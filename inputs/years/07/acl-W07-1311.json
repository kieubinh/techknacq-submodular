      "text": [
        "One of the important issues in building a search engine for nonstandard spellings is a reliable way to allow the comparison of words, that is, to measure the similarity between the search expression and the results provided.",
        "Given the abundance of distance measures and edit-distances available, methods are needed for efficiently comparing different similarity measures.",
        "In (Kempken et al.",
        "2006) we evaluated 13 different measures with the calculation of precision and recall to determine which were most qualified to deal with historical German spelling variants.",
        "We mainly used our own database of historical spellings, manually collected from the German text archives Bibliotheca Augustana, documentArchiv.de and Digitales Archiv Hessen-Darmstadt.",
        "Currently our database consists of 12,687 modern-historical word pairs (that we call evidences) originating between 1293 and 1919.",
        "The algorithm that proved best for calculating the edit costs between the modern and the historical spellings is called Stochastic distance (SM) and was originally proposed in 1975 by Bahl and Jelinek.",
        "In 1997 Ristad and Yianilos (Ristad et al., 1997) took it up again and extended the approach to machine learning abilities.",
        "Due to the complexity of language, apparently similar scopes can obviously favor totally different mechanisms.",
        "The Variant Detector VARD developed by Rayson et al.",
        "to detect spelling variants in historical English texts uses the standard Soundex algorithm with convincing efficiency (Rayson et al., 2005).",
        "The same algorithm yields an error rate 6.7 times higher than the stochastic distance for the comparison of German spelling variants.",
        "Cases like these suggest that finding one \"most suitable\" distance measure for all data might not be possible.",
        "As soon as the inherent structures change, another measure can prove to be more efficient.",
        "Even though, with the SM, we already found a suitable measure, its dependency on the underlying training data forces us to evaluate the training results: what is the size of an optimal training set?",
        "Is the training set well chosen?",
        "Does 14th-century data appropriately represent 13th-century spellings?",
        "Answers to these and similar questions not only help to ensure better retrieval but can also give an insight into phonetic or graphematic changes of language.",
        "Since standard calculations of retrieval quality, as we did for the 13 measures, require not only extensive work but are also difficult to evaluate, we propose possibilities for visual evaluation means to speed up and ease this process.",
        "The prototype we developed is but one example for those possibilities and is meant to encourage scientists to benefit from visual information representation.",
        "3 Development and functions of an interactive visual interface",
        "Since our project already deals with different methods for calculating word distance, the definition of a generic interface was necessary.",
        "Priority was given to the development of a slim and easily accessible device that allows the connection of arbitrary concepts of word distance.",
        "Our SM, a rule based measure using regular expressions, Soundex (Knuth, 1973), Jaro(-Winkler) (Jaro, 1995) and a number of additional measures are already implemented in our system.",
        "It was built in Java and is embedded in our general environment for the processing of nonstandard spellings.",
        "Information Visualization is a fairly new field of research that is rapidly evolving.",
        "A well established definition of information visualization is \"the use of computer-supported, interactive, visual representations of abstract data to amplify cognition\" (Card et al., 1999).",
        "While planning the prototype, we also kept Shneiderman's paradigm in mind: \"Overview first, zoom and filter details on demand\" (Shneiderman, 1996).",
        "In dealing with distance measures, our main task is to represent word distance.",
        "We employed multidimensional scaling (MDS) to display abstract distance in 2D space (see below).",
        "Interactivity is gained with the ability to select and remove spellings from the calculations, lower or raise cutoff frequencies and filters and even change replacement costs with instantaneous effect (see below).",
        "This led to a user interface separated into three main views:",
        "• The Histogram allows an overview of thousands of data items.",
        "The selection of a",
        "certain portion of data triggers MDS and table views.",
        "• Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) functions as a detail view.",
        "Such visualization is used to display sets of several dozen to a few hundred items.",
        "• The Table View can display different levels of detail.",
        "In (Kempken et al., 2007) we presented a TreeMap approach, another way to display details of single word derivations as an add-on for table views.",
        "Histograms are a widely spread tool for display of statistical distribution of values.",
        "In favor of Shnei-derman's paradigm, the histogram view represents a combination of overview and zoom functionality.",
        "This first stage allows for the reduction of the data set from up to several thousand items down to much more manageable sizes.",
        "To get a first impression of how a spelling distance performs on a set of evidences, we calculate the distance between a spelling variant and the entries in a dictionary.",
        "It is ensured that the collection also contains the standard spelling related to the variant.",
        "The results are sorted in ascending order by their distance from the spelling variant.",
        "Afterwards, the rank of the corresponding spellings is determined.",
        "In the best case, the correct relation will appear as the first entry in this list, that is, at the smallest distance from the variant.",
        "Often, other spellings appear \"closer\" to the variant and thus have a higher rank, pushing the spelling we sought for further down the list (cf.",
        "Figure 2).",
        "By applying this procedure to a collection of word pairs, we get a distribution of spelling ranks over the set of evidences based on the spelling colFigure 2.",
        "The standard spelling \"liebe\" corresponding to variant \"liebd\" was pushed back by \"lieb\" because deletion of <d> is cheaper than the replacement of <d> with <e>.",
        "lection.",
        "Good distance measures produce a histogram with most of its largest bars close to the first rank on the left.",
        "A good example is the evaluation in section 5 (cf.",
        "Figure 5).",
        "The histogram provides a good representation of the overall performance of a spelling distance given for a set of test data.",
        "The user will quickly notice if a large number of spellings are found in the acceptable ranking range, if there are noticeable isolated outliers or if the values are spread widely over the whole interval.",
        "In addition, histograms can be useful as tools for comparing different spelling distances.",
        "Usually multiple histograms are viewed one after another or arranged next to each other.",
        "While this might be enough to perceive considerable differences in distributions, small-scale variations may pass unnoticed.",
        "An easy solution to this problem is to arrange the different histograms in a combined display area, where the relevant subinterval bars are lined up next to one another and made distinguishable by color or texture.",
        "Through this simple rearrangement, even small changes become noticeable to the user.",
        "Slight height differences between bars of the same value interval can be noticed as can shifts in peaks along the value range.",
        "For more quantitative performance measurement mean value and standard deviation are calculated and presented in numerical form.",
        "A distance definition that performs well will have a low mean value as more spellings are found with a good ranking.",
        "However, a mean value that is not especially high or low by itself is usually not enough to characterize a distribution.",
        "For this reason, it is important to know the values' spread around the distribution's mean value measured by the standard deviation (SD).",
        "A distribution with only a few, tightly packed value peaks provides a small SD whereas a widely spread one will have a large SD.",
        "A spelling distance that performs well can be recognized by a low mean value accompanied by a low SD.",
        "Both key values can also be made visible in a histogram by drawing markers in its background.",
        "In this way, even the key values are easy to compare when comparing spelling distances.",

        "The main application of such techniques is to assign the elements of an item set to a spatial configuration in such a way that it represents the elements' relationships with as little distortion as possible.",
        "In this context, MDS can be used to arrange spellings in a two-dimensional space according to their spelling distances from one another.",
        "Every available dimension reduces the need for distortion but increases the difficulty to interpret.",
        "Two or three dimensions are a good trade-off.",
        "This allows for an intuitive display of distances and clusters of spelling variants.",
        "It also makes it possible to discover distance anomalies.",
        "If this representation is provided with filtering features, it can be used to select subsets of elements quickly and comfortably.",
        "These subsets can then be displayed in detailed information views that would be too cluttered with greater numbers of items.",
        "The \"distortion\" is evaluated by comparing the distances calculated by the spelling distances with the configuration's geometric distances (i.e. distances following geometric rules).",
        "A common calculation for this distortion is the so-called \"raw stress\" factor.",
        "Kruskal (Kruskal, 1964) defined raw stress as the sum of distance errors over a configuration.",
        "To calculate this error, we use the distance matrix D, where each entry holds the calculated distance dij- between the spellings of the relevant row and column.",
        "These values can be modified by f(dij)=a dij to achieve a scaling more fit for visual distances, thus reducing stress.",
        "Comparison with geometric distances also requires this matrix to be symmetric.",
        "Because spelling distances are not necessarily symmetric (distance A - B differs from B - A), we use the mean value of both distance directions to create symmetry, as Kruskal suggests.",
        "The second part of the error calculation requires the geometric distances dij between the spellings, which is determined by i and j of the current configuration X.",

        "Kruskal's \"raw stress\" value is then determined by summarizing the error over the elements of the upper triangular matrix.",
        "The sum can be restricted to this reduced element set due to the symmetric nature of the matrix.",
        "In our Metric Evaluation Tool (MET) we used the SMACOF algorithm (see below) to calculate a stress-minimizing configuration.",
        "Finding such a configuration is a numerical optimization problem.",
        "Because a direct solution of such a problem is often not feasible, numerous iterative algorithms have been developed to calculate an approximate solution close enough to the direct solution, where one actually exists.",
        "The SMACOF algorithm (scaling by majorizing a complicated function) is such an approach (De Leeuw, 1977).",
        "We start by arranging the items in a checkerboard grid configuration.",
        "The algorithm then calculates the raw stress, modifies the current configuration so that it yields a lesser stress value by applying a Guttman Transformation (Guttman, 1968) and then compares the new configuration's stress with the old one.",
        "This step is repeated until the change in stress drops below a set threshold or a maximum number of iteration steps is exceeded.",
        "The resulting configuration is usually not an optimal one.",
        "Optimal in this case would be a distortionless representation with vanishing stress value.",
        "Such a configuration is rarely, if ever, achieved in MDS.",
        "There are three main reasons for this:",
        "• Some calculated spelling distances can conflict such that there is no spatial configuration that represents the distances without distortion.",
        "For example, a spelling may be determined to be close to several other spellings, which, however, are widely spread out.",
        "This is due to the fact that spelling distances do not always fulfill the triangle inequality.",
        "• Although geometric distances, being mathematical metrics, require the spelling distances to be symmetric, the spelling distances calculated will not necessarily be so.",
        "For instance, the distance between spellings A and B could be different from that between spellings B and A.",
        "• Even if an optimal configuration were to exist, the iterative optimization process might not actually find it.",
        "The algorithm might terminate due to iteration limits or because of being \"trapped\" in a local minimum.",
        "This restriction on the MDS result, however, is not severe enough to derogate its usage as a visualization tool.",
        "Its task is not to reconstruct the calculated distance perfectly but to uncover characteristics of the spelling distances and spelling sets used.",
        "These characteristics, such as clusters and outliers, usually outweigh the distortions.",
        "Applied to a set of spellings and their distance measure, MDS generates a spatial configuration fit for a plot view.",
        "The spellings' positions in relation to one another represent their similarity.",
        "Clusters of closely related spellings and outliers are easy to recognize and can be used as starting points for detailed analyses of subsets.",
        "An advantage of this type of visualization is that it considers the calculated distances among all spellings instead of only two.",
        "An initial comparison of the difference or similarity of multiple spellings is possible at a single glance and without switching between different views.",
        "Additional visual hints can improve the overview even further.",
        "Certain spellings, such as the standard spelling or the variant, can be made easily recognizable through color or shape indications.",
        "The selection of subsets is aided by zoom and filtering features applied to the plot view.",
        "Densely packed clusters can be made less cluttered by changing the plot's zoom factor or by blending irrelevant items into the background.",
        "Selecting the spellings by either clicking or encircling allows the subsets to be determined easily.",
        "The reduced item set can then be used for a detail view, for example the display of operations and distances like the tabular view.",
        "In the MET, the components used to calculate a distance for a given subset can be viewed.",
        "In this way, it is easy to understand, for example, why a certain spelling is not as \"close\" to another spelling as expected.",
        "This visualization approach is applicable to a wide variety of spelling distances as long as they provide a quantitative measurement of two spellings.",
        "There are no assumptions made about the distance value except that small values represent a high degree of similarity.",
        "After refining the selections from several thousand down to a few items, a detailed display of relevant information about the spellings and their calculated distances is needed.",
        "At this stage the actual values are more important than a visually comprehensible display of relations.",
        "Two different views in the MET use a tabular arrangement of values.",
        "One represents the distance matrix between a set of spellings, similar to the one used to calculate the MDS solution.",
        "However, in this case, the distances are not combined to a mean value for both directions.",
        "At this point the difference between the two directions can be of interest and should be visible.",
        "Standard spelling and spelling variant are displayed in different colors so they can be found more easily.",
        "The second tabular view displays the distances between the standard spelling and the ranked variants.",
        "To obtain a better understanding, the results are split up into their components using a Leven-shtein-based distance mirroring the replacement costs that occurred when transforming one spelling into the other.",
        "These components are displayed in the rows according to their classification, while the different spelling variants appear in the columns (cf.",
        "Figure 4).",
        "By reordering the columns, the user can move the spellings next to each other in order to compare them more closely.",
        "Another benefit of representing the values in this way is that detailed modifications to the spelling distance can be made interactively.",
        "Here, the replacement costs can be changed inside the table itself, allowing an instant evaluation on what effect such a change will have on the distance measure.",
        "Interaction",
        "There are several ways to interact with the application.",
        "Selection of data triggers an update of the view(s) on the next level of detail: by selecting columns of the histogram, the ranking table is activated; selecting spellings in the ranking table trigdeletion, insertion and replacement costs.",
        "These costs trigger an MDS view update.",
        "gers the MDS view where spellings can be selected to be shown in the distance matrix and metric editor.",
        "While selections in the tabular views and the histogram can easily be performed with a rectangular selection box, the MDS needed a more elaborate way of selecting data.",
        "A polygonal form can be drawn with the mouse that also allows inverted selection (cf.",
        "Figure 3).",
        "Using two sliders or numerical input, the upper and lower cut-off for selection can be defined.",
        "For example, all spellings with a distance higher than 2.5 to the search term can be excluded (cf. right side of Figure 3).",
        "Zooming can be performed using the mouse wheel.",
        "In the metric editor, showing the highest degree of detail, the costs for the operations of deletion, insertion and replacement can be adjusted.",
        "These changes are instantly represented in the MDS view, therefore allowing for the manual calibration of the distance measures (cf.",
