        "In this work, we attempt to capture patterns of co-occurrence across vowel systems and at the same time figure out the nature of the force leading to the emergence of such patterns.",
        "For this purpose we define a weighted network where the vowels are the nodes and an edge between two nodes (read vowels) signify their co-occurrence likelihood over the vowel inventories.",
        "Through this network we identify communities of vowels, which essentially reflect their patterns of co-occurrence across languages.",
        "We observe that in the assortative vowel communities the constituent nodes (read vowels) are largely uncorrelated in terms of their features indicating that they are formed based on the principle of maximal perceptual contrast.",
        "However, in the rest of the communities, strong correlations are reflected among the constituent vowels with respect to their features indicating that it is the principle of feature economy that binds them together."

      "text": [
        "Linguistic research has documented a wide range of regularities across the sound systems of the world's languages (Liljencrants and Lindblom, 1972; Lind-blom, 1986; de Boer, 2000; Choudhury et al., 2006; Mukherjee et al., 2006a; Mukherjee et al., 2006b).",
        "Functional phonologists argue that such regularities are the consequences of certain general principles like maximal perceptual contrast (Liljencrants and Lindblom, 1972), which is desirable between the phonemes of a language for proper perception of each individual phoneme in a noisy environment, ease of articulation (Lindblom and Mad-dieson, 1988; de Boer, 2000), which requires that the sound systems of all languages are formed of certain universal (and highly frequent) sounds, and ease of learnability (de Boer, 2000), which is required so that a speaker can learn the sounds of a language with minimum effort.",
        "In the study of vowel systems the optimizing principle, which has a long tradition (Jakobson, 1941; Wang, 1968) in linguistics, is maximal perceptual contrast.",
        "A number of numerical studies based on this principle have been reported in literature (Liljencrants and Lind-blom, 1972; Lindblom, 1986; Schwartz et al., 1997).",
        "Of late, there have been some attempts to explain the vowel systems through multi agent simulations (de Boer, 2000) and genetic algorithms (Ke et al., 2003); all ofthese experiments also use the principle ofper-ceptual contrast for optimization purposes.",
        "An exception to the above trend is a school of linguists (Boersma, 1998; Clements, 2004) who argue that perceptual contrast-based theories fail to account for certain fundamental aspects such as the patterns of co-occurrence of vowels based on similar acoustic/articulatory features observed across the vowel inventories.",
        "Instead, they posit that the observed patterns, especially found in larger size inventories (Boersma, 1998), can be explained only through the principle of feature economy (de Groot, 1931; Martinet, 1955).",
        "According to this principle, languages tend to maximize the combinatorial possibilities of a few distinctive features to generate a large number of sounds.",
        "The aforementioned ideas can be possibly linked together through the example illustrated by Figure 1.",
        "As shown in the figure, the initial plane P constitutes of a set of three very frequently occurring vowels /i/, /a/ and /u/, which usually make up the smaller inventories and do not have any single feature in common.",
        "Thus, smaller inventories are quite likely to have vowels that exhibit a large extent of contrast in their constituent features.",
        "However, in bigger inventories, members from the higher planes (P and P'') are also present and they in turn exhibit feature economy.",
        "For instance, in the plane P comprising of the set of vowels /i/, /â/, /â/, we find a nasal modification applied equally on all the three members of the set.",
        "This is actually indicative of an economic behavior that the larger inventories show while choosing a new feature in order to reduce the learnability effort of the speakers.",
        "The third plane P'' reinforces this idea by showing that the larger the size of the inventories the greater is the urge for this economy in the choice of new features.",
        "Another interesting facet of the figure are the relations that exist across the planes (indicated by the broken lines).",
        "All these relations are representative of a common linguistic concept of robustness (Clements, 2004) in which one less frequently occurring vowel (say /âi/) implies the presence of the other (and not vice versa) frequently occurring vowel (say /i/) in a language inventory.",
        "These cross-planar relations are also indicative of feature economy since all the features present in the frequent vowel (e.g., /i/) are also shared by the less frequent one (e.g., //).",
        "In summary, while the basis of organization of the vowel inventories is perceptual contrast as indicated by the plane P in Figure 1, economic modifications of the perceptually distinct vowels takes place with the",
        "vowel.",
        "There are however still more possible features of vowel quality, such as the velum position (e.g., nasality), type of vocal fold vibration (i.e., phonation), and tongue root position (i.e., secondary place ofarticulation).",
        "increase in the inventory size (as indicated by the planes P' and P\" in Figure 1).",
        "In this work we attempt to corroborate the above conjecture by automatically capturing the patterns of co-occurrence that are prevalent in and across the planes illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "In order to do so, we define the \"Vowel-Vowel Network\" or VoNet, which is a weighted network where the vowels are the nodes and an edge between two nodes (read vowels) signify their co-occurrence likelihood over the vowel inventories.",
        "We conduct community structure analysis of different versions of VoNet in order to capture the patterns of co-occurrence in and across the planes P, P' and P'' shown in Figure 1.",
        "The plane P consists of the communities, which are formed of those vowels that have a very high frequency of occurrence (usually assortative (Newman, 2003) in nature).",
        "We observe that the constituent nodes (read vowels) of these assortative vowel communities are largely uncorrelated in terms of their features.",
        "On the other hand, the communities obtained from VoNet, in which the links between the assortative nodes are absent, corresponds to the co-occurrence patterns of the planes P' and P''.",
        "In these communities, strong correlations are reflected among the constituent vowels with respect to their features.",
        "Moreover, the co-occurrences across the planes can be captured by the community analysis of VoNet where only the connections between the assortative and the non-assortative nodes, with the non-assortative node co-occurring very frequently with the assortative one, are retained while the rest of the connections are filtered out.",
        "We find that these communities again exhibit a high correlation among the constituent vowels.",
        "This article is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the experimental setup in order to explore the co-occurrence principles of the vowel inventories.",
        "In this section we formally define VoNet, outline its construction procedure, and present a community-finding algorithm in order to capture the co-occurrence patterns across the vowel systems.",
        "In section 3 we report the experiments performed to obtain the community structures, which are representative of the co-occurrence patterns in and across the planes discussed above.",
        "Finally, we conclude in section 4 by summarizing our contributions, pointing out some of the implications of the current work",
        "Figure 1: The organizational principles of the vowels (in decreasing frequency of occurrence) indicated through different hypothetical planes.",
        "and indicating the possible future directions.",
        "2 Experimental Setup",
        "In this section we systematically develop the experimental setup in order to investigate the cooccurrence principles of the vowel inventories.",
        "For this purpose, we formally define VoNet, outline its construction procedure, describe a community-finding algorithm to decompose VoNet to obtain the community structures that essentially reflects the cooccurrence patterns of the vowel inventories.",
        "Definition of VoNet: We define VoNet as a network of vowels, represented as G = ( VV,E ) where VVis the set of nodes labeled by the vowels and E is the set of edges occurring in VoNet.",
        "There is an edge e £ E between two nodes, if and only if there exists one or more language(s) where the nodes (read vowels) co-occur.",
        "The weight of the edge e (also edge-weight) is the number of languages in which the vowels connected by e co-occur.",
        "The weight of a node u (also node-weight) is the number of languages in which the vowel represented by u occurs.",
        "In other words, if a vowel vi represented by the node u occurs in the inventory of n languages then the node-weight of u is assigned the value n. Also if the vowel Vj is represented by the node v and there are w languages in which vowels v and Vj occur together then the weight of the edge connecting u and v is assigned the value v. Figure 2 illustrates this structure by reproducing some of the nodes and edges of VoNet.",
        "Construction of VoNet: Many typological studies (Lindblom and Maddieson, 1988; Ladefoged and Maddieson, 1996; Hinskens and Weijer, 2003; Choudhury et al., 2006; Mukherjee et al., 2006a; Mukherjee et al., 2006b) of segmental inventories have been carried out in past on the UCLA Phonological Segment Inventory Database (UPSID) (Maddieson, 1984).",
        "Currently UPSID records the sound inventories of 451 languages covering all the major language families of the world.",
        "The selection of the languages for the inclusion on UPSID is governed by a quota principle seeking maximum genetic diversity among extant languages in order to reduce bias towards any particular family.",
        "In this work we have therefore used UPSID comprising of these 451 languages and 180 vowels found across them, for constructing VoNet.",
        "Consequently, the set Vv comprises 180 elements (nodes) and the set E comprises 3135 elements (edges).",
        "Figure 3 presents a partial illustration of VoNet as constructed from UPSID.",
        "We attempt to identify the communities appearing in VoNet by the extended Radicchi et al.",
        "(Radic-chi et al., 2003) algorithm for weighted networks presented in (Mukherjee et al., 2006a).",
        "The basic idea is that if the weights on the edges forming a triangle (loops of length three) are comparable then the group of vowels represented by this triangle highly occur together rendering a pattern of cooccurrence while if these weights are not comparable then there is no such pattern.",
        "In order to capture this property we define a strength metric S (in the lines of (Mukherjee et al., 2006a)) for each of the edges of VoNet as follows.",
        "Let the weight of the edge (u,v), where u, v G Vv, be denoted by wuv.",
        "We define S as, if \\/j2ieVc-{u,v} (wui -wvif > 0 else S = oo.",
        "The denominator in this expression essentially tries to capture whether or not the weights on the edges forming triangles are comparable (the higher the value of S the more comparable the weights are).",
        "The network can be then decomposed into clusters",
        "Figure 2: A partial illustration of the nodes and edges in VoNet.",
        "The labels of the nodes denote the vowels represented in IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet).",
        "The numerical values against the edges and nodes represent their corresponding weights.",
        "For example /i/ occurs in 393 languages; /e/ occurs in 124 languages while they co-occur in 117 languages.",
        "or communities by removing edges that have S less than a specified threshold (say rf).",
        "At this point it is worthwhile to clarify the significance of a vowel community.",
        "A community of vowels actually refers to a set of vowels which occur together in the language inventories very frequently.",
        "In other words, there is a higher than expected probability of finding a vowel v in an inventory which already hosts the other members of the community to which v belongs.",
        "For instance, if/i/, /a/ and /u/ form a vowel community and if /i/ and /a/ are present in any inventory then there is a very high chance that the third member /u/ is also present in the inventory."

        "In this section we describe the experiments performed and the results obtained from the analysis of VoNet.",
        "In order to find the co-occurrence patterns in and across the planes of Figure 1 we define three versions of VoNet namely VoNetassort, VoNetrestand VoNetrest/.",
        "The construction procedure for each of these versions are presented below.",
        "Construction of VoNetassort: VoNetassort comprises the assortative nodes having node-weights above 120 (i.e, vowels occurring in more than 120 languages in UPSID), along with only the edges interconnecting these nodes.",
        "The rest of the nodes (having node-weight less than 120) and edges are removed from the network.",
        "We make a choice of this node-weight for classifying the assortative nodes from the non-assortative ones by observing the distribution of the occurrence frequency of the vowels illustrated in Figure 4.",

        "It consists of only the edges that connect an assorta-tive node with a non-assortative one if the non-assortative node co-occurs more than ninety five percent of times with the assortative nodes.",
        "The basic idea behind such a construction is to capture the cooccurrence patterns based on robustness (Clements, 2004) (discussed earlier in the introductory section) that actually defines the cross-planar relationships in Figure 1.",
        "Figure 7 shows how VoNetrest/ can be constructed from VoNet.",
        "The number of nodes in VoNetrest/ is 180 while the number of edges is 114.",
        "We separately apply the community-finding algorithm (discussed earlier) on each of VoNetassort, VoNetrest and VoNetrest/ in order to obtain the respective vowel communities.",
