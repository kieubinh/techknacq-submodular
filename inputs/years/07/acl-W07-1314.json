        "The comparison of lexemes across languages is a powerful method to investigate the historical relations between languages.",
        "A central prerequisite for any interpretation of historical relatedness is to establish lexical cognates, i.e. lexemes in different languages that are of shared descend (in contrast to similarity by chance).",
        "If a pair of lexemes in two different languages stem from the same origin, this can be due to the fact that both languages derive from a common ancestor language, but it can also be caused by influence from one language on another (or influence on both language from a third language).",
        "To decide whether cognates are indicative of a common ancestor language (\"vertical transmission\") or due to language influence (\"horizontal transmission\") is a difficult problem with no shortcuts.",
        "We do not think that one kind of cognacy is more interesting that another.",
        "Both loans (be it from a substrate or a superstrate) and lexemes derived from a shared ancestor are indicative of the history of a language, and both should be acknowledged in the unravelling of linguistic (pre)history.",
        "In this paper, we approach the identification of cognate lexemes on the basis of large parallel lex-ica between languages.",
        "This approach is an explicit attempt to reverse the \"Swadesh-style\" wordlist method.",
        "In the Swadesh-style approach, first meanings are selected that are assumed to be less prone to borrowing, then cognates are identified in those lists, and these cognates are then interpreted as indicative of shared descend.",
        "In contrast, we propose to first identify (possible) cognates among all available information, then divide these cognates into strata, and then interpret these strata in historical terms.",
        "(Because of limitations of space, we will only deal with the first step, the identification of cognates, in this paper.)",
        "This is of course exactly the route of the traditional historical-comparative approach to language comparison.",
        "However, we think that much can be gained by applying computational approaches to this approach.",
        "A major problem arises when dealing with large quantities of lexical material from many different languages.",
        "In most cases it will be difficult (or very costly and time consuming in the least) to use coherent and consistent phonetic transcriptions of all available information.",
        "Even if we would have dictionaries with phonetic transcriptions for all languages that we are interested in, this would not necessarily help, as the details of phonetic transcription are normally not consistent across different authors.",
        "In this paper, we will therefore attempt to deal with unprocessed material in practical orthographies.",
        "This will of course pose problems for history-ridden orthographies like in English or French.",
        "However, we beleve that for most of the world's languages the practical orthographies are not as inconsistent as those (because they are much younger) and might very well be useful for linguistic purposes.",
        "In this paper, we will first discuss the data used in this investigation.",
        "Then we will describe the algorithm that we used to infer alignments between word pairs.",
        "Finally, we will discuss a few of the results using this algorithm on large wordlists in practical orthography."

        "The IDS wordlists contain more than thousand entries of basic words from each language, and many entries contain alternative wordforms.",

      "text": [
        "An alignment of two words wa and wb is a bijective and maintained ordered one-to-one correspondence from all subsequences sa of the word wa with wa = concat(sai,sa2,... ,sak) to all subsequences sb of the word wb with wb = concat(sbl,sb2,... ,sbk).",
        "It is possible that one of the associated subsequences is the empty word e. In general one may construct a distance measure from such a linked sequence of two given words by assigning a cost for each single link of the alignment.",
        "There are many such alignment/cost functions described in the literature, and they are often used to calculate a distance measure between two sequences of characters (Inkpen et al., 2005).",
        "A measurement regularly used for linguistic sequences is the Levenshtein distance, or a modifications of it.",
        "Other distance measures detect, for example, the longest common subsequences or the longest increasing subsequences.",
        "It is our special interest to use multi-character mappings for calculating a distance between two words.",
        "Therefore, we adapt and extend the Leven-shtein measurement.",
        "First, we allow for mapping of any arbitrary string length (not just strings of one character as in Levenshtein) and, second, we assign a continuous cost between 0 and 1 for every mapping.",
        "Our algorithm consist basically of two steps.",
        "In the first step, all possible subsequence pairs between associated words are considered, and a cost function is extracted for every multi-gram pair from their cooccurrences in the whole wordlist.",
        "In a second step, this cost function is used to infer an alignment between whole words.",
        "On the basis of this alignment a new cost function is established for all multi-gram pairs.",
        "This second step can be iterated until the cost function stabilizes.",
        "For every pair of subsequences sai and sbj we count the number of co-occurrences.",
        "The subsequences sai and sbj co-occur when they are found in two associated words wa and wb from a language wordlist of two languages La and Lb.",
        "We then use a simple Dice coefficient as a cost function between all possible subsequences.",
        "For computational reasons, it is necessary to limit the size of the multi-grams considered.",
        "We decided to limit the multi-gram size to a number of maximally four UTF-8 characters.",
        "Still, in the first step of our algorithm, there is a very large set of such subsequence pairs because all possible combinations are considered.",
        "When an alignment is inferred in the iterative process, only the aligned subsequences are counted as co-occurrences, so the number of possible combinations is considerably lower.",
        "Further, to prevent low frequent co-occurrences to have a disproportional impact, we added an attestation threshold of 2% of the wordlist size for two subsequences to be accepted for the alignment process.",
        "An alignment of two words is a complete ordered linking of subsequences.",
        "We annotate it in the following way (vertical dashes delimit the subsequences; note that subsequences may be empty):",
        "There is a huge amount of possible combinations of aligned subsequences.",
        "On the basis of the cost function, a distance is established for every word pair alignment.",
        "The summation of all multi-gram mapping costs represents the distance of the alignment.",
        "Because we are dealing with multi-grams of variable length, alternative alignments of the same word pair will consist of a different number of subsequences.",
        "So, simple summation would lead to distances out of the range from 0 to 1.",
        "To counteract this, we normalized the word distance.",
        "We weighted each subsequence relative to the number of characters in the subsequence.",
        "For example, the mapping of w and tb in the example above would be multiplied by ^, because w and tb have together 3 characters and the complete words have in total 10 characters.",
        "To make use of efficient divide and conquer solving strategies and to get meaningful linguistic statements with the base of the calculated best alignments, we decided to look for a special subset of best alignments.",
        "As (Kondrak, 2002) pointed out, there are some situations in which the consideration of local alignment gets the required results.",
        "If only a part of a word aligning sequence is of high similarity then sometimes a linguistic justification of the whole word similarity is given.",
        "Those alignments contain the lowest cost multi-gram pairs, but are not necessarily of best similarity in total.",
        "To illustrate the difference between local and global alignment, consider an example that shows different results, depending whether the total sum of multi-gram similarities is taken or the best local one.",
        "Look at the two words 'abc' and 'af3Y and a part of its multi-gram cost function in Table 1.",
        "The summation of the costs would prefer alignment A2, as can be seen in Table 2.",
        "But we prefer Ai, because it contains the subsequence pair (ab | aft) with the lowest cost.",
        "With these assumptions, we composed a fast and easy method to find the best alignment.",
        "We prefer alignments where some links are very good, but the rest might not be.",
        "We assume that words are more related to each other, if there are such highly rated pairs.",
        "This approach can also be found in other string based comparing methods like, for example, the Longest Common Increasing Subsequence method, which calculates the longest equal multi-gram and neglects the rest of the word.",
        "We first order all possible multi-gram mappings by their costs and pick the subsequence pair with the lowest cost.",
        "Starting from this mapping seed, we look for mappings for the rest of the word pair, both before and after the initial mapped subsequence.",
        "For both these suffixes and prefixes, we again search for the subsequence with the lowest cost.",
        "This process is reapplied until the whole words are mapped.",
        "If there is more than one optimal linking subsequence pair, then all possible alignments are considered.",
        "In this way, we do not restrict, in contrast to Kondrak, which position for the multi-gram mapping will be preferred for the local alignment.",

        "Second, we payed close attention to the fact that the word similarity values are comparable among different language comparisons.",
        "This means that it is highly significant that the highest word similarities between English and French are much higher than those between English and Hunzib (actually, the alignments between English and Hunzib are nonsensical, but more about that later).",
