        "In the past decade databases have transitioned from a useful resource as a searchable repository of linguistic tokens of some type, to an actual tool capable of not only organising vast amounts of data, but executing complex statistical functions and queries on the data it stores.",
        "These advances in database technology complement those made in computational linguistics, and both have recently begun to converge on the domain of comparative and historical linguistic research.",
        "This paper contributes to this line of research through describing the database project Base de Dados para Estudos Comparativos - Tupi (BDEC-T) (Database for Comparative Studies - Tupl), which is part of a larger research program investigating the phonemic reconstruction of the Tupl languages.",
        "The database component of the BDEC-T is designed to capitalise on the functionality of cross-tabulation tables, commonly known as pivot tables, a recent innovation in the implementation SQL queries in many database and spreadsheet applications.",
        "Pivot tables can be described as an 'object-oriented' representation of SQL statements in the sense that columns of data are treated as objects, which allow the user to create multidimensional views of the data by 'dragging and dropping' columns into various sorting arrangements.",
        "We have found that this dynamic, multidimensional manipulation of the data can greatly aid the researcher in identifying relationships and correspondences that are otherwise difficult to summarize by other query types.",
        "In this paper we report on the results of an experiment that tests the applicability of pivot tables to language data, in particular, the comparative and historical reconstruction of the proto-phonemes in a language family.",
        "In doing this, three tests were conducted:",
        "1.",
        "The confirmation and challenging of a 'manual' and/or previously established reconstruction of a proto-language, Proto-Tupl;",
        "2.",
        "The testing of a new reconstruction generated by our model, and checking it against a manual reconstruction;",
        "3.",
        "The testing the upper limit of simultaneous, multiple correspondences across several languages.",
        "It is argued that this type of object-oriented implementation of SQL statements using pivot tables, offers two unique features: the first is the ability to check several one-to-one and one-to-many correspondences simultaneously across several languages; and secondly, the ability to dynamically survey the language-internal distribution of segments and their features.",
        "The former feature represents a notable advantage over other 'manual' methods, as the reconstructed forms may be entered in the database as proto-languages, which can be continually revised and tested against all other languages.",
        "The latter feature offers the ability to check the language-internal distribution of the (proto-)segments which will aid in preventing possible cases of skewed occurrences, as is shown below.",
        "Basic statistical analyses, such as numbers of occurrences, can also be reported, graphed and plotted by the pivot tables, thus providing further details of individual languages and proto-languages, and, ultimately, a more quantitatively reliable analysis.",
        "The net outcome of this is the presentation of a practical methodology that is easily and quickly implementable, and that makes use of a function that many people already have with their database or spreadsheet.",
        "The Tupl stock of language families is concentrated in the Amazon river basin of Brazil (and areas of neighbouring countries) and comprises 10 families of languages: Arikem, Awetl, Juruna, Mawe, Monde, Munduruku, Purubora, Ramarama, Tuparl, and Tupi-Guaranf (Rodrigues 1958; revised in Ro-drigues 1985), totaling approximately 64 languages.",
        "Tupl-Guarani is the largest family with more than 40 languages, while the other families range from one language (e.g. Aweti, Purubora) to six languages (e.g. Monde).",
        "From these, the Tupi-Guarani family is the only family that has been mostly analized from a historical point of view (e.g. Lemle 1971, Jensen 1989, Schleicher 1998, Mello 2000, etc.",
        "); there is also a proposal for Proto-Tupari (Tuparf family), by Moore and GaMcio (1993), and Proto-Munduruku (Munduruku family), by Picanco (2005).",
        "A preliminary reconstruction at level of the Tupi stock was proposed by Rodrigues (1995), in which he reconstructs a list of 67 items for Proto-Tupi (see further details below).",
        "The BDEC-T also includes these reconstructed languages, as they allow us to compare the results obtained from the database with the results of previous, manual historical-comparative studies."

      "heading": "2. The Application: Design and Method",
      "text": [
        "The BDEC-T was initially developed as repository database for language data from various Tupi languages described above, with the purpose of allowing the user to generate lists of word and phoneme correspondences through standard boolean search queries or SQL statements.",
        "These lists aided the researcher in exploring different correspondences in the course of a proto-phoneme or word reconstruction.",
        "The BDEC-T is implemented within MS Access 2003, which provides the user an interface for entering language data that is then externally linked to tab-delimited text files in order to preserve its declarative format.",
        "This also allowed flexibility in accessing the data for whatever purpose in the platform or program of the researcher's choosing.",
        "At present, the BDEC-T for the Tupi stock contains a glossary of 813 words and up to 3,785 entries distributed across 15 Tupian languages.",
        "Approximately 18% of this 813-word list appear to have cognates in the majority of languages entered so far, and which can be used as reference for a reliable set of robust cognates across the entire Tupf stock.",
        "This number is continually increasing as more languages are entered in the database, and at least 50% of the glossary is filled up for all languages.",
        "The average number of entries for each language varies considerably as it depends largely on available sources; yet, in general, the average is of approximately 250 words per language (i.e. about 30%).",
        "Each of the 65 languages and 4 proto-languages in BDEC-T is associated with its own data entry form.",
        "Each data entry form is divided into three main parts:",
        "1.",
        "The word entry fields where the word for that language is entered (along with two other optional features);",
        "2.",
        "The comparison viewer that contains fields which simultaneously display that same word in the all the other languages in the database;",
        "3.",
        "The segmentation section which contains an arrangement fields for recording segment data.",
        "The structure of the stored data is straightforward: the data entered in these forms is stored in a master table where all of the languages are represented as columns.",
        "Glosses are the rows, where each gloss is assigned a unique, autogenerated number in the master record when it is entered into the database.",
        "This serves as the primary key for all the translations of that gloss across all of the languages.",
        "The third component of the language data entry form, the segmentation section (Fig.",
        "1), contains a linear arrangement of ten columns, S1 to S10, and three rows, each cell of which corresponds to a field.",
        "The first row of the ten columns are fields where the user can enter in the segmentation of that particular word, which contains the segments themselves.",
        "The second and third rows correspond to optional features (F) that are associated with that segment.",
        "In this particular version F1 is unused, while F2 encodes syllable structure (i.e. 'O' onset, 'N' nu-cleus).",
        "For example, Figure 1 is a screenshot of a portion of the segmentation section in the language data entry form for Munduruku.",
        "The word being entered is 'moon', and the word in Munduruku is kafi.",
        "Segment slots S3 to S6 are used to segment the word.",
        "As a convention, a word will typically be segmented starting with the S3 slot, and not with S1.",
        "The reason for this is to allow for at least two segment fields (S1 and S2) to accommodate cognates in",
        "Segmentation of Munduruku Entry:",
        "other languages that have segments that occur before S3, but are entered into the database at a later time.",
        "This is done in order to maintain a consistency between correspondences, regardless of what slot they are in the data base.",
        "In other words, we need to be prepared to handle cases that are shown in Tables 1 and 2 above.",
        "If the Ava Canoeiro word for 'wind' is entered first in Table 1, it is prudent to have segment slots available for languages that are entered later that may have additional segments occurring before.",
        "Guaja and Arawete were entered into the database after Ava Canoeiro, and both have additional segments.",
        "Keeping S1 and S2 available as a general rule can accommodate these cases.",
        "Our purpose in designing the segmentation component of the form this way was to give the researcher complete control over how words are segmented.",
        "This also allows the researcher to crosscheck their segmentations in real time with those in the other languages already in the database, which can be done in the comparison viewer (not shown due to space limitations).",
        "This is essential for more complicated cases, such as those in Table 2, where there are not only word edge mismatches, but also gaps and (grammaticalized) morphological boundaries that need to be properly corresponded.",

        "All of the segment data in the language-specific tables are coordinated by the primary key generated and kept in the master table.",
        "The next subsection describes how this segmental data can be used in two specific ways: 1) to track correspondences between languages for a particular cognate or segment slot; and 2), for monitoring the language-internal distribution of segments.",
        "We propose that this is achieved through using cross-tabulations of the segment data recorded in each column, and outline a practical implementation of this is using pivot tables.",
        "Access 2003 includes a graphical implementation of SQL statements in the form of cross tabulations, or pivot tables, which provide the user an interface with which they can manipulate multiple columns of data to create dynamic, multidimensional organizations of the data.",
        "There are three basic reasons for organizing data into a pivot table, all of which are relevant to the task at hand: first, to summarize data contained in lengthy lists into a compact format; secondly, to find relationships within that data that are otherwise hard to see because of the amount of detail; and thirdly, to organize the data into a format that is easy to chart.",
        "Pivot tables are dynamic because columns of data are treated as objects that can be moved, or literally 'swapped' in, out our around in relation to other columns.",
        "They are multidimensional because column data can be organized along either axis, yielding different 'snapshots' of the data.",
        "It is this kind of functionality that will be capitalised on in examining correspondences beor switched between by the master switchboard.",
        "tween columns of segment data (S1-10) across any number of languages in the database.",
        "A cross tabulation displays the joint distribution of two or more variables.",
        "They are usually presented as a contingency table which describes the distribution of two or more variables simultaneously.",
        "Thus, cross tabulation allows us to examine frequencies of observations that belong to specific categories on more than one variable.",
        "By examining these frequencies, we can identify relations between cross-tabulated variables.",
        "Typically, only variables with a relatively small number of different meaningful values are cross tabulated.",
        "We suggest that phonemes fit this criteria, as there is a finite and relatively low number of total unique phonemes that can ever be potentially cross tabulated.",
        "For example, Figure 2 (below) is a screen shot of a pivot table generated in the BDEC-T that shows the distribution of word and morpheme-initial voiceless stops in Munduruku in relation to those in the same position for three other languages: Karitiana, Gaviao and Karo.",
        "This was achieved in the following way: as described above, we assume that the word-initial segment for most words is S3.",
        "The S3 column for Munduruku is then taken to the 'drop field' (shaded grey), where all of the values in the S3 of Munduruku become dependent variables.",
        "The S3 columns for Karitiana, Gaviao and Karo become independent variables, which allow us to monitor the distribution of voiceless stops in these languages in relation to the S3 segments in Munduruku.",
        "In essence, Munduruku S3 becomes a sort function on any other S3 columns to the right of it.",
        "Where this method becomes effective is when we 'swap' out Munduruku S3 and replace it with Gaviao S3, which is done by pulling the column header and placing it into the grey 'drop field'.",
        "This is shown in Figure 3 below.",
        "What Figure 3 immediately demonstrates is the asymmetric correspondence between Munduruku and Gaviao for S3: broadly speaking, the correspondences between Munduruku and Karitiana, Gaviao and Karo are more general, whereas the same correspondences for",

        "Figure 4 shows how the segment data in S3 and S4 from the same language can be used in a pivot table, allowing the user to track the distribution of certain word or morpheme-initial segments and the segments that follow them.",
        "This arrangement gives us a snapshot of consonant-vowel patterns in Karo, where S3 has been additionally filtered to show the distribution of vowels that follow the palatals [c] and [j].",
        "One important advantage to this arrangement of data and the use of pivot tables is the potential for tracking multiple correspondences across several languages simultaneously.",
        "So far, this is only limited by processor speed and viewing space.",

        "Another important result obtained with the BDEC-T is the Possibility of relating other tyPes of segmental information.",
        "For example, Munduruku exhibits a feature that makes it distinct from any other TuPian language: it is the only TuPian language known to make a Phonological contrast between modal and creaky (laryngealised) vowels (Picanco 2005).",

        "A comparison that considers only a segment-to-segment correspondence will mistakenly posit the correspondence set *?/0 for both Munduruku and Sakirabia (Mekens, Tuparf family), when the correspondence is in fact *?/0 for Sakirabia but *(C)V?V/(C)V for Munduruku.",
        "This is true for Rodrigues' analysis, which mistakenly established that \"in Munduruku [the glottal stop] has dropped\" us to compare features to segments, and to examine various correspondences of segments in a sequence.",

        "With this, this unique property of Munduruku, specifically creaky voice, can be explained historically in a principled way.",

        "On this note, the application computational procedures in the study of sound change and comparison have made notable advances in the past decade.",
        "Relevant to this study, systems such ALINE, a feature-based algorithm for measuring phonetic similarity, are capable of automating segmentation and quantitatively calculating cognate probabilities without resorting to a table of systematic sound correspondences (Kondrak 2002).",
        "These are valuable models which test many long-standing hypotheses on the nature of sound change and methods for investigating this.",
        "While not offering an automated algorithm of this type, we chose to keep segmentation manual in order to maintain accuracy and to make adjustments where needed in the S1-S10 segmentations made in the languages.",
