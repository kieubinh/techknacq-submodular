        "Identification of cognates and recurrent sound correspondences is a component of two principal tasks of historical linguistics: demonstrating the relatedness of languages, and reconstructing the histories of language families.",
        "Manually compiling the list of cognates is an error-prone and time-consuming task.",
        "Several methods for constructing comparative dictionaries have been proposed and applied to specific language families: Algonquian (Hewson, 1974), Yu-man (Johnson, 1985), Tamang (Lowe and Mazaudon, 1994), and Malayo-Javanic (Oakes, 2000).",
        "Most of those methods crucially depend on previously determined regular sound correspondences; each of them was both developed and tested on a single language family.",
        "Kondrak (2002) proposes a number of algorithms for automatically detecting and quantifying three characteristics of cognates: recurrent sound correspondences, phonetic similarity, and semantic affinity.",
        "The algorithms were tested on two well-studied language families: Indo-European and Algonquian.",
        "In this paper, we apply them instead to a set of languages whose mutual relationship is still being investigated.",
        "This is consistent with the original research goal of providing tools for the analysis of relatively unfamiliar languages represented by word lists.",
        "We show that by combining expert linguistic knowledge with computational analysis, it is possible to quickly identify a large number of cognate sets within a relatively little-studied language family.",
        "The experiments reported in this paper were performed in the context of the Upper Necaxa Totonac Project (Beck, 2005), of which one of the authors is the principal investigator.",
        "Upper Necaxa is a seriously endangered language spoken by around 3,400 indigenous people in Puebla State, Mexico.",
        "The primary goal of the project is to document the language through the compilation of an extensive dictionary and other resources, which may aid revitalization efforts.",
        "One aim of the project is the investigation of the relationship between Upper Necaxa Totonac and the other languages of the Totonac-Tepehua language family, whose family tree is not yet well-understood.",

        "In Section 2, we provide background on the Totonac-Tepehua family.",
        "Section 3 describes our data sets.",

        "The Totonac-Tepehua language family is an isolate group of languages spoken by around 200,000 people in the northern part of Puebla State and the adjacent areas of Veracruz and Hidalgo in East-Central Mexico (Figure 1).",
        "Although individual languages have begun to receive some attention from linguists, relatively little is known about the family as whole: recent estimates put the number of languages in the group between 14 and 20, but the phylogenetic relations between languages remains a subject of some controversy.",
        "The family has traditionally been divided into two coordinate branches: Tepehua, consisting of three languages (Pisa Flores, Tlachichilco, and Huehuetla), and To-tonacan.",
        "The Totonacan branch has in turn been divided into four sub-branches: Misantla, Lowlands or Papantla, Sierra, and Northern (Ichon, 1973; Reid, 1991), largely on the impressions of missionaries working in the area.",
        "Some dialectological work has cast doubt on the division between Northern and Sierra (Arana, 1953; Rojas, 1978), and groups them together into a rather heterogeneous Highland To-tonac, suggesting that this split may be more recent than the others.",
        "However, the experience of linguists working in Totonacan communities, including one of the authors, indicates that - judged by the criterion of mutual intelligibility - there are likely to be more, rather than fewer, divisions needed within the Totonacan branch of the family.",
        "Although Totonac-Tepehua shows a good deal of internal diversity, the languages that make it up are easily recognizable as a family.",
        "Speakers of Totonacan languages are aware of having a common historical and linguistic background, and there are large numbers of easily recognizable cognates and grammatical similarities.",
        "A typical Totonacan consonantal inventory, that of the Papantla variant (Levy, 1987), is given in Table 1.",
        "Most languages of the family share this inventory, though one of the languages used for this study, Upper Necaxa, has undergone a number of phonological shifts that have affected its consonantal system, most notably the collapse of the voiceless lateral affricate with the voiceless lateral fricative (both are now fricatives) and the lenition of the uvular stop to a glottal stop, a process that has also affected at least some of the",
        "Tepehua languages.",
        "In Upper Necaxa, this lenition has also resulted in the creation of ejective fricatives from historical stop-uvular stop clusters (Beck, 2006).",
        "Languages also differ as to whether the back-fricative consonant is /h/ or /x/, and some languages have evolved voiceless /w/ and/or voiceless /y/ phonemes in word-final position.",
        "The phonemic status of the glottal stop is an open question in several of the languages.",
        "In terms of vocalic inventory, it was previously thought that all Totonacan languages had three-vowel systems (/a/, /i/, /u/), and that they also made distinctions for each vowel quality in vowel length and laryngealization.",
        "It has since come to light that at least some languages in the Sierra group do not make length distinctions (in at least one of these, Olintla, it appears that short vowels have developed into a phonemic schwa), and that others do not distinguish laryngealized vowels.",
        "A number of languages, including Upper Necaxa and some of the languages adjacent to it, have developed a fivevowel system; the sounds /e/ and /o/ are recognized in the orthographies of several languages of the family even where their phonemic status is in doubt.",

        "The algorithms are described in detail in (Kondrak, 2002).",
        "The phonetic similarity of lexemes is computed using the ALINE algorithm, which assigns a similarity score to pairs of phonetically-transcribed words on the basis of the decomposition of phonemes into elementary phonetic features.",
        "The principal component of ALINE is a function that calculates the similarity of two phonemes that are expressed in terms of about a dozen multivalued phonetic features.",
        "For example, the phoneme n, which is usually described as a voiced alveolar nasal stop, has the following feature values: Place = 0.85, Manner = 0.6, Voice = 1, and Nasal = 1, with the remaining features set to 0.",
        "The numerical feature values reflect the distances between vocal organs during speech production, and are based on experimental measurements.",
        "The phonetic features are assigned salience weights that express their relative importance.",
        "The default salience values were tuned manually on a development set of phoneme-aligned cognate pairs from various related languages.",
        "The overall similarity score is the sum of individual similarity scores between pairs of phonemes in an optimal alignment of two words.",
        "The similarity value is normalized by the length of the longer word.",
        "For the determination of recurrent sound correspondences we employ the method of inducing a translation model between phonemes in two word lists.",
        "The idea is to relate recurrent sound correspondences in word lists to translational equivalences in bitexts.",
        "The translation model is induced by combining the maximum similarity alignment with the competitive linking algorithm of Melamed (2000).",
        "Melamed's approach is based on the one-to-one assumption, which implies that every word in the bitext is aligned with at most one word on the other side of the bitext.",
        "In the context of the bilingual word lists, the correspondences determined under the one-to-one assumption are restricted to link single phonemes to single phonemes.",
        "Nevertheless, the method is powerful enough to determine valid correspondences in word lists in which the fraction of cognate pairs is well below 50%.",
        "Because of the lack of a Totonac gold standard, the approach to computing semantic similarity of glosses was much simpler than in (Kondrak, 2002).",
        "The keyword selection heuristic was simply to pick the first word of the gloss, which in Spanish glosses is often a noun followed by modifiers.",
        "A complete gloss match was given double the weight of a keyword match.",
        "More complex semantic relations were not considered.",

        "The identification of these correspondences by traditional means is cumbersome and time-consuming, given the large amounts of data that require processing.",
        "The Upper Necaxa dictionary, for instance, contains nearly 9,000 entries, from which a list of about 2,000 nouns would have to be extracted by hand, and then compared pairwise to lists drawn from dictionaries of potentially comparable length of each of the other languages, each of which would also have to be compared to the other.",
        "Lists of potential correspondences from each pairwise comparison would then have to be compared, and so on.",
        "The algorithms described here accomplish in mere minutes what would take man-hours (perhaps years) of expert labour to accomplish manually, outputting the results in a format that is easily accessed and shared with other researchers as an HTML-format list of cognates that can be made available on the World Wide Web.",
        "The results obtained from a study of this type have important implications for linguists, as well as anthropologists and archeologists interested in the history and migratory patterns of peoples speaking Totonacan languages.",
        "Presented with extensive and robust cognate sets and lists of sound changes, linguists gain insight into the patterns of historical phonological change and can verify or discon-firm models of phonological and typological development.",
        "These data can also give rough indications of the time-depth of the linguistic family and, potentially, suggest geographical origins of populations.",
        "At present, Totonac-Tepehua has not been demonstrably linked to any other language family in Mesoamerica.",
        "careful reconstruction of a proto-language might reveal such links and, possibly, shed some light on the early movements and origins of Mesoamerican peoples.",
        "These experiments have also allowed us to create the beginnings of an etymological dictionary which will, in turn, allow us to reconstruct a more accurate Totonac-Tepehua family tree.",
        "By comparing the relative numbers of shared cognates amongst languages and the number of regular sound changes shared by individual subsets of languages in each cognate set, we hope to be able to determine relative proximity of languages and the order in which the family divided itself into branches, sub-branches, and individual languages.",
