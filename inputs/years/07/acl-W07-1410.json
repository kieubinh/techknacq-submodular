        "This paper describes our participation in the RTE-3 challenge.",
        "It is our first attempt to RTE and we have taken profit of an analysis of the approaches followed in previous challenges (see (Dagan et al., 2005), and (Bar-Haim et al., 2006) for overviews of RTE-1 and RTE-2).",
        "Our approach, however, is based on a set of semantic-based distance measures between sentences used by our group in previous contests in Question Answering (TREC 2004, see (Ferres et al., 2005), and CLEF 2004, see (Ferres et al., 2004)), and Automatic Summarization (DUC 2006, see (Fuentes et al., 2006)).",
        "Although the use of such measures (distance between question and sentences in passages candidates to contain the answer, distance between query and sentences candidates to be included in the summary, ... ) is different for RTE task, our claim is that with some modifications the approach can be useful in this new scenario.",
        "The organization of this paper is as follows.",
        "After this introduction we present in section 2 a description of the measures upon which our approach is built.",

        "Our approach for computing distance measures between sentences is based on the degree of overlapping between the semantic content of the two sentences.",
        "Obtaining the semantic content implies a depth Linguistic Processing.",
        "Upon this semantic representation ofthe sentences several distance measures are computed.",
        "We next describe such issues.",
        "Linguistic Processing (LP) consists of a pipe of general purpose Natural Language (NL) processors that performs tokenization, morphologic tagging, lemmatization, Named Entities Recognition and Classification (NERC) with 4 basic classes (PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANIZATION, and OTHERS), syntactic parsing and semantic labelling, with WordNet synsets, Magnini's domain markers and EuroWordNet Top Concept Ontology labels.",
        "The Spear parser performs full parsing and robust detection of verbal predicate arguments.",
        "The syntactic constituent structure of each sentence (including the specification of the head of each constituent) and the relations among constituents (subject, direct and indirect object, modifiers) are obtained.",
        "As a result of the performance of these processors each sentence is enriched with a lexical and syntactic language dependent representations.",
        "A semantic language independent representation of the sentence (called environment) is obtained from these analyses (see (Ferres et al., 2005) for details).",
        "The environment is a semantic network like representation built using a process to extract the semantic units (nodes) and the semantic relations (edges) that hold between the different tokens in the sentence.",
        "These units and relations belong to an ontology of about 100 semantic classes (as person, city, action, magnitude, etc.)",
        "and 25 relations (mostly binary) between them (e.g. time .of.event, actor of action, location of.event, etc.).",
        "Both classes and relations are related by taxonomic links (see (Ferres et al., 2005) for details) allowing inheritance.",
        "Consider, for instance, the sentence \"Romano_Prodi 1 is 2 the 3 prime 4 minister 5 of 6 Italy 7\".",
        "The following environment is built:",
        "which jentity(2,1), which.quality(2,5), mod(5,7), mod(5,4).",
        "We transform each environment into a labelled directed graph representation with nodes assigned to positions in the sentence, labelled with the corresponding token, and edges to predicates (a dummy node, 0, is used for representing unary predicates).",
        "Only unary (e.g. entity(5) in Figure 1) and binary (e.g. in Figure 2 whichjquality(2,5J) predicates are used.",
        "Over this representation a rich variety of lexico-semantic proximity measures between sentences have been built.",
        "Each measure combines two components:",
        "• A lexical component that considers the set of common tokens occurring in both sentences.",
        "The size of this set and the strength of the compatibility links between its members are used for defining the measure.",
        "A flexible way of measuring token-level compatibility has been set ranging from word-form identity, lemma identity, overlapping of WordNet synsets, approximate string matching between Named Entities etc.",
        "For instance, \"Romano Prodi\" is lex-",
        "ically compatible with \"R. Prodi\" with a score of 0.5 and with \"Prodi\" with a score of 0.41.",
        "\"Italy\" and \"Italian\" are also compatible with score 0.7.",
        "This component defines a set of (partial) weighted mapping between the tokens of the two sentences that will be used as anchors in the next component.",
        "• A semantic component computed over the subgraphs corresponding to the set of lexically compatible nodes (anchors).",
        "Four different measures have been defined:",
        "- Strict overlapping of unary predicates.",
        "- Strict overlapping of binary predicates.",
        "- Loose overlapping of unary predicates.",
        "- Loose overlapping of binary predicates.",
        "The loose versions allow a relaxed matching of predicates by climbing up in the ontology of predicates (e.g. provided that A and B are lexically compatible, i.en.city(A) can match i.en.proper.place(B), i.en-proper.named-entity(B), location(B) or entity(B)) .",
        "Obviously, loose overlapping implies a penalty on the score that depends on the length of the path between the two predicates and their informative content."
