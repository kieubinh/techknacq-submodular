        "Textual entailment recognition has become a popular Natural Language Processing task within the last few years.",
        "It consists in determining whether one text snippet (hypothesis) entails another one (text) (Glickman, 2005).",
        "To overcome this problem several approaches have been studied, being the Recognising Textual Entailment Challenge (RTE) (Bar-Haim et al., 2006; Dagan et al., 2006) the most referred source for determining which one is the most accurate.",
        "Many of the participating groups in previous editions of RTE, including ourselves (Ferrandez et al., 2006), designed systems that combined a variety of lexical, syntactic and semantic techniques.",
        "In our contribution to RTE-3 we attempt to solve the textual entailment recognition task by analyzing two different perspectives separately, in order to acknowledge the amount of information that an individual perspective can provide.",
        "Later on, we combine both modules to obtain the highest possible accuracy rate.",
        "For this purpose, we analyze the provided corpora by using a lexical module, namely DLSITE-1, and a syntactic one, namely DLSITE-2.",
        "Once all results have been obtained we perform a voting process in order to take into account all system's judgments.",
        "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.",
        "Section two describes the system we have built, providing details of the lexical and syntactic perspectives, and explains the difference with the one we presented in RTE-2.",
        "Third section presents the experimental results, and the fourth one provides our conclusions and describes possible future work."

      "text": [
        "This section describes the system we have developed in order to participate in RTE-3.",
        "It is based on surface techniques of lexical and syntactic analysis.",
        "As the starting point we have used our previous system presented in the second edition of the RTE Challenge (Ferrandez et al., 2006).",
        "We have enriched it with two independent modules that are intended to detect some misinterpretations performed by this system.",
        "Moreover, these new modules can also recognize entailment relations by themselves.",
        "The performance of each separate module and their combination with our previous system will be detailed in section three.",
        "Next, Figure 1 represents a schematic view of the system we have developed.",
        "As we can see in the previous Figure, our system is composed of three modules that are coordinated by an input scheduler.",
        "Its commitment is to provide the text-hypothesis pairs to each module in order to extract their corresponding similarity rates.",
        "Once all rates for a given text-hypothesis pair have been calculated, they will be processed by an output gatherer that will provide the final judgment.",
        "The method used to calculate the final entailment decision consists in combining the outputs of both lexical and syntactic modules, and these outputs with our RTE-2 system's judgment.",
        "The output gatherer will be detailed later in this paper when we describe the experimental results.",
        "The approach we presented in the previous edition of RTE attempts to recognize textual entailment by determining whether the text and the hypothesis are related using their respective derived logic forms, and by finding relations between their predicates using WordNet (Miller et al., 1990).",
        "These relations have a specific weight that provide us a score representing the similarity of the derived logic forms and determining whether they are related or not.",
        "For our participation in RTE-3 we decided to apply our previous system because it allows us to handle some kinds of information that are not correctly managed by the new approaches developed for the current RTE edition.",
        "This method relies on the computation of a wide variety of lexical measures, which basically consists of overlap metrics.",
        "Although in other related work this kind of metrics have already been used (Nicholson et al., 2006), the main contribution of this module is the fact that it only deals with lexical features without taking into account any syntactic nor semantic information.",
        "The following paragraphs list the considered lexical measures.",
        "Simple matching: initialized to zero.",
        "A boolean value is set to one if the hypothesis word appears in the text.",
        "The final weight is calculated as the sum of all boolean values and normalized dividing it by the length of the hypothesis.",
        "Levenshtein distance: it is similar to simple matching.",
        "However, in this case we use the mentioned distance as the similarity measure between words.",
        "When the distance is zero, the increment value is one.",
        "On the other hand, if such value is equal to one, the increment is 0.9.",
        "Otherwise, it will be the inverse of the obtained distance.",
        "Consecutive subsequence matching: this measure assigns the highest relevance to the appearance of consecutive subsequences.",
        "In order to perform this, we have generated all possible sets of consecutive subsequences, from length two until the length in words, from the text and the hypothesis.",
        "If we proceed as mentioned, the sets of length two extracted from the hypothesis will be compared to the sets of the same length from the text.",
        "If the same element is present in both the text and the hypothesis set, then a unit is added to the accumulated weight.",
        "This procedure is applied for all sets of different length extracted from the hypothesis.",
        "Finally, the sum of the weight obtained from each set of a specific length is normalized by the number of sets corresponding to this length, and the final accumulated weight is also normalized by the length of the hypothesis in words minus one.",
        "This measure is defined as follows:",
        "CSmatch = where SHi contains the hypothesis' subsequences of length i, and f (SHi) is defined as follows:",
        "being match(j) equal to one if there exists an element k that belongs to the set that contains the text's subsequences of length i, such that k = j.",
        "One should note that this measure does not consider non-consecutive subsequences.",
        "In addition, it assigns the same relevance to all consecutive subsequences with the same length.",
        "Furthermore, the longer the subsequence is, the more relevant it will be considered.",
        "Tri-grams: two sets containing tri-grams of letters belonging to the text and the hypothesis were created.",
        "All the occurrences in the hypothesis' tri-grams set that also appear in the text's will increase the accumulated weight in a factor of one unit.",
        "The weight is normalized by the size of the hypothesis' tri-grams set.",
        "ROUGE measures: considering the impact of n-gram overlap metrics in textual entailment, we believe that the idea of integrating these measures into our system is very appealing.",
        "We have implemented them as defined in (Lin, 2004).",
        "Each measure is applied to the words, lemmas and stems belonging to the text-hypothesis pair.",
        "Within the entire set of measures, each one of them is considered as a feature for the training and test stages of a machine learning algorithm.",
        "The selected one was a Support Vector Machine due to the fact that its properties are suitable for recognizing entailment.",
        "The syntactic module we have built is composed of few submodules that operate collaboratively in order to obtain the highest possible accuracy by using only syntactic information.",
        "The commitment of the irst two submodules is to generate an internal representation of the syntactic dependency trees generated by MINIPAR (Lin, 1998).",
        "For this purpose we obtain the output of such parser for the text-hypothesis pairs, and then process it to generate an on-memory internal representation of the mentioned trees.",
        "In order to reduce our system's noise and increase its accuracy rate, we only keep the relevant words and discard the ones that we believe do not provide useful information, such as determinants and auxiliary verbs.",
        "After this step has been performed we can proceed to compare the generated syntactic dependency trees of the text and the hypothesis.",
        "The graph node matching, termed alignment, between both the text and the hypothesis consists in inding pairs of words in both trees whose lemmas are identical, no matter whether they are in the same position within the tree.",
        "Some authors have already designed similar matching techniques, such as the one described in (Snow et al., 2006).",
        "However, these include semantic constraints that we have decided not to consider.",
        "The reason of this decision is that we desired to overcome the textual entailment recognition from an exclusively syntactic perspective.",
        "The formula that provides the similarity rate between the dependency trees of the text and the hypothesis in our system, denoted by the symbol tp, is shown in Equation 3:",
        "where t and X represent the text's and hypothesis' syntactic dependency trees, respectively, and ¬£ is the set that contains all synsets present in both trees, being ¬£ = t n X Ma e t,/3 e X.",
        "As we can observe in Equation 3, p depends on another function, denoted by the symbol 0, which provides the relevance of a synset.",
        "Such a weight factor will depend on the grammatical category and relation of the synset.",
        "In addition, we believe that the most relevant words of a phrase occupy the highest positions in the dependency tree, so we desired to assign different weights depending on the depth of the synset.",
        "With all these factors we deine the relevance of a word as shown in Equation 4:",
        "where // is a synset present in both t and A, y represents the weight assigned to //'s grammatical category (Table 1), o the weight of //'s grammatical relationship (Table 2), j an empirically calculated value that represents the weight difference between tree levels, and 5p the depth of the node that contains the synset // in A.",
        "The performed experiments reveal that the optimal value for j is 1.1.",
        "We would like to point out that a requirement of our system s similarity measure is to be independent of the hypothesis length.",
        "Therefore, we must define the normalized similarity rate, as represented in Equation 5:",
        "Once the similarity value has been calculated, it will be provided to the user together with the corresponding text-hypothesis pair identifier.",
        "It will be his responsibility to choose an appropriate threshold that will represent the minimum similarity rate to be considered as entailment between text and hypothesis.",
        "All values that are under such a threshold will be marked as not entailed."

        "On the other hand, for the remainder modules the development corpora was used to set the thresholds that determine if the entailment holds.",
        "The performed tests have been obtained by performing different combinations of the described modules.",
        "First, we have calculated the accuracy rates using only each single module separately.",

        "On the other hand, the syntactic one had a significantly lower rate, and the same happened with the system we presented in RTE-2.",
        "Therefore, a combination of them will most likely produce less accurate results than the lexical module, as it is shown in Table 3.",
        "However, we would like to point out that these results depend heavily on the corpus idiosyncrasy.",
