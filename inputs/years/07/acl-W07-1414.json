        "Coping with paraphrases appears to be an essential subtask in Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE).",
        "Most RTE systems incorporate some form of lexical paraphrasing, usually relying on WordNet to identify synonym, hypernym and hyponym relations among word pairs from text and hypothesis (Bar-Haim et al., 2006, Table 2).",
        "Many systems also address paraphrasing above the lexical level.",
        "This can take the form of identifying or substituting equivalent multi-word strings, e.g., (Bosma and Callison-Burch, 2006).",
        "A drawback of this approach is that it is hard to cope with discontinuous paraphrases containing one or more gaps.",
        "Other approaches exploit syntactic knowledge in the form of parse trees.",
        "Hand-crafted transformation rules can account for systematic syntactic alternation like active-passive form, e.g., (Marsi et al., 2006).",
        "Alternatively, such paraphrase rules may be automatically derived from huge text corpora (Lin and Pan-tel, 2001).",
        "There are at least two key advantages of syntax-based over string-based paraphrasing which are relevant for RTE: (1) it can cope with discontinuous paraphrases; (2) syntactic information such as dominance relations, phrasal syntactic labels and dependency relations, can be used to refine the coarse matching on words only.",
        "Here we investigate paraphrasing on the basis of of syntactic dependency analyses.",
        "Our sole resource is the DIRT data set (Lin and Pantel, 2001), an extensive collection of automatically derived paraphrases.",
        "These have been used for RTE before (de Salvo Braz et al., 2005; Raina et al., 2005), and similar approaches to paraphrase mining have been applied as well (Nielsen et al., 2006; Hickl et al., 2006).",
        "However, in these approaches paraphrasing is always one factor in a complex system, and as a result little is known of the contribution of paraphrasing for the RTE task.",
        "In this paper, we focus entirely on dependency-based paraphrasing in order to get a better understanding of its usefulness for RTE.",
        "In the next Section, we describe the DIRT data and present an algorithm for dependency-based paraphrasing in order to bring a pair's text closer to its hypothesis.",
        "We present statistics on coverage as well as qualitative discussion of the results.",
        "Section 3 then describes our RTE system and results with and without dependency-based paraphrasing."

      "text": [
        "Starting from the text-hypothesis pairs in the RTE XML format, we first preprocess the data.",
        "As the text part may consist of more than one sentence, we first perform sentence splitting using Mxtermi-nator (Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997), a maximum entropy-based end of sentence classifier trained on the Penn Treebank data.",
        "Next, each sentence is tokenized and syntactically parsed using the Minipar parser (Lin, 1998).",
        "From the parser's tabular output we extract the word forms, lemmas, part-of-speech tags and dependency relations.",
        "This information is then stored in an ad-hoc XML format which represents the trees as an hierarchy of node elements in order to facilitate tree matching.",
        "The DIRT (Discovering Inference Rules from Text) method is based on extending Harris Distributional Hypothesis, which states that words that occurred in the same contexts tend to be similar, to dependency paths in parse trees (Lin and Pantel, 2001).",
        "Each dependency path consists of at least three nodes: a root node, and two non-root terminal nodes, which are nouns.",
        "The DIRT data set we used consists of over 182k paraphrase clusters derived from 1GB of newspaper text.",
        "Each cluster consists of a unique dependency path, which we will call the paraphrase source, and a list of equivalent dependency paths, which we will refer to as the paraphrase translations, ordered in decreasing value of point-wise mutual information.",
        "A small sample in the original format is",
        "The first two lines represent the inference rule: X bought by Y entails X sold to Y.",
        "We preprocess the DIRT data by restoring prepositions, which were originally folded into a dependency relation, to individual nodes, as this eases alignment with the parsed RTE data.",
        "For the same reason, paths are converted to the same ad-hoc XML format as the parsed RTE data.",
        "Conceptually, our paraphrase substitution algorithm takes a straightforward approach.",
        "For the purpose of explanation only, Figure 1 presents pseudo-code for a naive implementation.",
        "The main function takes two arguments (cf. line 1).",
        "The first is a preprocessed RTE data set in which all sentences from text and hypothesis are dependency parsed.",
        "The second is a collection of DIRT paraphrases, each one mapping a source path to one or more translation paths.",
        "For each text/hypothesis pair (cf. line 2), we look at all the subtrees of the text parses (cf. line 3-4) and attempt to find a suitable paraphrase of this subtree (cf. line 5).",
        "We search the DIRT paraphrases (cf. line 8) for a source path that matches the text subtree at hand (cf. line 9).",
        "If found, we check if any of the corresponding paraphrase translation paths (cf. line 10) matches a subtree of the hypothesis parse (cf. line 11-12).",
        "If so, we modify the text tree by substituting this translation path (cf. line 13).",
        "The intuition behind this is that we only accept paraphrases that bring the text closer to the hypothesis.",
        "The DIRT paraphrases are ordered in decreasing likelihood, so after a successful paraphrase substitution, we discard the remaining possibilities and continue with the next text subtree (cf. line 14).",
        "The Match function, which is used for matching the source path to a text subtree and the translation path to an hypothesis subtree, requires the path to occur in the subtree.",
        "That is, all lemmas, part-of-speech tags and dependency relations from the path must have identical counterparts in the subtree; skipping nodes is not allowed.",
        "As the path's terminals specify no lemma, the only requirement is that their counterparts are nouns.",
        "The Substitute function replaces the matched path in the text tree by the paraphrase's translation path.",
        "Intuitively, the path \"overlays\" a part of the subtree, changing lemmas and dependency relations, but leaving most of the daughter nodes unaffected.",
        "Note that the new path may be longer or shorter than the original one, thus introducing or removing nodes from the text tree.",
        "As an example, we will trace our algorithm as applied to the first pair of the RTE3 dev set (id=1).",

        "The paraphrasing procedure can in effect be viewed as making the inference that Baikalfinans-group was bought by Rosneft, therefore Baikalfi-nansgroup was sold to Rosneft.",
        "The naive implementation of the algorithm is of course not very efficient.",
        "Our actual implementation uses a number of shortcuts to reduce processing time.",
        "For instance, the DIRT paraphrases are indexed on the lemma of their root in order to speed up retrieval.",
        "As another example, text nodes with less than two child nodes (i.e. terminal and unary-branching nodes) are immediately skipped, as they will never match a paraphrase path.",

        "Table 1 gives an impression of how many paraphrases were substituted.",
        "The first row lists the total number of nodes in the dependency trees of the text parts.",
        "The second row shows that for roughly 15% of these nodes, the DIRT data contains a paraphrase with the same lemma.",
        "The next two rows show in how many cases the source path matches the text and the translation path matches the hypothesis (i.e. giving rise to a paraphrase substitution).",
        "Clearly, the number of actual paraphrase substitutions is relatively small: on average about 0.5% of all text subtrees are subject to paraphrasing.",
        "Still, about one in six sentences is subject to paraphrasing, and close to half of all pairs is paraphrased at least once.",
        "Sentences triggering more than one paraphrase do occur.",
        "Also note that paraphrasing occurs more frequently in true entailment pairs than in false entailment pairs.",
        "This is to be expected, given that text and hypothesis are more similar when an entailment relation holds.",
        "Type of paraphrases A substantial number of the paraphrases applied are single word synonyms or verb plus particle combinations which might as well be obtained from string-based substitution on the basis of a lexical resource like WordNet.",
        "Some randomly chosen examples include X announces Y entails X supports Y, X makes Y entails X sells Y, and locates X at Y discovers X at Y.",
        "Nevertheless, more interesting paraphrases do occur.",
        "In the pair below (id=452), we find the paraphrase X wins Y entails X",
        "Table 1: Frequency of (partial) paraphrase matches on the RTE3 dev set (is) Y champion.",

        "Aged just seventeen, he won Wimbledon for the first time and went on to become the most prolific tennis player.",
        "Hypothesis: Boris Becker is a Wimbledon champion Entailment: True",
        "Another intriguing paraphrase, which appears to be false on first sight, is X flies from Y entails X makes (a) flight to Y.",
        "However, in the context of the next pair (id=777), it turns out to be correct.",
        "Text: The Hercules transporter plane which flew straight here from the first round of the trip in Pakistan, touched down and it was just a brisk 100m stroll to the handshakes.",
        "Hypothesis: The Hercules transporter plane made a flight to Pakistan.",
        "Coverage Although the DIRT data constitutes a relatively large collection of paraphrases, it is clear that many paraphrases required for the RTE3 data are missing.",
        "We tried to improve coverage to some extent by relaxing the Match function: instead of an exact match, we allowed for small mismatches in POS tag and dependency relation, reversing the order of a path's left and right side, and even for skipping nodes.",
        "However, subjective evaluation suggested that the results deteriorated.",
        "Alternatively, the coverage might be increased by deducing paraphrases on the fly using the web as a corpus, e.g., (Hickl et al., 2006).",
        "Somewhat surprisingly, the vast majority of paraphrases concerns verbs.",
        "Even though the DIRT data contains paraphrases for nouns, adjectives and complementizers, the coverage of these word classes is apparently not nearly as extensive as that of verbs.",
        "Another observation is that fewer paraphrases occur in pairs from the QA task.",
        "We have no explanation for this.",
        "False paraphrases Since the DIRT data was automatically derived and was not manually checked, it contains noise in the form of questionable or even false paraphrases.",
        "While some of these surface in paraphrased RTE3 data (e.g. X leaves for Y entails X departs Y, and X feeds Y entails Y feeds X), their number appears to be limited.",
        "We conjecture this is because of the double constraint that a paraphrase must match both text and hypothesis.",
        "Relevance Not all paraphrase substitutions are relevant for the purpose of recognizing textual entailment.",
        "Evidently, paraphrases in false entailment pairs are counterproductive.",
        "However, even in true entailment pairs paraphrases might occur in parts of the text that are irrelevant to the task at hand.",
        "Consider the following pair from the RTE3 dev set (id=417).",
        "Text: When comparing Michele Granger and Brian Goodell, Brian has to be the clear winner.",
