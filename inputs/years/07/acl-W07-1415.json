        "Since a high quantity of pairs of RTE-3 collections contain named entities (82.6% of the hypotheses in the test collection contain at least one named entity), the objective of this work is to study the effect of named entity recognition on textual entailment in the framework of the Third RTE Challenge.",
        "In short, the techniques involved in the experiments in order to reach these objectives are:",

        "The proposed systems are based on surface techniques of lexical and syntactic analysis considering each task (Information Extraction, Information Retrieval, Question Answering and Text Summarization) of the RTE Challenge independently.",
        "The systems accept pairs of text snippets (text and hypothesis) at the input and give a boolean value at the output: YES if the text entails the hypothesis and NO otherwise.",
        "This value is obtained by the application of the learned model by a SVM classifier.",
        "The main components of the systems are the following:",
        "Firstly, each text-hypothesis pair is preprocessed in order to obtain the following information for the entailment decision:",
        "• POS: a Part of Speech Tagging is performed in order to obtain lemmas for both text and hypothesis using the Freeling POS tagger (Carreras et al., 2004).",
        "<t>...Chernobyl accident began on <t>The Communist Party USA was a small Maoist political party which was founded in 1965 by members of the Communist Party around Michael Laski who took the side of China in the Sino-Soviet split.",

        "• NER: the Freeling Named Entity Recogniser is also applied to recover the information needed by the named entity entailment module that is described in the following section.",
        "Numeric expressions, proper nouns and temporal expressions of each text and hypothesis are tagged.",
        "• Dependency analysis: a dependency tree of each text and hypothesis is obtained using Lin's Minipar (Lin, 1998).",
        "Once the named entities of the hypothesis and the text are detected, the next step is to determine the entailment relations between the named entities in the text and the named entities in the hypothesis.",
        "In (Rodrigo et al., 2007) the following entailment relations between named entities were defined:",
        "1.",
        "A Proper Noun E1 entails a Proper Noun E2 if the text string of E1 contains the text string of",
        "E2.",
        "2.",
        "A Time Expression T1 entails a Time Expression T2 if the time range of T1 is included in the time range of T2.",
        "3.",
        "A numeric expression N1 entails a numeric expression N2 if the range associated to N2 encloses the range of N1.",
        "Some characters change in different expressions of the same named entity as, for example, in a proper noun with different wordings (e.g. Yasser, Yaser, Yasir).",
        "To detect the entailment in these situations, when the previous process fails, we implemented a modified entailment decision process taking into account the edit distance of Levenshtein (Levensthein, 1966).",
        "Thus, if two named entities differ in less than 20%, then we assume that exists an entailment relation between these named entities.",
        "However, this definition of named entities entailment does not support errors due to wrong named entities classification as we can see in Figure 1.",
        "The expression 1990 represents a year but it is recognised as a numeric expression in the hypothesis.",
        "However the same expression is recognised as a temporal expression in the text and, therefore, the expression in the hypothesis cannot be entailed by it according to the named entities entailment definition above.",
        "We quantified the effect of these errors in recognising textual entailment.",
        "For this purpose, we developed the following two settings:",
        "1.",
        "A system based in dependency analysis and WordNet (Herrera et al., 2006b) that uses the categorization given by the NER tool, where the entailment relations between named entities are the previously ones defined.",
        "2.",
        "The same system based on dependency analysis and WordNet but not using the categorization given by the NER tool.",
        "All named entities detected receive the same tag and a named entity E1 entails a named entity E2 if the text string of E1 contains the text string of E2 (see Figure2).",
        "We checked the performance of these two settings over the test corpus set of the Second RTE Challenge.",
        "The results obtained, using the accuracy measure that is the fraction of correct responses according to (Dagan et al., 2006), are shown in table 1.",
        "The table shows that with an easier and a more robust processing (NER without classification) the performance is not only maintained, but it is even slightly higher.",
        "This fact led us to ignore the named entity categorization given by the tool and assume that text and hypothesis are related and close texts where same expressions must receive same categories, without the need of classification.",
        "Thus, all detected named entities receive the same tag and we consider that a named entity E1 entails a named entity E2 if the text string of E1 contains the text string of E2.",
        "A tree matching module, which searches for matching branches into the hypotheses' dependency trees, is used.",
        "There is a potential matching branch per leaf.",
        "A branch from the hypothesis is considered a \"matching branch\" only if all its nodes from the root to the leaf are involved in a lexical entailment (Herrera et al., 2006a).",
        "In this way, the subtree conformed by all the matching branches from a hypothesis' dependency tree is included in the respective text's dependency tree, giving an idea of tree inclusion.",
