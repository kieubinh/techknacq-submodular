        "The task of textual entailment for the PASCAL Textual Entailment Challenge for 2007 was to create a system to determine if a given pair of sentences, called the Text-Hypothesis (T-H) pair, had the property of having the Text sentence entail the Hypothesis sentence.",
        "Each Text-Hypothesis pair is also assigned the type of entailment that should be applied to the pair when evaluating its entailment.",
        "There are four types of entailment, each of which may or may not need different techniques to determine entailment, and for the purposes of the RTE tool developed, are considered separate problems."

        "Our research group decided to begin focusing on the Recognizing Textual Entailment challenge this year in February and to continue our participation for years to come.",
        "It was decided to create a development environment from which our researchers could attempt different techniques of examining a Text-Hypothesis pair and yet all metrics resulting from those techniques could be used in calculating the final results.",
        "The RTE tool also randomly generates training and testing sets from the 800 Text-Hypothesis pairs provided for development by the competition to avoid over-fitting the data during the training stage.",
        "The RTE Tool can generate a metric by calling a .NET object, COM object, web page, command line, or an internal function.",
        "These metrics are cached to speed testing, though a specific metric type can be cleared manually should the object or function generating the metric be changed.",
        "In the image of the RTE tool above, we can see a typical results screen.",
        "We have a misclassified sample highlighted and all the relevant data for that sample displayed on the bottom.",
        "Each category is represented with a folder and displays the accuracy results of the last classification.",
        "In this way, we can easily compare and contrast different metrics and their effectiveness on the samples in a simple and intuitive way.",
        "Each metric developed is required to produce a continuous variable that can measure a feature of the TH pair.",
        "The metric value is required to be normalized between 0 and 1 inclusive so that we can use the same metrics for future expansion when possibly dealing with nearest-neighbor classification techniques and not be subject to scaling issues.",
        "This is also valuable if we intend to develop vague predicates [Brachman and Levesque, 2004] to use in Boolean rules, another potential classification implementation.",
        "There is also currently a constraint that the metric value \"0\" means the least entailment (according to that particular metric) and the value \"1\" means the most entailment.",
        "This helped create an easy way to maximize our linear discriminant function (which will be described below).",
        "This constraint is unnecessary when classifying using the univariate density model.",
        "The tool classifies a TH test pair using one of two classification methods.",
        "The first method uses the metrics of the training set to generate the parameters for eight Gaussian distributions, or two distributions for each type of textual entailment.",
        "Each distribution describes a probability density function (PDF) for a particular type of entailment.",
        "For example, there is one PDF for the entailment type of \"Question Answering\" (QA) whose entailment is \"YES\", and there is one PDF for the entailment type of QA whose entailment is \"NO\".",
        "This univariate normal model was chosen to simplify the calculations over the multivariate model we planned to use.",
        "Since the submissions would only consider one metric for each run, instead of using all the metrics we have defined, the univariate model was appropriate.",
        "The second method of classification uses the metrics from the training set to develop a linear decision boundary to maximize the accuracy outcome in the test set.",
        "Once this boundary, or threshold, is determined for each of the four types of entailment, a simple comparison of the metric from a TH pair can be classified based on what side of the boundary it is on.",
        "This linear discriminant function had a further constraint that required the metric values be described in a certain way to simplify the classification function.",
        "This requirement will be lifted for our next submission in order to deal with solution landscapes that may not adhere to our Gaussian distribution model."

        "Three different metrics were developed for use in our RTE tool this year.",
        "We decided to concentrate on producing simple measurements to create a baseline for which to judge the development of new metrics as well as to judge the performance of future training or classification methods.",
        "Due to time constraints, we chose to employ simple metrics, which have been used before, in order to meet our primary goals.",
        "Despite the simplicity and the lack of semantic interpretation of the metrics, these metrics coupled with our pattern classification strategy yielded competitive results.",
        "Our first metric is a simple lexical similarity ratio between the words in the Text and Hypothesis sentences in a TH pair.",
        "The formula counts number of matches between the occurrences of a word in the Hypothesis and the words in the Text.",
        "The sum is then normalized by dividing it by the number of words in the Hypothesis itself.",
        "For baseline purposes, every word was considered and only punctuation was removed.",
        "This technique was also used by other teams in previous challenge submissions [Jijkoun and Rijke, 2005].",
        "Our second metric was not used in the final results, but will be described for completeness.",
        "This metric was the average of the distances in the Text between matched words from the Hypothesis normalized by dividing that average by the maximum possible distance.",
        "In other words, if two words in the Hypothesis were found in the Text, the distance between them in the Text would be averaged with all the other combinations of matched word pair distances and then normalized by dividing the maximum possible distance value for that particular sentence.",
        "Preliminary results showed a less than significant correlation and so were not used in this submission.",
        "The third metric is nearly identical to the lexical similarity metric defined above except that if a word in the Hypothesis sentence is not matched, then all its synonyms and antonyms are also searched for in the Text sentence.",
        "Any synonym matches raise the score and any antonym matches lower the score by a fixed amount, and in this case arbitrarily selected as Â±1 (before normalization).",
        "A Microsoft Word 2003 COM object was used to search for the synonyms and antonyms from Microsoft Word's lexical database."

        "Two different types of classification methods were used to classify entailment for a Text-Hypothesis pair.",
        "Both types are described below.",
        "We chose to initially keep our classification models simple and easy to visualize so that both our experienced and inexperienced research group members could participate.",
        "The \"No Free Lunch Theorem\" [Duda, Hart, and Stork, 2001] shows that there is no inherent benefit to any specific classifier , and since the more important task of generating the metrics crosses academic disciplines in our research group, we found communicating in terms of a Gaussian distribution was easily understood.",
        "The continuous univariate normal model, or Gaussian density, allows us to calculate p(x), or the probability that feature x will appear in a dataset.",
        "The data points in the given dataset is assumed to be distributed in a Gaussian distribution, sometimes referred to as a bell curve.",
        "Of course if the data points in that data set turn out to be distributed in a non-Gaussian curve (i.e. exponential curve or even linear) or multimodal curve (more than one peak), then we may not be able to draw any conclusions.",
        "For the purposes of our metrics, we are assuming a Gaussian distribution, and encourage the developer of the metric function to attempt to fit the metric results into Gaussian curve.",
        "The two parameters of interest are the mean u and the variance o, of the data points.",
        "With these two parameters, we are essentially able to calculate the probability density function (PDF) for the category.",
        "After calculating these parameters from the development data set, we can apply the following formula to generate the probability, p(x), of a sample, where x is the metric value we wish to classify.",
        "During the training step, the mean of a category is calculated.",
        "The following formula does this calculation, where n is the number of samples, and xi is a particular metric of the ith sample:",
        "Also during the training step, the variance of a category is also calculated, with this formula:",
        "For each type of entailment, there are two classifiers: one classifier for \"YES\" and one classifier for \"NO\", representing the two categories.",
        "During the training step, the mean and variance parameters are calculated directly from the metrics that come from the development data.",
        "During the testing step, the specified metric is calculated for the TH pair, and using the univariate normal formula, we can calculate the probability that the calculated metric is in the \"YES\" category or the \"NO\" category.",
        "Then which ever result is larger, that category is chosen as the answer.",
        "To understand the limitations of this method, we have a quick example.",
        "Here is a parameter list of each category as well as the decisions that were made from them:",
        "Overall correct entailments made: 492 out of 800.",
        "Overall probability of success : 0.615",
        "As we can see, the two categories (IE,NO) and (IE,YES) are very similar in mean, u.",
        "This essentially translates to two Gaussian curves peaking at the same point, which would cause an overlap that would favor the curve with the larger variance during the calculation of p(x).",
        "If we look at the results using these parameters, we can see that in the \"IE\" type of entailment all decisions were made in favor of that category.",
        "This does not mean that there is an error, just that the distribution of this metric is too similar and so probably is not a good metric to use in deciding the classification for that category.",
        "Whereas in entailment type \"QA\", we find that this metric does indeed divide the categories into two curves that are quite separated, and so yields a good accuracy.",
        "This is the easiest way the RTE tool calculates whether a TH pair is in a specific category.",
        "If a metric is less-than a specific threshold, then the TH pair is classified as \"NO\", and if it is above the threshold, then the pair is classified as \"YES\".",
        "Each type of entailment has its own discriminant function and therefore, there are only four classifiers or in this case, technically defined as four di-chotomizers.",
        "Each threshold is calculated using a brute force iterative technique.",
        "After the metric is calculated for each sample, the RTE tool simply increments the threshold a certain fixed amount (arbitrarily selected as 0.001 each each iteration) and records the accuracy over the entire development data set for that iteration.",
        "As the process concludes after one thousand iterations (that is, moving the threshold from 0 to 1 in .001 increments), the threshold with the maximum accuracy is selected as the threshold for that classifier.",
        "This, however, places a constraint on the way the metric needs to be defined, as described above in section 2.1."

        "By focusing our efforts this year on developing a tool to test various methods of classification and metrics, we created an excellent way to develop our ideas and distribute our research efforts among researchers.",
        "The RTE Development Environment will help us coordinate our efforts and allow small gains in any individual metric to contribute to the overall classification in a proportionately significant way.",
        "For future enhancements, we intend to apply the multivariate model to process a metric vector in determining classification instead of just considering one metric at a time (as we did in the univariate model).",
        "In addition, we intend to extend our metrics to consider semantic interpretations and comparisons between the Text-Hypothesis pair.",
        "We feel that our overall success was illuminating to the larger task at hand and we are looking forward to applying our decision making framework to next year's submission.",
