        "Understanding written language is a non-trivial task.",
        "It takes years for children to read, and ambiguities of written communication remain long after we learn the basics.",
        "Despite these apparent complexities, the bag-of-words (BOW) approach, which ignores structure both within a sentence and within a document, continues to dominate information retrieval, and to some extent document summarization and paraphrasing and entailment systems.",
        "The rational behind the BOW approach is in part simplicity (it is much easier and less computationally expensive to compare terms in one sentence with terms in another, than to generate the sentence structure); and in part accuracy, the BOW approach continues to achieve similar if not improved performance than information retrieval systems employing deep language or logical based representations.",
        "This performance is surprising when you consider that a BOW approach could not distinguish between the very different meaning conveyed by: (1)Slow down so that you don't hit the riders on the road and (2)Don't slow down so you hit the riders on the road.",
        "A system that employed a syntactic representation of these sentences however, could detect that the don't modifier applies to hit in first sentence and to slow second.",
        "In contrast to information retrieval, researchers in paraphrase and entailment detection have increased their use of sentence structure.",
        "Fewer than half of the submissions in the first Recognizing Textual Entailment challenge (RTE1) employed syntax (13/28, 46%) (Dagan, Glickman, & Magnini, 2005), but more than two-thirds (28/ submissions employed syntax (Bar-Haim et al., 2006).",
        "Furthermore, for the first time, the RTE2 results showed that systems employing deep language features, such as syntactic or logical representations of text, could outperform the purely semantic overlap approach typified by BOW.",
        "Earlier findings such as (Vanderwende, Coughlin, & Dolan, 2005) also suggest that sentence structure plays an important role in recognizing textual entailment and paraphrasing accurately.",
        "Our goal in this paper is to explore the degree to which sentence structure alone influences the accuracy of entailment and paraphrase detection.",
        "Other than a lexicon (which is used to identify the base form of a term), our approach uses no background knowledge, such as WordNet (Miller, 1995), extensive dictionaries (Litkowski, 2006) or custom-built knowledge-bases (Hickl et al., 2006) that have been successfully employed by other systems.",
        "While such semantic knowledge should improve entailment performance, we deliberately avoid these sources to isolate the impact of sentence structure alone."

        "Our approach requires an explicit representation of structure in both the hypothesis (HSent) and test (TSent) sentence(s).",
        "Systems in RTE challenges employ a variety of parsers.",
        "In RTE2 the most popular sentence structure was generated by Minipar (Lin, 1998), perhaps because it is also one of the fastest parsers.",
        "Our system uses the typed dependency tree generated by the Stanford Parser (Klein & Manning, 2002).",
        "A complete set of parser tags and the method used to map from a constituent to a typed dependency grammar can be found in (de Marneffe et al., 2006).",
        "Figure 1 shows an example typed dependency grammar for pair id 355 in the RTE3Test set.",
        "Our proposed approach requires the base form of each term.",
        "We considered two lexicons for this purpose: WordNet (Miller, 1995) and the SPECIALIST lexicon (National Library of",
        "Medicine, 2000).",
        "The latter is part of the National Library of Medicine's (NLM) Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and comprises terms drawn from medical abstracts, and dictionaries, both medical and contemporary.",
        "With 412,149 entries, the SPECIALIST lexicon (version 2006AA) is substantially larger than the 5,947 entries in WordNet (Version 3.0).",
        "To understand the level of overlap between the lexicons we loaded both into an oracle database.",
        "Our subsequent analysis revealed that of the WordNet entries, 5008 (84.1%) had a morphological base form in the SPECIALIST lexicon.",
        "Of the 548 distinct entries that differed between the two lexicons, 389 differed because either the UMLS (214 terms) or WordNet (11 terms) did not have a base form.",
        "These results suggest that although the NLM did not develop their lexicon for news articles, the entries in the SPECIALIST lexicon subsumes most terms found in the more frequently used WordNet lexicon.",
        "Thus, our system uses the base form of terms from the SPECIALIST lexicon.",
        "Previous work (Lin & Pantel, 2001) suggests the utility of collapsing paths through prepositions.",
        "The type dependency does have a preposition tag, prep, however, we found that the parser typically assigns a more general tag, such as dep (see the dep tag in Figure 1 between wrapped and by).",
        "Instead of using the prep tag, the system collapses paths that contain a preposition from the SPECIALIST lexicon.",
        "For example, the system collapses four paths in TSentEG millions of visitors, wrapped in 1995, wrapped by Christo, and wrapped began before.",
        "The typed dependency grammar, such as that shown in Figure 1, can produce many different features that may indicate entailment.",
        "Our current implementation uses the following four base level features.",
        "(1) Subject: The system identifies the subject(s) of a sentence using heuristics and the parser subject tags nsubjpass and nsubj.",
        "(2) Object: The system uses the parser tag dobj to identify the object(s) in each sentence.",
        "(3) Verb: The system tags all terms linked with either the subject or the object as a verb.",
        "For example, wrapped is tagged as the verb wrap from the link wrapped nsubjpass Reichstag shown in Figure 1.",
        "(4) Preposition: As described in section 2.3 the system collapses paths that include a preposition.",
        "The subject feature had the most coverage of the base level features and the system identified at least one subject for 789 of the 800 hypotheses sentences in RTE3Devmt.",
        "We wrote heuristics that use the parser tags to identify the subject of the remaining 11 sentences.",
        "The system found subjects for seven of those eight remaining hypothesis sentences (3 were duplicate sentences).",
        "In contrast, the object feature had the least coverage, with the system identifying objects for only 480 of the 800 hypotheses in the RTE3 revised development set",
        "(RTE3Devmt).",
        "In addition to the head noun of a subject, modifying nouns can also be important to recognize entailment.",
        "Consider the underlined section of TSentEG: which was later bought by the Russian state-owned oil company Rosneft.",
        "This sentence would lend support to hypotheses sentences that start with The Baikalfinasgroup was bought by ... and end with any of the following phrases an oil company, a company, Rosneft, the Rosneft Company, the Rosneft oil company, a Russian company, a Russian Oil company, a state-owned company etc.",
        "Our system ensures the detection of these valid entailments by adding noun compounds and all modifiers associated with the subject and object term.",
        "We reviewed previous RTE challenges and a subset of RTE3Devmt sentences before arriving at the following derived features that build on the base level features described in 2.4.",
        "The features that use 'opposite' approximate the difference between passive and active tense.",
        "For each hypothesis sentence, the system records both the number of matches (#match), and the percentage of matches (%match) that are supported by the test sentence(s).",
        "(1) Triple: The system compares the subject-verb-objects in HSent with the corresponding triple in TSent.",
        "(2) Triple Opposite: The system matches the verbs in both HSent and TSent, but matches the subject in HSent with the object in TSent.",
        "(3) Triple Subject Object: This feature approximates the triple in (1) by comparing only the subject and the object in HSent with TSent, but ignoring the verb.",
        "(4) Triple Subject Object Opposite: The system compares the objects in HSent with the subjects in TSent.",
        "(5) Subject Subject: In addition to the triples used in the derived features 1-4, the system stores subject-verb and object-verb pairs.",
        "This feature compares the distinct number of subjects in HSent with those in TSent.",
        "(6) Verb Verb: The system compares only the verb in the subject-verb, object-verb tuples in HSent with those in TSent.",

        "We used both previous RTE challenges and machine learning over the derived features to inform the final decision rules.",
        "For the latter, we chose a decision tree classifier because in addition to classification accuracy, we are also interested in gaining insight into the underlying syntactic features that produce the highest predictive accuracy.",
        "The decision trees shown in Figure 2 were generated using the Oracle Data Miner 10.2.0.2.",
        "Tree (A) suggests that if there is less than a 63.33% similarity between the number of subjects in the hypothesis sentence and the words in any of the test sentences (feature 11), that the hypothesis sentence is not entailed by the test sentence(s).",
        "The NO prediction from this rule would be correct in 71% cases, and assigning NO would apply to 42% of sentences in the development set.",
        "A YES prediction would be correct in 69% of sentences, and a YES prediction would take place in 57% of sentences in the development set.",
        "Tree (B) also suggests that an increase in the number of matches between the subject in the hypothesis sentence and the words used in the test sentence(s) is indicative of an entailment.",

        "At each level of recursion, a decision tree algorithm selects the single feature that best improves performance (in this case, the purity of the resulting leaves, i.e. so that sentences in each leaf have all YES or all NO responses).",
        "Now consider feature 1, where the subject, verb and object triple in the hypothesis sentence matches the corresponding triple in a test sentence.",
        "Even though the predictive accuracy of this feature is high (74.36%), it is unlikely that this feature will provide the best purity because only a small number of sentences (39 in RTE3Devmt) match.",
        "Similarly, a subject-object match has the highest predictive accuracy of any feature in RTE3Devmt (78.79%), but again few sentences (66 in RTE3Devm) match.",
        "We submitted two different decision rules to RTE3 based on thresholds set to optimize performance in RTE3Devmt set.",
        "The thresholds do not consider the source of a sentence, i.e. from information extraction, summarization, information retrieval or question answering activities.",
        "The first decision rule adds the proportion of matches for each of the derived features described in section 2.5 and assigns YES when the total proportion is greater than or equal to a threshold 2.4.",
        "Thus, the first decision rule overly favors sentences where the subject, verb and object match both HSent and TSent because if a sentence pair matches on feature 1, then the system also counts a match for features 3, 4, 5, and 8.",
        "This lack of feature independence is intentional, and consistent with our intuition that feature 1 is a good indicator of entailment.",
        "To arrive at the second decision rule, we considered the features proposed by decision trees with a non-greedy search strategy that favors high quality features even when only a small percentage of sentences match.",
        "The second rule predicts YES under the following conditions: when the subject, verb, and object of HSent match those in any TSent (feature 1), in either order (feature 2) or when the subject and object from the HSent triple match any TSent (feature 3), or when the TSent subject matches >= 80% of the HSent subject terms (feature 5) or when the TSent subject and preposition matches >=70% of those in HSent (feature 10) or when TSent word matches >= 70% of the subject terms in the HSent sentence (feature 11).",
