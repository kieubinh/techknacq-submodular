        "The Third Recognising Textual Entailment Challenge (RTE-3) task consists in developing a system for automatically determining whether or not a hypothesis (H) can be inferred from a text (T), which could be up to a paragraph long.",
        "Our entry to the RTE-3 challenge is a system that takes advantage of Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Landauer and Dumais, 1997).",
        "This numerical method for reducing noise generated by word choices within texts is extensively used for document indexing and word sense disambiguation.",
        "Recently, there have also been efforts to use techniques from LSA to recognise textual entailment (Clarke, 2006; de Marneffe et al., 2006).",
        "However, we argue that these efforts (like most LSA approaches in the past) suffer from an inadequate vector representation for textual contexts as bags of words.",
        "In contrast, we have applied LSA to vector representations of semi-structured text.",
        "Our representation takes into account the grammatical role (i.e. subject, verb or object) a word occurs in.",
        "Within this system report, we describe and discuss our methodology in section 2, our current implementation in section 3, and system results in section 4.",
        "We conclude in section 5 with a discussion of the results obtained and with the presentation of possible steps to improve our system's performance."

        "Our approach addresses the problem of the semantic gap that exists between low level linguistic entities (words) and concepts.",
        "Concepts can be described by means of predicate-argument structures or by a set of alternative natural language realisations.",
        "In this work we use terminology co-occurrence information to identify when different spans of text have common semantic content even if they do not share vocabulary.",
        "To achieve this, we use variable size n-grams to independently model subject, verb and object, and capture semantics derived from grammatical structure.",
        "In order to detect textual entailment we measure the semantic similarity between n-grams in each TH pair.",
        "To align subjects, verbs and objects within H and T, we build the set of all n-grams for T, and do the same for H. Section 3.5 describes this process in more detail.",
        "Our approach is based on the assumption that a word sense can be derived from the textual contexts in which that words occurs.",
        "This assumption was formalised in the Distributional Hypothesis (Harris, 1954).",
        "We implemented a vector space model (Salton et al., 1975) to capture word semantics from linguistic (i.e. grammatical role) and contextual (i.e. frequency) information about each word.",
        "To avoid high matrix sparsity our vector space model uses second order co-occurrence (Widdows, 2004, p. 174).",
        "We assumed that the corpus we generated the vector space model from has a probabilistic word distribution that is characterised by a number of semantic dimensions.",
        "The LSA literature seems to agree that optimal number of dimensions is somewhere between two hundred and one thousand depending on corpus and domain.",
        "As specified by LSA we applied Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) (Berry, 1992) to identify the characteristic semantic dimensions.",
        "The resulting model is a lower dimensional projection of the original model that captures indirect associations between the vectors in the original model.",
        "SVD reduces the noise in word categorisations by producing the best approximation to the original vector space model."

        "The development data set consists of eight hundred TH pairs, half of them positive.",
        "By positive pair we mean a TH pair in which T entails H. All other pairs we call negative.",
        "Each TH pair belongs to a particular sub-task.",
        "Those subtasks are Information Extraction (IE), Information Retrieval (IR), Question Answering (QA) and Summarisation (SUM).",
        "In the current prototype, we ignored annotations about sub-tasks.",
        "The only knowledge source we used in our implementation was a parsed newswire corpus (Reuters News Corpus) (Lewis et al., 2004).",
        "To derive contextual information about the meaning ofwords constituting the SVOs, we analysed the Reuters corpus as explained below.",
        "For parsing the corpus, we used Minipar because of its speed and because its simple dependency triple output format (-t option) contains word stems and the grammatical relations between them.",
        "A simple AWK script was used to convert the parse results into Prolog facts, one file for each sentence.",
        "A straightforward Prolog program then identified SVOs in each of these fact files, appending them to one big structured text file.",
        "Our algorithm currently recognises intransitive, transitive, ditransitive, and predicative clauses.",
        "Intransitive clauses are encoded as SVOs with an empty object slot.",
        "Transitive clauses result in a fully instantiated SVOs.",
        "Ditransitive clauses are encoded as two different SVOs: the first containing subject, verb and direct object; the second triple containing the subject again, an empty verb slot, and the indirect object.",
        "Predicatives (e.g. \"somebody is something\") are encoded just like transitive clauses.",
        "In this first prototype, we only used one word (which could be a multi-word expression) for subject, verb and object slot respectively.",
        "We realise that this approach ignores much information, but given a large corpus, it might not be detrimental to be selective.",
        "To reduce the dimensionality of our vector space model we stem the SVOs using Snowball.",
        "Then, we calculate how many times stems co-occur as subject, verb or object with another stem within the same SVO instance.",
        "To keep track of the grammatical role (i.e. subject, verb, object) of the words we stem them and label the stems with the corresponding role.",
        "From the corpus, we built a model (S, V, O) of the English (news) language consisting of three matrices: S for subjects, V for verbs, and O for objects.",
        "We built the three stem-to-stem matrices from labeled stem co-occurrences within the extracted triples.",
        "The entries to the matrices are the frequencies of the co-occurrence of each labeled stem with itself or with another labeled stem.",
        "In our current prototype, due to technical restrictions explained in Section 3.4, each matrix has 1000 rows and 5000 columns.",
        "Columns of matrix S contain entries for stems labeled as subject, columns of matrix V contain entries for stems labeled as verb, and columns of matrix O contain entries for stems labeled as object.",
        "The frequency entries of each matrix correspond to the set of identically labeled stems with the highest frequency.",
        "Rows of the three matrices contain entries corresponding to the same set of labeled stems.",
        "Those labeled stems are the ones with the highest frequency in the set of all labeled stems.",
        "Of these, 347 stems are labeled as subject, 356 are labeled as verb, and 297 are labeled as object.",
        "Each row entry is the frequency of co-occurrence of two labeled stems within the same triple.",
        "Finally, each column entry is divided by the number of times the labeled stem associated with that column occurs within all triples.",
        "We calculated the Singular Value Decompositions (SVDs) for S, V and O.",
        "Each SVD of a matrix A is defined as a product of three matrices:",
        "SVD is a standard matrix operation which is supported by many programming libraries and computer algebra applications.",
        "The problem is that only very few can handle the large matrices required for real-world LSA.",
        "It is easy to see that the memory required for representing a full matrix of 64 bit floating point values can easily exceed what current hardware offers.",
        "Fortunately, our matrices are sparse, so a library with sparse matrix support should be able to cope.",
        "Unfortunately, these are hard to find outside the Fortran world.",
        "We failed to find any Java library that can perform SVD on sparse matrices.",
        "We finally decided to use svdlibc, a modernised version of SVDPACKC using only the LAS2 algorithm.",
        "In pretests with a matrix derived from a different text corpus (18371 rows x 3469 columns, density 0.73%), it completed the SVD task within ten minutes on typical current hardware.",
        "However, when we try to use it for this task on a matrix S of dimension 5000 x 5000 (density 1.4%), SVDLIBC did not terminate.",
        "In theory, there is a Singular Value Decomposition for every given matrix, so we assume this is an implementation flaw in either SVDLIBC or GCC.",
        "With no time left to try Fortran alternatives, we resorted to reducing the size of our three matrices to 1000 x 5000, thus losing much information in our language model.",
        "Our Minipar triple extraction algorithm is not able to handle SVOs that are embedded within other SVOs (as e.g. in \"Our children play a new game that involves three teams competing for a ball.\").",
        "Therefore, in order to determine if SVOs displayed in H are semantically similar to any of those displayed in T, we generate all n-grams of all lengths for each T and H: one set for subjects, one for verbs and another one for objects.",
        "Example: \"The boy played tennis.\"",
        "Derived n-grams: the; the boy; the boy played; the boy played tennis; boy; boy played; boy played tennis; played; played tennis; tennis.",
        "We use n-grams to model subjects, verbs and objects of SVOs within T and H.",
        "We generate three vector representations for each n-gram.",
        "To do this, we add up columns from the Reuters Corpus derived matrices.",
        "To build the first vector representation, we use the S matrix, to build the second vector we use the V matrix, and to build the third vector we use the O matrix.",
        "Each of the three representations is the result of adding the columns corresponding to each stem within the n-gram.",
        "To calculate the semantic similarity between n-grams, we fold the three vector representations of each n-gram into one of the dimensionally reduced matrices S200, V200 or O200.",
        "Vector representation originating from the S matrix are folded into S200.",
        "We proceed analogously for vector representations originating from V200 and O200.",
        "We apply equation 2 to fold vectors from Gr where r G {S, V, O}.",
        "G is a matrix which consists of all the vector representations of all the n-grams modeling T or H. S2r00 and U2r00 are SVD results reduced to 200 dimensions.",
        "For each TH pair we calculate the dot product between the G matrices for H and T as expressed in equation 3",
        "The resulting matrix Or contains the dot product similarity between all pairs of n-grams within the same set.",
        "Finally, for each TH pair we obtain three similarity values s, v, o by selecting the entry of Orwith the highest value.",
        "Now we have calculated almost everything we need to venture a guess about textual entailment.",
        "For each TH pair, we have three scores s, v, o for for subject, verb and object slot respectively.",
        "The remaining task is to combine them in a meaningful way in order to make a decision.",
        "This requires some amount of training which in the current prototype is as simple as computing six average values: sp, vsp, osp are the average scores of subject, verb and object slots over those TH pairs for which textual entailment is known to hold.",
        "Conversely, sn, Vn, onare the averages for those pairs that do not stand in a textual entailment relation.",
        "The (rounded) values were determined are shown in table 1.",
        "Note that the average values for non-entailment are always lower than the average values for entailment, which indicates that our system indeed tends to discriminate correctly between these cases.",
        "The very low values for the verb similarities (figure 3) compared to subject similarities (figure 1) and object similarities (figure 2) remind us that before we can combine slot scores, they should be scaled to a comparable level.",
        "This is achieved by dividing each slot score by its corresponding average.",
