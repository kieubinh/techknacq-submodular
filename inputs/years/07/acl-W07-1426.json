        "Textual entailment is a relation between two text snippets in which the meaning of one snippet, called the hypothesis (H), can be inferred from the other snippet, called the text (T).",

        "T: A bus collision with a truck in Uganda has resulted in at least 30 fatalities and has left a further 21 injured.",
        "H: 30 die in a bus collision in Uganda.",
        "Given such a pair, a recognizing textual entailment (RTE) system should output its judgement about whether or not an entailment relation holds between them.",
        "For the above example pair, H is entailed by T.",
        "The PASCAL Recognizing Textual Entailment Challenge is an annual challenge on this task which has been held since 2005 (Dagan et al., 2006; Bar-Haim et al.",
        "2006).",
        "As textual entailment recognition is thought to be a common underlying semantic inference task for many natural language processing applications, such as Information Extraction (IE), Information Retrieval (IR), Question Answering (QA), and Document Summarization (SUM), the PASCAL RTE Challenge has been gaining more and more attention in the NLP community.",
        "In the past challenges, various approaches to recognizing textual entailment have been proposed, from syntactic analysis to logical inference (Bar-Haim et al.",
        "2006).",
        "As a new participant, we have two goals by attending the RTE-3 Challenge: first, we would like to explore how state-of-the-art language techniques help to deal with this semantic inference problem; second, we try to obtain a more thorough knowledge of this research and its state-of-the-art.",
        "Inspired by the success of machine learning techniques in RTE-2, we employ the same strategy in our RTE-3 system.",
        "Several lexical, syntactical, and semantical language analysis techniques are explored to derive effective features for determining textual entailment relation.",
        "Then, a general machine learning algorithm is applied on the transformed data for training and prediction.",

        "At the second stage, a machine learning algorithm is applied to obtain an inference/prediction model when training or output its decision when predicting.",
        "In the language processing module, we try to analyze TH pairs with the state-of-the-art NLP techniques, including lexical, syntactical, and semantical analyses.",
        "We first split text into sentences, and tag the Part of Speech (POS) of each word.",
        "The text with POS information is then fed into three separate modules: a named entities recognizer, a word sense disambiguation (WSD) module, and a dependency parser.",
        "These language analyzers output their own intermediate representations for the feature extraction module.",

        "This package provides many different semantic relatedness measures.",
        "In our system, we use the Lesk relatedness measure for function SSim, as it can be used to make comparisons between concepts of different parts of speech (POS) (Baner-jee&Pedersen, 2002).",
        "Because the value of SSim may be larger than 1, we normalize the original value from the WordNet::Similarity package to guarantee it fall between 0 and 1.",
        "POS Tagging",
        "For the words out of WordNet, e.g. new proper nouns, we use the following strategy: if two words match exactly, the similarity between them is 1; otherwise, the similarity is 0.",
        "It needs to be pointed out that Equation (1) is a variant of the text semantic similarity proposed in (Mihalcea et al.",
        "2006).",
        "However, in Equation (1), we take into account out of vocabulary words and normalization for some word-to-word similarity metrics that may be larger than 1.",
        "In addition, we use an IDF dictionary from MEAD (Radev et al.",
        "2001; http://www.summari-zation.com/mead/) for retrieving the IDF value for each word.",
        "For the words out of the IDF dictionary, we assign a default value 3.0.",
        "Named Entities are important semantic information carriers, which convey more specific information than individual component words.",
        "Intuitively, we can assume that all named entities in a hypothesis would appear in a textual snippet which entails the hypothesis.",
        "Otherwise, it is very likely that the entailment relation in a TH pair doesn't hold.",

        "We use the English analysis tool OAK (Sekine 2002) to recognize named entities in textual snippets.",
        "With the NE feature, we can capture some local dependency relations between words, but we may miss many dependency relations expressed in a long distance.",
        "These missed long distance dependency relations may be helpful for determining whether entailment holds between H and T. So, we design a DEP feature as follows:",
        "Function DEP_S derives the set of dependent content word pairs from a textual snippet.",
        "We require that the two content words of each pair should be dependent directly or linked with at most one function word.",
        "We use C&C parser (Clark and Curran 2004) to parse the dependency structure of a textual snippet and then derive the dependent content word pairs.",
        "We don't consider the type of dependency relation between two linked words.",
        "The DIST feature measures the distance between unmapped tokens in the text.",
        "Adams (2006) uses a simple count of the number of unmapped tokens in the text that occur between two mapped tokens, scaled to the length of the hypothesis.",
        "Our system uses a different approach, i.e. measuring the average length of the gaps between mapped tokens.",
        "The number of tokens in the text between each consecutive pair of mapped tokens is summed up, and this sum is divided by the number of gaps (equivalent to the number of tokens - 1).",
        "In this formula, consecutive mapped tokens in the text count as gaps of 0, so a prevalence of consecutive mapped tokens lowers the value for this feature.",
        "The purpose of this approach is to reduce the effect of long appositives, which may not be mapped to the hypothesis but should not rule out entailment.",
        "The Negation feature is very simple.",
        "We simply count the occurrences of negative words from a list in both the hypothesis (nh) and the text (nt).",
        "The list includes some common negating affixes.",
        "Then the value is:",

        "It is interesting to note that some features improve the score in some combinations, but in others they decrease it.",
        "For instance, although DEP scores above the baseline at 0.5663, when added to the combination of LSS, NE, TK, and LEN it lowers the overall accuracy by 1.5%.",
        "As we mentioned in section 4.2, Average Precision (AvgP) is expected to evaluate the ranking ability of a system according to confidence values.",
        "However, we found that the current evaluation process and the measure itself have some problems and need to be modified for RTE evaluation.",
        "On one hand, the current evaluation process doesn't consider tied cases where many pairs may have the same confidence value.",
        "It is reasonable to assume that the order of tied pairs will be random.",
        "Accordingly, the derived Average Precision will vary.",
        "Let's look at a simple example: suppose we have two pairs c and d, and c is the only one positive entailment pair.",
        "Here, R=1, N=2 for Equation (3).",
        "Two systems X and Y output ranked results as {c, d} and {d,c} respectively.",
        "According to Equation (3), the AvgP value of system X is 1, where that of system Y is 0.5.",
        "If these two systems assign same confidence value for both pairs, we can not conclude that system X is better than system Y.",
        "To avoid this problem, we suggest requiring that each system for ranked submission output its confidence for each pair.",
        "Then, when calculating Average Precision measure, we first re-rank the list with these confidence values and true answers for each pair.",
        "For tied pairs, we rank pairs with true answer \"NO\" before those with positive entailment relation.",
        "By this way, we can produce a stable and more reasonable Average Precision value.",
        "For example, in the above example, the modified average precisions for both systems will be 0.5.",
        "On the other hand, from the Equation (3), we know that the upper bound of Average Precision is 1.",
        "At the same time, we can also derive a lower bound for this measure as in Equation (4).",
        "It corresponds to the worst system which places all the negative pairs before all the positive pairs.",
        "The lower bound of Average Precision for RTE-3 test dataset is 0.3172.",
        "As the values of N and R change, the lower bound of Average Precision will vary.",
        "Therefore, the original Average Precision measure as in Equation (3) is not an ideal one for comparison across datasets.",
        "To solve this problem, we propose a normalized Average Precision measure as in Equation (5)."
