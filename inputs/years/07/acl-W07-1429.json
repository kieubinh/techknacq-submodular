        "Sentence Compression can be seen as the removal of redundant words or phrases from an input sentence by creating a new sentence in which the gist of the original meaning of the sentence remains unchanged.",
        "Sentence Compression takes an important place for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks where specific constraints must be satisfied, such as length in summarization (Barzilay & Lee, 2002; Knight & Marcu, 2002; Shinyama et al., 2002; Barzilay & Lee, 2003; Le Nguyen & Ho, 2004; Unno et al., 2006), style in text simplification (Marsi & Krahmer, 2005) or sentence simplification for subtitling (Daelemans et al., 2004).",
        "Generally, Sentence Compression involves performing the following three steps: (1) Extraction of paraphrases from comparable corpora, (2) Alignment of paraphrases and (3) Induction of rewriting rules.",
        "Obviously, each of these steps can be performed in many different ways going from totally unsupervised to totally supervised.",
        "In this paper, we will focus on the first two steps.",

        "Two different approaches have been proposed for Sentence Compression: purely statistical methodologies (Barzilay & Lee, 2003; Le Nguyen & Ho, 2004) and hybrid linguistic/statistic methodologies",
        "Unno et al., 2006).",
        "As our work is based on the first paradigm, we will focus on the works proposed by (Barzilay &",
        "Lee, 2003) and (Le Nguyen & Ho, 2004).",
        "(Barzilay & Lee, 2003) present a knowledge-lean algorithm that uses multiple-sequence alignment to learn generate sentence-level paraphrases essentially from unannotated corpus data alone.",
        "In contrast to (Barzilay & Lee, 2002), they need neither parallel data nor explicit information about sentence semantics.",
        "Rather, they use two comparable corpora.",
        "Their approach has three main steps.",
        "First, working on each of the comparable corpora separately, they compute lattices compact graph-based representations to find commonalities within groups of structurally similar sentences.",
        "Next, they identify pairs of lattices from the two different corpora that are paraphrases of each other.",
        "Finally, given an input sentence to be paraphrased, they match it to a lattice and use a paraphrase from the matched lattices mate to generate an output sentence.",
        "(Le Nguyen & Ho, 2004) propose a new sentence-reduction algorithm that do not use syntactic parsing for the input sentence.",
        "The algorithm is an extension of the template-translation algorithm (one of example-based machine-translation methods) via innovative employment of the Hidden Markov model, which uses the set of template rules learned from examples.",
        "In particular, (Le Nguyen & Ho, 2004) do not propose any methodology to automatically extract paraphrases.",
        "Instead, they collect a corpus by performing the decomposition program using news and their summaries.",
        "After correcting them manually, they obtain more than 1,500 pairs of long and reduced sentences.",
        "Comparatively, (Barzilay & Lee, 2003) propose to use the N-gram Overlap metric to capture similarities between sentences and automatically create paraphrase corpora.",
        "However, this choice is arbitrary and mainly leads to the extraction of quasi-exact or exact matching pairs.",
        "For that purpose, we introduce a new metric, the Sumo-Metric.",
        "Unlike (Le Nguyen & Ho, 2004), one interesting idea proposed by (Barzilay & Lee, 2003) is to cluster similar pairs of paraphrases to apply multiple-sequence alignment.",
        "However, once again, this choice is not justified and we will see by classical visualization methodologies (Kruskal & Wish, 1977) and exhaustive experiments by applying different clustering algorithms, that clustering may not be the best approach for automatic pattern identification.",
        "As a consequence, we will study global and local biology based sequence alignments compared to multi-sequence alignment that may lead to better results for the induction of rewriting rules."

      "text": [
        "Paraphrase corpora are golden resources for learning monolingual text-to-text rewritten patterns.",
        "However, such corpora are expensive to construct manually and will always be an imperfect and biased representation of the language paraphrase phenomena.",
        "Therefore, reliable automatic methodologies able to extract paraphrases from text and subsequently corpus construction are crucial, enabling better pattern identification.",
        "In fact, text-to-text generation is a particularly promising research direction given that there are naturally occurring examples of comparable texts that convey the same information but are written in different styles.",
        "Web news stories are an obvious example.",
        "Thus, presented with such texts, one can pair sentences that convey the same information, thereby building a training set of rewriting examples i.e. a paraphrase corpus.",
        "A few unsupervised metrics have been applied to automatic paraphrase identification and extraction (Barzilay & Lee, 2003; Dolan & Brockett, 2004).",
        "However, these unsupervised methodologies show a major drawback by extracting quasi-exact or even exact match pairs of sentences as they rely on classical string similarity measures such as the Edit Distance in the case of (Dolan & Brockett, 2004) and word N-gram overlap for (Barzilay & Lee, 2003).",
        "Such pairs are clearly useless.",
        "More recently, (Anonymous, 2007) proposed a new metric, the Sumo-Metric specially designed for asymmetrical entailed pairs identification, and proved better performance over previous established metrics, even in the specific case when tested with the Microsoft Paraphrase Research Corpus (Dolan & Brockett, 2004).",
        "For a given sentence pair, having each sentence x and y words, and with X exclusive links between the sentences, the Sumo-Metric is defined in Equation 1 and 2.",
        "e-k*s(x,y,x) otherwise",
        "with a, 3 e [0,1] and a + 3 = 1.",
        "(Anonymous, 2007) show that the Sumo-Metric outperforms all state-of-the-art metrics over all tested corpora.",
        "In particular, it shows systematically better F-Measure and Accuracy measures over all other metrics showing an improvement of (1) at least 2.86% in terms of F-Measure and 3.96% in terms of Accuracy and (2) at most 6.61% in terms of F-Measure and 6.74% in terms of Accuracy compared to the second best metric which is also systematically the word N-gram overlap similarity measure used by (Barzilay & Lee, 2003).",
        "Literature shows that there are two main reasons to apply clustering for paraphrase extraction.",
        "On one hand, as (Barzilay & Lee, 2003) evidence, clusters of paraphrases can lead to better learning of text-to-text rewriting rules compared to just pairs of paraphrases.",
        "On the other hand, clustering algorithms may lead to better performance than standalone similarity measures as they may take advantage of the different structures of sentences in the cluster to detect a new similar sentence.",
        "However, as (Barzilay & Lee, 2003) do not propose any evaluation of which clustering algorithm should be used, we experiment a set of clustering algorithms and present the comparative results.",
        "Contrarily to what expected, we will see that clustering is not a worthy effort.",
        "Instead of extracting only sentence pairs from corpora, one may consider the extraction of paraphrase sentence clusters.",
        "There are many well-known clustering algorithms, which may be applied to a corpus sentence set S = {si,...,sn}.",
        "Clustering implies the definition of a similarity or (distance) matrix Anxn, where each each element aij is the similarity (distance) between sentences si and Sj.",
        "We experimented four clustering algorithms on a corpus of web news stories and then three human judges manually cross-classified a random sample of the generated clusters.",

        "The \"QT\" column shows the Quality Threshold algorithm (Heyer et al., 1999) and the last column \"EM\" is the Expectation Maximization clustering algorithm (Hogg et al., 2005).",
        "One main conclusion, from table 1 is that clustering tends to achieve worst results than simple paraphrase pair extraction.",
        "Only the QT achieves better results, but if we take the average of the four clustering algorithms it is equal to 0.568, smaller than the 0.618 baseline.",
        "Moreover, these results with the QT algorithm were applied with a very restrictive value for cluster attribution as it is shown in table 2 with an average of almost two sentences per cluster.",
        "In fact, table 2 shows that most of the clusters have less than 6 sentences which leads to question the results presented by (Barzilay & Lee, 2003) who only keep the clusters that contain more than 10 sentences.",
        "In fact, the first conclusion is that the number of experimented clusters is very low, and more important, all clusters with more than 10 sentences showed to be of very bad quality.",

        "We perform the MDS process on 500 sentencesrandomly selected from the Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus.",
        "In particular, the projection over the three first eigenvectors (or proper vectors) provides the best visualization where data are clearly organized into several classes (at least two classes).",
        "The obtained visualizations (Figure 1) show distinctly that no particular data organization can be drawn from the used similarity measures.",

        "In our work, we employ alignment methods for aligning words between two sentences, which are paraphrases.",
        "The words are the base blocks of our sequences (sentences).",

        "In the first one, the algorithms try to fully align both sequences, admitting gap insertions at a certain cost, while in the local methods the goal is to find pairwise sub-alignments.",
        "How suitable each algorithm may be applied to a certain problem is discussed in the next two subsections.",
        "The well established and widely used Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for pairwise global sequence alignment, uses dynamic programming to find the best possible alignment between two sequences.",

        "Therefore, a huge optimization effort were engaged and new algorithms appeared like k-tuple, not guaranteeing to find optimal alignments but able to tackle the complexity problem.",
        "In our alignment tasks, we do not have these complexity obstacles, because in our corpora the mean length of a sentence is equal to 20.9 words, which is considerably smaller than in a DNA sequence.",
        "Therefore an implementation of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm has been used to generate optimal global alignments.",
        "The figure 2 exemplifies a global word alignment on a paraphrase pair.",
        "The Smith-Waterman (SW) algorithm is similar to the Needleman Wunsch (NW) one, since dynamic programming is also followed hence denoting the similar complexity issues, to which our alignment task is immune.",
        "The main difference is that SW seeks optimal sub-alignments instead of a global alignment and, as described in the literature, it is well tailored for pairs with considerable differences, in length and type.",
