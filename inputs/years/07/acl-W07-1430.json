        "Nevertheless, as (Hobbs, 1985) and others have argued, semantic representations for natural language need not be higher-order in that ontological promiscuity can solve the problem.",
        "That is, by reifying all objects that can be predicated of, it is possible to retain a semantic representation scheme for NL that is first-order.",
        "This observation is crucial for computational applications for two reasons.",
        "First, logics that goes beyond first order are highly undecidable.",
        "Second and more importantly, there is no off the shelf higher order automated reasoners that could be put to use to reason about the meaning of higher-order formulae.",
        "In this paper, we present a semantics for adjectives that adopts an ontologically promiscuous approach and thereby supports first order inference for all types of adjectives including extensional ones.",
        "Indeed, traditional semantic classifications of adjectives such as (Chierchia and Connell-Ginet, 1990; Kamp, 1975; Kamp and Partee, 1995) subdivide adjectives into two classes namely extensional vs. intensional adjectives, the latter grouping together adjectives which intuitively denote functions from properties to properties, i.e. second order objects.",
        "We present a compositional semantics for adjectives which both (i) defines a first order representation and (ii) integrates interactions with other sources of linguistic information such as lexical semantics and morpho-derivational relations.",
        "We then show that the proposed semantics correctly predicts the inferential patterns observed to hold of the various adjective subclasses identified in the literature (Chierchia and Connell-Ginet, 1990; Kamp, 1975; Kamp and Partee, 1995; Amoia and Gardent, 2006).",
        "This paper is structured as follows.",
        "We start by presenting a classification of adjectives which is motivated by the different inferential patterns observed.",
        "We then propose a compositional semantics for each class and show that it correctly predicts their inferential behaviour.",

        "Depending on the adjective type, the properties denoted by Adj and N will contribute either directly or indirectly to the meaning of the [Adj N]ap phrase.",
        "Thus in an intersective [Adj N]ap phrase, the meaning contributed by Adj and N are simply the properties they denote.",
        "By contrast, the privative fake forces the negation of the N property to be part of the Adj N meaning whilst the subsective gastronomical induces a relation to the morphoderivationally related noun concept (about gastronomy) to be included in the the Adj N meaning.",
        "More generally, the properties that compose the meaning of the Adj N phrase can be the denotation of Adj and/or N, the negation of N, its denotation in the past or some property derived from it.",

        "In all cases the [Adj N]apphrase denotes a set of individuals but whilst in most cases the [Adj N]ap phrase is neutral with respect to the existence in the real world of these individuals, plain non-subsective [Adj N]ap phrases (e.g. alleged murderer) explicitly question it (an alleged murderer may or not exist in the real world).",
        "In designing a semantics for adjectives, we assume a semantics for nouns which reflect their possible interactions with the different types of adjectives",
        "As we shall shortly see, the additional lambda variable e is imposed by the treatment of adjective semantics we propose and more specifically by the necessity to sometimes distinguish between the individual described by the noun and the individual described by the adjective.",

        "This accounts for the first observation according to which an [Adj N]apphrase may refer to either one or two individuals.",
        "Second, the meaning of the [Adj N]ap phrase is a function not of the Adj and N meaning but rather of properties derived from these meanings (A' for Adj and N, as modified by its three arguments, for N).",
        "This accounts for the second observation.",
        "Third, the use of the exists predicate will permit distinguishing between existence in the universe of discourse and existence in the real world.",

        "The semantic representation of an [Adj N]ap adjectival phrase involving an intersective adjective is given in Figure 2 together with the derivation of the [Adj N]ap phrase red table.",
        "As can be seen, in this case, the relation Ri holding between the lambda bound variable x and the entity introduced by the adjective is one of identity.",
        "Similarly, the entity e introduced is equated with x and the relation R2is Xx,y.true (i.e. there is no modifying relation between ea and en).",

        "As recalled above, subsective adjectives are characterised by the fact that the [Adj N]ap phrase entails N but not A. Relatedly, the adjective phrase introduces not one but two individuals, one linked to the adjective and the other to the noun.",
        "For instance, the phrase the gastronomical book refers to a book x which is about the gastronomy concept en.",
        "Thus in such cases, we take the R2 relation holding between x, the NP quantified variable, and ea, the entity introduced by the adjective, to be distinct from identity, while the Ri relation is empty.",
        "This ensures that the NP refers to two entities, one bound by the determiner and licenced by N, the other existentially quantified and licensed by A.",
        "For instance, the sentence John read every gastronomical books is interpreted as meaning that John read all books that are about gastronomy.",

        "Because of space restrictions, we only show here how to represent two of these subclasses namely denominal (e.g. gastronomical) and measure subsective adjectives (e.g. big).",
        "In both cases, the idea is to decompose the meaning of the adjectives into a finer grained lexical meaning.",

        "In this case, C would be, e.g. \"mouse\" so that the formula above can be glossed as x is a mouse with a size ea which is high for a mouse.",
        "In particular, Daisy is a big mouse entails that Daisy is a mouse and that Daisy is big for a mouse, but not that Daisy is big.",
        "As seen above, privative adjectives entail that the entity described by the NP is not N, e.g. a fake gun is not a gun.",

        "As shown in Figure 4, this is accounted for by providing the appropriate relation R (e.g. R2 being the relation time introduced by former or Ri being the identity relation x = ea introduced by fake).",
        "This representation presupposes that each sentence in which such modality adjectives do not occur has a default value for time and/or modality.",

        "To account for this fact, we follow Hobbs' approach in distinguishing between existence in the universe of discourse and existence in the real world.",
        "Thus, the logical existential connective 3 is used to denote existence in the discourse world while the special predicate Exists is used to denote existence in the real world.",
        "We assume further a theory that permits determining when an individual exists in the universe of discourse and when it exists in the real world.",
        "Given these caveats, the semantics of plain non-subsective adjectives is as indicated in Figure 5 and simply specifies that the alleged murderer is an individual x which exists in the universe of discourse (but not necessarily in the real world) and which is alleged to be a murderer.",
        "Moreover, as stated in (Hobbs, 1985), we assume that the alleged predicate is existentially opaque in its second argument.",

        "First, previous work (Amoia and Gardent, 2006) has shown that the classification presented here can be further detailed and even finer-grained classes identified thereby permitting the creation of syntactically and semantically homogeneous adjectival classes.",
        "The advantages of identifying such homogeneous classes has been well demonstrated for verbs.",
        "It permits structuring the lexicon and facilitates development and maintenance.",
        "Based on the idea that syntax (and in particular, so-called syntactic alternations) helps define such classes, we are currently investigating in how far adjectival syntax helps further refine adjectival classes.",
        "Second, the proposed classification need to be applied and combined with ontological and lexical semantic information.",
        "That is, each adjective should be classified wrt the 4 types of model theoretic semantics described here and related to such a lexical semantics ontology as e.g., WordNet, the MikroKosmos ontology of the SIMPLE lexicon.",
        "Thus (Raskin and Nirenburg, 1995) describe the methodology used to encode adjectival entries in the lexicon of the MikroKosmos semantic analyser.",
        "The MikroKosmos lexicon contains 6,000 entries for English and 1,500 entries for Spanish adjectives.",
        "Adjectives are organised in an ontology which distinguishes between the following three main adjectival classes: (i) Scalar Adjectives, which are represented as property-value pairs, (ii) Denominal Adjectives, (e.g. atomic, civil, gastronomical) represented as nouns and (iii) Deverbal Adjectives,(e.g. eager, abusive, readable) isre-lated to the meaning of the verb they are derived to.",
        "The classification of adjectives proposed in SIMPLE (SIMPLE, 2000) is also ontology-based.",
        "A lexical entry for an adjective is characterised by a set of semantic and syntactic information.",
        "Semantic information describes: (i) the hierarchy of ontological properties expressed by the particular adjective, for example the adjective expresses the property of COLOUR and this is a physical property; (ii) whether the adjective is intersective or subsective; (iii) whether the adjective has a persistent duration (i.e. is stable) or not.",
        "Moreover, syntactic information describes adjectival features such as (i) predicative/attributive usage, and (ii) gradability.",
        "SIMPLE has actually added semantic information to approximately 3,500 lexical entries (about 10,000 senses) for each of the 12 European languages considered in the project.",
        "It would be interesting to see whether any ofthese resources can be used to create an adjective lexicon rich enough to support both syntactic processing and semantic inference.",
        "Finally, a third point of interest concerns the integration of the compositional semantics proposed here for adjectives into a robust semantic processing system.",
        "We plan to integrate this semantics into the CCG2Sem semantic parsing system (Bos, 2005) and to investigate in how far, this would help deal with entailment recognition."
