        "The last five years have seen a surge of interest in the problem of textual inference, that is, automatically determining whether a natural-language hypothesis can be inferred from a given premise.",
        "A broad spectrum of approaches have been explored, ranging from shallow-but-robust to deep-but-brittle.",
        "Up to now, the most successful approaches have used fairly impoverished semantic representations, relying on measures of lexical or semantic overlap (Jijkoun and de Rijke, 2005), pattern-based relation extraction (Romano et al., 2006), or approximate matching of predicate-argument structure (Hickl et al., 2006).",
        "Such methods, while robust and broadly effective, are imprecise, and are easily confounded by ubiquituous inferences involving monotonicity, particularly in negative polarity contexts, as in: P: No case of indigenously acquired rabies infection has been confirmed in the past 2 years.",
        "H: No rabies cases have been confirmed.",
        "Because it drops important qualifiers in a negative context, the hypothesis does not follow; yet both the lexical content and the predicate-argument structure of the hypothesis closely match the premise.",
        "At the other extreme, textual inference can be approached as deduction, building on work in formal computational semantics to translate sentences into first-order logic (FOL), and then applying a theorem prover or a model builder (Akhmatova, 2005; Fowler et al., 2005).",
        "However, such approaches tend to founder on the difficulty of accurately translating natural language in FOL – tricky issues include idioms, intensionality and propositional attitudes, modalities, temporal and causal relations, certain quantifiers, and so on.",
        "FOL-based systems that have attained high precision (Bos and Markert, 2006) have done so at the cost of very poor recall.",
        "In this work, we explore a different point on the spectrum, by developing a computational model of natural logic, that is, a logic whose vehicle of inference is natural language.",
        "Natural logic eschews logical notation and model theory.",
        "Its proofs proceed by incremental edits to expressions of natural language, and its inference rules specify conditions under which semantic expansions or contractions preserve truth.",
        "It thus permits us to do precise reasoning about monotonicity, while sidestepping the difficulties of translating sentences into FOL.",
        "It should be emphasized that there are many important kinds of inference which are not addressed by a natural logic system, including temporal reasoning, causal reasoning (Khan sold nuclear plans => Khan possessed nuclear plans), paraphrase (McEwan flew to Rome => McEwan took a flight to Rome), relation extraction (Bill Gates and his wife, Melinda... => Melinda Gates is married to Bill Gates), etc.",
        "Moreover, a natural logic system will struggle with inferences requiring modelbuilding or deep proof search, which are more suitable for formal deduction systems.",
        "However, the applicability of natural logic is broader than it might at first appear, and a natural logic system can be designed to integrate with other kinds of reasoners."

        "Natural logic aims to explain inferences involving monotonicity, in which the concepts or constraints expressed are expanded or contracted.",
        "Consider, for example, the sentence Every meal without wine is a terrible crime.",
        "Some semantic elements can be expanded (but not contracted) salva veritate, and are therefore said to have positive polarity: wine may be broadened to drink, terrible crime may be relaxed to crime, or every may be weakened to some.",
        "Other elements can only be contracted (not expanded) salva veritate, and thus have negative polarity: meal can be narrowed to dinner.",
        "The monotonicity calculus developed in (Sanchez Valencia, 1991) explains these polarity effects by (1) defining an entailment relation over multifarious expressions of natural language, (2) defining monotonicity properties of semantic functions, and finally (3) specifying how monotonicities combine during Fregean composition of semantic functions.",
        "The entailment relation.",
        "Most work in textual inference reflects a simple concept of entailment: one sentence entails another, or does not.",
        "In natural logic, however, entailment is a semantic containment relation (analogous to the set containment relation C) over expressions of all types, including words and phrases as well as sentences.",
        "We define the entailment relation C recursively over the semantic types familiar from Montague semantics.",
        "If c and d are of type t (truth values), then c C d iff c – d. If c and d are of type e (entities), then c C d iff c = d. Finally, if c and d are of functional type",
        "(a,//), then c C d iff for all a e a, c(a) C d(a).",
        "Otherwise, if c C d and d C c, we write c # d.",
        "Using these formal definitions, we can establish entailment relations between common nouns (penguin C bird), common and proper adjectives (tiny C small, French C European), transitive and intransitive verbs (kick C strike, hover C fly), temporal and locative modifiers (this morning C today, in Beijing C in China), connectives (and C or), and quantifiers (everyone C someone, all C most C some).Among noun phrases, we have everyone C Einstein C some physicist.",
        "Finally, observe that dropping a modifier generally yields entailment (eat quickly C eat) though this heuristic can be violated, e.g., by operator adjectives (fake vaccine C vaccine).",
        "Monotonicity.",
        "Under the Fregean hypothesis, the meaning of a compound expression is the result of function application.",
        "In semantics as in mathematics, we can describe a function as upward monotone if \"larger\" inputs yield larger outputs.",
        "Formally, given a function f of functional type (a, //):",
        "• f is upward-monotone (j) iff for all x, y e a, x C y entails f (x) C f (y).",
        "• f is downward-monotone (j) iff for all x, y e a, x C y entails f(y) C f(x).",
        "• f is non-monotone (jj.)",
        "iff it is neither upward-nor downward-monotone.",
        "Most linguistic expressions may be regarded as upward-monotone semantic functions.",
        "Thus tango in Paris C dance in France, since tango C dance and in Paris C in France.",
        "However, a number of important linguistic constructions are downward-monotone, including negation (not), restrictive quantifiers (no, few, at most n), restrictive verbs (lack, fail, prohibit), certain adverbs (without, except), the antecedent of a conditional, and so on.",
        "We thus have didn't dance C didn't tango, few athletes C few sprinters, lack weapons C lack guns, without clothes C without pants, and If stocks rise, we win C If stocks soar, we win.",
        "Finally, a few expressions must be considered non-monotone, including superlative adjectives and quantifiers such as most.",
        "Thus prettiest butterfly # prettiest insect and most boats # most vehicles.",
        "Note that certain generalized quantifiers must be treated as binary functions having different monotonicities in different arguments.",
        "Thus every is downward-monotone in its first argument (every fish swims C every shark swims) but upward-monotone in its second argument (every shark swims C every shark moves).",
        "Composition of monotonicity.",
        "Finally, we must specify how monotonicities combine during Fregean composition of semantic functions.",
        "In Sanchez Valencia's marking algorithm, we represent each input expression as a parse in the Lambek categorial grammar.",
        "We then (1) mark leaf nodes with appropriate lexical monotonicity values, (2) project monotonic-ities to internal nodes representing function applications, and finally (3) compose monotonicities along the path from the root to each leaf in order to determine effective polarities.",
        "The composition of monotonicities is straightforward.",
        "Suppose h = f o g. If either f or g is non-monotone, then so is h. Otherwise, if the monotonicities of f and g are the same, then h is upward-monotone; if they are different, then h is downward-monotone.",

        "Relative to other textual inference systems, the Nat-Log system does comparatively little linguistic preprocessing.",

        "Unlike the categorial grammar parses assumed by Sanchez Valencia, the nesting of constituents in phrase-structure parses does not always correspond to the composition of semantic functions, which introduces a number of complications.",
        "We define a list of downward-monotone and non-monotone expressions, and for each item we specify its arity and a Tregex pattern (Levy and Andrew, 2006) which permits us to identify its occurrences.",
        "We also specify, for each argument, both the monotonicity and another Tregex pattern which helps us to determine the sentence span over which the monotonicity is projected.",
        "(Figure 1 shows some example definitions.)",
        "The marking process computes these projections, performs monotonicity composition where needed, and marks each token span with its final effective monotonicity.",
        "The second stage of processing establishes an alignment between the premise and the hypothesis.",
        "While there are many notions of alignment, in this work we have chosen to represent alignments as sequences of atomic edits over spans of word tokens.",
        "We define four types of atomic edits: deletion of a span from the premise, insertion of a span into the hypothesis, substitution of a hypothesis span for a premise span, and advance over a span without modification.",
        "Each atomic edit is parameterized by the token indices at which it operates.",
        "As an example, the first problem in table 3 may be aligned using following edits:",
        "Clearly, this representation imposes certain limitations: there is no atomic edit type representing the movement of a token span from one sentence location to another (instead a combination of deletion and insertion must be used), and there can be no alignments to non-contiguous sets of tokens.",
        "However, the span edit representation also offers important benefits.",
        "First, there is always a well-defined sequence of intermediate forms through which the sentence progresses during editing, which is important for the computation of monotonicity features.",
        "Second, given a cost function over edits, it is possible to construct an efficient dynamic program to find the lowest-cost edit sequence between any pair of sentences, using a straightforward extension of the Levenshtein string-edit algorithm.",
        "For this purpose, we have designed a cost function which prefers edits which operate on longer spans; penalizes edits operating on spans which are not parse-tree constituents; imposes nomimal cost on substitutions of words having the same lemma; and imposes little cost on certain \"light\" edits, involving prepositions, articles, auxiliaries, etc.",
        "When applied to problems like those in the FraCaS test suite (section 4), this cost model gives intuitively pleasing results.",
        "However, because our focus in this work is on entailment, we have not devoted much energy to optimizing our alignment model, and will not discuss it further.",
        "(For the RTE experiments described in section 5, we use alignments derived from an independent RTE system.",
        "Translating those alignments into the span edit representation requires relaxing some of its constraints, as we'll explain.)",
        "The edit sequence obtained during the alignment stage effectively decomposes the global entailment problem into a sequence of atomic entailment problems, one for each atomic edit.",

        "We then compose our atomic entailment predictions to produce a global entailment prediction.",
        "The atomic entailment model uses a classifier to predict one of five elementary entailment relations (table 1) for each atomic edit.",
        "This model uses a feature representation designed to capture characteristics of the edit pertinent to a natural logic analysis: the type of the edit (DEL, INS, or SUB), the effective monotonicity at the affected token span (j, j, or jj), and various lexical features of the affected tokens.",
        "In the case of a SUB edit, the lexical features help to indicate whether the substitution constitutes a semantic expansion, contraction, equivalence, or exclusion, using WordNet-derived measures of synonymy, hyponymy, and antonymy, and a measure of lemma similarity based on Levenshtein string-edit distance.",
        "In addition, for edits of all types, we have found it useful to generate a \"light edit\" feature indicating whether the affected tokens belong to categories which are usually negligible for inferential purposes, including prepositions, articles, auxiliaries, and punctuation.",
        "The entailment model uses a decision tree classifier, trained on a small data set of 69 problems custom-designed to exercise diverse regions of the feature space.",
