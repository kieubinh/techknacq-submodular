        "With the maturation of language technology, software engineering issues such as re-usability, interoperability, or portability are getting more and more attention.",
        "As dozens of standalone components such as tokenizers, stemmers, lemmatizers, chunkers, parsers, etc.",
        "are made accessible in various NLP software libraries and repositories the idea sounds intriguing to (re-)use them on an 'as is' basis and thus save expenditure and manpower when one configures a composite NLP pipeline.",
        "As a consequence, two questions arise.",
        "First, how can we abstract away from the specific code level of those single modules which serve, by and large, the same functionality?",
        "Second, how can we build NLP systems by composing them, at the abstract level of functional specification, from these already existing component building blocks disregarding concrete implementation matters?",
        "Yet another burning issue relates to the increasing availability ofmultiple metadata annotations both in corpora and language processors.",
        "If alternative annotation tag sets are chosen for the same functional task a 'data conversion' problem is created which should be solved at the abstract specification level as well (Ide et al., 2003).",
        "Software engineering methodology points out that these requirements are best met by properly identifying input/output capabilities of constituent components and by specifying a general data model (e.g., based on UML (Rumbaugh et al., 1999)) in order to get rid of the low-level implementation (i.e., coding) layer.",
        "A particularly promising proposal along this line of thought is the Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) (Ferrucci and Lally, 2004) originating from IBM research activities.",
        "UIMA is but the latest attempt in a series of proposals concerned with more generic NLP engines such as Atlas (Laprun et al., 2002) or Gate (Cunningham, 2002).",
        "These frameworks have in common a data-driven architecture and a data model based on annotation graphs as an adaptation of the TIPSTER architecture (Grishman, 1997).",
        "They suffer, however, from a lack of standards for data exchange and abstraction mechanisms at the level of specification languages.",
        "This can be achieved by the definition of a common annotation scheme.",
        "We propose an UIMA schema which accounts for a significant part of the complete NLP cycle - from the collection of documents and their internal formal structure, via sentence splitting, tokenization, POS tagging, and parsing, up until the semantic layer (still excluding discourse) - and which aims at the implementation-independent specification of a core NLP system."

        "The object-oriented perspective already allows the development of a domain-independent schema and extensions of core types without affecting the base schema.",

        "The attribute projective relates to the property of the dependency relation whether it is projective or not.",
        "As different dependency relation sets can be used for parsing, we propose subtyping similar to the constituency-based parsing approaches.",
        "In order to account for alternative dependency relation sets, we aggregate all possible annotations in the Token type as a list (depRelList).",
        "The Semantics layer comprises currently the representation of named entities, particularly for the biomedical domain.",

        "Hence, the design of this scheme allows the annotation of the entire cycle of (sentence-level) NLP analysis (discourse phenomena still have to be covered).",
        "The annotation scheme consists mostly of core types which are designed in a domain-independent way.",
        "Nevertheless, it can easily be extended with types which fit other needs.",
        "The current scheme supplies an extension for the biomedical domain at the document meta and structure level, as well as on the semantic level.",
        "The morpho-syntactic and syntactic levels provide types needed for the analysis of the English language.",
        "Changes of attributes or attribute value sets will lead to adaptations to other natural languages.",
        "We implemented the scheme as an UIMA type system.",
        "The formal specifications are implemented using the UIMA runtime environment.",
        "This direct link of formal and implementational issues is a major asset using UIMA unmatched by any previous specification approach.",
        "Furthermore, all annotation results can be converted to the XMI format within the UIMA framework.",
        "XMI, the XML Metadata Interchange format, is an OMG standard for the XML representation of object graphs.",
        "The scheme also eases the representation of annotation results for the same task with alternative and often competitive components.",
        "The identification of the component which provided specific annotations can be retrieved from the attribute com-ponentId.",
        "Furthermore, the annotation with alternative and multiple tag sets is supported as well.",
        "We have designed for each tag set a type representing the corresponding annotation parameters.",
        "The inheritance trees at almost all annotation layers support the parallelism in annotation process (e.g., tagging may proceed with different POS tagsets).",
        "The user of the scheme can restrict the potential values of the types or attributes.",
        "The current scheme makes use of the customization capability for POS tagsets, for all attributes of constituents and chunks.",
        "This yields additional flexibility in the design and, once specified, an increased potential for automatic control for annotations.",
        "The scheme also enables a straightforward connection to external resources such as ontologies, lexicons, and databases as evidenced by the corresponding subtypes of ResourceEntry (cf.",
        "Figure 1-1).",
        "These types support the specification of a relation between a concrete text span and the unique item addressed in any of these resources.",
        "With these considerations in mind, we strive for the elaboration of a common standard UIMA type system for NLP engines.",
        "The advantages of such a standard include an easy exchange and integration of different NLP analysis engines, the facilitation of sophisticated evaluation studies (where, e.g., alternative components for NLP tasks can be plugged in and out at the spec level), and the reusability of single NLP components developed in various labs.",
