        "Collocation is a lexical phenomenon in which two or more words are habitually combined and commonly used in a language to express certain semantic meaning.",
        "For example, in Chinese, people will say ffjjil- (historical baggage) rather than ffj Jfc -ff^ (historical luggage) even though l^lffl (baggage) and ff^P(luggage) are synonymous.",
        "However, no one can argue why WMl must collocate with Briefly speaking, collocations are frequently used word combinations.",
        "The collocated words always have syntactic or semantic relations but they cannot be generated directly by syntactic or semantic rules.",
        "Collocation can bring out different meanings a word can carry and it plays an indispensable role in expressing the most appropriate meaning in a given context.",
        "Consequently, collocation knowledge is widely employed in natural language processing tasks such as word sense disambiguation, machine translation, information retrieval and natural language generation (Manning et al.",
        "1999).",
        "Although the importance of collocation is well known, it is difficult to compile a complete collocation dictionary.",
        "There are some existing corpus linguistic researches on automatic extraction of collocations from electronic text (Smadja 1993; Lin 1998; Xu and Lu 2006).",
        "These techniques are mainly based on statistical techniques and syntactic analysis.",
        "However, the performances of automatic collocation extraction systems are not satisfactory (Pecina 2005).",
        "A problem is that collocations are word combinations that co-occur within a short context, but not all such co-occurrences are true collocations.",
        "Further examinations is needed to filter out pseudo-collocations once co-occurred word pairs are identified.",
        "A collocation bank with true collocations annotated is naturally an indispensable resource for collocation research.",
        "(Kosho et al.",
        "2000) presented their works of collocation annotation on Japanese text.",
        "Also, the Turkish treebank, (Bedin 2003) included collocation annotation as one step in its annotation.",
        "These two collocation banks provided collocation identification and co-occurrence verification information.",
        "(Tutin 2005) used shallow analysis based on finite state transducers and lexicon-grammar to identify and annotate collocations in a French corpus.",
        "This collocation bank further provided the lexical functions of the collocations.",
        "However to this day, there is no reported Chinese collocation bank available.",

        "Although collocations are habitual expressions in natural language use and they can be easily understood by people, a precise definition of collocation is still far-reaching (Manning et al.",
        "1999).",
        "In this study, we define a collocation as a recurrent and conventional expression of two or more content words that holds syntactic and semantic relation.",
        "Content words in Chinese include noun, verb, adjective, adverb, determiner, directional word, and gerund.",
        "Collocations with only two words are called bi-gram collocations and others are called n-gram collocations.",
        "From a linguistic view point, collocations have a number of characteristics.",
        "Firstly, collocations are recurrent as they are of habitual use.",
        "Collocations occur frequently in similar contexts and they appear in certain fixed patterns.",
        "However, they cannot be described by the same set of syntactic or semantic rules.",
        "Secondly, free word combinations which can be generated by linguistic rules are normally considered compositional.",
        "In contrast, collocations should be limited compositional (Manning et al.",
        "1999) and they usually carry additional meanings when used as a collocation.",
        "Thirdly, collocations are also limited substitutable and limited modifiable.",
        "Limited substitutable here means that a word cannot be freely substituted by other words with similar linguistic functions in the same context such as synonyms.",
        "Also, many collocations cannot be modified freely by adding modifiers or through grammatical transformations.",
        "Lastly, collocations are domain-dependent (Smadja 1993) and language-dependent."

        "The guideline firstly determines the annotation strategy.",
        "(1) The annotation of CCB follows the headword-driven strategy.",
        "The annotation uses selected headwords as the starting point.",
        "In each circle, the collocations corresponding to one headword are annotated.",
        "Headword-driven strategy makes a more efficient annotation as it is helpful to estimate and compare the relevant collocations.",
        "(2) CCB is manually annotated with the help of automatic estimation of computational features, i.e. semi-automatic software tools are used to generate parsing and chunking candidates and to estimate the classification features.",
        "These data are present to the annotators for determination.",
        "The use of assis-tive tools is helpful to produce accurate annotations with efficiency.",
        "The guideline also specifies the information to be annotated and the labels used in the annotation.",
        "For a given headword, CCB annotates both bigram collocations and n-gram collocations.",
        "Considering the fact that n-gram collocations consisting of continuous significant bi-grams as a whole and, the n-gram annotation is based on the identification and verification of bi-gram word combinations and is prior to the annotation of bi-gram collocations.",
        "For bi-gram annotation, which is the major interest in collocation research, three kinds of information are annotated.",
        "The first one is the syntactic dependency of the headword and its co-word in a bi-gram collocation .",
        "A syntactic dependency normally consists of one word as the governor (or head), a dependency type and another word serves as dependent (or modifier) (Lin 1998).Totally, 10 types of dependencies are annotated in CCB.",
        "They are listed in Table 1 below.",
        "Table l. The dependency categories",
        "The second one is the syntactic chunking information (a chunk is defined as a minimum non-nesting or non-overlapping phrase) (Xu and Lu, 2005).",
        "Chunking information identifies all the words for a collocation within the context of an enclosed chunk.",
        "Thus, it is a way to identify its proper context at the most immediate syntactic structure.",
        "11 types of syntactic chunking categories given in (Xu and 2006) are used as listed in Table 2.",
        "Table 2.",
        "The chunking categories The third one is the classification of collocation types.",
        "Collocations cover a wide spectrum of habitual word combinations ranging from idioms to free word combinations.",
        "Some collocations are very rigid and some are more flexible.",
        "(Xu and Lu 2006) proposed a scheme to classify collocations into four types according to the internal association of collocations including compositionality, non-substitutability, non-modifiability, and statistical significance.",
        "They are, Type 0: Idiomatic Collocation",
        "Type 0 collocations are fully non-compositional as its meaning cannot be predicted from the meanings of its components such as MM^Z^M (climbing a tree to catch a fish, which is a metaphor for a fruitless endeavour).",
        "Some terminologies are also Type 0 collocations such as M ff(Blue-tooth ) which refers to a wireless communication protocol.",
        "Type 0 collocations must have fixed forms.",
        "Their components are non-substitutable and non-modifiable allowing no syntactic transformation and no internal lexical variation.",
        "This type of collocations has very strong internal associations and co-occurrence statistics is not important.",
        "Type 1: Fixed Collocation",
        "Type 1 collocations are very limited compositional with fixed forms which are non-substitutable and non-modifiable.",
        "However, this type can be compositional.",
        "None of the words in a Type 1 collocation can be substituted by any other words to retain the same meaning such as in f?t3£/n Mf&ffi.",
        "/n (diplomatic immunity).",
        "Finally, Type 1 collocations normally have strong co-occurrence statistics to support them.",
        "Type 2: Strong Collocation",
        "Type 2 collocations are limitedly compositional.",
        "They allow very limited substitutability.",
        "In other words, their components can only be substituted by few synonyms and the newly generated word combinations have similar meaning, e.g., M^a/v MJW /n (alliance formation) and M^f/v J$cJM/n (alliance formation).",
        "Furthermore, Type 2 collocations allow limited modifier insertion and the order of components must be maintained.",
        "Type2 collocations normally have strong statistical support.",

        "Type 3 collocations have loose restrictions.",

        "With the help of a computer program, the annotators manually classified bigram collocations into three types.",
        "The numbers of Type 0/1, Type 2 and Type 3 collocations are 152, 3,982 and 19,447, respectively.",

        "This indicates that a collocation normally has only one fixed syntactic dependency.",
        "It is also observed that about 10% bigram collocations have more than one dependency type, especially Type 3 collocations.",
        "For example, two types of dependencies are identified in the bigram collocation jjk/an-ffM^/n.",
        "They are jjk /an-AN-I3s$/n (a safe nation) which indicates the dependency of a noun and its nominal modifier where Bs^/n serves as the head, and ffM/n-NN-jk/an (national security) which indicates the dependency of a noun and its nominal modifier where jjk/an serves as the head.",

        "In which, about 82% belongs to five major dependency types.",
        "They are AN, VO, NN, ADV and SBV.",
        "It is noteworthy that the percentage of NN collocation is much higher than that in English.",

        "The collocations with CMP, NJX and NN dependencies on average have higher percentage to be classified into Type 0/1 and Type 2 collocations.",
        "This indicates that CMP, NJX and NN collocations in Chinese are always used in fixed patterns and these kinds of collocations are not freely modifiable and substitutable.",
        "In the contrary, many ADV and AN collocations are classified as Type 3.",
        "This is partially due to the special usage of auxiliary words in Chinese.",
        "Many AN Chinese collocations can be inserted by a meaningless auxiliary word &t) /u and many ADV Chinese collocations can be inserted by an auxiliary word itfe/u.",
        "This means that many AN and ADV collocations can be modified and thus, they always have two peak cooccurrences.",
        "Therefore, they are classified as Type 3 collocations.",
        "7.7% and 62.5% of the collocations with dependency OT are classified as Type 0/1 and Type2 collocations, respectively.",
        "Such percentages are much higher than the average.",
