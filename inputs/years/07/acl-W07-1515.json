        "The Appraisal framework (Martin and White, 2005) describes a taxonomy of the language employed in communicating evaluation, explaining how users of English convey attitude (emotion, judgement ofpeo-ple and appreciation of objects), engagement (assessment of the evaluations of other people) and how writers may modify the strength of their attitude/engagement.",
        "Accurate automatic analysis of these aspects of language will augment existing research in the fields of sentiment (Pang et al., 2002) and subjectivity analysis (Wiebe et al., 2004), but assessing the usefulness of analysis algorithms leveraging the Appraisal framework will require test data.",
        "At present there are no machine-readable Appraisal-annotated texts publicly available.",
        "Real-world instances of Appraisal in use are limited to example extracts that demonstrate the theory, coming from a wide variety of genres as disparate as news reporting (White, 2002; Martin, 2004) and poetry (Martin and White, 2005).",
        "These examples, while useful in demonstrating the various aspects of Appraisal, can only be employed in a qualitative analysis and would bring about inconsistencies if analysed collectively – one can expect the writing style to depend upon the genre, resulting in significantly different syntactic constructions and lexical choices.",
        "We therefore need to examine Appraisal across documents in the same genre and investigate patterns within that particular register.",
        "This paper discusses the methodology of an Appraisal annotation study and an analysis of the inter-annotator agreement exhibited by two human judges.",
        "The output of this study has the additional benefit of bringing a set of machine-readable annotations of Appraisal into the public domain for further research.",
        "This paper is structured as follows.",

        "The taxonomy described by the Appraisal framework is depicted in Figure 1.",
        "Appraisal consists of three subsystems that operate in parallel: attitude looks at how one expresses private state (Quirk et al., 1985) (one's emotion and opinions); engagement considers the positioning of oneself with respect to the opinions of others and graduation investigates how the use of language functions to amplify or diminish the attitude and engagement conveyed by a text.",
        "The Attitude subsystem describes three areas of private state: emotion, ethics and aesthetics.",
        "An attitude is further qualified by its polarity (positive or negative).",
        "Affect identifies feelings – author's emotions as represented by their text.",
        "Judgement deals with authors' attitude towards the behaviour of people; how authors applaud or reproach the actions of others.",
        "Appreciation considers the evaluation of things – both man-made and natural phenomena.",
        "Through engagement, Martin and White (2005) deal with the linguistic constructions by which authors construe their point of view and the resources used to adopt stances towards the opinions of other people.",
        "The theory of engagement follows Stubbs (1996) in that it assumes that all utterances convey point of view and Bakhtin (1981) in supposing that all utterances occur in a miscellany of other utterances on the same motif, and that they carry both implicit and explicit responses to one another.",
        "In other words, all text is inherently dialogistic as it encodes authors' reactions to their experiences (including previous interaction with other writers).",
        "Engagement can be both retrospective (that is, an author will acknowledge and agree or disagree with the stances of others who have previously appraised a subject), and prospective (one may anticipate the responses of an intended audience and include counter-responses in the original text).",
        "Martin and White (2005) consider the resources by which writers alter the strength of their evaluation as a system of graduation.",
        "Graduation is a general property of both attitude and engagement.",
        "In attitude it enables authors to convey greater or lesser degrees of positivity or negativity, while graduation of engagements scales authors' conviction in their utterance.",
        "Graduation is divided into two subsystems.",

        "The corpus used in this study consists of unedited book reviews.",
        "Book reviews are good candidates for this study as, while they are likely to contain similar language by virtue of being from the same genre of writing, we can also expect examples of Appraisal's many classes (for example, the emotion attributed to the characters in reviews of novels, judgements of authors' competence and character, appreciation of the qualities of books and engagement with the propositions put forth by the authors under review).",
        "The articles were taken from the web sites of four British newspapers (The Guardian, The Independent, The Telegraph and The Times) on two different dates – 31 July 2006 and 11 September 2006.",
        "Each review is attributed to a unique author.",
        "The corpus is comprised of 38 documents, containing a total of 36,997 tokens in 1,245 sentences.",
        "Two human annotators, d and j, participated in this study, assigning tags independently.",
        "The annotators were well-versed in the Appraisal framework, having studied the latest literature.",
        "The judges were asked to annotate appraisal-bearing terms with the appraisal type presumed to be intended by the author of the text.",
        "They were asked to highlight each example of appraisal and specify the type of attitude, engagement or graduation present.",
        "They also assigned a polarity (positive or negative) to attitudinal items and a scaling (up or down) to graduating items, employing a custom-developed software tool to annotate the documents.",
        "Four alternative annotation strategies were considered.",
        "One approach is to allow only a single token per annotation.",
        "However, this is too simplistic for an Appraisal annotation study – a unit of Appraisal is frequently larger than a single token.",

        "The design was deceptively simple-COMPLEXITY.",
        "Example 1 demonstrates that a single-token approach is inappropriate as it ascribes a judgement of someone's honesty, whereas Example 2 indicates the correct analysis – the sentence is an appreciation of the simplicity of the \"design\".",
        "This example shows how it is necessary to annotate larger units of appraisal-bearing language.",
        "Including more tokens, however, increases the complexity of the annotation task, and reduces the likelihood of agreement between the judges, as the annotated tokens of one judge may be a subset of, or overlap with, those of another.",
        "We therefore experimented with tagging entire sentences in order to constrain the annotators' range of choices.",
        "This resulted in its own problems as there is often more than one appraisal in a sentence, for example:",
        "The design was deceptively simple-COMPLEXITY and belied his ingenuity-CAPACITY.",
        "An alternative approach is to permit annotators to tag an arbitrary number of contiguous tokens.",
        "Arbitrary-length tagging is disadvantageous as the judges will frequently tag units of differing length, but this can be compensated for by relaxing the rules for agreement – for example, by allowing intersecting annotations to match successfully (Wiebe et al., 2005).",
        "Bruce and Wiebe (1999) employ another approach, creating units from every non-compound sentence and each conjunct of every compound sentence.",
        "This sidesteps the problem of ambiguity in appraisal unit length, but will still fail to capture both appraisals demonstrated in the second conjunct of Example 4.",
        "The design was deceptively simple-COMPLEXITY and belied his remarkable-NORMALITY ingenuity-C APACITY.",
        "Ultimately in this study, we permitted judges to annotate any number of tokens in order to allow for multiple Appraisal units of differing sizes within sentences.",

        "The judges discussed examples of the most common types of disagreement in an attempt to acquire a common understanding for the second round, but annotations from the first round were left unaltered.",

        "The same relaxation of constraints is employed in this study.",
        "Tasks with a known number of annotative units can be analysed with measures of agreement such as Cohen's k Coefficient (1960), but the judges' freedom in this task prohibits meaningful application of this measure.",
        "For example, consider how word sense annotators are obliged to choose from a limited fixed set of senses for each token, whereas judges annotating Appraisal are free to select one of thirty-two classes for any contiguous substring of any length within each document; there are 16 (n – n) possible choices in a document of n tokens (approximately 6.5 x 10 possibilities in this corpus).",

        "Judge d, however, tends to perceive pronouncement as occurring wherever the author makes an assertion (e.g. this is or there will be).",
        "Judge j seems to require that the assertion carry a degree of emphasis to include a term in the Pronounce class.",
        "The low agreement of the Mass graduations can also be explained in this way, as both d and j select strong expressions relating to size (e.g. massive or scant).",
        "Annotator j found additional but weaker terms like largely or slightly.",
        "The Pronounce and Mass classes provide typical examples of the disagreement exhibited by the annotators.",
        "It is not that the judges have wildly different understandings of the system, but rather they disagree in the bounds of a class – one annotator may require a greater degree of strength of a term to warrant its inclusion in a class.",
        "Contingency tables (not depicted due to space constraints) reveal some interesting tendencies for confusion between the two annotators.",
        "Approximately 33% of d's annotations of Proximity (Space) were ascribed as Capacity by j.",
        "The high percentage is due to the rarity of annotations of Proximity (Space), but the confusion comes from differing units of Appraisal, as shown in Example 6.",
        "[d] But at key points in this story, one gets the feeling that the essential factors are operating just outside-PROXIMITY (SPACE) James's field of vision-C APACITY.",
        "[j] But at key points in this story, one gets the feeling that the essential factors are operating just outside James's field ofvision-C APACITY.",
        "Another interesting case of frequent confusion is the pair of Satisfaction and Propriety.",
        "Though not closely related in the Attitude subsystem, j chooses Propriety for 21% of d's annotations of Satisfaction.",
        "The confusion is typified by Example 7, where it is apparent that there is disagreement in terms of who is being appraised.",
        "[d] Like him, Vermeer - or so he chose to believe - was an artist neglected-SATiSFACTiON and wronged-Satisfaction by critics and who had died an almost unknown.",
        "[j] Like him, Vermeer - or so he chose to believe - was an artist neglected and wronged-PROPRIETY by critics and who had died an almost unknown.",
        "Annotator d believes that the author is communicating the artist's dissatisfaction with the way he is treated by critics, whereas j believes that the critics are being reproached for their treatment of the artist.",
        "This highlights a problem with the coding scheme, which simplifies the task by assuming only one type of Appraisal is conveyed by each unit."

        "This paper has discussed the methodology of an exercise annotating book reviews according to the Appraisal framework, a functional linguistic theory of evaluation in English.",
        "The agreement exhibited by two human judges was measured by analogy with the evaluation employed for the MUC-7 shared tasks (Chinchor, 1998).",
        "The agreement varied greatly depending on the level of abstraction in the Appraisal hierarchy (a mean F-score of 0.698 at the most abstract level through to 0.395 at the most concrete level).",
        "The agreement also depended on the type being annotated – there was more agreement evident for types of attitude compared to types of engagement or graduation.",
        "The exercise is the first step in an ongoing study of approaches for the automatic analysis of expressions of Appraisal.",
        "The primary output of this work is a corpus of book reviews independently annotated with Appraisal types by two coders.",
        "Agreement was in general low, but if one assumes that the intersection of both sets of annotations contains reliable examples, this leaves 2,223 usable annotations.",
        "Future work will employ these annotations to evaluate algorithms for the analysis of Appraisal, and investigate the usefulness of the Appraisal framework when in the computational analysis of document sentiment and subjectivity."
