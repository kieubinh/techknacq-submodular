        "The most reliable data set for Turkish is the Metu-Sabanci Turkish Treebank (Oflazer et al., 2003) consisting of 5635 sentences annotated with dependency structures.",
        "Unfortunately, the data size of this treebank remained unchanged during recent years.",
        "There exist also some other small data sets manually pos-tagged by different research groups.",
        "In this study, we introduce our treebank annotation tool developed in order to improve the size of the existing data sets for Turkish (particularly the treebank).",
        "Our main motivation for developing a new tool is the inability of the existing tools (e.g. Atalay et al.",
        "(2003) and DepAnn (Kakkonen, 2006) which seems to be the most suitable tools for our task) in either reflecting the peculiar morphological and dependency structure of Turkish or providing suitable automatic analyses for guidance.",
        "We also aim to speed up the annotation process by using graphical user-friendly interfaces and transforming the annotation process from a manual (starting from scratch) procedure into a controlling and correcting procedure.",
        "In the rest of this paper, we first introduce the framework of the tool and then the details of its different annotation stages.",
        "We then close with conclusions and future work."

        "The most important characteristic of Turkish which distinguishes it from most of the well-studied languages is its very rich morphological structure.",
        "Turkish which is an agglutinative language has a very productive derivational and inflectional morphology.",
        "This rich structure of the language has been represented in the literature (Oflazer et al., 2003; Hakkani-Tiir et al., 2002; Eryigit and Oflazer, 2006) by splitting the words into inflectional groups (IGs) which are separated from each other by derivational boundaries.",
        "Each IG is then annotated with its own part-of-speech and inflectional features.",

        "The second IG is the derived verb \"being in your room\" in present tense (+Pres), with 1st singular number-person agreement (+A1sg) inflectional features.",
        "The morphological analysis stage is totally automatic except that the user can enter other analyses to the text boxes under each word if the correct one is not within the above listed items or the analyzer couldn t suggest any analysis.",
        "This latter case generally occurs for numerical values (e.g., numbers, dates) and unknown words.",

        "Figure 3 gives an example of this structure.",
        "In this screen, the annotator first selects a dependent unit by selecting the check box under it and then a head unit and the appropriate dependency relation from the combo box appearing under the constructed dependency.",
        "In this figure, we see that the adjective \"eski\" (old) is connected to the first IG of the word \"odandayim\" since it is the word \"oda\" (room) which is modified by the adjective, not the derived verb form \"odandayim\" (I'm in your room).",
        "On the other hand, the adverb \"simdi\" (now) is connected to the second IG of this word and modifies the verb \"being in the room\".",
        "The graphical interface is designed so that the annotator can easily determine the correct head word and its correct IG.",
        "In each step of the syntactic annotation, the partially built dependency tree is shown to the annotators in order to reduce the number of mistakes caused by the inattentiveness of the annotators (such as the errors encountered in the original Turkish treebank; cycled dependencies, erroneous crossing dependencies, unconnected items, dependencies to nonexistent items).",
        "Extra cautions are taken with similar reasons in order to force the annotators to only make valid annotations:",
        "• Only the check boxes under final IGs of the words become active when the annotator is about to select a dependent since the dependencies can only emanate from the last IGs of the dependents.",
        "• The dependents may only be connected to the IGs of other words, thus the check boxes of the IGs within the dependent word become passive when selecting a head unit.",
        "Similar to the morphological disambiguation stage, the annotator may want to consult to an automatic analyzer.",
        "We use the data-driven dependency parser of Nivre et al.",
        "(2006) as an external parsing guide which is shown to give the highest accuracy for Turkish and for many other languages.",
        "The output of the parser (pre-trained on the Turkish treebank) is reflected to the screen by automatically constructing the dependency tree.",

        "ITU treebank annotation tool is a semi-automatic annotation tool tailored for the particular morphological structure of Turkish where we need to annotate units smaller than words.",
        "It has three annotation levels and uses pluggable analyzers in order to automate these levels.",
        "These are a rule-based morphological analyzer, and machine learning based part-of-speech tagger and dependency parser.",
        "The tool which aims to provide a user-friendly platform for the human annotators, also tries to minimize the number of errors due to the complexity of the annotation process of Turkish.",
        "The tool is designed and used only for Turkish in its current state, however it can be used for other languages with similar morphological structure (particularly other Turkic languages) by replacing the external analyzers.",
        "By using this tool, we observed significant acceleration both in correcting the existing treebank and developing new data sets.",
        "However education of new human annotators still remains as a difficult point and requires a lot of time.",
        "Hence in the future, we aim to develop online education tools which teach the annotators and tests their performance.",
        "We also aim to carry the platform to the web and supply an environment which can be reached from different places by volunteer researchers and collect the data in a single place.",
