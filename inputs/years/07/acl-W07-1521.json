        "In the field of Chinese corpus construction, plenty of attention has been paid to POS tagging and syntactic structures bracketing, for instance the Penn Chinese Treebank (Xue et al., 2002) and Sinica Corpus (Huang et al., 1992), but very limited work has been done with semantic knowledge annotation.",
        "Huang et al.",

        "SENSEVAL-3 provides a Chinese word sense annotated corpus, which contains 20 words and 15 sentences per meaning for most words, but obviously the data is too limited to achieve wide coverage, high accuracy WSD systems.",

        "The corpus CSP, the lexicon CSD and CCD constitute a highly relational and tightly integrated system: 1) In CSD the sense distinctions are described relying on the corpus; 2) In CSP the word occurrences are assigned sense tags according to the sense entry specified in CSD; 3) The linking between the sense entry in CSD and CCD synsets are established.",

        "In the word sense annotating interface, the sentences from CSP containing the target ambiguous words are displayed in the upper section, and the word senses with feature-based description from CSD are displayed in the bottom section.",
        "Through reading the context in the corpus, the human annotator decides to add or delete or edit a sense entry in the lexicon.",
        "The default value of the range of the context is within a sentence, and the surrounding characters in the left and right of the target word can be specified by the annotator.",
        "Annotators can do four kinds of operations in CSD: 1) Add a sense entry and then fill in all the features; 2) Delete a sense entry along with all its feature description; 3) Edit a sense entry and change any of the features; 4) Select a sample sentence form the CSP and add it to the lexicon in the corresponding sense entry.",
        "According to the sense specification in CSD the human annotator assigns semantic tags to the word occurrences in CSP.",
        "The operation is quite easy.",

        "1) Search sequentially (forward or backward) all the instances of an ambiguous words regardless of the annotating state; 2) Search sequentially (forward or backward) the already annotated instances; 3) Search sequentially (forward or backward) the yet un-annotated instances and 4) Search the instances of a specific ambiguous word (the window named Find/Replace in figure3, and again is shown in figure 4 for clearness).",
        "The tool of Find/Replace is widely used in this project and has proven to be effective in annotating word senses.",
        "It allows the annotator to search for a specific word to finish tagging all its occurrences in the same period of time rather than move sequentially through the text.",
        "The consistency is more easily kept when the annotator manages many different instances of the same word than handle a few occurrences of many different words in a specific time frame, because the former method enables the annotator to establish an integrative knowledge system about a specific word and its sense distinction.",
        "Also the tool of Find/Replace provides flexible searching schemes for a specific ambiguous word.",
        "For instance, search in the corpus with different directions (forward/backward) and search with different annotating states (annotated/un-annotated/both).",
        "Using the tool the annotator can also replace some specific word occurrences in the corpus (often with special POS tags) with a sense tag, thus can finish annotating the corpus quickly and with a batch method.",
        "For instance the POS tag of \"vq\" (means verb complement) often uniquely corresponds to a specific verb sense such as \"JF/vq-^J7vq!8\".",
        "There is the status bar in the bottom line of the word sense annotating interface, and there clearly show the annotating status: the total word occurrences, the serial number of the current processing instance and the number of the already annotated instances.",

        "So the linking between the sense entries in CSD and the synsets in CCD is tried to establish in this project.",
        "After the linking has been established, the paradigmatic relations (such as hy-pernym / hyponym, meronym / holonym) expressed in CCD can map automatically to the sense entry in CSD.",
