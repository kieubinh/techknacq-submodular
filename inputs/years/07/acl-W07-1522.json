        "have also grown in sophistication.",
        "For English, several annotation schemes have already been proposed for both coreference relation and argument structure, and annotated corpora have been developed accordingly (Hirschman, 1997; Poe-sio et al., 2004; Doddington et al., 2004).",
        "For instance, in the Coreference task on Message Understanding Conference (MUC) and the Entity Detection and Tracking (EDT) task in the Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) program, which is the successor of MUC, the details of specification of annotating coreference relation have been discussed for several years.",
        "On the other hand, the specification of predicate-argument structure analysis has mainly been discussed in the context of the CoNLL shared task on the basis of the PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005).",
        "In parallel with these efforts, there have also been research activities for building Japanese text corpora annotated with coreference and predicate-argument relations such as the Kyoto Text Corpus version 4.0 (Kawahara et al., 2002) and the GDA-Tagged Corpus (Hasida, 2005).",
        "However, as we discuss in this paper, there is still much room for arguing and refining the specification of such sorts of semantic annotation.",

        "Coreference annotation in English has been evolving mainly in the context of information extraction.",
        "For instance, in the 6th and 7th Message Understanding Conferences (MUC), coreference resolution is treated as a subtask of information extraction.",
        "The annotated corpora built in the MUC contain coref-erence relations between NPs, which are used as a gold standard data set for machine learning-based approaches to coreference resolution by researchers such as Soon et al.",
        "(2001) and Ng and Cardie (2002).",
        "However, van Deemter and Kibble (1999) claim that the specification of the MUC coreference task guides us to annotate expressions that are not normally considered coreferential, such as appositive relations (e.g. Julius Caesari, a well-known em-perori, ...).",
        "In the task of Entity Detection and Tracking (EDT) in the Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) program (Doddington et al., 2004), the successor of MUC, the coreference relations are redefined in terms of two concepts, mentions and entities, in order to avoid inappropriate co-indexing.",
        "In the specification of EDT, mentions are defined as the expressions appearing in the texts, and entities mean the collective set of specific entities referred to by the mentions in the texts.",
        "Entities are limited to named entities such as Person and Organization for adequacy and reliability of annotation.",
        "Therefore, the ACE data set has the drawback that not all coref-erence relations in the text are exhaustively annotated.",
        "It is insufficient to resolve only the annotated coreference relations in order to properly analyze a text.",
        "In parallel with these efforts, Japanese corpora have been developed that are annotated with coreference relations, such as the Kyoto Text Corpus version 4.0 (Kawahara et al., 2002) and GDA-Tagged Corpus (Hasida, 2005).",
        "Before reviewing these works, we explain the relationship between anaphora and coreference in Japanese, referring to the following examples.",
        "In example (1), the pronoun sorei (it) points back to iPodi, and these two mentions refer to the same entity in the world and thus are considered both anaphoric and coreferential.",

        "On the other hand, in example (2), we still see an anaphoric relation between iPodi (iPodi) and sorej (itj) and sorej points back to iPodi.",

        "Mary-TOP onej-acc buy-PAST punc Mary also bought one.",
        "As in the above examples, an anaphoric relation can be either coreferential or not.",
        "The former case is called an identity-of-reference anaphora (IRA) and the latter an identity-of-sense anaphora (ISA) (see Mitkov (2002)).",
        "In English the difference between IRA and ISA is clearly expressed by the anaphoric relations formed with 'it' and 'one' respectively.",
        "This makes it possible to treat these classes separately.",
        "However, in Japanese, no such clear lexical distinction can be drawn.",
        "In both the Kyoto Corpus and GDA-Tagged Corpus, there is no discussion in regards to distinction between ISA and IRA, thus it is unclear what types of coreference relations the annotators annotated.",
        "To make matters worse, their approaches do not consider whether or not a mention refers to a specific entity like in the EDT task.",
        "As described in the previous section, conventional specifications in Japanese are not based on a precise definition of coreference relations, resulting in inappropriate annotation.",
        "On the other hand, in our specification, we consider two or more mentions as coreferential in case they satisfy the following two conditions:",

        "The PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005), on the other hand, defines a set of semantic roles (labeled ARG0, ARG1, and AM-ADV, etc.)",

        "In the FrameNet (Fillmore and Baker, 2000), a specific set of semantic roles is defined for each set of semantically-related verbs called a FrameNet frame.",
        "However, there is still only limited consensus on how many kinds of semantic roles should be identified and which linguistic theory we should adopt to define them at least for the Japanese language.",
        "An alternative way of labeling predicate-argument relations is to use syntactic cases as labels.",
        "In Japanese, arguments of a verb are marked by a postposition, which functions as a case marker.",

        "Labeling predicate-argument relations in terms of syntactic cases has a few more advantages over semantic roles as far as Japanese is concerned:",
        "• Manual annotation of syntactic cases is likely to be more cost-efficient than semantic roles",
        "because they are often explicitly marked by case markers.",
        "This fact also allows us to avoid the difficulties in defining a label set.",
        "• In Japanese, the mapping from syntactic cases to semantic roles tends to be reasonably straightforward if a semantically rich lexicon of verbs like the VerbNet (Kipper et al., 2000) is available.",
        "• Furthermore, we have not yet found many NLP applications for which the utility of semantic roles is actually demonstrated.",
        "One may think of using semantic roles in textual inference as exemplified by, for example, Tatu and Moldovan (2006).",
        "However, similar sort of inference may well be realized with syntactic cases as demonstrated in the information extraction and question answering literature.",
        "Taking these respects into account, we choose to label predicate-argument relations in terms of syntactic cases, which follows the annotation scheme adopted in the Kyoto Corpus.",
        "Once the level of syntactic cases is chosen for our annotation, another issue immediately arises, alteration of syntactic cases by syntactic transformations such as passivization and causativization.",

        "(7) illustrates how the arguments in sentence (5) are annotated with logical case relations: Tom is labeled as the ga-case (Nominative) filler of the verb tabe (to eat) and Mary is labeled as the Extra-Nominative (ex-ga) which we newly invent to indicate the Causer of a syntactically causativized clause.",
        "In the NAIST Text Corpus, we choose to this latter way of annotation motivated by such considerations as follows:",
        "• Knowing that, for example, Tom is the filler of the ga-case (Nominative) of the verb tabe (to eat) in (5) is more useful than knowing that Tom is the ni-case (Dative) of the causativized verb tabe-saseru (to make someone eat) for such applications as information extraction.",

        "While it has several advantages as discussed in 3.1, this choice has also a drawback that should be removed.",
        "The problem arises from lexical verb alternation.",
        "It can sometimes be hard for annotators to determine a case frame of a given predicate when verb alternation takes place.",
        "For example, sentence (15) can be analyzed simply as in (16a).",
        "However, since the verb shibaru (bind) has also another alternative case frame as in (16b), the labeling of the case of the argument kisoku (rule), i.e. either ga (nom) or de (inst) may be undecidable if the argument is omitted.",

        "For example, the event-noun hassei (realization) has both transitive and intransitive readings, which may produce awkward ambiguities.",
        "To avoid this problem, we have two options; one is to predefine the preference in case frames as a convention for annotation and the other is to deal with such alternations based on generic resources of lexical semantics such as Lexical Conceptual Structure (LCS) (Jackendoff, 1990).",
        "Creating a Japanese LCS dictionary is another ongoing project, so we can collaborate with them in developing the valuable resources.",
        "Event-nouns of some semantic types such as keiyaku (contract), kisei (regulation) and toushi (investment) are interpreted as either an event or an entity resulting from an event depending on are context.",
        "However, it is sometimes difficult to judge whether such an event-noun should be interpreted as an event or a resultant entity even by considering the whole context, which degrades the stability of annotation.",
        "This phenomena is also discussed in the NomBank, and we will share their insights and refine our annotation manual in the next step.",
        "Even though coreference relation is defined as IRA relations, the lack of agreement on the granularity of noun classes makes the agreement ratio worse.",
