        "The relevance of corpus work for different tasks in the fields of linguistics is widely accepted.",
        "This holds especially for the area of (semi-)automatic text and discourse analysis which demands reference corpora in which instances of various levels of discourse structure have been annotated.",
        "Such annotation tasks are typically carried out by a combination of automatic and manual techniques.",
        "Manual annotation of large text corpora is a time consuming effort.",
        "Therefore, annotation tools are an indispensable means to overcome the limits of manual annotations.",
        "In spite of their limited level of automatization, such tools nevertheless help to semi-automatically support the annotation process and to secure consistency of manual annotations.",
        "This paper describes such an annotation tool which focuses on a certain type of discourse structures.",
        "More specifically, we deal with anaphoric relations and lexical cohesion.",
        "Our starting point is the observation that these two resources of textual cohesion (Halliday and Hasan, 1976) homogeneously induce chainlike discourse structures: one the one hand we have reference chains started by some antecedence and continued by some anaphora linked to the same antecedence.",
        "On the other hand, lexical cohesion generates so called lexical chains of semantically related tokens.",
        "Based on this observation we describe the annotation tool Serengeti which reflects this structural homogeneity on the level of its structural representation model as well as by its procedural annotation model.",
        "Serengeti includes an annotation scheme which is extended in order to support the annotation of reference chains and lexical chains.",
        "The paper is organized as follows: Section 2.1 describes the application scenario of anaphoric relations and the scheme we use to annotate them.",
        "Section 2.2 deals with the second application scenario: lexical chains.",
        "As our starting point was the former scenario, its extension to the latter one will be motivated by a separate case study of lexical chaining.",
        "Section 3 refers to related work, while Section 4 describes our annotation tool in detail.",
        "Finally, the application of Serengeti to annotating lexical chains is described in Section 5."

        "We use the term 'heterogeneity' to refer to resources that differ either in terms of form (text, audio, video) or in terms of function (e. g. lexicons, annotated texts).",
        "Connection between these resources can be established with the means of XML, cf. Simons (2004).",
        "Integrating resources via an abstract interface is necessary due to different reasons: The resources used have often been developed independently from each other and a cascaded application of one resource to the output of another resource is not always possible.",
        "Furthermore, the output of different resources often cannot be encoded in a single structure without driving into incompatibilites (i. e. XML overlap).",
        "Therefore an architecture was developed which allows for the combination of the output structures of several linguistic resources into a single XML annotated document and which is described in detail in Witt et al.",
        "(2005) and Stuhrenberg et al.",
        "(2006) .",
        "Motivation and Background Resolving anaphoric relations needs a variety of different information (e.g. POS, distance information, grammatical function, semantic knowledge, see, for example, Mitkov (2002) for an overview).",
        "Several resources are applied to a corpus of 47 texts and the output structures are combined into a single XML document using the architecture mentioned above.",
        "In order not only to integrate but also evaluate resources for a given linguistic task formally in terms of precision and recall, it should be possible to either switch on or switch off a given resource.",
        "In the application domain of anaphora resolution evaluation is done as follows.",
        "Each discourse entity or referent (cf. Karttunen (1976)) is annotated as an XML element which holds a variety of attribute information.",
        "Each XML element is reinterpreted as a feature vector; pairs of discourse entities between which an anaphoric relation holds form a single feature vector with additional information relevant for anaphora resolution (e. g. distance information, identity of grammatical form, semantic relatedness of underlying lemmata and the like).",
        "In order to evaluate different resource settings, decision trees with varying sets of feature vectors are used for the process of anaphora resolution.",
        "Xiaofeng et the feasibility of decision trees for the domain of anaphora resolution; we have chosen this approach as it makes it possible to easily switch the information set for training and evaluation as opposed to e. g. rewriting rule sets.",
        "Both, training and evaluation as well as empirically based analysis of anaphora need an annotated reference corpus (Poesio et al., 2002).",
        "Scheme and annotation process are described in the following section.",
        "The Annotation Scheme for Anaphoric Relations Several annotation schemes for annotating anaphoric relations have been developed in the last years, e. g. the UCREL anaphora annotation scheme (Fligelstone, 1992; Garside et al., 1997), the SGML-based MUC annotation scheme (Hirschmann, 1997), and the MATE/GNOME Scheme (Poesio, 2004), amongst others.",
        "In order to annotate discourse relations - either anaphoric relations or lexical chains (cf.",
        "Section 2.2) - two types of information have to be specified.",
        "First, the markables, i. e. the elements that can be part of a relation, have to be specified (cf. Müller and Strube (2003)).",
        "Second, the relation(s) between markables and their respective types and subtypes have to be defined.",
        "The markables form a basis for the annotation process and therefore have to be annotated in advance.",
        "Normally, for a domain under investigation, elements are denoted as being mark-ables either via a specific element or via the use of a universal attribute.",
        "In our system, discourse entities are detected automatically on the basis of POS and parsing information.",
        "The annotation scheme for annotating anaphoric relations is an extension of the scheme presented by Holler et al.",
        "(2004) that has been developed for annotations in the context of text-to-hypertext conversion in the project B1 Hy-Tex.",
        "We adopt the distinction between coreference and cospecification but we extend the annotation scheme for an explicit distinction between cospec-ification (direct anaphora) and bridging (associative or indirect anaphora).",
        "Thus, we add the primary relation type bridgingLink (denoting bridging) to the already existing one (cospecLink).",
        "Each primary relation type includes different secondary relation",

        "Now he was so that he soon g ; and a [leaf] fell on him, and then another, and then another, and before long he was covered all over with |eaves|, yellow, golden and brown.",

        "Motivation and Background Based on the concept of lexical cohesion (Halliday and Hasan, 1976), computational linguists (inter alia Morris and Hirst (1991)) developed a method to compute a partial text representation: lexical chains.",
        "These span over passages or even the complete text linking lexical items.",
        "The exemplary annotation in Figure 1 illustrates that lexical chaining is achieved by the selection of vocabulary and significantly accounts for the cohesive structure of a text passage.",
        "Items in a lexical chain are connected via semantic relations.",
        "Accordingly, lexical chains are computed on the basis of a lexical semantic resource such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "Figure 1 also depicts several unsystematic relations, which should in principle be considered.",
        "Unfortunately, common lexical resources do not incorporate them sufficiently.",
        "Most systems consist of the fundamental modules shown in Table 1.",
        "However, in order to formally evaluate the performance of a given chainer in terms of precision and recall, a (preferably standardized and freely available) test set would be required.",
        "To our knowledge such a resource does not exist - neither for English nor for German.",
        "We therefore plan to develop an evaluation corpus (gold standard), which on the one hand includes the annotation of lexical chains and on the other hand reveals the rich interaction between various principles to achieve a cohesive text structure.",
        "In order to systematically construct sound guidelines for the annotation of this gold standard, we conducted a case study.",
        "Case Study Six subjects were asked to annotate lexical chains in three short texts and in doing so record all challenges and uncertainties they experienced.",
        "The subjects were asked to read three texts - a wikipedia entry (137 words), a newspaper article (233 words), and an interview (306 words).",
        "They were then given a list of all nouns occurring in the articles (almost all chainers exclusively consider nouns as chaining candidates), which they had to rate with respect to their 'importance' in understanding the text.",
        "On this basis they were asked to determine the semantic relations of every possible chaining candidate pair, thus chain the nouns and annotate the three texts.",
        "Just like previously reported case studies (Beigman Klebanov, 2005; Morris and Hirst, 2004; Morris and Hirst, 2005) aiming at the annotation of lexical chains, we found that the inter-annotator agreement was in general relatively low.",
        "Only the annotation of very prominent items in the three texts, which accounted for approximately one fifth of the chaining candidates, resulted in a satisfying agreement (that is: the majority of the subjects produced an identical or very similar annotation).",
        "However, all subjects complained about the task.",
        "They found it rather difficult to construct linearized or quasi-linearized structures, in short, chains.",
        "Instead, most of the subjects built clusters and drew very complex graphs to illustrate the cohesive relations they found.",
        "They also pointed out that only a small fraction of the candidate list contributed to their text understanding.",
        "This clearly supports our observation that most of the subjects first skimmed through the text to find the most prominent items, established chains for this selection and then worked the text over to distribute the remaining items to these chains.",
        "We therefore assume that lexical chains do not directly reflect reading and understanding processes.",
        "Nevertheless, they do in some way contribute to them.",
        "Many subjects additionally noted that a reasonable candidate list should also include multi-word units (e.g. technical terms) or even phrases.",
        "Furthermore, as already reported in previous work (Morris and Hirst, 2004), the semantic relations usually considered seem not to suffice.",
        "Accordingly, some subjects proposed new relations to characterize the links connecting candidate pairs.",
        "Given our own findings and the results reported in previous work, it is obviously demanding to find a clear-cut border between the concepts of lexical chaining, semantic fields, and co-reference/anaphora resolution.",
        "Definitely, the annotation of co-reference/anaphora and lexical chains is inherently analogous.",
        "In both cases an annotation layer consisting of labelled edges between pairs of annotation candidates is constructed.",
        "However, we assume that the lexical chaining layer might contain more edges between annotation candidates.",
        "As a consequence, its structure presumably is more complex and its connectivity higher.",
        "We thus plan to conduct an extended follow-up study in order to explore these differences between the annotation of lexical chains and co-reference/anaphora.",
        "We also intend to take advantage of - amongst other aspects - the inter-annotator comparison functionality provided by Serengeti (see Section 4 for a detailed description) in order to implement a formally correct inter-annotator agreement test."
