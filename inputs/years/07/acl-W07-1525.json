        "Anaphoric annotation is notoriously problematic because of ambiguity and subjectivity issues.",
        "One has to deal with them at two stages: 1) by designing annotation guidelines; 2) by performing annotation.",
        "As for 1), it is a well-known problem that different schemes propose different annotation decisions.",
        "As for 2), different annotators may have different judgments on coreference-related issues.",
        "The current paper focuses on the general principles and strategies of annotating coreference - the theoretical core that should logically precede any annotation decisions or schemes, but has not been formulated explicitly by now.",
        "The number of existing schemes released just in the last few years is overwhelming and is out of the scope here.",
        "The MUC is still generally accepted as the most standard-like annotation scheme (Hirschman, 1997).",
        "Given its simplicity is its most important advantage, it has been criticized for its limited coverage and its contra-intuitive understanding of coreference.",
        "One of the most well-known later approaches is MATE/GNOME (Poe-sio, 2004).",
        "As the author fairly notices, \"there can be no such thing as a general-purpose anaphoric annotation instructions\", due to the complexity of phenomena associated with the term of anaphora.",
        "So, its essential idea is combining a \"general-purporse markup scheme\" (MATE) with application-specific scheme instantiations (GNOME).",
        "In PoCoS, we adapted and elaborated this idea, by suggesting the Core and Extended Schemes.",
        "The PoCoS, the Potsdam Coreference Scheme, both adapts selected features of existing schemes and implements a set of innovative features.",
        "We distinguish between the Core and Extended Scheme: the Core Scheme is general and reusable, while the Extended Scheme supports a wider range of specific extensions, see fig. 1.",

        "While CONSTITUENCY and COMPLETENESS define constraints for markable identification, consistency also affects selection preferences among potential antecedents, and it motivates the explicit representation of anaphoric ambiguity in PoCoS.",

        "The definition of primary and secondary markables makes use of language-specifics such as existence of a definite determiner, etc.",
        "These specifications, although formulated here specifically for German and English, are subject to language-specific alternative instantiations of the PoCoS Scheme.",
        "Note that in Russian, the differentiation between primary and secondary markables is made on the basis of different linguistic cues, as definiteness is not explicitly marked.",
        "Therefore, in Russian, secondary markables are only certain quantified expressions.",
        "Nevertheless, the function of primary and secondary markables remains the same.",
        "Further, existence of a predetermined set of potential anaphors allows to verify if all primary markables are assigned a relation or have been explicitly marked as non-referring.",
        "Another important novel aspect is the systematic treatment of ambiguity in the annotation of large corpora.",
        "This aspect has never been included in coreference annotation before (except for one experiment described by Poesio and Artstein, 2005) and thus defines the task of coreference annotation in a more precise way.",
        "Moreover, we specified a set of heuristic rules to guide an annotator to a specific decision in case of ambiguity or vagueness.",
        "These rules are ranked according to their priority.",
        "Similarly, Versley (2006) has recently argued that a \"light-weight theory\" of anaphoric ambiguity is due, in order to ensure consistent coding decisions.",
        "Finally, splitting annotation procedure into stages allows explicit structuring of the process, in existing approaches presented no more than implicitly (cf. Naumann, 2006, see p. 12)."

        "This paper has presented the general coreference annotation framework and the PoCoS Scheme for coreference annotation.",
        "As an innovative feature for coreference annotation, it implements ambiguity resolution strategies and proposes annotation of ambiguities.",
        "Also, by introducing language-neutral criteria for identification of markables, it both reduces the notorious complexity of anaphoric annotation on the systematic basis and enables applicability of similar principles across languages.",
        "Thus, it has a better portability and cross-language comparability as compared to the previous work.",
        "One possible field of application of the scheme can be seen in its utilisation for the anaphoric annotation of parallel corpora, an idea which is currently explored by the authors."
