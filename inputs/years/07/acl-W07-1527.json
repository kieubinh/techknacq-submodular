        "Linguistically annotated corpora are valuable resources for both theoretical and computational linguistics.",
        "They have played an important role in any aspect of natural language processing research, from supervised learning to evaluation, and have been used in many applications such as Syntactic and Semantic Parsing, Information Extraction, and Question Answering.",
        "A long-term research topic in linguistics, computational linguistics, and artificial intelligence has",
        "'in the past few years at many workshops, tutorials, and competitions this research topic has received considerable inter-",
        "been the semantic interpretation of noun phrases (NPs).",
        "The basic problem is simple to define: given a noun phrase constructed out of a pair of concepts expressed by words or phrases, c\\ - c2, one representing the head and the other the modifier, determine the semantic relationship between the two concepts.",
        "For example, a compound family estate should be interpreted as the estate owned by the family; an NP such as dress of silk should be interpreted as denoting a dress made from silk.",
        "The problem, while simple to state is hard to solve.",
        "The reason is that the meaning of these constructions is most of the time ambiguous or implicit.",
        "Currently, the best-performing English NP interpretation methods in computational linguistics focus mostly on two consecutive noun instances (noun compounds) and are either (weakly) supervised, knowledge-intensive (Rosario and Hearst, 2001), (Rosario et al., 2002), (Moldovan et al., 2004), (Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006), (Pennacchiotti and Pantel, 2006), (Kim and Baldwin, 2006), (Snow et al., 2006), (Girju et al., 2005; Girju et al., 2006), or use statistical models on large collections of un-labeled data (Berland and Charniak, 1999), (Lap(Turney, 2006).",
        "Unlike unsupervised models, supervised knowledge-rich approaches rely heavily on large sets of annotated training data.",
        "For example, we previously showed (Girju et al., 2006) that, for",
        "est from the computational linguistics community: workshop on Multiword Expressions at COLING/ACL 2006, 2004, 2003; Computational Lexical Semantics Workshop at ACL 2004; Tutorial on Knowledge Discovery from Text at ACL 2003; Shared",

        "the task of automatic detection of part-whole relations, our system's learning curve reached a plateau at 74% F-measure when trained on approximatively 10,000 positive and negative examples.",
        "Interpreting NPs correctly requires various types of information from world knowledge to complex context features.",
        "Since the training data needs to be as accurate as possible, many of such features are manually identified and annotated.",
        "Thus, the annotation process is an important task that requires not only considerable amount of time, but also experience with various annotation schemas and tools, and a good understanding of the research topic.",
        "Moreover, the extension of the noun phrase interpretation task to other natural languages brings forward new annotation issues.",
        "This paper presents observations on our experience with an annotation scheme that was used in the training of a state-of-the-art noun phrase semantic interpretation system (Girju, 2007).",

      "text": [
        "The automatic discovery of semantic relations must start with a thorough understanding of the linguistic aspects of the underlying relations.",
        "These considerations are not only employed as features in the supervised noun phrase interpretation model, but they are also used in the annotation process.",
        "Noun phrases can be compositional when their meaning is derived from the meaning of the constituent nouns (e.g., door knob - part-whole, kiss in the morning - temporal), or idiosyncratic, when the meaning is a matter of convention (e.g., soap opera, sea lion).",
        "NPs can also express metaphorical names (eg, ladyfinger), proper names (e.g., John Doe), and binomial (dvandva) compounds in which neither noun is the head (e.g., player-coach).",
        "NPs can also be classified into synthetic (verbal) and root (non-verbal) constructions.",
        "It is widely held (Levi, 1978), (Selkirk, 1982) that the modifier noun of a synthetic noun compound, for example, may be associated with a theta-role of the verbal head.",
        "For instance, in truck driver, the noun truck satisfies the theme relation associated with the direct object in the corresponding argument structure of the verb to drive.",
        "Studied cross-linguistically, noun phrases can express variations from one language to another.",
        "For example, English compounds of the form N\\ N2(e.g., wood stove) usually translate in Romance languages as N2 P N (e.g., four a bois (French) stove at/to wood).",
        "Romance languages have very few N N compounds and they are of limited semantic categories, such as type (e.g., legge quadro (Italian) - framework law).",
        "Moreover, while English N N compounds are right-headed (e.g., framework/modifier law/head), Romance compounds are left-headed (e.g., legge'/head quadro/modifier).",
        "For this research we focus only on English-Romance compositional noun phrases of the type N N and N P N and disregard metaphorical and proper names.",
        "In the following section we present two different state-of-the-art classification sets used in NP interpretation."

      "heading": "3. Lists of semantic classification relations",
      "text": [
        "Although researchers (Downing, 1977), (Jespersen, 1954) argued that noun compounds, and NPs in general, encode an infinite set of semantic relations, many agree (Finin, 1980), (Levi, 1978) there is a limited number of relations that occur with high frequency in these constructions.",
        "However, the number and the level of abstraction of these frequently used semantic categories are not agreed upon.",
        "They can vary from a few prepositions (Lauer, 1995) to hundreds and even thousands more specific semantic relations (Finin, 1980).",
        "The more abstract the categories, the more noun phrases are covered, but also the more room for variation as to which category a phrase should be assigned.",
        "Lauer (Lauer, 1995), for example, considers a set of eight prepositions as semantic classification categories that can link the head and the modifier nouns in a noun compound: of, for, with, in, on, at, about, and from.",
        "However, according to this classification, the noun compound love story, for instance, can be classified both as story of love and story about love.",
        "The main problem with these abstract categories is that much of the meaning of individual compounds is lost, and sometimes there is no way to decide whether a form is derived from one category or another.",
        "on the other hand, lists of very specific semantic relations are difficult to build as they usually contain a very large number of predicates, such as the list of all possible verbs that can link the noun constituents.",
        "Finin (Finin, 1980), for example, uses semantic categories such as \"dissolved in\" to build interpretations of compounds such as \"salt water\" and \"sugar water\".",
        "In this research we experiment with two sets of semantic classification categories defined at different abstraction levels.",
        "The first is a core set of 22 semantic relations (22 SRs), set which was identified by us from the linguistics literature and from various experiments after many iterations over a period of time (Moldovan and Girju, 2003).",
        "We proved empirically that this set is encoded by noun - noun pairs in noun phrases and is a subset of our larger list of 35 semantic relations.",
        "This list, presented in Table 1 along with examples and semantic argument frames, is general enough to cover a large majority of text semantics while keeping the semantic relations to a manageable number.",
        "A semantic argument frame is defined for each semantic relation and indicates the position of each semantic argument in the underlying relation.",
        "For example, \"Argi is part of (whole) Arg2\" identifies the part (Argi) and the whole (Arg2) entities of this relation.",
        "This representation is important since it allows to distinguish between different arrangements of the arguments for given relation instances.",
        "For example, most of the time, in N N compounds Argi precedes Arg2, while in N P N constructions the position is reversed (Arg2 P Argi).",
        "However, this is not always the case as shown by N N instances such as \"ham/Argl sandwichlArgT\" and \"door/Arg2 knob/Argl\".",
        "These argument frames were introduced to provide consistent guide to the annotators to easily test the goodness-of-fit of the relations.",
        "The second set is Lauer's list of 8 prepositions and can be applied only to noun-noun compounds.",
        "We selected these two state-of-the-art sets as they are of different size and contain semantic classification categories at different levels of abstraction.",
        "Lauer's list is more abstract and, thus capable of encoding a large number of noun compound instances found in a corpus, while our list contains finer grained semantic categories.",
        "Details about the coverage of these semantic lists on the two different corpora (Europarl and CLUVI), how well they solve the interpretation problem of noun phrases, and the mapping from one list to another are provided in a companion paper (Girju, 2007)."

Word-Net 2.1: flower#2 is a \"reproductive organ of angiosperm plants especially one having showy or colorful parts\", while flower#1 is \"a plant cultivated for its blooms or blossoms\").",

        "The annotators were also asked to identify the translation phrases, tag each instance with the corresponding semantic relation, and identify the semantic arguments Argi and Arg2 in the semantic argument frame of the corresponding relation.",
        "Thus, since the order of the semantic arguments in an NP is not fixed (Girju et al., 2005), the annotators were presented with the semantic argument frame for each of the 22 semantic relations and were asked to tag the NP instances accordingly.",

        "Translation instances",

        "Semantic relations",
        "Whenever the annotators found an example encoding a semantic relation or a preposition paraphrase other than those provided or they didn't know what interpretation to give, they had to tag it as other-sr and other-pp, respectively .",
        "For example, in the CLUVI sentences (4) and (5) below, the noun phrases melody of the pearl and cry of death (the cry announcing death) were tagged as other-sr since here the context of the sentences does not indicate the association between the two nouns.",
        "Moreover, noun compound instances such as the corner box and knowledge searches were tagged as other-pp (box in the corner, searches after knowledge).",

        "(En.)",
        "Moreover, most of the time one instance was tagged with one semantic relation, and respectively preposition paraphrase, but there were also situations in which an example could belong to more than one classification category in the same context.",
        "For example, Texas city is tagged as part-whole/place-area, but also as a location relation using the 22-SR classification category, and respectively as of, from, in based on the 8-PP category (e.g., city of Texas, city from Texas, and city in Texas).",
        "Other instances, however, can encode a total of three semantic relations in a particular context.",
        "One such instance is cup#2 of hotjchocolate#1 in example (6) below, which was tagged in CLUVI as measure/other(content-container)/loc.",
        "Sense #2 of cup in WordNet refers to \"the quantity the cup will hold\" (cf. Word-Net 2.1), thus mostly indicating a measure relation.",
        "However, since most hot beverages (such as tea, coffee, and chocolate) are served in cups, it stands to reason that the instance can be easily paraphrased as a cup holding hold chocolate.",
        "Although our current NP interpretation system (Girju, 2007) does not differentiate between location and contentcontainer (as other researchers (Tyler and Evans, 2003), we consider content-container as a special type of location), we capture them in our annotation scheme.",
        "Other examples of multiple annotations are measure/part-whole (e.g., an abundance of buildings, a bunch ofguys), Overall, 0.5% Europarl and 6.9% CLUVI instances were tagged with more than one semantic relation, and almost all noun compound instances were tagged with more than one preposition.",
        "Thus, the annotated instances used in the corpus analysis and system training phases have the following format: <NPEn ;NPEs; NP1t; NPFr; NPPort; NPRo; target>.",
        "The word target is one of the 23 (22 + other) semantic relations or one of the eight prepositions considered.",
        "For example, <judgment#2/Argi of presidency#2/Arg2; valoracion sobre la Presidencia; avis sur la presidence; giudizio sulla Pres-idenza; veredicto sobre a Presidencia; evaluarea Presedinfiei; theme>.",
        "The annotators' agreement was measured using Kappa statistics, one of the most frequently used measure of inter-annotator agreement for classification tasks: K = Pr(-pTpE)E'>, where Pr(A) is the proportion of times the annotators agree and Pr(E) is the probability of agreement by chance.",
        "The K coefficient is 1 if there is a total agreement among the annotators, and 0 if there is no agreement other than that expected to occur by chance.",
        "The Kappa values obtained on each corpus are shown in Table 2.",
        "We also computed the number of pairs that were tagged with other by both annotators for each semantic relation and preposition paraphrase, over the number of examples classified in that category by at least one of the judges.",
        "For the noun compound instances that encoded more than one classification category, the agreement was done on one of the relations only.",
        "The agreement obtained for the Europarl corpus is higher than the one for CLUVI on both classification sets.",
        "This is partially explained by the distribution of semantic relations in both corpora.",
        "overall, the K coefficient shows a fair to good level of agreement for the corpus data on the set of 22-SRs, taking into consideration the task difficulty.",
        "The level of agreement for the prepositional paraphrases was much higher.",
        "All these can be explained by the instructions the annotators received prior to the annotation and by their expertise in lexical semantics.",
        "Table 2: The inter-annotator agreement on the NP annotation on the two corpora.",
        "For the noun compound instances that encoded more than one semantic classification category, the agreement was done on one of the relations only.",
        "\"N/A\" means not applicable.",
        "13.05% of Europarl and 1.9% of CLUVI instances that could not be tagged with Lauer's prepositions were included in other-pp category.",
        "About 99% of the Europarl N N instances encode type relations (e.g., framework law), while in CLUVI most of them were type (e.g., nightmare sensation), followed by other-sr (e.g., altar boys), and is-a (e.g., Winchester carbine).",
        "From the initial corpus we considered those English instances that had all the translations encoded by N N and N P N. Out of these, we selected only 1,023 Europarl and 1,008 CLUVI instances encoded by N N and N P N in all languages considered and resulted after agreement.",
        "We split the corpora using a 8:2 training - test ratio and used it to train and test our system.",
        "Details about the experiments and the results obtained are presented in (Girju, 2007)."

        "In this paper we presented some observations on our experience with an annotation scheme that was used in the training of a state-of-the-art noun phrase semantic interpretation system.",
        "These observations are defined in the framework of a larger project.",
        "This project is to investigate various linguistic issues and develop specific language models for the interpretation of noun phrase constructions in Germanic, Romance, and other classes of languages.",
        "Our approach to NP interpretation, and thus annotation procedure, is novel in several ways.",
        "We define the problem in a cross-linguistic framework and provide empirical observations on various annotation issues based on a set of two different corpora using two state-of-the-art classification tag sets: Lauer's prepositions and our list of 22 relations.",
        "The linguistic implications are also important to mention here.",
        "The annotation investigations done in this research provide new insights into the research topic at hand, the semantic interpretation of noun phrases, in particular and the identification of semantic relations between nominals (irrespective of the syntactic constructions that link the two nouns), in general.",
        "One such linguistic aspect is the importance of context for this task.",
        "Sometimes, the local context of the noun phrase is not enough to disambiguate the underlying instances.",
        "For this, the annotators need to relay on world and domain specific knowledge and the entire context of the sentence, or consider a larger context window (from a simple paragraph including the sentence, to the discourse of the text) as shown below in (6), (7), and (8).",
        "In (6) and (7), for example, neither the context of the sentence, nor the context of their paragraph provide the meaning of the NPs.",
        "Many of the CLUVI instances tagged as other-sr (such as the music of the pearl in (6)), are naming phrases - they were defined only once in the text collection and later on mentioned to refer to the initial concept.",
        "In (8), on the other hand, the meaning of the NP the destruction ofthe Palestinian Authority is theme and not agent as might be considered by default.",
