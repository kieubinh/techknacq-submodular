        "Geometric constraints that are associated with projective prepositions need to be such that they are met by positive uses such as (1) and violated by negative uses such as (2).",
        "Given that these sentences are appropriate uses to describe Figure 1, the spatial scene should meet the constraints that are associated with to the right ofand violate the constraints of to the left of.",
        "It is obvious that this dual question of true or false invokes the issue of vagueness: We may find utterances describing a particular spatial scene and also their negations describing the same scene.",
        "For example, the following positive use of above may be appropriate to describe the spatial scene above The circle is above the rectangle - but also the corresponding negative use in the sentence The circle is not above the rectangle.",

        "In contrast to other approaches that report empirical studies on geometric conditions of projective prepositions (Kelleher, 2003; Crawford et al., 2000; Logan and Sadler, 1996; Gapp, 1995; Abella, 1995) the resource used in this paper enables us to study their use in conversation.",

        "Although projective prepositions are in general sensitive to extra-geometric influences, e.g. dynamic LOs and ROs and functional relations between LO and RO (Coventry and Garrod, 2004), we do not expect that such effects play a role in the data, because the domain is static and it hardly contains any pairs of objects with a functional relationship.",
