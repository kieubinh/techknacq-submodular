        "It is obvious that this dual question of true or false invokes the issue of vagueness: We may find utterances describing a particular spatial scene and also their negations describing the same scene.",
        "For example, the following positive use of above may be appropriate to describe the spatial scene above The circle is above the rectangle - but also the corresponding negative use in the sentence The circle is not above the rectangle.",
