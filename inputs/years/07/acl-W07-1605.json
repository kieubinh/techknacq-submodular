        "It has been claimed that D-PPs are mostly idiomatic and not productive.",
        "Hence, computational grammars often include D-PPs only as stock phrases or listed multiword expressions and do not offer a grammatical treatment.",
        "However, both claims have to be doubted seriously.",
        "Kiss (2006, 2007) shows that the class of D-PPs does not contain more idiomatic phrases than a typical phrasal category should and also argues against a 'light P hypothesis' which allows a pseudo-compositional treatment of D-PPs by ignoring the semantics of the preposition altogether.",

        "As has been pointed out by Kiss (2006, 2007), speakers of German can neither freely produce sequences consisting of unter and determinerless N projections (typically a noun) nor can they judge such constructions in isolation.",
        "In addition, not even very similar nouns can be interchanged in a D-PP, as can be witnessed by comparing near-synonyms Voraussetzung and Prämisse which both translate as prerequisite, or as provided in the examples in (2).",
