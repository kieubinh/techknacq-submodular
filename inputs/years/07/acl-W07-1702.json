        "To produce a Named Entity Recognition and Classification (NERC) system for a lesser spread Slavic language like Croatian could be a task which differs a lot from the task of building such a system for a language like English, German or French.",
        "Compared to them, Croatian language has more elaborated inflectional system and more freedom in the word order within the sentence.",
        "Besides, the resources and tools needed for producing such a system (POS/MSD tagger, sentence segmentator, chunker, lexicons or gazetteers etc.)",
        "are not widely available.",
        "But still we can say that even in languages with that kind of structural properties like Slavic languages have, named entities (NE) form a subset of natural language expressions that demonstrates relatively predictable structures.",
        "It could be questioned whether the relatively free word order in Croatian also covers the named entities (how much it influences their internal structure and their position in a sentence structure).",
        "What we also aim at in this paper is to investigate the possibility to describe NE with relatively simple rule-based systems i.e. whether it is possible to describe and classify NE in Croatian using regular grammars.",
        "The next part of the paper describes basic methodology of our system.",
        "The third part presents strategies for NERC which have been converted into rules.",

      "text": [
        "This NERC system for Croatian is based on handmade rules encoded in transducers which are applied in a cascade (Abney, 1996).",
        "The reason for selecting this method was simple.",
        "Since this is the first NERC system for Croatian, and there were no previous solutions for any particular NE class, we had to split the general NERC problem to a set of smaller locally manageable problems covering not just broad NE classes, but also their subclasses which were recognized by characteristic patterns.",
        "In such a way the set of rules could be kept under control and modules covering different parts of a problem could be called when needed in the runtime.",
        "In the same time the development time is shorter and the system is more consistent.",
        "Every transducer in our system represents a local grammar (Gross, 1993) dedicated to the description of a part of a sentence i.e. local linguistic expression.",
        "The orientation to a local description where the simpler (and more certain) cases are solved first, followed by more complex ones, gives more precision to the whole system.",
        "This \"island of certainty\" principle (Abney, 1996:11) is also used in our NERC system.",
        "The system uses the principle of the \"longest match\" as any other NERC system: in the case of more than one possible expression recognized by rules several different rules, system chooses the longest one.",
        "In this way potentially ambiguous NEs are being dynamically disambiguated (see e1 where Madunic Ltd. would be recognized and classified as organization NE because of the principle of the \"longest match\" which also included Ltd and thus avoiding matching only family name Madunic from the lexicon of names)."

      "text": [
        "In this section we will discuss the basic strategies that have been used in different NERC systems and their applicability for Croatian.",
        "The simple NER could be done by direct match of text with the list of NEs.",
        "Even if we previously solve the problem of inflection, such an approach would result with a lot of errors.",
        "In the example",
        "el: Znali smo da je Madunic d.o.o.",
        "u vlasnistvu njegova oca.",
        "(We knew that Madunic Ltd is a property of his father.)",
        "the expression Madunic could be wrongly recognized and classified as a family name.",
        "Even that result can be questionable since it may happen that this very name is not in the list of family names.",
        "Better results could be gained by using more information i.e. features which already exist in NEs.",
        "One of features for personal names are titles such as dr., mr., prof., ing.",
        "etc., for company names characteristic strings are d.o.o.",
        "(Ltd), d.d.",
        "(S.A., GmBH) etc.",
        "Such explicit strings are called internal evidence (McDonald 1996:22) and usually form a part of NE.",
        "On the other hand the example such as:",
        "e2: Danas je stiglo pismo iz poduzeca \"Euro Bakovic\".",
        "(A letter from the firm \"'Buro Bakovic\" arrived today. )",
        "would yield simple person name Duro Dakovic if the contextual information of NE (i.e. string po-duzeca/the firm and usage of quotes) is not taken into account.",
        "NEs often refer to certain classes such as institutions, hospitals, schools, persons, etc.",
        "Such contextual feature is called external evidence (McDonald 1996:22) and its recognition is mostly used as a classification criterion i.e. class membership proof.",
        "In the case illustrated by the following example:",
        "e3: U klinici za infektivne bolesti \"Dr. Fran Mihaljevic\" tog je dana bila guzva.",
        "(It was crowded that day at the clinic for infectuous diseases \"Dr. Fran Mihaljevic\" .)",
        "the external evidence is often decisive for NERC.",
        "In e3 the internal evidence (Dr.) represents a strong argument for a person NE, but only contextual external evidence (klinici/the clinic and quotes) gives the right solution.",
        "The external evidences are crucial for NERC in any language but they also have an important role during the system development.",
        "They can be useful when a list of names is not complete - an external evidence is taking the role of an additional proof.",
        "They can also reduce the need for elaborated internal evidence checking when rules are being build.",
        "The internal and external evidence is being used by all NERC systems such as LTG (Mikheev et al.",
        "1999), FASTUS (Hobbs et al.",
        "1997), Proteus (Yangarber, Grishman, 1998).",
        "Sometimes during the processing there is a need for storing information which are relevant only for a current text/discourse/document.",
        "Such information are usually stored in a dynamic lexicon where temporarily relevant information are stored and used for the processing of a current document.",
        "Dynamic lexicon entries are being collected from the confident contexts and usually are being used for tagging words which could be NEs but there is not enough external evidences for that.",
        "Dynamic lexicon could store all possible variants of a NE (a person) such as the full name and family name including middle initial, only family name, only name, only initials including all inflectional word-forms etc.",
        "In the case of companies, it could include the long company name, its shorter version and/or acronym.",
        "Distribution of acronyms shows that they frequently appear without internal and/or external evidences which are present with the full name (e.g. instead of the full name Investi-cijsko-komercijalna banka, in the text there is only Banka or only 1KB).",
        "In such cases all tokens forming an NE and all their combinations are stored in the dynamic lexicon (Mikheev et al.",
        "1999:5).",
        "In our case it would be also Investicijsko-komercijalna, komercijalna banka, Investicijska banka, and also an acronym derived from the first letters of all tokens (IKB).",
        "Dynamic lexicon are used by a numer of NERC systems such as ones described in (Mikheev et al.",
        "1998), (McDonald 1996) and (Piskorski et al.",
        "2000).",
        "This strategy is used for solving complex ambiguities (Mikheev, 1999).",
        "The initial position in the sentence is one of such ambiguous spots.",
        "If the NE is complex e.g. has a conjuncted structure, its solving can be quite a difficult task.",

        "e4: Osiguranje Zagreb i Primosten potpisali su ugovor o suradnji.",
        "(Insurance Zagreb and Primosten countersigned an agreement on cooperation. )",
        "e5: Osiguranje Ivicu i Horvatu nije isplatilo naknadu.",
        "(Insurance didn't pay the benefit to Ivic and Horvat.)",
        "The token (Osiguranje) which in e4 is a part of NE (Osiguranje Zagreb) is also a common noun and is capitalized since it is in the initial sentence position.",
        "The second NE (Primosten) is from the list of locations but it could be also a part of conjunction (Osiguranje Zagreb i Osiguranje Primosten) which is shortened or forms a unique NE (Osigu- ranje Zagreb i Primosten).",
        "In the e5 there is no ambiguitiy since Ivicu and Horvatu are person NEs and being in dative case clearly show that they do not belong to the same NE with Osiguranje (being in nominative case).",
        "Conjunction i ('and') can be syntactically interpreted in two ways: it can serve as a connector of two separate NEs (Pliva i INA) or can be a part of NE (Buhic i sinovi; Vodoopskrba i odvodnja).",
        "This cases can be solved with a strategy that presupposes that at least there will be one unambiguous position for the same NE in the text.",
        "Solving the e4 example could be formulated in several steps.",
        "1) all possible subsets of expression (Osiguranje Zagreb i Primosten; Osiguranje Zagreb; Osiguranje Primosten; Zagreb i Primosten; Primosten...) should be stored in a dynamic lexicon; 2) if any of this substrings is detected in the text in an unambiguous position:",

        "the system can test that they are separate NEs and resolve the role of conjunction.",
        "A proper solution for categorising Primosten is derived from this as well, since the coordinative conjunction i will usually connect the NEs from the same category (Mikheev, 1999).",
        "This strategy is used in systems by Mikheev et al.",
        "(1999) and Wacholder (1997).",
        "Ambiguous tokens, where the same string can refer to a common noun in common usage or as a part of NE, are quite common in texts (e.g. a token Sunce in initial sentence position can be a common noun but it has been recorded that it can also be a name of investment fund or insurance company).",
        "Since texts are meant to be understood by readers (even when shortening and compressing procedures are used by authors) it is very rare that the same token has different meanings within the same text.",
        "Gale, Church and Yarowsky (1992) formed a hypothesis that ambiguous words have a strong tendency of keeping a single meaning in the same text/discourse.",
        "It has been experimentally proven up to 98% of cases.",
