        "Proper names constitute a significant part of natural language texts (estimated to about 10% in newspaper articles) and are important for NLP applications, such as Information Extraction, which rely on automatic text understanding.",
        "In particular, corefer-ence resolution (e.g., identifying several name variants as referring to the same entity) plays a crucial role in such systems.",
        "Although automatic recognition of proper names in English, French and other major languages has been in the research focus for over a decade now, cf. (Bikel et al., 1997), (Borth-wick, 1999), (Li et al., 2003), only a few efforts have been reported for Slavic languages, cf. (Cunningham et al., 2003) (Russian and Bulgarian), (Pisko-rski, 2005) (Polish).",
        "Rich inflection and a more relaxed word order make recognition of proper names in Slavic more difficult than for other languages.",
        "Moreover, inflection of proper names is usually",
        "!The research presented in this paper was partially founded by the Ministry of Education and Science (Poland), grant number 3T11C00727.",
        "quite different from common nouns, which complicates the lemmatization process necessary for correct coreference resolution.",
        "In this paper, we focus on lemmatization of Polish person names, the most idiosyncratic class of proper names in this language.",
        "First, we report results of a rule-based symbolic approach.",
        "We apply different heuristics, mostly based on the internal (morphological and syntactic) structure of proper names but also on the surrounding context.",
        "Sometimes, however, the required information is not available, even if the entire document is considered, and lemmatization cannot be performed.",
        "Therefore, we experimented with various knowledge-poor methods, namely string distance metrics, in order to test their usefulness for lemmatization of Polish person names as an alternative technique, especially for cases where document-level heuristics are insufficient.",
        "Lemmatization of proper names in Slavic has not attracted much attention so far but some work has been done for Slovene: (Erjavec et al., 2004) present a machine-learning approach to lemmatization of unknown single-token words, whereas (Pouliquen et al., 2005) report on a shallow approach to find base forms.",
        "The organization of the paper is as follows.",
        "First, we present a description of phenomena which make lemmatization of Polish person names a difficult task.",
        "Next, a rule-based approach and its evaluation are presented.",
        "Then, various string distance metrics are introduced, followed by the results of experiments on newspaper texts.",

      "text": [
        "Polish is a West Slavic language with rich nominal inflection: nouns and adjectives are inflected for case, number and gender.",
        "There are 7 cases, 2 numbers and traditionally 3 genders are distinguished: masculine, feminine and neuter.",
        "Just like common nouns, Polish person names undergo declension but their inflectional patterns are more complicated.",
        "A typical Polish name consists of a first name and a last name; unlike in Russian or Bulgarian, there are no patronymics.",
        "Additionally, titles (e.g., dr 'Phd', inz.",
        "'engineer', prof. 'professor') or honorific forms (pan 'Mr.'",
        "or pani 'Mrs./Miss') are often used.",
        "In general, both the first and the last name can be inflected, e.g., Jan Kowalski (nominative) vs. Jana Kowalskiego (genitive/accusative).",
        "If the surname is also a regular word form, things get more complicated.",
        "Whether the last name can be inflected in such cases depends on several factors, e.g., on the gender of the first name, a category (part-of-speech) and gender of the (common) word used as a surname.",
        "For instance, if the surname is a masculine noun, it is inflected only if the first name is also masculine.",
        "This is illustrated in Table 1 with declension of the male name Kazimierz Polak 'Casimir Pole' and its variant with the female first name Kazimiera.",
        "If the surname is an adjective (e.g., Niski 'Short'), it is inflected (according to the adjectival paradigm) and agrees in gender with the first name, i.e., male and female last name forms are different (e.g., Niski 'Short' (masc.)",
        "vs. Niska 'Short' (fem.)).",
        "The declension of foreign surnames may strongly depend on their origin, and in particular on the pronunciation.",
        "For example, the name Wilde is pronounced differently in English and German, which impacts its declension in Polish.",
        "If it's of English origin, a nominal declension is applied, i.e., Wilde'a (gen.), whereas if it comes from German, an adjective-like declension is adopted: Wildego (gen.).",
        "Declension of surnames which are also common nouns can be different from the declension of common nouns.",
        "In Table 2, we present a comparison of the common noun golab 'dove' in singular and plural with the corresponding forms used for the surname.",
        "A comprehensive overview of this rather intriguing declension paradigm of Polish names is given in (Grzenia, 1998).",
        "Finally, first name forms present problems as well.",
        "Foreign masculine first names, whose pronounced version ends in a consonant or whose written version ends in -a, -o, y or i do in general get inflected (e.g., Jacques (nom.)",
        "vs. Jacques'a (gen./acc.",
        ")), whereas names whose pronounced version ends in a vowel and are stressed on the last syllable (e.g., François) usually do not change form.",
        "For female first names created from a male first name, e.g., Jôzef (masc.)",
        "vs. Jôzefa (fem.",
        "), there is a frequent homonymy between the nominative form of the female name and the genitive/accusative form of the corresponding male form, e.g., Jôzefa is nominative of Jôzefa (fem.)",

        "The text fragment Dane Federalnego in (2) is recognized by the grammar as a person name since Dane is a gazetteer entry for a foreign (English) first name.",
        "Consequently, Federalnego Urzedu Statys-tycznego could not be recognized as an organization name.",
        "Potentially, heuristics solving such NE overlapping collisions could improve the precision.",

        "In (3) and (4) the names Della of Dell' and Austri-akow of Austrians' were erroneously recognized as surnames.",
        "The rule matching a token representing a title followed by a capitalized word, adopted for English person names, is less reliable for Polish due to declension of proper names and lack of prepositions in genitive constructions.",
        "One solution to this problem would involve matching Della and Aus-triakow with their base forms (Dell and Austriacy, resp.",
        "), which might appear in the immediate context.",
        "In this way, the name type could be validated.",
        "However, a corpus inspection revealed that quite frequently no base form appears in the same document.",
        "The last example, (5), illustrates another problem, which is even harder to solve.",
        "The phrase prezes spolki Kruk is structurally ambiguous, i.e., it can be bracketed as [prezes [spolki Kruk]] or [[prezes spolki] Kruk].",
        "Consequently, the name Kruk might either refer to a company name ( .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "said the president of the Kruk company') or to a person name ( .",
        ".",

        "said Kruk, the president of the company').",
        "Inferring the proper interpretation might not be possible even if we consider the subcategorization frame of the verb powiedzietc 'to say'.",
        "For evaluation of recognition and lemmatization of person names, a set of 30 articles on various topics (politics, finance, sports, culture and science) has been randomly chosen from Rzeczpospolita (Weiss, 2007), a leading Polish newspaper.",

        "As for the last name Belki, it is a genitive form of the common Polish noun belka 'beam', so the base form can be obtained directly.",
        "Nevertheless, as inflection of proper names differs from that of common nouns, various combinations of the regular noun Belka and the special proper name form Belki are possible, which increases ambiguity of the identified form.",

      "heading": "4. Application of String Distance Metrics for Lemmatization",
      "text": [
        "Since knowledge-based lemmatization of Polish NEs is extremely hard, we also explored a possibility of using string distance metrics for matching inflected person names with their base forms (and their variants) in a collection of document, rather than within a single document.",
        "The rest of this section describes our experiments in using different string distance metrics for this task, inspired by the work presented in (Cohen et al., 2003) and (Christen, 2006).",
        "The problem can be formally defined as follows.",
        "Let A, B and C be three sets of strings over some alphabet E, with B C C. Further, let f : A – B be a function representing a mapping of inflected forms (A) into their corresponding base forms (B).",
        "Given, A and C (the search space), the task is to construct an approximation of f, namely f : A – C. If f(a) = f (a) for a e A, we say that f returns the correct answer for a; otherwise, f is said to return an incorrect answer.",
        "For another task, a multi-result experiment, we construct an approximation f * : A – 2C, where f * returns the correct answer for a if f (a) e f *(a).",
        "In our experiments, we have explored mainly character-level string metrics applied by the database community for record linkage.",
        "Our point of departure is the well-known Lev-enshtein edit distance metric specified as the minimum number of character-level operations (insertion, deletion or substitution) required for transforming one string into another (Levenshtein, 1965) and bag distance metric (Bartolini et al., 2002) which is a time-efficient approximation of the Lev-enshtein metric.",
        "Next, we have tested the Smith-Waterman (Smith and Waterman, 1981) metric, which is an extension of Levenshtein metric and allow a variable cost adjustment to edit operations and an alphabet mapping to costs.",
        "Another group of string metrics we explored is based on a comparison of character-level n-grams in two strings.",
        "The q-gram metric (Ukkonen, 1992) is computed by counting the number of q-grams contained in both strings.",
        "An extension to q-grams is to add positional information, and to match only common q-grams that occur at a specified distance from each other (positional q-grams) (Gravano et al., 2001).",
        "Finally, the skip-gram metric (Keskustalo et al., 2003) is based on the idea that in addition to forming bigrams of adjacent characters, bigrams that skip characters are considered as well.",
        "Gram classes are defined that specify what kind of skip-grams are created, e.g. {0,1} class means that regular bigrams (0 characters skipped) and bigrams that skip one character are formed.",
        "We have explored {0,1}, {0,2} and {0,1,2} gram classes.",
        "Taking into account the Polish declension paradigm, we also added a basic metric based on the longest common prefix, calculated as follows:",
        "where lcp(s,t) denotes the longest common prefix for s and t. The symbol 6 is a parameter for favoring certain suffix pairs in s (t).",
        "We have experimented with two variants: CP^ with 6 = 0 and CP<s2, where 6 is set to 1 if s ends in: o, y, a, e, and t ends in an a, or 0 otherwise.",
        "The latter setting results from empirical study of the data and the declension paradigm.",
        "For coping with multi-token strings, we tested a similar metric called longest common substrings (LCS) (Christen, 2006), which recursively finds and removes the longest common substring in the two strings compared, up to a specified minimum length.",
        "Its value is calculated as the ratio of the sum of all found longest common substrings to the length of the longer string.",
        "We extended LCS by additional weighting the lengths of the longest common substrings.",
        "The main idea is to penalize the longest common substrings which do not match the beginning of a token in at least one of the compared strings.",
        "In such cases, the weight for lcs(s, t) (the longest common substring for s and t) is computed as follows.",
        "Let a denote the maximum number of non-whitespace characters which precede the first occurrence of lcs(s,t) in s or t. Then, lcs(s,t) is assigned the weight:",
        "where p has been experimentally set to 4.",
        "We refer to the 'weighted' variant of LCS as WLCS.",
        "Good results for name-matching tasks (Cohen et al., 2003) have been reported using the Jaro metric and its variant, the Jaro-Winkler (JW) metric (Winkler, 1999).",
        "These metrics are based on the number and order of common characters in two compared strings.",
        "We have extended the Jaro-Winkler metric to improve the comparison of multi-token strings.",
        "We call this modification JWM and it can be briefly characterized as follows.",
        "Let J(s,t) denote the value of the Jaro metric for s and t. Then, let s = s1... sK and t = t1... tL, where s» (tj) represent i-th token of s and t respectively, and assume, without loss of generality, L < K. JWM(s,t) is defined as:",
        "where 6 denotes the common prefix adjustment factor and boostp is calculated as follows:",
        "The main idea behind JWM is to boost the Jaro similarity for strings with the highest number of agreeing initial characters in the corresponding tokens in the compared strings.",
        "Finally, for multi-token strings, we tested a recursive matching pattern, known also as Monge-Elkan distance (Monge and Elkan, 1996).",
        "The intuition behind this measure is the assumption that a token in s (strings are treated as sequences of tokens) corresponds to a token in t which has the highest number of agreeing characters.",
        "The similarity between s and t is the mean of these maximum scores.",
        "Two further metrics for multi-token strings were investigated, namely Sorted-Tokens and Permuted-Tokens.",
        "The first one is computed in two steps: (a) first, tokens forming a full string are sorted alphabetically, and then (b) an arbitrary metric is applied to compute the similarity for the 'sorted' strings.",
        "The latter compares all possible permutations of tokens forming the full strings and returns the calculated maximal similarity value.",
        "A detailed description of string metrics used here is given in (Christen, 2006) and in (Piskorski et al., 2007).",
        "For the experiments on coreference of person names, we used two resources: (a) a lexicon of the most frequent Polish first names (PL-F(IRST)-NAMES) consisting of pairs of an inflected form and the corresponding base form, and (b) an analogous lexicon of inflected full person names (first name + surname) (PL-FULL-NAMES).",
        "The latter resource was created semi-automatically as follows.",
        "We have automatically extracted a list of 22485 full person-name candidates from a corpus of 15724 on-line news articles from Rzeczpospolita by using PL-F-NAMES lexicon and an additional list of 30000 uninflected foreign first names.",
        "Subsequently, we have randomly selected a subset of about 1900 entries (inflected forms) from this list.",
        "In basic experiments, we simply used the base forms as the search space.",
        "Moreover, we produced variants of PL-F-NAMES and PL-FULL-NAMES by adding to the search space base forms of foreign first names and a complete list of full names extracted from the Rzeczpospolita corpus, respectively.",
        "Table 3 gives an overview of our test datasets.",
        "Since for a given string more than one answer can be returned, we measured the accuracy in three ways.",
        "First, we calculated the accuracy on the assumption that a multi-result answer is incorrect and we defined all-answer accuracy (AA) measure which penalizes multi-result answers.",
        "Second, we measured the accuracy of single-result answers (single-result accuracy (SR)) disregarding the multi-result answers.",
        "Finally, we used a weaker measure which treats a multi-result answer as correct if one of the results in the answer set is correct (relaxed-all-answer accuracy (RAA)).",
        "Let s denote the number of strings for which a single result (base form) was returned.",
        "Analogously, m is the number of strings for which more than one result was returned.",
        "Let sc and mc denote, respectively, the number of correct single-result answers returned and the number of multi-result answers containing at least one correct result.",
        "The accuracy metrics are computed as: AA = sc/(s + m), SR = sc/s, and RAA = (sc + mc)/(s + m).",
        "We started our experiments with the PL-F-NAME dataset and applied all but the multi-token strings distance metrics.",
        "The results of the accuracy evaluation are given in Table 4.",
        "The first three columns give the accuracy figures, whereas the column labeled AV gives an average number of results returned in the answer set.",
        "Interestingly, the simple linguistically-aware common prefix-based measure turned out to work best in the AA category, which is the most relevant one, whereas WLCS metrics is the most accurate in case of single-result answers and the RAA category.",
        "Thus, a combination of the two seems to be a reasonable solution to further improve the performance (i.e., if WLCS provides a single answer, return this answer, otherwise return the answer of CPs2).",

        "For Slavic languages, rich and idiosyncratic inflection of proper names presents a serious problem for lemmatization.",
        "In this paper we investigated two different techniques for finding base forms of person names in Polish.",
        "The first one employs heuristics and linguistic knowledge.",
        "This method does not provide optimal results at the moment as necessary tools and linguistic resources, e.g., amorpho-logical generator or a subcategorization lexicon, are still underdeveloped for Polish.",
        "Moreover, contextual heuristics do not always find a solution as the required information might not be present in a single document.",
        "Therefore, we considered string distance metrics as an alternative approach.",
        "The results of applying various measures indicate that for first names, simple common prefix (CP<s) metric obtains the best results for all-answer accuracy, whereas the weighted longest common substrings (WLCS) measure provides the best score for the single-result accuracy.",
        "Hence, a combination of these two metrics seems the most appropriate knowledge-poor technique for lemmatizing Polish first names.",
        "As for full names, our two modifications (WLCS and JWM) of standard distance metrics and CP<s obtain good results as internal metrics for recursive measures and as standalone measures.",
