        "Information extraction from natural language text has become an important task for NLP applications during the last years.",
        "In the era of huge text data collections, these methods allows us to perform searches within reasonable time.",
        "For the purpose of IE, many methods based on very different approaches (formal grammars, statistics, artificial intelligence) have already been elaborated.",
        "In spite of a great number of described experiments, the invented methods were untested on Polish texts.",
        "Nowadays, there is great interest in statistical and machine learning methods, e.g. (Bunescu et al., 2003), but applying machine learning techniques to Polish texts is difficult, as there are hardly any annotated Polish data (excluding morpho-syntactic information which is available).",
        "The second obstacle was the type of chosen data - relatively low number of available records with complex text.",
        "That is why we decided to carry out a rule-based IE systern.",
        "Below, we present the system selecting information from diabetic patients' hospital records written in unrestricted Polish.",
        "We defined a domain dependent set of rules basing on an expert's knowledge and tested them on the previously unseen reports.",
        "The extracted data were put into a database allowing for statistical analysis.",
        "The other result of the project, the annotated set of original reports, can be further used for applying other methods of IE to these texts.",
        "In our project, we use the SProUT (Shallow Processing with Unification and Typed Feature Structures) system, (Drozdzyfiski et al., 2004).",
        "SProUT is a general purpose platform consisting of a set of components for basic linguistic operations.",
        "Grammar rules are regular expressions on typed feature structures (TFS) which are results of tokenization or morphological analysis, as well as information from the domain lexicon.",
        "SProUT differs from many other systems in that it allows for unification of TFSs thus allows more general extraction rules.",
        "Analysing Polish text is possible due to the integration (Pisko-rski et al., 2004) of Morfeusz, a morphological analyser for Polish (Wolinski, 2006).",
        "Although most biomedical IE activities are related to literature mining and terminology extraction, (e.g. (Bunescu et al., 2003), (Tveit and Saetre 2005)), clinical patients record mining is not a new research goal for all languages, e.g. (Hahn, Romacker and Schulz, 2002).",
        "In (Hripcsak et al., 2002) 24 clinical conditions were extracted from narrative chests radiographic reports.",
        "The task closest to the pre-",
        "!Our first rule-based IE experiment concerned mammography reports (Mykowiecka, Kupsc and Marciniak, 2004).",
        "sented here, i.e. searching for information contained in natural language patients' discharge summaries was undertaken in project MENELAS (Zweigenbaum, 1994) and AMBIT (Harkema et al., 2004).",
        "In the last one, the extraction rules were based on both syntactic (word category) and semantic information (e.g. latitude-noun or area-noun).",
        "83 radiology reports were processed and descriptions of lung cancers extracted and evaluated.",
        "The exemplary results for location were: 61% precision and 92% recall.",
        "Results of our experiment are shown in sections 4 and 6."
