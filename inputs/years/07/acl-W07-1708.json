        "The goal of this paper is to compile a method for multi-word term extraction, taking into account both the linguistic properties of Bulgarian terms and their statistical rates.",
        "Term extraction exploits well-established techniques that seem difficult to improve significantly.",
        "As in many other areas of computational linguistics, term extraction has been approached generally with three different strategies - linguistic techniques, statistical techniques and a combination of both (Bourigault et al., 2001; Jac-quemin & Bourigault, 2000).",
        "The linguistically based techniques exploit the morpho-syntactic structure of terms that usually differ from one language to another (for example in Bulgarian and in English the most frequent syntactic structure representing terms is the noun phrase, but the two languages significantly differ in their constituent structure and agreement properties).",
        "The automatic extraction of term morpho-syntactic patterns, being in most cases language-dependent, requires specific language processing - Part-of-speech (POS) tagging, lemmatization, syntactic parsing, etc.",
        "The statistical techniques, on the other hand, rely on the different statistical features of terms compared to other words in the text and are usually based on the detection of words and expressions with a frequency value higher than a given limit.",
        "Some of the statistical approaches focus on the association measures between the components of the multiword terms.",
        "Hybrid approaches, combining linguistic and statistical techniques, are also applied, mainly in two manners: statistical proceeding is used to filter the term candidates obtained through linguistic techniques, and, vice versa, some linguistic filters are exploited after statistical processing, in order to extract the statistically significant word combinations that match some given syntactic patterns.",
        "The method for automatic multi-word term extraction, presented in this paper, also relies both on linguistic knowledge and on statistical processing.",
        "The research aims are to:",
        "• Apply syntactic patterns of Bulgarian terms directed to multi-word term extraction;",
        "• Use well-known statistical methods (association measures) to eliminate some of the irrelevant multi-word terms;",
        "• Further limit the number of invalid terms by clustering term candidates around their lemmas;",
        "• Test the performance of such a method over the manually annotated corpus.",
        "Most of the current methods for automatic term extraction are developed for English, and thus they are not appropriate for direct adaptation to Bulgarian, due to the morpho-syntactic differences between the two languages.",
        "Bulgarian is a language with a rich inflectional system.",
        "That is to say, a noun lemma can appear in six forms if it is masculine and in four forms if it is feminine or neuter.",
        "Besides, noun phrase structure and agreement properties in Bulgarian differ in some aspects from other languages such as English, Therefore, a language-specific approach is needed if we want to utilise the morpho-syntactical information for term extraction.",
        "To the best of our knowledge there is no report of an extensive work directed towards Bulgarian term extraction.",
        "The structure of our paper outlines the three steps involved in our approach.",
        "In the following section we present a short linguistic analysis of Bulgarian terms.",
        "In the third section, we describe the identification of the candidate terms.",
        "The fourth section explains how we applied a list of terms to the filters.",
        "We then evaluate our results on a corpus that was set up by manual annotation.",

        "We share the views that larger corpora not only give statistically more reliable counts, but also reveal phenomena that are completely lacking in smaller samples.",
        "The Acquis Communautaire (AC) - the European Union legislation, which consists of approximately eight thousand documents containing approximately 40 million words (to be more specific, its Bulgarian subpart) - is targeted as the most appropriate resource for our research: because of its size, and because of the number of languages included in it.",
        "(The proposed method can be further transformed and/or evaluated to deal with the rest of the languages represented in the parallel corpus.)",
        "The AC contains documents from several domains, which are divided into chapters: Agriculture, Fisheries, Transport Policy, Taxation, Economic and Monetary Union, Statistics, Social",
        "Policy and Employment, Energy, Industrial Policy, Education and Training, Telecommunication and Information Technologies, Culture and Audiovisual Policy, etc.",
        "This annotated subpart of the Bulgarian AC is developed as a test corpus and contains 10,521 words from randomly selected text samples representing the domains of Agriculture (AGR), Energy (ENR) and Education and Training (EDC).",
        "Some criteria for the manual annotation of Bulgarian terms were defined, the notion of term among others.",
        "As with most linguistic concepts, a term is defined in various ways.",
        "For example, as \"a word or expression that has a precise meaning in some uses or is peculiar to a science, art, profession\" (Webster, 2002), or as \"a word or expression used for some particular thing\", or generally as words or phrases that denote specific concepts in a given subject domain.",
        "For the purposes of this investigation we defined a term as An open class word or expression that is peculiar to a specific domain of human activities and occurs with a determinate (in some limits) frequency in that domain.",
        "The annotation of terms in the Bulgarian AC subpart is also based on both the maximum and minimum length term selection.",
        "That is, in the case of a multi-word term which constituents are also terms, the longest term (as well as all shorter terms) is selected.",
        "It should be pointed out, however, that the term annotated corpus is still small enough to be representative of the word frequency and is a sample of translated texts that might manifest different tendencies for a term's distribution from those in the original texts.",
        "The general impression is that the most of the papers dealing with automatic term extraction (especially the statistically based ones) are focused on multi-word terms.",
        "This can be explained by the fact that for English a bigger percentage of multiword terms comparing to single-word terms is reported.",
        "To show the tendency for the correlation between single-word and multi-word terms in Bulgarian texts, the manually annotated subpart of the Bulgarian AC has been studied.",
        "We found out (Table 1.)",
        "that the proportion of single-word terms varies from about 2.5% to 3% depending on the subject domain.",
        "The results show that the use of single-word terms in Bulgarian technical documents is also not very frequent and the tendency is that multi-word terms are preferred to single-word ones.",
        "Following these observations, first we will concentrate on the extraction of the Bulgarian multi-word terms.",
        "Table 1.",
        "Distribution of single-word terms",
        "The starting point for the linguistically motivated part of the automatic term extraction is to describe the syntactic structure of Bulgarian terms.",
        "There are several Bulgarian terminological dictionaries published and some terminological databases available on the internet - all recourses are taken into consideration in the analysis without providing exact calculations.",
        "The collection of Bulgarian terms, obtained by the annotated subpart of the Bulgarian AC, is used as a source for the determination of the most frequent syntactic structures of Bulgarian terms.",
        "It is claimed that NPs constitute about 80-99 % of whole terms in an English text, with the varying percentage depending on the text types (Arppe, 1995).",
        "The same statement is roughly true for Bulgarian; although there are some adjectives and verbs that can be regarded as terms in a certain domain (only three verbs and one adjective are detected in the annotated corpus).",
        "In this study we have concentrated on the NPs' term extraction, which comprises the focus of interest in several studies (Jacquemin, 2001; Justeson & Katz, 1995; Voutanen, 1993).",
        "In order to obtain the statistics, the annotated part of Bulgarian AC is pre-processing.",
        "This allows the consequences of the categories constituting Bulgarian terms to be extracted and their frequency to be calculated.",
        "As a result, 16 different sequences of categories are obtained, among them 5 with a rate higher than 11 %.",
        "In the next examples the most frequent syntactic patterns of the Bulgarian multiword terms are listed following their frequency rate:",
        "• AN – riboloven sezon (fishing season),",
        "iglolistno darvo (conifer), zemedelski ceni (firm prices), termalna energiya (thermal energy), kli-matichna instalaciya (air-conditioning);• NpN – obogatyavane na gorivo (fuel enrichment), podobryavane na pochvata (soil improvement), prava na deteto (children's rights), svoboda napechata (freedom of the press);",

        "Among the five types, the AN structure was the most frequent one, although the exact percentage still remains to be calculated over the bigger corpus.",
        "The main differences observed concerning these five Bulgarian structures and their English equivalents are the regular agreement between the adjectival modifier and the head noun in Bulgarian and the prepositional phrase in Bulgarian instead the noun modifier in English.",
        "The adjective-noun agreement in Bulgarian noun phrases is partially exploited in the presented piece of work, but it might be extensively considered in further improvements of the method.",
        "In the case of NpN, NpAN and ANpN structures, we found out that most of the terms corresponding to these patterns are built up with the Bulgarian preposition na (of).",
        "This may be explained by the fact that these PPs usually correspond to the English NPs with a noun modifier denoting more specific concepts.",

        "And finally, the formation of word forms of each component of a multi-word term and the type of agreement dependencies between components show the classification of multi-word terms into grammatical types that describe the real word paradigm belonging to a particular term (Koeva, 2005).",

        "All extracted term candidates are grammatically correct, due to the syntactically based pattern matching.",
        "Further developments of the method include:",
        "• Statistical determination of single-word terms;",
        "• Coverage of long-distance occurrence and rare syntactic structures of multi-word terms;",
        "• Analyzing the embedded terms.",
        "• Using 'stop lists' of open and closed class words that are hardly to be found in the multiword terms.",
        "Some other experiments will be made using other well-known techniques of association measure.",
        "For the evaluation purposes the test corpus will be extended.",
        "A bigger homogeneous corpus would undoubtedly result in an increase in terms with more representative frequencies, and, therefore, in an improvement in statistical estimation of terms.",
        "The results can be exploited in the multilingual term extraction, due to the fact that the AC represents the biggest multilingual parallel corpus."
