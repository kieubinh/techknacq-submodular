        "The semantic nature of the derivational relations, however, was not systematically analyzed and labeled in EuroWordNet project.",
        "If we try to label the derivational relations semantically and include them in WordNet as a result we get two level network where on the higher level we have the ,main' semantic relations between synsets such as synonymy, near_syn-onymy, antonymy, hypero/hyponymy, meronymy and others and on the lower level there are relations like the derivational ones that hold rather between literals than between synsets.",
        "In the highly inflectional languages the derivational relations represent a system of semantic relations that definitely reflects cognitive structures that may be related to a language ontology.",
        "Such ontology undoubtedly exists but according to our knowledge it has not been written down yet.",

        "We will not be dealing with this topic here, it calls for a separate examination (project), 14. possessive relation (existing between different POS): noun -> adjective otec -> otcùv father -> father's), semantically it is a relation between an object (person) and its possession.",
        "We should mention two more relations that are sometimes regarded inflectional but in our view they belong here as well: gerund relation - verb -> adjective: (bojovat ->bojujici, fight -> fighting) and passive relation - verb -> adjective (passive participle): (ucit -> ucen, teach -> taught).",
