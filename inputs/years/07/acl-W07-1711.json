        "Determining the sense of an ambiguous word in a given context may benefit many NLP tasks, such as Machine Translation, Question Answering, or Text-to-Speech synthesis.",
        "The Word Sense Discrimination (WSD) or Word Sense Induction task consists of grouping together the occurrences of a semantically ambiguous term according to its senses.",
        "Word Sense Discrimination is similar to Word Sense Disambiguation, but allows for a more unsupervised approach to the problem, since it does not require a predefined set of senses.",
        "This is important, given the number of potentially ambiguous words in a language.",
        "Moreover, labeling an occurrence with its sense is not always necessary.",
        "For example, in Information Retrieval WSD would be useful for the identification of documents relevant to a query containing an ambiguous term.",
        "Different approaches to WSD have been proposed, but the evaluation is often conducted using a single language, so it is difficult to predict performance on another language.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, there has not been a systematic comparative analysis of WSD systems on different languages.",
        "Yet, it is interesting to see whether there are significant differences in performance when a method is applied to several languages that have different linguistic structures.",
        "Identifying the reasons for performance differences might suggest what features are useful for the task.",
        "The present project adopts an approach to WSD that is based on similarity measure between context terms of an ambiguous word.",
        "We compare the performance of an algorithm for WSD on English, Hebrew, and Russian, using lexically ambiguous words and corpora of similar sizes.",
        "We believe that testing on the above languages might give an idea about how accuracy of an algorithm for WSD is affected by language choice.",
        "Russian is a member of the Slavic language group and is morphologically rich.",
        "Verbs, nouns, and adjectives are characterized by a developed inflectional system, which results in a large number of wordforms.",
        "Hebrew is a Semitic language, and is complex in a different way.",
        "In addition to the root-pattern morphology that affects the word stem, it also has a complex verb declination system.",
        "Moreover, function words, such as prepositions and determiners, cliti-cize, thereby increasing the number of wordforms.",
        "Lastly, cliticization, coupled with the absence of short vowels in text, introduces an additional level of ambiguity for Hebrew.",
        "There are two main findings to this study.",
        "First, we show that the morphological complexity of the language affects the performance of the algorithm for WSD.",
        "Second, the lemma-based approach to Russian WSD significantly improves the results over the word-based approach.",
        "The rest of the paper is structured as follows: first, we describe previous work that is related to the project.",
        "Section 3 provides details about the algorithm for WSD that we use.",

        "Thus, senses are viewed as clusters of words.",
        "Another approach is based on clustering the occurrences of an ambiguous word in a corpus into clusters that correspond to distinct senses of the word.",
        "Based on this approach, a sense is defined as a cluster of contexts of an ambiguous word.",

        "He finds 50 most similar words to the target and clusters them into groups, the number of groups being the number of senses.",
        "He reports comparable results for the two languages, but he uses both morphologically and lexically ambiguous words.",
        "Moreover, the evaluation methodology focuses on the success of disambiguation for an ambiguous word, and reports the number of ambiguous words that were disambiguated successfully.",
        "Davidov and Rappoport (2006) describe an algorithm for unsupervised discovery of word categories and evaluate it on Russian and English corpora.",
        "However, the focus of their work is on the discovery of semantic categories and from the results they report for the two languages it is difficult to infer how the languages compare against each other.",

        "She reports that morphology is useful, but the focus is on derivational morphology of the English language.",
        "In the present context, we are interested in the effect of inflectional morphology on WSD, especially for languages, such as Russian and Hebrew.",

        "Our algorithm relies on the method for selection of relevant contextual terms and on distance measure between them introduced in (Sproat and van Santen, 1998) and on the approach described in (Schütze, 1998), though the details of clustering differ slightly.",
        "The intuition behind the algorithm can be summarized as follows: (1) words that occur in the context of the ambiguous word are useful for determining its sense; and (2) contextual terms of an ambiguous word belong to topics corresponding to the senses of the ambiguous word.",
        "Before describing the algorithm in detail, we give an overview of the system.",
        "The algorithm starts by collecting all the occurrences of an ambiguous word in the corpus together with the surrounding context.",
        "Next, we build a symmetric distance matrix D, where rows and columns correspond to context terms, and D[i][j] is the distance value of term i and term j.",
        "The distance measure is supposed to reflect how the two terms are close semantically (whether they are related to the same topic).",
        "For example, we would expect the distance between the words financial and money to be smaller than the distance between the words financial and river: The first pair is more likely to occur in the same context, than the second one.",
        "Using the distance measure, the context terms are partitioned into sense clusters.",
        "Finally, we group the sentences containing the ambiguous word into sentence clusters using the context term clusters.",

        "Term weights are used to select context terms that will be helpful in determining the sense of the ambiguous word in a particular context.",

        "Experiment 2 compares the performance for Russian in two settings: with and without morphological processing performed on the context terms.",
        "Table 2 presents experimental results.",
        "Baseline is computed by assigning the most common sense to all occurrences of the ambiguous word.",
        "We observe that English achieves the highest performance both in terms of cluster purity and FScore, while Russian performs most poorly among the three languages.",
        "This behavior may be correlated with the average frequency of the context terms that are used to construct the distance matrix in the corpus (cf. 7 for English and 4.2 for Russian).",
        "In particular, the difference in the frequencies can be attributed to the morphological complexity of Russian, as compared to English and Hebrew.",
        "Hebrew is more complex than English morphologically, which would account for a drop in performance for the Hebrew words vs. the English words.",
        "Furthermore, one would expect a higher degree of ambiguity for Hebrew due to the absence of short vowels in text.",
        "It is worth noting that while both Hebrew and Russian possess features that might negatively affect the performance, Hebrew performs better than Russian.",
        "We hypothesize that cliticization and the lack of vowels in text are not as significant factors for the performance as the high inflectional nature of a language, such as Russian.",
        "We observe that the majotity of the context terms selected by the algorithm for disambiguation belong to the noun category.",
        "This seems intuitive, since nouns generally provide more information content than other parts of speech and thus should be useful for resolving lexical ambiguity.",
        "While an English or a Hebrew noun only has several wordforms, a Russian noun may have up to 12 different forms due to various inflections.",
        "The morphological complexity of Russian affects the performance in two ways.",
        "First, cluster purity is affected, since the counts of context terms are not sufficiently reliable to accurately estimate term distances.",
        "Incorrect term distances subsequently affect the quality of the term clusters.",
        "Second, the percentage of default occurrences (examples that have no context terms occurring in the distance matrix) is the least for English (0.22) and the highest for Russian (0.27).",

        "The results of experiment 2 support the fact that morphological complexity of a language negatively affects the performance.",

        "We apply a morphological analyzer to the corpus and replace each word with its lemma.",
        "In 10% of the word tokens, the analyzer gives more than one possible analysis, in which case the first analysis is selected.",
