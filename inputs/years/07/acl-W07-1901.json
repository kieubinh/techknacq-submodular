        "There is no longer any question that the production of language and its accompanying non-verbal behaviour are tightly linked (e.g., Bavelas and Chovil, 2000).",
        "The communicative functions of body language listed by Bickmore and Cassell (2005) include conversation initiation and termination, turn-taking and interruption, content elaboration and emphasis, and feedback and error correction; non-verbal behaviours that can achieve these functions include gaze modification, facial expressions, hand gestures, and posture shifts, among others.",
        "When choosing non-verbal behaviours to accompany the speech of an embodied conversational agent (ECA), it is necessary to translate general findings from observing human behaviour into concrete selection strategies.",
        "There are two main implementation techniques that have been used for making this decision.",
        "In some systems, recorded behaviours are analysed and rules are created by hand based on the analysis; in others, recorded human data is used directly in the decision process.",
        "The former technique is similar to the classic role of corpora in natural-language generation described by Reiter and Dale (2000), while the latter is more similar to the more recent data-driven techniques that have been adopted (Belz and Varges, 2005).",
        "Researchers that have used rule-based techniques to create embodied-agent systems include: Poggi and Pelachaud (2000), who concentrated on generating appropriate affective facial displays based on descriptions of typical facial expressions of emotion; Cassell et al.",
        "(2001a), who selected gestures and facial expressions to accompany text using heuristics derived from studies of typical North American non-verbal-displays; and Marsi and van Rooden (2007), who generated typical certain and uncertain facial displays for a talking head in an information-retrieval system.",
        "Researchers that used data-driven techniques include: Stone et al.",
        "(2004), who captured the motions of an actor performing scripted output and then used that data to create performance specifications on the fly; Cassell et al.",
        "(2001b), who selected posture shifts for an embodied agent based on recorded human behaviour; and Kipp (2004), who annotated the gesturing behaviour of skilled public speakers and derived \"gesture profiles\" to use in the generation process.",
        "Using rules derived from the data can produce displays that are easily identifiable and is straightforward to implement.",
        "On the other hand, making direct use of the data can produce output that is more similar to actual human behaviour by incorporating naturalistic variation, although it generally requires a more complex selection algorithm.",
        "In this paper, we investigate the relative utility of the two implementation strategies for a particular decision: selecting the conversational facial displays of an animated talking head.",
        "We use two methods for comparison: gathering users' subjective preferences, and measuring the impact of both selection strategies on users' ability to perceive user tailoring in speech.",
        "In Section 2, we first describe how we recorded and annotated a corpus of facial displays in the domain of the target generation system.",
        "Section 3 then presents the two strategies that were implemented to select facial displays based on this corpus: one using a simple rule derived from the most characteristic behaviours in the corpus, and one that made a weighted choice among all of the options found in the corpus for each context.",
        "The next sections describe two user studies comparing these strategies: in Section 4, we compare users' subjective preferences, while in Section 5 we measure the impact of each strategy on user's ability to select spoken descriptions correctly tailored to a given set of user preferences.",
        "Finally, in Section 6, we discuss the results of these two studies, draw some conclusions, and outline potential future work."

        "The surface form of each sentence was created by the OpenCCG surface realiser (White, 2006), using a grammar that specified both the words and the intended prosody for the speech synthesiser.",
        "We attached all of the relevant contextual, syntactic, and prosodic information to each node in the OpenCCG derivation tree, including the user-model evaluation of the object being described (positive, negative, or neutral), the predicted pitch accent, the clause of the sentence (first, second, or only), and whether the information being presented was new to the discourse.",
        "The sentences in the script were presented one at a time to a speaker who was instructed to read each out loud as expressively as possible into a camera directed at his face.",
        "The following facial displays were then annotated on the recordings: eyebrow motions (up or down), eye squinting, and rigid head motion on all three axes (nodding, leaning, and turning).",
        "Each of these displays was attached to the node or nodes in the OpenCCG derivation tree that exactly covered the span of words temporally associated with the display.",
        "Two coders separately processed the sentences in the corpus.",
        "Using a version of the fi weighted agreement measure proposed by Artstein and Poesio (2005) – which allows for a range of agreement levels – the agreement on the sentences processed by both coders was 0.561.",
        "When the distribution of facial displays in the corpus was analysed, it was found that the single biggest influence on the speaker's behaviour was the user-model evaluation of the features being described.",
        "When he described features of the design that had positive user-model evaluations, he was more likely to turn to the right and to raise his eyebrows (Figure 1(a)); on the other hand, on features with negative user-model evaluations, he was more likely to lean to the left, lower his eyebrows, and squint his eyes (Figure 1(b)).",
        "The overall most frequent display in all contexts was a downward nod on its own.",

        "The main difference between the output of the majority strategy on the one hand, and that of the two strategies described here on the other, is in the distribution of the face-display combinations: over 90% of the that the majority strategy selected a display, it used a downward nod on its own, while both of the other strategies tended to generate a more even distribution of displays across the sentences.",

        "The performance on these trials was essentially the identical to that on the full set of trials: the correctly targeted description was chosen 20 times, and the other version 18 times.",
        "So the worse performance with the data-driven schedules cannot be attributed solely to the selected facial displays conflicting with the linguistic content.",
        "Another possibility is that the study participants who used the data-driven schedules were distracted by the expressive motions of the talking head and failed to pay attention to the content of the speech.",
        "This appears to have been the case in the COMIC whole-system evaluation (White et al., 2005), for example, where the performance of the male participants on a recall task was significantly worse when a more expressive talking head was used.",

        "The results of the subjective-preference evaluation indicate that participants tended to prefer the output generated by the data-driven strategy, although this preference was not significant.",
        "In the second study, videos generated by the data-driven strategy significantly decreased participants' ability to detect correctly-tailored spoken output when compared to a speech-only presentation; on the other hand, videos generated by the rule-based strategy did not have a significant impact on this task.",
        "These results indicate that, at least for this corpus and this generation task, the choice of generation strategy depends largely on which aspect of the system is more important: to create an agent that users like subjectively, or to ensure that users fully understand all aspects of the output presented in speech.",
        "If the former is more important, than an implementation that uses the data directly appears to be a slightly better option; if the latter is more important, then the rule-based strategy seems superior.",
        "On the subjective-preference evaluation, users preferred the original corpus motions over either of the generated versions.",
        "As discussed in Section 4.5, this suggests that there is room for a more sophisticated data-driven selection strategy that reproduces the corpus data more closely.",
        "The output of such a generation strategy might also have a different effect on the perception task.",
        "Both of these studies used the RUTH talking head (Figure 3), which has no body and, while human in appearance, is not particularly realistic.",
        "We used this head to investigate the the generation of a limited set of facial displays, based on contextual information including the user-model evaluation, the predicted prosody, the clause of the sentence, and the surface string.",
        "More information about the relative utility of different techniques for selecting non-verbal behaviour for embodied agents can be gathered by experimenting with a wider range of agents and of non-verbal behaviours.",
        "Other possible agent types include photorealistic animated agents, agents with fully articulated virtual bodies, and physically embodied robot agents.",
        "The possibilities for non-verbal behaviours include deictic, iconic, and beat gestures, body posture, gaze behaviour, and facial expressions of various types of affect, while any source of syntactic or pragmatic context could be used to help make the selection.",
        "Experimenting with other combinations of agent properties and behaviours can improve our knowledge of the relative utility of different mechanisms for selecting non-verbal behaviour."
