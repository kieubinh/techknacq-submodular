        "Aiduti in Japanese Multi-party Design Conversations",
        "Future University - Hakodate 116-2 Kameda-Nakano Hakodate Hokkaido, Japan",
        "Japanese backchannel utterances, aizuti, in a multi-party design conversation were examined, and aizuti functions were analyzed in comparison with its functions in two-party dialogues.",
        "In addition to the two major functions, signaling acknowledgment and turn-management, it was argued that aizuti in multi-party conversations are involved in joint construction of design plans through management of the floor structure, and display of participants' readiness to engage in collaborative elaboration of jointly constructed proposals."

        "Backchannel utterances are one of the representative phenomena characterizing conversational interactions.",
        "We can find backchannel utterances in every natural conversation in every culture.",
        "Different languages have different repertoire of expressions that work as backchannels.",
        "In terms of what functions they serve in conversations, it has widely been acknowledged that backchannels, by conveying the hearer feedback to the speaker, serve to contribute to informational coordination between conversational participants, through conversational flow management in terms of both common grounding and smooth turn-taking.",
        "It has also been acknowledged, perhaps less explicitly, that backchannels serve to contribute to affective coordination by promoting rapport between conversational participants.",
        "It is still unclear how these two contrasting views on backchannels can be integrated.",
        "How are the informational and the affective coordination functions of backchannels inter-related?",
        "What factors determine relative salience of these two functions in certain usage of backchannels?",
        "Are there any categories of conversational interactions that promote one or the other functions?",
        "Are there cultural differences in backchannel usages?",
        "We focus, in this paper, on the use of Japanese backchannels, aiduti, in multi-party conversations.",
        "Based on the analysis of how aiduti utterances are employed in experimentally captured multi-party design conversation data, we argue that aiduti utterances in Japanese have, on top of the informational coordination functions of common-grounding and turn-management, the function of expressing the readiness, a positive attitude, on the part of a participant to engage in the joint construction of an ongoing proposal currently under discussion, which then leads to affective coordination."

      "heading": "2. Backchannels in Dialogues",
      "text": [
        "Backchannel utterances were conceived initially in two-party dialogues with one speaker and one hearer.",
        "Schegloff (1982) picked up hearer's short utterances such as 'uh, huh' produced in response to the speaker's main utterances, and characterized them as backchannels, whose functions are to convey backward messages from the hearer to the speaker indicating that the hearer is attending to, listening to, understanding, and expecting to continue the production of the speaker's main message.",
        "Heritage (2006) provides a broader conception of backchannels and lists the following four functions for backchannel utterances.",
        "• Provide Acknowledgments to prior locutions by the speaker",
        "• Projection of further talk in turn taking",
        "• Recipient epistemic states triggered by the speaker's message",
        "• Recipient affiliative attitude, how the recipient is aligned with speaker's message",
        "Maynard (1986) compared Japanese and American dialogues, and observed that Japanese dialogues have almost twice as much aizuti as American backchannel utterances.",
        "This observation suggests that significance of backchannels and their functions in conversational interactions may depend on social groups, types of activities and other social or task related parameters."

        "We will focus on aiduti utterances in Japanese multiparty design conversations.",
        "In order to locate the type of activity we've been working on within the broad range of interaction activities collectively categorized as multi-party conversations, we first try to list up potential parameters that might influence the structure and organization of conversational interactions.",
        "Number of participants",
        "We call a conversation between more than two people a multi-party conversation.",
        "A conversation between three people and a conversation between 10 people are not the same in their conversational organization.",
        "It has been observed (Fay et al., 2000) that conversations with a small number of participants tend to be homogeneous that contain a number of equal status pairwise interactions, whereas conversations with a large number of participants tend to be more hierarchical with a central control person working as a chairperson.",
        "Types of activities",
        "Conversational interactions are often embedded in larger activities, and the type of embedding activities makes a difference in the organization of conversations.",
        "(a) Purpose",
        "One-way information transfer in lectures and joint problem solving in a group of people have both fixed but different types of goals.",
        "When people chat for socialization, having a conversation itself becomes its own purpose.",
        "These different types of goals could produce different organizational structures in conversations.",
        "(b) Rigidity of purpose",
        "Even within joint problem solving activities, we can conceive of different degree of rigidity of problem goals conversational participants are working on.",
        "In one extreme lies a pursuit of a fixed goal such as mathematical problem solving, in which a problem with a clearly determined answer is given to the group.",
        "In other extreme lies a problem solving under a loosely stated goal such as floor planning of an apartment for the group, in which the only requirement is to reach an agreement, and factors to consider must be made explicit in the course of conversation.",
        "The design conversation we've looked at belong to the latter category.",
        "(c) Reality",
        "Every experimental data collection has to face this problem.",
        "Whether or not and how much the outcome of the conversation has real import in participants' life makes a big difference in conversational organization.",
        "(d) Use of objects",
        "Use of physical objects, particularly informational artifact such as whiteboard and projectors, changes the use pattern of multi-modal signals: gaze, gestures and body postures, and needs to be taken into account in experimental data collection.",
        "Characteristics of participants (a) Participant properties",
        "Differences in capabilities such as in knowledge and in expertise, and dispositional properties, such as preferences, beliefs, and personalities of participants greatly contribute to shape the interaction.",
