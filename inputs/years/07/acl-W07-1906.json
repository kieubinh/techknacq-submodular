        "Analysis focused on differences in the use of dialogue acts and non-verbal behaviors, as well as cooccurrences of dialogue acts, eye gaze and head nods, and found a pattern of verbal and nonverbal behavior that differentiates the dialogue of friends from that of strangers, and differentiates early acquaintances from those who have worked together before.",

        "What characterizes the language of people who have known one another for a long time?",

        "Advances in natural language are ensuring that embodied conversational agents (ECAs) are increasingly scintillating, emotionally and socially expressive, and personality-rich.",
        "However, for the most part, those same ECAs demonstrate amnesia, beginning every conversation with a user as if it is their first, and never getting past the stage of introductory remarks.",
        "As the field of ECAs matures, and these systems are found on an increasing number of platforms, for an increasing number of applications, we feel that it is time to ensure that ECAs be able to engage in deepening relationships that make their collaboration with humans productive and satisfying over long periods of time.",
        "To this end, in this paper we examine the verbal and nonverbal correlates of friendship in an empirical study, and then take first steps towards a model of deepening friendship and rapport in ECAs.",
        "The current study is a part of a larger research program into linguistic and social coordination devices from the utterance level to the relationship level - how they work in humans, how they can be modeled in virtual humans, and how virtual humans can be used to teach people who wish to learn these skills."

        "As people become closer, their conversational style changes.",
        "They may raise more topics in the course of a conversation, refer more to themselves as a single unit than as two people, and be more responsive to one another's talk (Cassell & Tver-sky, 2005; Hornstein, 1982).",
        "They also are likely to sustain eye contact longer, smile more, and lean more towards one another (Grahe & Bernieri, 1999; Richmond & McCroskey, 1995).",
        "In addition, friends appear to have fewer difficulties with lexical search, perhaps because they can rely on greater shared knowledge, and are more likely to talk at the same time, and to negotiate turn-taking in a less rigid manner, both through gaze and gesFigure 1.",
        "Three component model of rapport (from Tickle-Degen & Rosenthal, 1990).",
        "ture (Welji & Duncan, 2005).",
        "Tickle-Degnen & Rosenthal (1990) propose a model of deepening rapport over time based on the relationship among three components: positivity, mutual attention and coordination.",
        "As shown in Figure 1, as friendship deepens, the importance of positivity decreases, while the importance of coordination increases.",
        "Attention to the conversational partner, however, is hypothesized to remain constant.",
        "That is, strangers are more likely to be polite and uniformly positive in their talk, but also more likely to be awkward and badly coordinated with their interlocutors.",
        "As a relationship progresses and impressions have been formed and accepted, disagreement becomes acceptable and important.",
        "This may entail an increase in face-threatening issues and behaviors (cf. Brown & Levinson, 1987) accompanied by a decrease in the need to mediate these threats.",
        "At this stage in the relationship, coordination becomes highly important, so that the conversation will be less awkward and there is less likelihood of misunderstanding.",
        "Attention to one another, however, does not change.",
        "Tickle-Degnen & Rosenthal point out that these features are as likely to be expressed nonverbally (through smiles, nods, and posture shifts, for example) as verbally.",
        "One criticism of Tickle-Degnen & Rosenthal, and similar work, is that positive feelings for, and knowledge about, the other person are not distinguished (Cappella, 1990).",
        "That is, what might be perceived as lack of rapport could actually be a lack of familiarity with a partner's behavioral cues for indicating misunderstanding or requesting information.",
        "This conflation may come from the fact that the word rapport is used both to refer to the phenomenon of instant responsiveness (\"we just clicked\") and that of deepening interdependence over time.",
        "ECA research has been divided between a focus on instant rapport (Gratch et al., 2006; Maatman, Gratch, & Marsella, 2005) and a focus on establishing and maintaining relationships over time (Bickmore & Picard, 2005; Cassell & Bickmore, 2002; Stronks, Nijholt, van der Vet, & Heylen, 2002).",
        "Perhaps due to difficulties with analyzing dyadic interdependent processes, and modeling them in computational systems, much of the work in both traditions still takes a signaling approach, whereby particular signals (such as nodding or small talk) demonstrate the responsiveness, extroversion, or rapport-readiness of the agent, but are decontextualized from the actions of the dyad (Duncan, 1990).",
        "Although this approach is well paired to current technological constraints, it may not adequately account for the contingency of interpersonal interaction and conversation.",
        "In addition, in none of these previous studies was there a focus on how verbal and nonverbal devices actually change over the course of a relationship, and how those devices are interdependent between speaker and listener.",
        "An instant rapport approach is useful for building systems that are initially attractive to users; but a system that signals increasing familiarity and intimacy through its linguistic and nonverbal behaviors may encourage users to stay with the system over a longer period of time.",
        "In the current work, we concentrate how discourse and nonverbal behavior changes over time, and across the dyad, as this perspective allows us to highlight the similarities between interpersonal coordination and knowledge coordination of the kind that has been studied in both conversational analysis and psycholinguistics.",
        "Work on conversational analysis demonstrates the importance of knowledge coordination components such as turn-taking and adjacency pairs (e.g.Goodwin, 1981; Schegloff & Sacks, 1973).",
        "Inspired by this approach, work by Clark and collaborators on grounding and conversation as joint action has made demonstrated coordination and cooperation as defining characteristics of conversation (Clark, 1996; Clark & Brennan, 1991; Clark &",
        "Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986).",
        "This work has in turn, received a significant amount of attention in computational linguistics, specifically in the study of dialogue (Matheson, Poesio, & Traum, 2000; Nakano, Reinstein, Stocky, & Cassell, 2003; Traum, 1994; Traum & Dillenbourg, 1998).",
        "To develop a model of nonverbal grounding, Nakano et al.",
        "(2003) studied people giving directions with respect to a map placed in between them.",
        "In that study, we observed that when a direction-receiver looked up from the map while the direction-giver was still giving directions, the giver would initiate grounding behavior such as a repeat or a rephrase.",
        "The literature reviewed above leads us to believe that there is an integral relationship between social and knowledge coordination.",
        "In this paper, we attempt to draw conclusions about the changes in social and linguistic coordination over the short-and long-term in a way that illuminates that potential relationship, and that is also computationally viable.",
        "In order to do this, we replicate the task we used in our earlier grounding study (Nakano et al., 2003); that is we use a direction-giving task, where half the subjects can see one another, and half are divided by a screen.",
        "Here, however, half of the subjects in each visibility condition are friends and half are strangers.",
        "And to study the potential development of rapport across the experimental period, each pair performs three subsequent direction-giving tasks.",
        "In the next section, we discuss the experimental procedure further.",
        "In section 4, we introduce first steps towards a new computational model of rapport that incorporates conversational coordination and grounding, based on our empirical findings."

        "S/he gave the other participant directions on how to reach that location, without the use of maps or other props.",

        "In these Stranger dyads, the Giver looks at the Receiver to signal the need for feedback.",

        "We found better coordination, but that was revealed, paradoxically, through fewer coordination devices and fewer dialogue acts in each turn, both comparing from Route 1 to Route 3, and comparing Strangers to Friends.",
        "Friends - Positivity",
        "In the Friends dialogues, we find a notable collocation of non-verbal behavior and the Receiver's use of Repeat-Rephrase utterance (i.e., repeating the Giver's utterance back to ensure correct interpretation).",
        "This is in contrast to the findings for Stranger dyads which found nonverbal behaviors found in conjunction with the Giver's reactive use of Repeat-Rephrase - i.e., the Giver's questioning of the Receiver's understanding - perhaps after a breakdown in mutual understanding.",
        "In the Friend dyads, it is the Receiver who proactively checks correct understanding of the Giver's utterance before the interaction continues.",
        "Tickle-Degnen & Rosenthal predict a reduction in the importance of positivity as rapport increases over time in a relationship.",
        "We found some evidence to support this, since such questioning of the Giver in itself may be viewed as face-threatening behavior.",
        "However, in the Friends dialogues, this Repeat-Rephrase appears anticipated - or sanctioned - by the Giver who looks at the Receiver prior to the utterance.",
        "Further, during and after the Receivers' use of the Repeat-Rephrase utterance, they also look at the Giver, which again would be expected to be viewed as a threat to face.",
        "Similarly, the Receiver gazes at the Giver before and during the Giver's use of Influence dialogue acts (explicit commands, such as \"turn left\").",
        "Such direct gaze, along with a reduced number of mediating dialogue acts such as Acknowledgments, appears to indicate that Friends dialogues are less concerned with avoiding face-threatening behavior, and as such would appear less concerned with maintaining positivity during the interaction.",
        "Note that, almost paradoxically, Friends demonstrate their increased ability to coordinate their interaction through a diminished use of explicit coordination devices.",
        "This speeds up the interaction, and reduces the number of overall dialogue acts.",
        "And, finally, differences between Friends and Strangers are vastly diminished when the interlocutors cannot see one another.",
        "This leads us to believe that nonverbal behaviors in addition to gaze and head nods may be playing a role in how Friends coordinate with one another; an advantage which is taken away when they can only hear one another's voices."

        "In the short-term context of conversation, maintenance of mutual attention and incremental coordination of beliefs are requisites for grounding and turn-taking.",
        "In prior computational systems, grounding has been achieved by marking the status of conversational contributions as provisional (ungrounded) or shared (grounded).",
        "Conversational actions by either the user or the system can trigger updates that change provisional information to shared.",
        "Acknowledgements, for example, are explicit ways of achieving grounding, but moving on to the next stage of the task is equally effective, as it presupposes that prior utterances have been taken up (Traum, 1994).",
        "In a model such as this, grounding occurs at the turn level.",
        "In order to handle the multimodal phenomena that participate in grounding in face-to-face conversation, as Nakano et al.",
        "(Nakano et al., 2003) have shown, a model of knowledge coordination needs to have more frequently updated access to potential grounding events.",
        "In that implementation, we continuously polled for inputs, so as to capture the updates in grounding that occur between typical linguistic segments.",
        "We believe that the focus on time and process that allowed us to look at events of a smaller granularity in our earlier work on nonverbal grounding behavior will also allow us to extend up to events of a larger granularity, such as stages in a relationship.",
        "That is, we believe that the results described in earlier sections of this paper can be taken into account in a computational system by maintaining a model of the state of shared and private information across several interactions (several years, if possible).",
        "In this way, the shared history of two interlocutors (the user and the system) can be translated into patterns of linguistic behavior, such as reduced use of acknowledgements, and reduced positivity, with increased interruption and information requests.",
        "This is similar to Cheng, Cavedon & Dale (2004)'s approach to direction-giving.",
        "In this approach, the system maintains a history of places it has given directions to before.",
        "Using this task history, it is able to generate shorter directions at later stages in the dialogue.",
        "In our implementation, however, the very style of the interaction is modified by the shared history of the user and the system.",
        "In the sense that we are modifying the linguistic style of the dialogue based on psychological attributes, our approach is similar to work by Mairesse & Walker (2007) and Isard et al.",
        "(2006).",
        "In both cases, a broad set of natural language generation parameters is employed to generate language that differs along a personality dimension, based on a number of previous empirical studies.",
        "In the current approach, however, the features that are modified derive from the interdependence of the system with a particular user.",
        "Some of the features that are present in the conversations of friends, such as interjections and completion of one another's utterances, are still beyond current computational abilities, as they would require online, real-time processing and understanding of utterances with incremental planning and generation of responses.",
        "We are interested in pursuing this feature of the system as dialogue technologies improve."

        "In this paper, we have compared direction-giving between friends and strangers, and within these two groups we have compared three subsequent direction-giving episodes.",
        "In order to determine the effect played specifically by nonverbal behavior in short-and long-term rapport, half of our participants could see one another, while the other half were divided by a screen.",
        "Our experimental and analytic methodology drew from both the social psychological, conversational analysis, and conversation as joint action traditions.",
        "Consequently, our results were able to demonstrate the ways in which the verbal and nonverbal devices that index rapport relate to the role those same devices play in knowledge coordination.",
        "Based on this commonality, we proposed a computationally viable model of deepening friendship within and across subsequent tasks that extends our previous work on grounding in face-to-face interaction.",
        "The work we have presented here therefore differs substantially from previous work on rapport and relationship building in embodied conversational agents.",
        "We did not start out with a definition of rapport but instead investigated those behaviors that characterize dyads who have self-identified as friends or strangers.",
        "And rather than looking at rapid assessment of rapport (the feeling of \"clicking\") we looked at the long-term version: acquiring a sense of mutual interdependence.",
        "Finally, rather than looking at how to get ECAs to engage users into establishing a relationship, or into letting down their guard, we examined those behaviors that characterize the dyadic interaction at each stage.",
        "All of these topics, however, are clearly interrelated, and future research will benefit from taking a greater number of them into account in both data analysis, and the implementation of ECAs.",
        "Future research in our own lab will also have to be more explicit about how to implement the computational model that we have started to lay out here.",
        "Additional subjects in a similar experiment will no doubt facilitate that task.",
        "As we increasingly understand better how conversation changes when people come to know one another, we expect to apply these results to our ongoing research on virtual peers that can teach children with autism how to sustain interpersonal relationships (Tartaro & Cassell, 2006) and to our work on building the survey interviewers of the future, who can both engage their survey-takers and keep them honest (Cassell & Miller, in press).",
        "More generally, however, we hope to increasingly implement ECAs who will stick around for the long haul."
