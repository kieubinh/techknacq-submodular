        "When we look at human conversation in a casual, open setting, such as a party or marketplace, one of the first things we notice is a tendency for people to cluster into subgroups involved in different conversations.",
        "These groupings are not fixed, however, people will often join and leave groups and often move from one group to another.",
        "Groups themselves may fragment into subgroups, and smaller groups sometimes merge into one larger group.",
        "Participants in these groups adapt their positions and orientations to account for these circumstances, often without missing a beat or otherwise disrupting their conversations.",
        "In order to create believable social environments for games or training simulations we need agents that can perform these same kinds of behaviors in a realistic way.",
        "There are a number of crowd simulations (Sung et al., 2004; Shao and Terzopou-los, 2005; Still, 2000; Helbing and Molnar, 1995), but most of these place an emphasis on large-scale movement of agents and do not model the low-level aspects of conversational interaction in a realistic way – movement of agents in multiparty conversation is more about positioning and repositioning on a local scale.",
        "There is also a large body of work on embodied conversational agents (Cassell et al., 2000), which attempt to model realistic conversational non-verbal behaviors.",
        "Most of this work focuses on aspects such as gaze, facial expressions, and hand and arm gestures, rather than positioning and orientation in a group.",
        "There is some important work on authored presentation agents and avatars for human participants which take account of position in the modelling (Vilhjalmsson and Cassell, 1998; Rehm et al., 2005), but none of this work presents fully explicit algorithms for controlling the positioning and movement behavior ofautonomous agents in dynamic conversations.",
        "In previous work, it has been shown that incorrect positioning ofanimated agents has a negative effect on the believability of dynamic group conversation (Jan and Traum, 2005).",
        "Research from anthropologists and social psychologists such as the classic work on proxemics by Hall (1968) and positioning by Kendon (1990) provide social reasons to explain how people position themselves in different situations.",
        "It is also important to know that people expect similar behavior in virtual environments as in real life as shown by Bailenson et al.",
        "(2003).",
        "This gives us basic principles on which to base the simulation and provides some qualitative expectations, but is not suitable to directly convert into algorithms.",
        "The social force model (Helbing and Molnar, 1995) developed for crowd simulations gives a good framework for movement simulation.",
        "While the basic model shows how to handle pedestrian motion we apply the model to the problem of movement in conversation setting.",
        "Our implementation of conversational movement and positioning is an extension of prior work in group conversation simulation using autonomous agents.",
        "Carletta and Padilha (2002) presented a simulation of the external view of a group conversation, in which the group members take turns speaking and listening to others.",
        "Previous work on turn-taking is used to form a probabilistic algorithm in which agents can perform basic behaviors such as speaking and listening, beginning, continuing or concluding a speaking turn, giving positive and negative feedback, head nods, gestures, posture shifts, and gaze.",
        "Behaviors are generated using a stochastic algorithm that compares randomly generated numbers against parameters that can take on values between 0 and 1.",
        "This work was further extended by (Jan and Traum, 2005), who used new bodies in the Unreal Tournament game engine, and added support for dynamic creation of conversation groups.",
        "This simulation allowed dynamic creation, splitting, joining, entry and exit of sub-conversations.",
        "However, the characters were located in fixed positions.",
        "As indicated in their subject evaluations, this significantly decreased believability when conversation groups did not coincide with positioning of the agents.",
        "Adding support for movement of characters is a natural step to counter these less believable situations.",
        "We augment this work by adding a movement and positioning component that allows agents to monitor \"forces\" that make it more desirable to move to one place or another, iteratively select new destinations and move while remaining engaged in conversations.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes the main motivations that agents have for moving from their current position in conversation.",
        "Section 3 presents the social force model, which specifies a set of forces that pressure an agent to move in one direction or another, and a decision algorithm for deciding which forces to act on in different situations.",
        "Section 4 presents a series of test cases for the algorithm, demonstrating that the model behaves as desired for some benchmark problems in this space.",
        "We conclude in section 5 with a description of future work in this area."

      "heading": "2. Reasons for Movement",
      "text": [
        "There are several reasons why someone engaged in conversation would want to shift position.",
        "Some of these include:",
        "• one is listening to a speaker who is too far and or not loud enough to hear,",
        "• there is too much noise from other nearby sound sources,",
        "• the background noise is louder than the speaker,",
        "• one is too close to others to feel comfortable,",
        "• one has an occluded view or is occluding the view of others.",
        "Any of these factors (or a combination of several) could motivate a participant to move to a more comfortable location.",
        "During the simulation the speakers can change, other noise sources can start and stop, and other agents can move around as well.",
        "These factors can cause a variety of motion throughout the course of interactions with others.",
        "In the rest of this section we describe these factors in more detail.",
        "In the next section we will develop a formal model of reactions to these factors.",
        "The first reason we consider for repositioning of conversation participants is audibility of the speaker.",
        "The deciding factor can be either the absolute volume of the speaker, or the relative volume compared to other \"noise\".",
        "Noise here describes all audio input that is not speech by someone in the current conversation group.",
        "This includes the speech of agents engaged in other conversations as well as non-speech sounds.",
        "When we are comparing the loudness of different sources we take into account that intensity of the perceived signal decreases with the square of the distance and also that the loudness ofseveral sources is additive.",
        "Even when the speaker can be heard over a noise source, if outside disruptions are loud enough, the group might want to move to a more remote area where they can interact without interruptions.",
        "Each of the participants may decide to shift away from a noise source, even without an explicit group decision.",
        "Of course this may not always be possible if the area is very crowded.",
        "Another reason for movement is proxemics.",
        "Hall (1968) writes that individuals generally divide their personal space into four distinct zones.",
        "The intimate zone is used for embracing or whispering, the personal zone is used for conversation among good friends, the social zone is used for conversation among acquaintances and the public zone for public speaking.",
        "The actual distances the zones span are different for each culture and its interpretation may vary based on an individual's personality.",
        "If the speaker is outside the participant's preferred zone, the participant will move toward the speaker.",
        "Similarly if someone invades the personal zone of a participant, the participant will move away.",
        "The final reason for movement is specific to multiparty conversations.",
        "When there are several people in conversation they will tend to form a circular formation.",
        "This gives the sense of inclusion to participants and gives them a better view of one another (Kendon, 1990)."

      "text": [
        "We present our movement simulation in the context of a social force model.",
        "Similar to movement in crowds, the movement of people engaged in conversation is to a large extent reactionary.",
        "The reaction is usually automatic and determined by person's experience, rather than planned for.",
        "It is possible to assign a vectorial quantity for each person in conversation, that describes the desired movement direction.",
        "This quantity can be interpreted as a social force.",
        "This force represents the influence of the environment on the behavior of conversation participant.",
        "It is important to note however that this force does not directly cause the body to move, but rather provides a motivation to move.",
        "We illustrate these forces with figures such as Figure 1, where each circle",
        "Figure 1: A sample group positioning.",
        "Each circle represents an agent.",
        "A thick border represents that the agent is talking, filled or empty shading indicates conversation group membership.",
        "represents an agent, the different shadings represent members of different conversation groups, thicker circles represent speakers in that group, and arrows represent forces on an agent of interest.",

        "This is unlike a kinematics calculation with physical forces where all forces are always active.",
        "Combining all the conditions we can define which forces are active according to a simple decision procedure.",

        "Here we wanted to examine particular scenarios and how the movement algorithm would react to specific changes in conversation group structure.",
        "For this reason we disabled conversational grouping decisions in the algorithm and triggered the group structure changes manually from the user interface.",

        "We let the simulation run and at some point we give a command to the fourth agent to join the group of three.",
        "At first the agent will move toward the group until he is in a comfortable range as shown in Figure 7.",

        "The other agents know of the presence of the fourth agent, but they have no idea that he would like to join them.",
        "The fourth agent is listening for a while and when he gives a feedback signal the other agents interpret that as a signal that he wants to join the conversation.",
        "As a result the agents reevaluate their positioning and one agent decides it would be appropriate to move a step back to give more space to the new agent.",
