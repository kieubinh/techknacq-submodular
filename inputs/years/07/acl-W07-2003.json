      "text": [
        "The theme of Task 4 is the classification of semantic relations between simple nominals (nouns or base noun phrases) other than named entities ?",
        "honey bee, for example, shows an instance of the Product-Producer relation.",
        "The classification occurs in the context of a sentence in a written English text.",
        "Algorithms for classifying semantic relations can be applied in information retrieval, information extraction, text summarization, question answering and so on.",
        "The recognition of textual entailment (Tatu and Moldovan, 2005) is an example of successful use of this type of deeper analysis in high-end NLP applications.",
        "The literature shows a wide variety of methods of nominal relation classification.",
        "They depend as much on the training data as on the domain of application and the available resources.",
        "Rosario and Hearst (2001) classify noun compounds from the domain of medicine, using 13 classes that describe the semantic relation between the head noun and the modifier in a given noun compound.",
        "Rosario et al. (2002) classify noun compounds using the MeSH hierarchy and a multilevel hierarchy of semantic relations, with 15 classes at the top level.",
        "Nastase and Szpakowicz (2003) present a two-level hierarchy for classifying noun-modifier relations in base noun phrases from general text, with 5 classes at the top and 30 classes at the bottom; other researchers (Turney and Littman, 2005; Turney, 2005; Nastase et al., 2006) have used their class scheme and data set.",
        "Moldovan et al. (2004) propose a 35- class scheme to classify relations in various phrases; the same scheme has been applied to noun compounds and other noun phrases (Girju et al., 2005).",
        "Chklovski and Pantel (2004) introduce a 5-class set, designed specifically for characterizing verb-verb semantic relations.",
        "Stephens et al. (2001) propose 17 classes targeted to relations between genes.",
        "La-pata (2002) presents a binary classification of relations in nominalizations.",
        "There is little consensus on the relation sets and algorithms for analyzing semantic relations, and it seems unlikely that any single scheme could work for all applications.",
        "For example, the gene-gene relation scheme of Stephens et al. (2001), with relations like X phosphorylates Y, is unlikely to be transferred easily to general text.",
        "We have created a benchmark data set to allow the evaluation of different semantic relation classification algorithms.",
        "We do not presume to propose a single classification scheme, however alluring it would",
        "be to try to design a unified standard ?",
        "it would be likely to have shortcomings just as any of the others we have just reviewed.",
        "Instead, we have decided to focus on separate semantic relations that many researchers list in their relation sets.",
        "We have built annotated data sets for seven such relations.",
        "Every data set supports a separate binary classification task.",
        "2 Building the Annotated Data Sets Ours is a new evaluation task, so we began with data set creation and annotation guidelines.",
        "The data set that Nastase and Szpakowicz (2003) created had relation labels and part-of-speech and WordNet sense annotations, to facilitate classification.",
        "(Moldovan et al., 2004; Girju et al., 2005) gave the annotators an example of each phrase in a sentence along with WordNet senses and position of arguments.",
        "Our annotations include all these, to support a variety of methods (since we work with relations between nominals, the part of speech is always noun).",
        "We have used WordNet 3.0 on the Web and sense index tags.",
        "We chose the following semantic relations: Cause-Effect, Content-Container, Instrument-Agency, Origin-Entity, Part-Whole, Product-Producer and Theme-Tool.",
        "We wrote seven detailed definitions, including restrictions and conventions, plus prototypical positive and near-miss negative examples.",
        "For each relation separately, we based data collection on wild-card search patterns that Google allows.",
        "We built the patterns manually, following Hearst (1992) and Nakov and Hearst (2006).",
        "Instances of the relation Content-Container, for example, come up in response to queries such as ?",
        "* contains *?, ?",
        "* holds *?, ?the * in the *?.",
        "Following the model of the Senseval-3 English Lexical Sample Task, we set out to collect 140 training and at least 70 test examples per relation, so we had a number of different patterns to ensure variety.",
        "We also aimed to collect a balanced number of positive and negative examples.",
        "The use of heuristic patterns to search for both positive and negative examples should naturally result in negative examples that are near misses.",
        "We believe that near misses are more useful for supervised learning than negative examples that are generated randomly.",
        "?Among the contents of the <e1>vessel</e1> were a set of carpenter's <e2>tools</e2>, several large storage jars, ceramic utensils, ropes and remnants of food, as well as a heavy load of ballast stones.",
        "?",
        "nominals, so parsing or chunking is not necessary.",
        "For Task 4, we define a nominal as a noun or base noun phrase, excluding names entities.",
        "A base noun phrase, e.g., lawn or lawn mower, is a noun with pre-modifiers.",
        "We also exclude complex noun phrases (e.g., with attached prepositional phrases ?",
        "the engine of the lawn mower).",
        "The procedure was the same for each relation.",
        "One person gathered the sample sentences (aiming approximately for a similar number of positive and negative examples) and tagged the entities; two other people annotated the sentences with WordNet senses and classified the relations.",
        "The detailed relation definitions and the preliminary discussions of positive and negative examples served to maximize the agreement between the annotators.",
        "They first classified the data independently, then discussed every disagreement and looked for consensus.",
        "Only the agreed-upon examples went into the data sets.",
        "Next, we split each data set into 140 training and no fewer than 70 test examples.",
        "(We published the training set for the Content-Container relation as development data two months before the test set.)",
        "Table 1 shows the number of positive and negative ex",
        "amples for each relation.",
        "The average inter-annotator agreement on relations (true/false) after the independent annotation step was 70.3%, and the average agreement on WordNet sense labels was 71.9%.",
        "In the process of arriving at a consensus between annotators, the definition of each relation was revised to cover explicitly cases where there had been disagreement.",
        "We expect that these revised definitions would lead to much higher levels of agreement than the original definitions did."
