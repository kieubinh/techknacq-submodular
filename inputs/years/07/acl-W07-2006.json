        "It is commonly thought that one of the major obstacles to high-performance Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is the fine granularity of sense inventories.",
        "State-of-the-art systems attained a disambiguation accuracy around 65% in the Senseval-3 all-words task (Snyder and Palmer, 2004), where WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) was adopted as a reference sense inventory.",
        "Unfortunately, WordNet is a fine-grained resource, encoding sense distinctions that are difficult to recognize even for human annotators (Edmonds and Kilgarriff, 2002).",
        "Making WSD an enabling technique for end-to-end applications clearly depends on the ability to deal with reasonable sense distinctions.",
        "The aim of this task was to explicitly tackle the granularity issue and study the performance of WSD systems on an all-words basis when a coarser set of senses is provided for the target words.",
        "Given the need of the NLP community to work on freely available resources, the solution of adopting a different computational lexicon is not viable.",
        "On the other hand, the production of a coarse-grained sense inventory is not a simple task.",
        "The main issue is certainly the subjectivity of sense clusters.",
        "To overcome this problem, different strategies can be adopted.",
        "For instance, in the OntoNotes project (Hovy et al., 2006) senses are grouped until a 90% inter-annotator agreement is achieved.",
        "In contrast, as we describe in this paper, our approach is based on a mapping to a previously existing inventory which encodes sense distinctions at different levels of granularity, thus allowing to induce a sense clustering for the mapped senses.",
        "We would like to mention that another SemEval2007 task dealt with the issue of sense granularity for WSD, namely Task 17 (subtask #1): Coarse-grained English Lexical Sample WSD.",
        "In this paper, we report our experience in organizing Task 07."

        "To tackle the granularity issue, we produced a coarser-grained version of the WordNet sense inventory3 based on the procedure described by Navigli (2006).",
        "The method consists of automatically mapping WordNet senses to top level, numbered entries in the Oxford Dictionary of English (ODE, (Soanes and Stevenson, 2003)).",
        "The semantic mapping between WordNet and ODE entries was obtained in two steps: first, we disambiguated with the SSI algorithm (Navigli and Velardi, 2005) the definitions of the two dictionaries, together with additional information (hypernyms and domain labels); second, for each WordNet sense, we determined the best matching ODE coarse entry.",
        "As a result, WordNet senses mapped to the same ODE entry were assigned to the same sense cluster.",
        "WordNet senses with no match were associated with a singleton sense.",
        "In contrast to the automatic method above, the sense mappings for all the words in our test corpus were manually produced by the third author, an expert lexicographer, with the aid of a mapping interface.",
        "Not all the words in the corpus could be mapped directly for several reasons: lacking entries in ODE (e.g. adjectives underlying and shivering),",
        "different spellings (e.g. after-effect vs. aftereffect, halfhearted vs. half-hearted, etc.",
        "), derivatives (e.g. procedural, gambler, etc.).",
        "In most of the cases, we asked the lexicographer to map senses of the original word to senses of lexically-related words (e.g. WordNet senses of procedural were mapped to ODE senses of procedure, etc.).",
        "When this mapping was not straightforward, we just adopted the WordNet sense inventory for that word.",
        "We released the entire sense groupings (those induced from the manual mapping for words in the test set plus those automatically derived on the other words) and made them available to the participants."

        "We excluded auxiliary verbs, uncovered phrasal and idiomatic verbs, exclamatory uses, etc.",
        "The annotator was allowed to tag words with multiple coarse senses, but was asked to make a single sense assignment whenever possible.",
        "The lexicographer annotated an overall number of 2,316 content words.",
        "47 (2%) of them were excluded because no WordNet sense was deemed appropriate.",
        "The remaining 2,269 content words thus constituted the test data set.",
        "Only 8 of them were assigned more than one sense: specifically, two coarse senses were assigned to a single word instance4 and two distinct fine-grained senses were assigned to 7 word instances.",
        "This was a clear hint that the sense clusters were not ambiguous for the vast majority of words.",
        "In Table 2 we report information about the pol-ysemy of the word instances in the test set.",
        "Overall, 29.88% (678/2269) of the word instances were monosemous (according to our coarse sense inventory).",

        "As the inter-annotator agreement is often considered an upper bound for WSD systems, it was desirable to have a much higher number for our task, given its coarse-grained nature.",
