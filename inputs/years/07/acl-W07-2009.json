        "The task involves both finding the synonyms and disambiguating the context.",
        "Participating systems are free to use any lexical resource.",
        "There is a subtask which requires identifying cases where the word is functioning as part of a multiword in the sentence and detecting what that multiword is."

        "Word sense disambiguation (WSD) has been described as a task in need of an application.",
        "Whilst researchers believe that it will ultimately prove useful for applications which need some degree of semantic interpretation, the jury is still out on this point.",
        "One problem is that WSD systems have been tested on fine-grained inventories, rendering the task harder than it need be for many applications (Ide and Wilks, 2006).",
        "Another significant problem is that there is no clear choice of inventory for any given task (other than the use of a parallel corpus for a specific language pair for a machine translation application).",
        "The lexical substitution task follows on from some previous ideas (McCarthy, 2002) to examine the capabilities of WSD systems built by researchers on a task which has potential for NLP applications.",
        "Finding alternative words that can occur in given contexts would potentially be useful to many applications such as question answering, summarisation, paraphrase acquisition (Dagan et al., 2006), text simplification and lexical acquisition (McCarthy, 2002).",
        "Crucially this task does not specify the inventory for use beforehand to avoid bias to one predefined inventory and makes it easier for those using automatically acquired resources to enter the arena.",
        "Indeed, since the systems in SemEval did not know the candidate substitutes for a word before hand, the lexical resource is evaluated as much as the context based disambiguation component.",
        "2 Task set up The task involves a lexical sample of nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs.",
        "Both annotators and systems select one or more substitutes for the target word in the context of a sentence.",
        "The data was selected from the English Internet Corpus of English produced by Sharoff (2006) from the Internet (http://corpus.leeds.ac.uk/internet.html).",
        "This is a balanced corpus similar in flavour to the BNC, though with less bias to British English, obtained by sampling data from the web.",
        "Annotators are not provided with the PoS (noun, verb, adjective or adverb) but the systems are.",
        "Annotators can provide up to three substitutes but all should be equally as good.",
        "They are instructed that they can provide a phrase if they can't think of a good single word substitute.",
        "They can also use a slightly more general word if that is close in meaning.",
        "There is a ?NAME?",
        "response if the target is part of a proper name and ?NIL?",
        "response if annotators cannot think of a good substitute.",
        "The subjects are also asked to identify",
        "if they feel the target word is an integral part of a phrase, and what that phrase was.",
        "This option was envisaged for evaluation of multiword detection.",
        "Annotators did sometimes use it for paraphrasing a phrase with another phrase.",
        "However, for an item to be considered a constituent of a multiword, a majority of at least 2 annotators had to identify the same multiword.",
        "The annotators were 5 native English speakers from the UK.",
        "They each annotated the entire dataset.",
        "All annotations were semi-automatically lemma-tised (substitutes and identified multiwords) unless the lemmatised version would change the meaning of the substitute or if it was not obvious what the canonical version of the multiword should be."

        "298 of the trial, and 1696 of the test release remained after filtering items with less than 2 non NIL and non NAME responses and a few with erroneous PoS tags.",
        "The words included were selected either manually (70 words) from examination of a variety of lexical resources and corpora or automatically (131) using information in these lexical resources.",
        "Words were selected from those having a number of different meanings, each with at least one synonym.",
        "Since typically the distribution of meanings of a word is strongly skewed (Kilgarriff, 2004), for the test set we randomly selected 20 words in each PoS for which we manually selected the sentences 2 (we refer to these words as MAN) whilst for the remaining words (RAND) the sentences were selected randomly."
