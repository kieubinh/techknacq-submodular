        "Newspaper texts, narratives and other texts describe events that occur in time and specify the temporal location and order of these events.",
        "Text comprehension, amongst other capabilities, clearly requires the capability to identify the events described in a text and locate these in time.",
        "This capability is crucial to a wide range of NLP applications, from document summarization and question answering to machine translation.",
        "Recent work on the annotation of events and temporal relations has resulted in both a de-facto standard for expressing these relations and a hand-built gold standard of annotated texts.",
        "TimeML (Pustejovsky et al., 2003a) is an emerging ISO standard for annotation of events, temporal expressions and the anchoring and ordering relations between them.",
        "TimeBank (Pustejovsky et al., 2003b; Boguraev et al., forthcoming) was originally conceived of as a proof of concept that illustrates the TimeML language, but has since gone through several rounds of revisions and can now be considered a gold standard for temporal information.",
        "TimeML and TimeBank have already been used as the basis for automatic time, event and temporal relation annotation tasks in a number of research projects in recent years (Mani et al., 2006; Boguraev et al., forthcoming).",
        "An open evaluation challenge in the area of temporal annotation should serve to drive research forward, as it has in other areas of NLP.",
        "The automatic identification of all temporal referring expressions, events and temporal relations within a text is the ultimate aim of research in this area.",
        "However, addressing this aim in a first evaluation challenge was judged to be too difficult, both for organizers and participants, and a staged approach was deemed more effective.",
        "Thus we here present an initial evaluation exercise based on three limited tasks that we believe are realistic both from the perspective of assembling resources for development and testing and from the perspective of developing systems capable of addressing the tasks.",
        "They are also tasks, which should they be performable automatically, have application potential."

        "In the following we describe the tasks as they were ultimately realized in the evaluation.",
        "There were three tasks ?",
        "A, B and C. For all three tasks the data provided for testing and training includes annotations identifying: (1) sentence boundaries; (2) all temporal referring expression as",
        "specified by TIMEX3; (3) all events as specified in TimeML; (4) selected instances of temporal relations, as relevant to the given task.",
        "For tasks A and B a restricted set of event terms were identified ?",
        "those whose stems occurred twenty times or more in TimeBank.",
        "This set is referred to as the Event Target List or ETL.",
        "TASK A This task addresses only the temporal relations holding between time and event expressions that occur within the same sentence.",
        "Furthermore only event expressions that occur within the ETL are considered.",
        "In the training and test data, TLINK annotations for these temporal relations are provided, the difference being that in the test data the relation type is withheld.",
        "The task is to supply this label.",
        "TASK B This task addresses only the temporal relations holding between the Document Creation Time (DCT) and event expressions.",
        "Again only event expressions that occur within the ETL are considered.",
        "As in Task A, TLINK annotations for these temporal relations are provided in both training and test data, and again the relation type is withheld in the test data and the task is to supply this label.",
        "TASK C Task C relies upon the idea of their being a main event within a sentence, typically the syntactically dominant verb.",
        "The aim is to assign the temporal relation between the main events of adjacent sentences.",
        "In both training and test data the main events are identified (via an attribute in the event annotation) and TLINKs between these main events are supplied.",
        "As for Tasks A and B, the task here is to supply the correct relation label for these TLINKs."

        "The EVENT and TIMEX3 annotations were taken",

        "For task C, there was an extra annotation phase where the main events were marked up.",
        "Main events are those events that are syntactically dominant in the sentences.",
        "It should be noted that annotation of temporal relations is not an easy task for humans due to rampant temporal vagueness in natural language.",
        "As a result, inter-annotator agreement scores are well below the often kicked-around threshold of 90%, both for the TimeML relation set as well as the TempEval relation set.",
        "For TimeML temporal links, an inter-annotator agreement of 0.77 was reported, where agreement was measured by the average of precision and recall.",
        "The numbers for TempEval are even lower, with an agreement of 0.72 for anchorings of events to times (tasks A and B) and an agreement of 0.65 for event orderings (task C).",
        "Obviously, numbers like this temper the expectations for automatic temporal linking.",
        "The lower number for TempEval came a bit as a surprise because, after all, there were fewer relations to choose form.",
        "However, the TempEval annotation task is different in the sense that it did not give the annotator the option to ignore certain pairs of events and made it therefore impossible to skip hard-to-classify temporal relations."

        "The evaluation approach of TempEval avoids the interdependencies that are inherent to a network of temporal relations, where relations in one part of the network may constrain relations in any other part of the network.",
        "To accomplish that, TempEval deliberately focused on subtasks of the larger problem of automatic temporal annotation.",
        "One thing we may want to change to the present TempEval is the definition of task A.",
        "Currently, it instructs to temporally link all events in a sentence to all time expressions in the same sentence.",
        "In the future we may consider splitting this into two tasks, where one subtask focuses on those anchorings that are very local, like ?...White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater [said] [late yesterday] that...?.",
        "We expect both inter-annotator agreement and system performance to be higher on this subtask.",
        "There are two research avenues that loom beyond the current TempEval: (1) definition of other subtasks with the ultimate goal of establishing a hierarchy of subtasks ranked on performance of automatic taggers, and (2) an approach to evaluate entire time-lines.",
        "Some other temporal linking tasks that can be considered are ordering of consecutive events in a sentence, ordering of events that occur in syntactic subordination relations, ordering events in coordi-nations, and temporal linking of reporting events to the document creation time.",
        "Once enough temporal links from all these subtasks are added to the entire temporal graph, it becomes possible to let confidence scores from the separate subtasks drive a constraint propagation algorithm as proposed in (Allen, 1983), in effect using high-precision relations to constrain lower-precision relations elsewhere in the graph.",
        "With this more complete temporal annotation it is no longer possible to simply evaluate the entire graph by scoring pairwise comparisons.",
        "Instead the entire timeline must be evaluated.",
        "Initial ideas regarding this focus on transforming the temporal graph of a document into a set of partial orders built",
        "around precedence and inclusion relations and then evaluating each of these partial orders using some kind of edit distance measure.4 We hope to have taken the first baby steps with the three TempEval tasks."
