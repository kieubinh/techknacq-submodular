        "Because of time constraints on the data preparation, this year's task has proportionally more verbs and fewer nouns than previous All-Words English tasks, which may account for the lower scores.",

        "grained senses provides consistently higher performance than previous more fine-grained Lexical Sample Tasks.",

        "A gap of about 10 points between the verb and noun performance seems to indicate that in general the verbs were more difficult than the nouns.",

        "in spite of high human agreement.",
        "The hope is that better knowledge sources can overcome the gap still existing between the system performance and human agreement.",
