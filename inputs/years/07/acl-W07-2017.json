        "Recent years have witnessed a surge in available resources for the Arabic language.",
        "The computational linguistics community is just about starting to exploit these resources toward several interesting scientific and engineering goals.",
        "The Arabic language is interesting from a computational linguistic perspective.",
        "It is significantly different from English hence creating a challenge for existing technology to be easily portable to Arabic.",
        "The Arabic language is inherently complex due to its rich morphology and relative free word order.",
        "Moreover, with the existence of several interesting varieties, the spoken ver-naculars, we are witnessing the emergence of written dialectal Arabic everyday on the web, however there are no set standards for these varieties.",
        "We have seen many successful strides towards functional systems for Arabic enabling technolo-gies, but we are yet to read about large Arabic NLP applications such as Machine Translation and Information Extraction that are on par with performance on the English language.",
        "The problem is not the existence of data, but rather the existence of data annotated with the relevant level of information that is useful for NLP.",
        "This task attempts a step towards the goal of creating resources that could be useful for such applications.",
        "In this task, we presented practitioners in the field with challenge of labeling Arabic text with semantic labels.",
        "The labels constitute two levels of gran-ularity: sense labels and semantic role labels.",
        "We specifically chose data that overlapped such that we would have the same data annotated for different types of semantics, lexical and structural.",
        "The overall task of Arabic Semantic Labeling was subdivided into 4 sub-tasks: Arabic word sense disambiguation (AWSD), English to Arabic WSD task (EAWSD), argument detection within the context of semantic role labeling, and argument semantic role classification.",
        "Such a set of tasks would not have been feasible without the existence of several crucial resources: the Arabic Treebank (ATB) (Maamouri et al., 2004), the Arabic WordNet (AWN) (Elkateb et al., 2006), and the Pilot Arabic Propbank (APB).2 This paper is laid out as follows: Section 2 will describe some facts about the Arabic language; Section 3 will present the overall description of the tasks; Section 4 describes the word sense disambiguation task; Section 5 describes the semantic role labeling task.",
        "2 The Arabic Language In the context of our tasks, we only deal with MSA.3 Arabic is a Semitic language.",
        "It is known for its templatic morphology where words are made up of roots and affixes.",
        "Clitics agglutinate to words.",
        "For instance, the surface word wbHsnAthm4 ‘and by their virtues[fem.",
        "]’, can be split into the conjunction w ‘and’, preposition b ‘by’, the stem HsnAt ‘virtues [fem.",
        "]’, and possessive pronoun hm ‘their’.",
        "Arabic is different from English from both the morphological and syntactic perspectives which make it a challenging language to the existing NLP technology that is too tailored to the English language.",
        "From the morphological standpoint, Arabic exhibits rich morphology.",
        "Similar to English, Arabic verbs are marked explicitly for tense, voice and person, however in addition, Arabic marks verbs with mood (subjunctive, indicative and jussive) information.",
        "For nominals (nouns, adjectives, proper names), Arabic marks case (accusative, genitive and nominative), number, gender and definiteness features.",
        "Depending on the genre of the text at hand, not all of those features are explicitly marked on naturally occurring text.",
        "Arabic writing is known for being underspecified for short vowels.",
        "Some of the case, mood and voice features are marked only using short vowels.",
        "Hence, if the genre of the text were religious such as the Quran or the Bible, or pedagogical such as children’s books in Arabic, it would be fully specified for all the short vowels to enhance readability and disambiguation.",
        "From the syntactic standpoint, Arabic, different from English, is considered a pro-drop language, where the subject of a verb may be implicitly encoded in the verb morphology.",
        "Hence, we observe sentences such as Akl AlbrtqAl ‘ate-[he] the-oranges’, where the verb Akl encodes that the subject is a 3rd person masculine singular.",
        "This sentence is exactly equivalent to hw Akl AlbrtqAl ‘he ate the-oranges’.",
        "In the Arabic Treebank (ATB), we observe that 30% of all sentences are pro-dropped for subject.",
        "Also Arabic is different from English in that it exhibits a larger degree of free word order.",
        "For ex-ample, Arabic allows for subject-verb-object (SVO) and verb-subject-object (VSO) argument orders, as well as, OSV and OVS.",
        "In the ATB, we observe an equal distribution of both VSO and SVO orders 4We use the Buckwalter transliteration scheme to show romanized Arabic (Buckwalter, 2002).",
        "each equally 35% of the time.",
        "An example of an SVO sentence is AlrjAl AklwA AlbrtqAl ‘the-men ate-them the-oranges’, this is contrasted with Akl AlrjAl AlbrtqAl ‘ate the-men the-oranges’.",
        "Arabic exhibits more complex noun phrases than English mainly to express possession.",
        "These constructions are known as idafa constructions.",
        "In these complex structures an indefinite noun is followed by a definite noun.",
        "For example, rjl Al-byt ‘man the-house’ meaning ‘man of the house’.",
        "Accordingly, MSA does not have a special prepositional use to express possession in a manner similar to English.",
        "3 Overall Tasks Description Given the differences between English and Arabic, we anticipate that the process of automatically tagging text with semantic information might take more than just applying an English semantic labeler to Arabic.",
        "With this in mind, we decided to design a set of tasks that target different types of semantic annotations.",
        "We designed an all-words style word sense disambiguation (WSD) task for all the nouns and verbs in Arabic running text.",
        "Moreover, we designed another task where the participants are asked to detect and classify semantic role labels (SRL) for a large portion of newswire text.",
        "The WSD texts are chosen from the same set used for SRL.",
        "All the data is from the Arabic Treebank III ver.",
        "2 (ATB).",
        "The ATB consists of MSA newswire data from Annhar newspaper, from the months of July through November of 2002.",
        "The ATB is fully annotated with morphological information as well syntactic structural information.",
        "The released data for the subtasks is unvowelized and romanized using the Buckwalter transliteration scheme.",
        "The part of speech (POS) tag set used in the released data for both the WSD and the SRL subtasks is the reduced tag set that is officially released with the ATB.",
        "4 Task: WSD In the context of this task, word sense disambiguation is the process by which words in context are tagged with their specific meaning definitions from a predefined lexical resource such as a dictionary or taxonomy.",

        "long tradition of algorithms designed for solving this problem (Ide and Veronis, 1998).",
        "Most of the systems however target English since it is the language with most resources.",
        "In fact a big push forward dawned on English WSD with the wide release of significant resources such as WordNet.",
        "Arabic poses some interesting challenges for WSD since it has an inherent complexity in its writing system.",
        "As mentioned earlier, written MSA is underspecified for short vowels and diacritics.",
        "These short vowels and diacritics convey both lexical and inflectional information.",
        "For example, klyp could mean three different things, ‘all’, ‘kidney’ and ‘col- lege’.",
        "Due to the undiacritized, unvowelized writing system, the three meanings are conflated.",
        "If diacritics are explicitly present, we would observe a better distinction made between kly p ‘all’ or ‘col- lege’, and klyp ‘kidney’.",
        "Hence, full diacritization may be viewed as a level of WSD.",
        "But crucially, naturally occurring Arabic text conflates more words due to the writing system.",
        "To date, very little work has been published on Arabic WSD.",
        "This is mainly attributed to the lack in lexical resources for the Arabic language.",
        "But this picture is about to change with the new release of an Arabic WordNet (AWN).",
        "Arabic WordNet Arabic WordNet (AWN) is a lexical resource for modern standard Arabic.",
        "AWN is based on the design and contents of Princeton WordNet (PWN)(Fellbaum, 1998) and can be mapped onto PWN as well as a number of other wordnets, enabling translation on the lexical level to and from dozens of other languages.",
        "AWN focuses on the the Common Base Concepts (Tufis, 2004), as well as extensions specific to Arabic and Named Entities.",
        "The Base Concepts are translated manually by authors 2 and 3 into Arabic.",
        "Encoding is bi-directional: Arabic concepts for all senses are determined in PWN and encoded in AWN; when a new Arabic verb is added, extensions are made from verbal entries, including verbal derivations, nominalizations, verbal nouns, etc.",
        "To date, the database comprises over 8,000 synsets with over 15,000 words; about 1,400 synsets refer to Named Entities.",
        "Task design With the release of the AWN, we set out to design a subtask on Arabic WSD.",
        "The task had only trial and test data released in an XML compliant format marking instance, sentence and document boundaries.",
        "The relevant words are marked with their gross part of speech and underlying lemma and English gloss information.",
        "The participants are required to annotate the chosen instances with the synset information from AWN.",
        "Many of the entries in AWN are directly mapped to PWN 2.0 via the byte offset for the synsets.",
        "The two subtasks data comprised 1176 verb and noun instances: 256 verbs and 920 nouns.",
        "The annotators were only able to annotate 888 instances for both English and Arabic due to gaps in the AWN.",
        "Hence, the final data set comprised 677 nouns and 211 verbs.",
        "The gold standard data is annotated authors 2 and 3 of Arabic (the annotators who created the AWN).",
        "There was always an overlap in the data of around 300 instances.",
        "In the English Arabic WSD task, participants are provided with a specific English word in translation to an Arabic instance.",
        "They are also given the full English translation of the Arabic document.",
        "Unfortunately, there were no participants in the task.",
        "5 Task: Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) Shallow approaches to text processing have been garnering a lot of attention recently.",
        "Specifically, shallow approaches to semantic processing are making large strides in the direction of efficiently and effectively deriving tacit semantic information from text.",
        "Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) is one such approach.",
        "With the advent of faster and powerful com-puters, more effective machine learning algorithms, and importantly, large data resources annotated with relevant levels of semantic information FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) and ProbBank corpora (Palmer et al., 2005), we are seeing a surge in efficient approaches to SRL (Carreras and Ma`rquez, 2005).",
        "SRL is the process by which predicates and their arguments are identified and their roles defined in a sentence.",
        "To date, most of the reported SRL systems are for English.",
        "We do see some headway for other languages such as German and Chinese.",
        "The systems for the other languages follow the successful models devised for English, (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; 95 ( .",
        "( .",
        "( .",
        "Xue and Palmer, 2004; Pradhan et al., 2003).",
        "However, no SRL systems exist for Arabic.",
        "Challenges of Arabic for SRL Given the deep difference between such languages, this method may not be straightforward.",
        "To clarify this point, let us consider Figure 1.",
        "It illustrates a sample Arabic syntactic tree with the relevant part of speech tags and arguments defined.",
        "The sentence is m$rwE AlAmm AlmtHdp frD mhlp nhAyp l AtAHp AlfrSp AmAm qbrS.",
        "meaning ‘The United Nations’ project imposed a final grace period as an opportunity for Cyprus’.",
        "As we see in the figure, the predicate is frD ‘imposed’ and it has two numbered arguments: ARG0 is the subject of the sentence which is m$rwE AlAmm AlmtHdp ‘United Nations project’; ARG1, in the object position, namely, mhlp nhAyp ‘final grace period’.",
        "The predicate has an ARGM-PRP (purpose argument) in l AtAHp AlfrSp AmAm qbrS ‘as an opportunity for Cyprus’.",
        "As exemplified earlier in Section 2, there are several crucial structural differences between English and Arabic.",
        "These differences can make the SRL task much harder to resolve than it is for English.",
        "Pro-drop could cause a problem for Arabic SRL systems that do not annotate traces.",
        "Passivization is marked with a short vowel that hardly ever appears on unvocalized text.",
        "The structural word order could create problems.",
        "For instance for a sentence such as ‘the man reached – told the boy’, Alrjl ‘the man’ could be an ARG0 for the VSO, or ARG1 for an VOS.",
        "Or for the following structure Alwld blg Alrjl ‘the boy reached the man’, Alwld ‘the boy’ could be an ARG0 if it were a SVO sentence, or could be an ARG1 if it were an OVS sentence.",
        "Idafa constructions may cause problems for argument boundary detection systems unless the underlying parser is sensitive to these constructions.",
        "For example, in the sentence illustrated in Figure 1, the NP m$rwE AlAmm AlmtHdp ‘the United Nations’ project’ is an idafa construction, so the scope of the NP has to cover all three words and then assign the ARG boundary to the correct NP.",
        "Arabic Propbank Taking into consideration the possible challenges, an Arabic Propbank (APB) was created.",
        "APB comprises 200K words from ATB 3 version 2 annotating the proposition for each verb.",
        "The chosen verbs occur at least 12 times in the corpus covering 80% of the data.",
        "It provides semantic role annotations for 454 verbal predicates.",
        "The predicates are fully specified for diacritization hence no two lexically variant verbs are conflated.",
        "APB defines an overall 26 argument types.",
        "We have excluded here 4 of these argument types, three of which were absent from the training data and ARGM-TER which marks ATB errors.",
        "Once the verbs are chosen, the framers come up with frames based on a combination of syntactic and semantic behaviors expressed by the verb and its core arguments.",
        "The framers use their native intuition, look at a sample occurrence in the data, and use external sources to aid them in the frame-creating process.",
        "If the verb has more than one sense, it is divided into more than one frame depending on how it relates to its arguments.",
        "The arguments themselves are chosen based not only on what is deemed semantically necessary, but on frequency of usage, as well.",
        "Figure 1 shows an example predicate and its arguments annotated with semantic role labels.",
        "Task Design The Arabic SRL task is split into an argument boundary detection task and an argument classification task.",
        "We released data for the 95 most frequent verbs.",
        "An important characteristic of the dataset is the use of unvowelized Arabic in the Buckwalter transliteration scheme.",
        "We released the gold standard parses in the ATB as a source for syntactic parses for the data.",
        "The data is annotated with the reduced Bies POS tag set (in the LDC ATB distribution).",
        "The data comprises a development set of 886 sentences, a test set of 902 sentences, and a training set of 8,402 sentences.",
        "The development set comprises 1710 argument instances, the test data comprises 1657 argument instances, and training data comprises 21,194 argument instances.",
        "For evaluation we use the official CoNLL evaluator (Carreras and Ma`rquez, 2005).",

        "On the task of Semantic Role Labeling, we have created a test, training and development set that has been successfully validated through being employed for building the first Arabic SRL system.",
        "Hopefully, this data will help propel research in Arabic SRL.",
        "It is also worth noting that we currently have effectively created a data set that is annotated for word senses, lexical information such as full morphological specifications, syntactic and semantic parses as well as English glosses and translations.",
