        "poses considerable challenges for automatic systems due to the scarcity of sentiment clues in these units: sometimes, the decision about the text span sentiment has to be based on just a single sentiment clue and the cost of every error is high.",
        "This is particularly true for headlines, which are typically very short.",
        "Therefore, an ideal system for sentiment tagging of headlines has to use a large set of features with dependable sentiment annotations and to be able to reliably deduce the sentiment of the headline from the sentiment of its components.",

        "positive vs. negative and subjective vs. objective ?",
        "have attracted considerable attention in the recent years (Hu and Liu, 2004; Kim and Hovy, 2005; Riloff et al., 2006; Tur-ney and Littman, 2003; Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003).",
        "Unsupervised knowledge-based methods are the preferred approach to classification of sentences into positive and negative, mostly due to the lack of adequate amounts of labeled training data (Gamon and Aue, 2005).",
        "These approaches rely on presence and scores of sentiment-bearing words that have been acquired from dictionaries (Kim and Hovy, 2005) or corpora (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003).",
        "Their accuracy on news sentences is between 65 and 68%.",
        "Sentence-level subjectivity detection, where training data is easier to obtain than for positive vs. negative classification, has been successfully performed using supervised statistical methods alone (Pang and Lee, 2004) or in combination with a knowledge-based approach (Riloff et al., 2006).",
        "Since the extant literature does not provide clear evidence for the choice between supervised machine learning methods and unsupervised knowledge-based approaches for the task of ternary sentiment classification of sentences or headlines, we developed two systems for the Affective Text task at SemEval-2007.",

        "The system uses three main knowledge inputs: a list of sentiment-bearing unigrams, a list of valence shifters (Polanyi and Zaenen, 2006), and a set of rules that define the scope and results of combination of sentiment-bearing words with valence shifters."

        "The unigrams used for sentence/headline classification were learned from WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) dictionary entries using the STEP system described in (Andreevskaia and Bergler, 2006b).",
        "In order to take advantage of the special properties of WordNet glosses and relations, we developed a system that used the human-annotated adjectives from (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997) as a seed list and learned additional unigrams from WordNet synsets and glosses.",
        "The STEP algorithm starts with a small set of manually annotated seed words that is expanded using synonymy and antonymy relations in WordNet.",
        "Then the system searches all WordNet glosses and selects the synsets that contain sentiment-bearing words from the expanded seed list in their glosses.",
        "In order to eliminate errors produced by part-of-speech ambiguity of some of the seed words, the glosses are processed by Brill's part-of-speech tagger (Brill, 1995) and only the seed words with matching part-of-speech tags are considered.",

        "or ?Negativ?",
        "in the General Inquirer that were not picked up by STEP were added to the final list.",
        "Since sentiment-bearing words in English have different degree of centrality to the category of sentiment, we have constructed a measure of word centrality to the category of positive or negative sentiment described in our earlier work (Andreevskaia and Bergler, 2006a).",
        "The measure, termed Net Overlap Score (NOS), is based on the number of ties that connect a given word to other words in the category.",
        "The number of such ties is reflected in the number of times each word was retrieved from WordNet by multiple independent STEP runs with non-intersecting seed lists.",
        "This approach allowed us to assign NOSs to each unigram captured by multiple STEP runs.",
        "Only words with fuzzy membership score not equal to zero were retained in the list.",

        "The brevity of the headlines compared to typical news sentences2 requires that the system is able to make a correct decision based on very few sentiment clues.",
        "Due to the scarcity of sentiment clues, the additional factors, such as presence of valence shifters, have a greater impact on the system performance on headlines than on sentences or texts, where impact of a single error can often be compensated by a number of other, correctly identified sentiment clues.",
        "For this reason, we complemented the system based on fuzzy score counts with the capability to discern and take into account some relevant elements of syntactic structure of sentences.",
        "We added to the system two components in order to enable this capability: (1) valence shifter handling rules and (2) parse tree analysis.",

        "In order to correctly determine the scope of valence shifters in a sentence, we introduced into the system the analysis of the parse trees produced by MiniPar (Lin, 1998).",

        "On the other hand, supervised machine learning has good recall even with a relatively small training set, but its precision and accuracy are low.",
