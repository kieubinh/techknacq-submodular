        "?cause-effect?).",
        "The system should return ?true?",
        "if a person reading the sentence would conclude that the relation holds between the two la-beled noun phrases.",
        "Our system represents a test sentence with a semantic graph, including the relation being tested and both of its proposed arguments.",
        "Semantic distance is calculated between this graph and a set of graphs representing the training examples relevant to the test sentence.",
        "A near-match between a test sentence and a positive training example is evidence that the same relation which holds in the example also holds in the test.",
        "We compute semantic distances to negative training examples as well, comparing the total positive and negative scores in order to decide whether a relation is true or false in the test sentence."

      "heading": "2 Motivation",
      "text": [
        "Many systems which perform well on related tasks use syntactic features of the input sentence, coupled with classification by machine learning.",
        "This approach has been applied to problems like compound noun interpretation (Rosario and Hearst 2001) and semantic role labeling (Gildea and Ju-rafsky 2002).",
        "In preparing our system for Task 4, we started by applying a similar syntax-based feature analysis to the trial data: 140 labeled examples of the relation ?content-container?.",
        "In 10-fold cross-validation with this data we achieved an average f-score of 70.6, based on features similar to the subset trees used for semantic role labeling in (Mo-schitti 2004).",
        "For classification we applied the updated tree-kernel package (Moschitti 2006), distributed with the svm-light tool (Joachims 1999) for learning Support Vector Machines (SVMs).",
        "Training data for Task 4 is small, compared to other tasks where machine learning is commonly applied.",
        "We had difficulty finding a combination of features which gave good performance in cross-validation, but which did not result in a separate support vector being stored for every training sentence ?",
        "a possible indicator of overfitting.",
        "As an example, the ratio of support vectors to training",
        "examples for the experiment described above was .97, nearly 1-to-1.",
        "As a result of this analysis we started work on our knowledge-based system, with the goal of using the two approaches together.",
        "We were also motivated by an interest in using relation definitions and background knowledge from WordNet to greater advantage.",
        "The algorithm we used in our final submission is similar to recent systems which discover textual entailment relationships (Haghig-hi, Ng et al. 2005; Zanzotto and Moschitti 2006).",
        "It gives us a way to encode information from the relation definitions directly, in the form of statements in a knowledge representation language.",
        "The inference rules that are learned by this system from training examples are also easier to interpret than the models generated by an SVM.",
        "In small-data applications this can be an advantage."

        "After instantiating the graph we generalize it using hypernym information from WordNet.",

        "Counter-evidence for a test sentence can be calculated in the same way, using relevant negative statements.",
