        "Therefore we had the hypothesis that the NEs in the documents for a person name should be a main distinctive criterion for disambiguating people.",
        "Furthermore, the relational context of a person name should also be able to give good clues for disambiguation.",
        "Sentence patterns related to a name, i.e. patterns that contain the name as subject or object like ?be(Person X, lawyer)?",
        "often convey uniquely identifying information about a person.",
