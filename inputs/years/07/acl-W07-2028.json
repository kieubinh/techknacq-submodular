        "The starting point of our research is an approach for identifying relations between named entities exploiting only shallow linguistic information, such as tokenization, sentence splitting, part-of-speech tagging and lemmatization (Giuliano et al., 2006).",
        "A combination of kernel functions is used to represent two distinct information sources: (i) the global context where entities appear and (ii) their local contexts.",
        "The whole sentence where the entities appear (global context) is used to discover the presence of a relation between two entities.",
        "Windows of limited size around the entities (local contexts) provide useful clues to identify the roles played by the entities within a relation (e.g., agent and target of a gene interaction).",
        "In the task of detecting protein-protein interactions, we obtained state-of-the-art results on two biomedical data sets.",
        "In addition, promising results have been recently obtained for relations such as work for and org based in in the news domain1.",
        "In this paper, we investigate the use of the above approach to discover semantic relations between nominals.",
        "In addition to the original feature representation, we have integrated deep syntactic processing of the global context and semantic information for each candidate nominals using WordNet as external knowledge source.",
        "Each source of information is represented by kernel functions.",
        "A tree kernel (Moschitti, 2004) is used to exploit the deep syntactic processing obtained using the Charniak parser (Charniak, 2000).",
        "On the other hand, bag of synonyms and hypernyms is used to enhance the representation of the candidate nominals.",
        "The final system is based on five basic kernel functions (bag-of-words kernel, global context kernel, tree kernel, supersense kernel, bag of synonyms and hypernyms kernel) linearly combined and weighted under different conditions.",
        "The experiments were carried out using support vector machines (Vapnik, 1998) as classifier.",

        "Experimental results show that our kernel-based approach is appropriate also to detect semantic relations between nominals.",

        "E.g.,",
        "for content-container we obtain the best performance combining the tree kernel and the bag of synonyms and hypernyms kernel; on the other hand, for instrument-agency the best performance is obtained by combining the global kernel and the supersense kernel.",
        "Surprisingly, the supersense kernel alone works quite well and obtains results comparable to the bag of synonyms and hypernyms kernel.",
        "This result is particularly interesting as a supersense tag-ger can easily provide a satisfactory accuracy (Ciaramita and Altun, 2006).",
        "On the other hand, obtaining an acceptable accuracy in word sense disambiguation (required for a realistic application of the bag of synonyms and hypernyms kernel) is impractical as a sufficient amount of training for at least all nouns is currently not available.",
        "Hence, the supersense could play a crucial role to improve the performance when approaching this task without the nominals disambiguated.",
        "To model the global context using the Fore-Between, Between and Between-After contexts did not produce a significant improvement with respect to the bag-of-words model.",
        "This is mainly due to the fact that examples have been collected from the Web using heuristic patterns/queries, most of which implying Between patterns/contexts (e.g., for the cause-effect relation ?",
        "* comes from *?, ?",
