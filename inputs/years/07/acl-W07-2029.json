        "The lexical substitution (Glickman et al., 2006a) can be regarded as a subtask of the lexical entailment, in which for a given word in context the system is asked to select an alternative word that can be replaced in that context preserving the meaning.",
        "Lexical Entailment, and in particular lexical reference (Glickman et al., 2006b)1 , is in turn a subtask of textual entailment, which is formally defined as a relationship between a coherent text T and a language expression, the hypothesis H .",
        "T is said to entail H , denoted by T ?",
        "H , if the meaning of H can be inferred from the meaning of T (Dagan et al., 2005; Dagan and Glickman., 2004).",
        "Even though this notion has been only recently proposed in the computational linguistics literature, it attracts more and more attention due to the high generality of its settings and to the usefulness of its (potential) applications.",
        "1In the literature, slight variations of this problem have been also referred to as sense matching (Dagan et al., 2006).",
        "With respect to lexical entailment, the lexical substitution task has a more restrictive criterion.",
        "In fact, two words can be substituted when meaning is preserved, while the criterion for lexical entailment is that the meaning of the thesis is implied by the meaning of the hypothesis.",
        "The latter condition is in general ensured by substituting either hyperonyms or synonyms, while the former is more rigid because only synonyms are in principle accepted.",
        "Formally, in a lexical entailment task a system is asked to decide whether the substitution of a particular term w with the term e in a coherent text Hw = H lwHr generates a sentence He = H leHr such that Hw ?",
        "He, where H l and Hr denote the left and the right context of w, respectively.",
        "For example, given the source word ?weapon?",
        "a system may substitute it with the target synonym ?arm?, in order to identify relevant texts that denote the sought concept using the latter term.",
        "A particular case of lexical entailment is recognizing synonymy, where both Hw ?",
        "He and He ?",
        "Hw hold.",
        "The lexical substitution task at SEMEVAL addresses exactly this problem.",
        "The task is not easy since lists of candidate entailed words are not provided by the organizers.",
        "Therefore the system is asked first to identify a set of candidate words, and then to select only those words that fit in a particular context.",
        "To promote unsupervised methods, the organizers did not provide neither labeled data for training nor dictionaries or list of synonyms explaining the meanings of the entailing words.",
        "In this paper, we describe our approach to the Lexical Substitution task at SEMEVAL 2007.",
        "We developed two different systems (named IRST1-lsa and IRST2-syn in the official task ranking), both exploiting a common lists of synonyms extracted from dictionaries (i.e. WordNet and the Oxford Dictio",
        "nary) and ranking them according to two different criteria: Domain Proximity: the similarity between each candidate entailed word and the context of the entailing word is estimated by means of a cosine between their corresponding vectors in the LSA space.",
        "Syntagmatic Coherence: querying a large corpus, the system finds all occurrences of the target sentence, in which the entailing word is substituted with each synonym, and it assigns scores proportional to the occurrence frequencies.",
        "Results show that both methods are effective.",
        "In particular, the second method achieved the best performance in the competition, defining the state-of-the-art for the lexical substitution task."

        "We exploited two corpora for our systems: the British National Corpus for acquiring the LSA space for ranking with domain proximity measure (Section 2.2) and the Web 1T 5-gram Version 1 corpus from Google (distributed by Linguistic Data Consortium)2 for ranking the proposed synonyms according to syntagmatic coherence (Section 2.3)."
