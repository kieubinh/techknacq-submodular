        "We use the term entity to mean a specific person or object.",
        "A mention is a reference to an entity such as a word or phrase in a document.",
        "Taken together, all mentions that refer to the same real-world object model that entity (Mitchell et al. 2004).",
        "Entity disambiguation inherently involves resolving many-to-many relationships.",
        "Multiple distinct strings may refer to the same entity.",
        "Simultaneously, multiple identical mentions refer to distinct entities (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998).",
        "Fair Isaac's entity disambiguation software is based largely on language-independent algorithms that resolve mentions in the context of the entire corpus.",
        "The system utilizes multiple types of context as evidence for determining whether two mentions correspond to the same entity and it automatically learns the weight of evidence of each context item via corpus statistics.",
        "The goal of the Web People Search task (Artiles et al. 2007) is to assign Web pages to groups, where each group contains all (and only those) pages that refer to one unique entity.",
        "A page is assigned to multiple groups if it mentions multiple entities, for example ?John F. Kennedy? and the ?John F. Kennedy Library?.",
        "The pages were selected via a set of keyword queries, and the disambiguation is evaluated only on those query entities.",
        "This differs from Fair Isaac's system in a few key ways: our system deals with mentions rather than documents, our system does not require a filter on mentions, and our system is generally used for large collections of documents containing very many names rather than small sets of highly ambiguous documents dealing with one specific name.",
        "Nevertheless, it was possible to run the Fair Isaac entity disambiguation system on the Web People Search task data with almost no modifications and achieve accurate results.",
        "The remaining sections of this paper describe Fair Isaac's automatic entity disambiguation methodology and report on the performance of the system on the WePS data."

        "In unstructured text, each document provides a natural context for entity disambiguation.",
        "After cleaning up extraneous markup we carry out within-document co-reference resolution, aggregating information about each entity mentioned in each document.",
        "We then use these entity attributes as features in determining which documents deal with the same entity."

      "text": [
        "The first challenge in dealing with data from the Web is to decide which documents are useful and",
        "what text from those documents contains relevant information.",
        "As a first pass, the first HTML file in a folder which contained the query name was used as the main page.",
        "In retrospect, it might have been better to combine all portions of the page, or choose the longest page.",
        "We copied the title element and converted all text chunks to paragraphs, eliminating all other HTML and script.",
        "If no HTML was found in the directory for a page, the first text file which contained the query was used instead."

      "text": [
        "When dealing with unstructured text, a named entity recognition (NER) system provides the input to the entity disambiguation.",
        "Due to time constraints and that Persons are the entity type of primary interest, any mention that matches one of the query strings is automatically labeled as a Person, regardless of its actual type.",
        "As described in Blume (2005), the system next carries out entity type-specific parsing in order to extract entity attributes such as titles, generate standardized names (e.g. p_abdul_khan_p for ?Dr.",
        "Abdul Q.",
        "Khan?",
        "), and populate the data structures (token hashes) that are used to perform the within-document entity disambiguation.",
        "We err on the side of not merging entities rather than incorrectly merging entities.",
        "Looking at multiple documents provides additional statistics.",
        "Thus, the cross-document disambiguation process described in the next section will still merge some entities even within individual documents."

      "heading": "2.3 Cross-Document Disambiguation",
      "text": [
        "Our cross-document entity disambiguation relies on one key insight: an entity can be distinguished by the company it keeps.",
        "If Abdul Khan 1 associates with different people and organizations at different locations than Abdul Khan 2, then he is probably a different person.",
        "Furthermore, if it is possible to compare two entities based on one type of context, it is possible to compare them based on every type of context.",
        "Within each domain, we require a finite set of context items.",
        "In the domains of co-occurring locations, organizations, and persons, these are the standardized names derived in the entity information extraction phase of within-document disambiguation.",
        "We use the logarithm of the inverse name frequency (the number of standard person names with which this context item appears), INF, as a weight indicating the salience of each context item.",
        "Co-occurrence with a common name provides less indication that two mentions correspond to the same entity than co-occurrence with an uncommon name.",
        "To reduce noise, only entities that occur within a given window of entities are included in this vector.",
        "In all test runs, this window is set to 10 entities on either side.",
        "Because of the effects that small corpora have on statistics, we added a large amount of newswire text to improve frequency counts.",
        "Many of the query names would have low frequency in a text corpus that is not about them specifically, but have high frequency in this task because each document contains at least one mention of them.",
        "This would cause the INF weight to incorrectly estimate the importance of any token; adding additional documents to the disambiguation run reduces this effect and brings frequency counts to more realistic levels.",
        "We similarly count title tokens that occur with the entity and compute INF weights for the title tokens.",
        "Topic context, as described in Blume (2005), was used in some post-submission runs.",
        "We define a separate distance measure per context domain.",
        "We are able to discount the co-occurrence with multiple items as well as quantify an unexpected lack of shared co-occurrence by engineering each distance measure for each specific domain.",
        "The score produced by each distance measure may be loosely interpreted as the log of the likelihood of two randomly generated contexts sharing the observed degree of similarity.",
        "In addition to the context-based distance measures, we utilize a lexical (string) distance measure based on exactly the same transformations as used to compare strings for intra-document entity disambiguation plus the Soundex algorithm (Knuth 1998) to measure whether two name tokens sound the same.",
        "A large negative score indicates a great deal of similarity (log likelihood).",
        "The process of cross-document entity disambiguation now boils down to repeatedly finding a pair of entities, comparing them (computing the sum of the above distance measures), and merging them if the score exceeds some threshold.",
        "We compute sets of keys based on lexical similarity and compare only entities that are likely to match.",
        "The WePS evaluation only deals with entities that match a query.",
        "Thus, we added a new step of key generation based on the query."

        "The NER process identified a ratio of approximately 220 mentions per document across 3,359 documents.",
        "Within-document entity disambiguation reduced this to approximately 113 entities per document, which we refer to as document-level entities.",
        "Of these, 3,383 Persons (including those Organizations and Locations which were relabeled as Persons) contained a query name.",
        "Cross-document entity disambiguation reduced this to 976 distinct persons with 721 distinct standardized names.",
        "Thus, 2,407 merge operations were performed in this step.",
        "On average, there are 48 mentions per query name.",
