        "Lexical substitution aims to find alternative words that can occur in given contexts.",
        "It is important in many applications, such as query reformulation in question answering, sentence generation, and paraphrasing.",
        "There are two key problems in the lexical substitution task, the first of which is candidate substitute extraction.",
        "Generally speaking, synonyms can be regarded as candidate substitutes of words.",
        "However, some looser lexical relationships can also be considered, such as Hypernyms and Hyponyms defined in WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "In addition, since lexical substitution is context dependent, some words which do not have similar meanings in general may also be substituted in some certain contexts (Zhao et al., 2007).",
        "As a result, finding a lexical knowledge base for substitute extraction is a challenging task.",
        "The other problem is candidate scoring and ranking according to given contexts.",
        "In the lexical substitution task of SemEval-2007, context is constrained as a sentence.",
        "The system therefore has to score the candidate substitutes of each target word using the given sentence.",
        "The following questions should be considered here: (1) What words in the given sentence are ?useful?",
        "context?",
        "(2) How to combine the context words and use them in ranking candidate substitutes?",
        "For the first question, we can use all words of the sentence, words in a window, or words having syntactic relations with the target word.",
        "For the second question, we can regard the context words as ?bag of words?, n-grams, or syntactic structures.",
        "In HIT, we extract candidate substitutes from WordNet, in which both synonyms and hypernyms are investigated (Section 3.1).",
        "After that, we score the candidates using a web-based scoring method (Section 3.2).",
        "In this method, we first select fragments containing the target word from the given sentence.",
        "Then we construct queries by replacing the target word in the fragments with the candidate substitute.",
        "Finally, we search Google using the constructed queries and score each candidate based on the counts of retrieved snippets.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews some related work on lexical substitution.",
        "Section 3 describes our system, especially the web-based scoring method.",
        "Section 4 presents the results and analysis."

        "Synonyms defined in WordNet have been widely used in lexical substitution and expansion (Smea-ton et al., 1994; Langkilde and Knight, 1998; Bol",
        "shakov and Gelbukh, 2004).",
        "In addition, a lot of methods have been proposed to automatically construct thesauri of synonyms.",
        "For example, Lin (1998) clustered words with similar meanings by calculating the dependency similarity.",
        "Barzilay and McKeown (2001) extracted paraphrases using multiple translations of literature works.",
        "Wu and Zhou (2003) extracted synonyms with multiple resources, including a monolingual dictionary, a bilingual corpus, and a monolingual corpus.",
        "Besides the handcrafted and automatic synonym resources, the web has been exploited as a resource for lexical substitute extraction (Zhao et al., 2007).",
        "As for substitute scoring, various methods have been investigated, among which the classification method is the most widely used (Dagan et al., 2006; Kauchak and Barzilay, 2006).",
        "In detail, a binary classifier is trained for each candidate substitute, using the contexts of the substitute as features.",
        "Then a new contextual sentence containing the target word can be classified as 1 (the candidate is a correct substitute in the given sentence) or 0 (otherwise).",
        "The features used in the classification are usually similar with that in word sense disambiguation (WSD), including bag of word lemmas in the sentence, n-grams and parts of speech (POS) in a window, etc.",
        "There are other models presented for candidate substitute scoring.",
        "Glickman et al. (2006) proposed a Bayesian model and a Neural Network model, which estimate the probability of a word may occur in a given context."

        "As mentioned above, all words in the given sentence can be used as contextual information in the scoring of candidate substitutes.",
        "However, it is obvious that not all context words are really useful when determining a word's substitutes.",
        "An example can be seen from Figure 1.",

        "The useless contexts may even be noise if they are used in the scoring.",
        "As a result, it is important to select context words carefully.",
        "In HIT, we select context words based on the following assumption: useful context words for lexical substitute are those near the target word in the given sentence.",
        "In other words, the words that are far from the target word are not taken into consideration.",
        "Obviously, this assumption is not always true.",
        "However, considering only the neighboring words can reduce the risk of bringing in noise.",
        "Besides, Edmonds (1997) has also demonstrated in his paper that short-distance collocations with neighboring words are more useful in lexical choice than long ones.",
        "Let w be the target word, t a candidate substitute, S the context sentence.",
        "Our basic idea is that: One can substitute w in S with t, which generates a new sentence S?.",
        "If S?",
        "can be found on the web, then the substitute is admissible.",
        "The more times S?",
        "occurs on the web, the more probable the substitute is.",
        "In practice, however, it is difficult to find a whole sentence S?",
        "on the web due to sparseness.",
        "Instead, we use fragments of S?",
        "which contains t and several neighboring context words (based on the assumption above).",
        "Then the question is how to obtain one (or more) fragment of S?.",
        "A window with fixed size can be used here.",
        "Suppose p is the position of t in S?, for instance, we can construct a fragment using words from position p-r to p+r, where r is the radius of window.",
        "However, a fixed r is difficult to set, since it may be too large for some sentences, which makes the fragments too specific, while too small for some other sentences, which makes the fragments too loose.",

        "1(a) But when Daniel turned <head>blue</head> one time and he totally stopped breathing.",

        "1(b) and 2(b) are fragments constructed according to 1(a) and 2(a), where the window radius is 2 and t denotes any candidate substitute of the target word.",
        "It is obvious that 1(b) is a rather strict fragment, which makes it difficult to find sentences containing it on the web, while 2(b) is quite loose, which can hardly constrain the semantics of t. Having considered the problem above, we propose a rule-based method that constructs fragments with varied lengths.",
        "Let Ft be a fragment containing t, the construction rules are as follows: Rule-1: Ft must contain at least two words besides t, at least one of which is non-stop word.",
        "Rule-2: Ft does not cross sub-sentence boundary (?,?).",
        "Rule-3: Ft should be the shortest fragment that satisfies Rule-1 and Rule-2.",

        ": (1) t occurs at the beginning of Ft, (2) t occurs in the middle of Ft, and (3) t occurs at the end of Ft.",
        "Here we have another constraint: if one constructed fragment F1 is the substring of F2, then F2 is removed.",
        "Please note that the morphology is not taken into account when we construct queries.",
        "For the sentence 1(a) and 2(a) in Table 1, the constructed fragments are as follows: For 1(a): Daniel turned t; t one time; turned t one For 2(a): recommend that you t; t with us be",
        "To score a candidate substitute, we replace ?t?",
