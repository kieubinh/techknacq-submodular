        "In the task Multilevel Semantic Annotation of Catalan and Spanish of the SemEval competition 2007, the target are two different languages.",
        "The general SRL task consists of two tasks: prediction of semantic roles (SR) and prediction of the semantic class of the verb (SC).",
        "The data provided in the task (Ma`rquez et al., 2007) are sentences annotated with lemma, POS tags, syntactic information, semantic roles, and the semantic classes of the verb.",
        "A training corpus for Catalan (ca.3LB) and another for Spanish (sp.3LB) are provided.",
        "Although the setting is similar to the CoNLL?Shared Task 2005, three relevant differences are that the corpora are significantly smaller, that the syntactic information is based on a manually corrected treebank, which contains also syntactic functions (i.e. direct object, indirect object, etc.",
        "), and that the set of semantic roles is larger, especially for core arguments.",
        "Our goal is to check whether simple individual systems could produce competitive results in both subtasks, and whether they would be robust enough when applied to two languages and to the held?out test sets provided."

        "processing phase that is very similar to the sequen-tialization in (Ma`rquez et al., 2005).",

        "and the clause boundaries in order to look for the siblings of the verb that are under the same clause.",
        "Our assumption is that all siblings of the verb are potential candidates for semantic roles.",
        "The focus selection process produces two groups of focus tokens: on the one hand, the verbs and, on the other, the siblings of",
        "the verbs.",

      "heading": "2.2 Classification",
      "text": [
        "In both systems we approach the classification task in one step, predicting directly the SR and the SC class.",
        "This means that in the SR task we do not perform a previous classification to select the tokens that might be assigned a role.",
        "We assume that all verbs belong to a class.",
        "As for the SR, we assume that most siblings of the verb will have a class, except for those that have syntactic functions AO, ET, MOD, NEG, IMPERS, PASS, and VOC.",
        "The siblings that do not have a semantic role are assigned the NONE tag.",
        "Because the corpus is small and because the amount of instances with a NONE class is proportionally low, we do not consider it necessary to filter these cases.",
        "Regarding the learning algorithm, we use the IB1 classifier as implemented in TiMBL (version 5.1) (Daelemans et al., 2004), a supervised inductive algorithm for learning classification tasks based on the k nearest neighbor (k-nn) algorithm.",
        "In IB1, similarity is defined by a feature?level distance metric between a test instance and a memorized training instance.",
        "The metric combines a per?feature value?",
        "based distance metric with global feature weights that account for relative differences in importance of the features.",
        "The TiMBL parameters used in the systems are the IB1 algorithm, the Jeffrey Divergence as feature metric, MVDM threshold at level 1, weighting using GainRatio, k=11, and weighting neighbors as function of their Inverse Linear Distance (for details we refer the reader to the TiMBL reference guide (Daelemans et al., 2004)).",
        "As for the features, we started by using the same feature set for both classifiers and then, after some experimentation, we decided to use slightly different feature sets for the two sub-tasks.",
        "Most of the features we designed are features that have become standard for the SRL task (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Xue and Palmer, 2004; Carreras and Ma`rquez, 2004; Carreras and Ma`rquez, 2005).",
        "In our system, the features relate to the verb, the verb siblings, what we take to be the content word of the siblings, the clause, and the relation verb?arguments.",
        "Additionally, we added lexical features extracted from the verb lexicon provided for the task, and from Word-Net.",
        "After experimenting with 323 features, we selected 98 for the SR task and 77 for the SC subclass.",
        "In order to select the features, we started with a basic system, the results of which were used as a baseline.",
        "Every new feature that was added to the basic system was evaluated in terms of average accuracy in 10- fold cross-validation experiments; if it improved the performance on held-out data, it was added to the selection.",
        "One problem with this hill-climbing method is that the selection of features is determined by the order in which the features have been introduced.",
        "We also performed experiments applying the feature selection process reported in (Tjong Kim Sang et al., 2005), a bidirectional hill climbing process.",
        "However, experiments with this advanced method did not produce a better selection of features.",
        "The features for the SR prediction subtask are the following: ?",
        "Features on the verb (6).",
        "They are shared by all the instances that represent phrases belonging to the same clause: VForm; VLemma; VCau: binary feature that indicate if the verb is in a causative construction with hacer, fer or if the main verb is causar; VPron, VImp, VPass: binary features that indicate if the verb is pronominal, impersonal, and in passive form respectively.",
