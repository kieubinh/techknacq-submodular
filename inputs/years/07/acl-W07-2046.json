        "There has been a growing interest in temporal information extraction in recent years, as more and more operational NLP systems demands dealing with time-related issues in natural languages.",
        "In this paper, we report on an end-to-end system that is capable of automating identification of temporal referring expressions, events and temporal relations in text by leveraging various NLP tools and linguistic resources at LCC.",
        "It has to be noted that the system we report here is not only intended for TempEval 2007 evaluation, but will also be used as a NLP tool for our other applications (e.g. temporal Question Answering).",
        "That is why we experimented to use our own temporal and event extraction capabilities in this work, although time and event tags have already been provided in the testing/training data.",
        "Another reason we use our own temporal tagging is that our temporal tagger extracts more information than that available in the training/testing data.",
        "For instance, temporal signals are removed from the data that the task organizers provide, but our temporal tagger detects that, as part of the tagging procedure.",
        "The following is an example for the tagged expression ?on this coming Sunday?.",
        "Our data structure allows us to easily access and manipulate any part of the tagged chunk of text, which leaves the interpretation of whether the temporal signal on in the example is part of the temporal expression to users of temporal tagger.",
        "Taking as input this data structure, the normalization, including relative date resolution, is a straightforward process, provided that the reference time can be computed from the context.",
        "For temporal relation identification, by leveraging the capabilities of our temporal tagger, event tagger and several other in-house NLP tools, we derive a rich set of syntactic and semantic features for use by machine learning.",
        "We also explored the possibility of combining the rule-based approach with machine learning in an integrated manner so that our system can take advantage of these two approaches for temporal relation identification."

        "AGENT or SUBJECT) of event terms and a context detector to detect linguistic contexts in a discourse.",
        "We use such information as extended features for machine learning.",
        "The Temporal Tagger tags and normalizes temporal expressions conforming to the TimeML guideline.",
        "The Temporal Merger compares our own temporal and event tagging with those supplied in training/testing data.",
