        "The existence of links between grammatical relations and various forms of semantic interpretation has long been observed; grammatical relations play a crucial role in theories of linking, i.e. the realization of the semantic arguments of predicates as syntactic units (Manning, 1994; Mel?c?uk, 1988).",
        "Grammatical relations may be covered by many definitions but it is probably easier to use them as an extension of dependency grammars, where relations take the form of arc labels.",
        "In addition, some linguistic phenomena such as wh-movement and discontinuous structures are conveniently described using dependency syntax by allowing nonprojective dependency arcs.",
        "It has also been claimed that dependency syntax is easier to understand and to teach to people without a linguistic background.",
        "Despite these advantages, dependency syntax has relatively rarely been used in semantic structure extraction, with a few exceptions.",
        "Ahn et al. (2004) used a post-processing step to convert constituent trees into labeled dependency trees that were then used as input to a semantic role labeler.",
        "Pradhan et al.",
        "(2005) used a rule-based dependency parser, but the results were significantly worse than when using a constituent parser.",
        "This paper describes a system for frame-semantic structure extraction that is based on a dependency parser.",
        "The next section presents the dependency grammar that we rely on.",
        "We then give the details on the frame detection and disambiguation, the frame element (FE) identification and classification, and dictionary extension, after which the results and conclusions are given."

        "The last few years have seen an increasing interest in dependency parsing (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006) with significant improvements of the state of the art, and dependency treebanks are now available for a wide range of languages.",
        "The parsing algorithms are comparatively easy to implement and efficient: some of the algorithms parse sentences in linear time (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003; Nivre et al., 2006).",
        "In the semantic structure extraction system, we used the Stanford part-of-speech tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003) to tag the training and test sentences and MaltParser, a statistical dependency parser (Nivre et al., 2006), to parse them.",
        "We trained the parser on the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993).",
        "The dependency trees used to train the parser were created from the constituent trees using a conversion program (Johansson and Nugues, 2007)1.",
        "The converter handles most of the secondary edges in the Treebank and encodes those edges as (generally) nonprojective dependency arcs.",
        "Such information is available in the Penn Treebank in the form of empty categories and secondary edges, it is however not available in the output of traditional constituent parsers, although there have been some attempts to apply a post-processing step to predict it, see Ahn et al. (2004), inter alia.",

        "We also removed all targets that had been tagged as support verbs for some other target.",
        "For the target words left after the filtering, we used a classifier to assign a frame, following Erk (2005).",
        "We trained a disambiguating SVM classifier on all ambiguous words listed in FrameNet.",
        "Its accuracy was 84% on the ambiguous words, compared to a first-sense baseline score of 74%.",
        "The classifier used the following features: target lemma, target word, subcategorization frame (for verb targets only), the set of dependencies of the target, the set of words of the child nodes, and the parent word of the target.",
        "The subcategorization frame feature was formed by concatenating the dependency labels of the children, excluding subject, parentheticals, punctuation and coordinations.",
        "For instance, for kidnap in Figure 2, the feature is PRP+OBJ.",
        "Coverage is one of the main weaknesses of the current FrameNet lexical database ?",

        "We tried to remedy this problem by training classifiers to find words that are related to the words in a frame.",

        "All senses of the lemma were used, and the features were weighted with respect to the relative frequency of the sense.",
        "Using this feature representation, we trained an SVM classifier for each frame that tells whether a lemma belongs to that frame or not.",
        "The FrameNet dictionary could thus be extended by 18,372 lexical units.",
        "If we assume a Zipf distribution and that the lexical units already in FrameNet are the most common ones, this would increase the",
        "coverage by up to 9%.",
        "In the test set, the new lexical units account for 53 out of the 808 target words our system detected (6.5%).",
        "We roughly estimated the precision to 70% by manually inspecting 100 randomly selected words in the extended dictionary.",
        "This strategy is most successful when the frame is equivalent to one or a few synsets (and their subtrees).",
        "For instance, for the frame MEDI-CAL_CONDITION, we can add the complete sub-tree of the synset pathological state, resulting in 641 new lemmas referring to all sorts of diseases.",
        "On the other hand, the strategy also works well for motion verbs (which often exhibit complex patterns of polysemy): 137 lemmas could be added to the SELF_MOTION frame.",
        "Examples of frames with frequent errors are LEADERSHIP, which includes many insects (probably because the most frequent sense of queen in SemCor is the queen bee), and FOOD, which included many chemical substances as well as inedible plants and animals."
