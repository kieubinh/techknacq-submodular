        "This paper describes the system we developed for the SemEval lexical substitution task, a new task in SemEval-2007.",
        "Although we tested different configurations on the trial data, our basic system relied on WordNet relatives (Fellbaum, 1998) and Google queries in order to identify the most plausible substitutes in the context.",
        "The main goal when building our system was to study the following factors: (i) substitution candidate set, (ii) settings of the relative-based algorithm, and (iii) syntactic filtering.",
        "We analysed these factors over the trial data provided by the organisation, and used the BEST metric to tune our system.",
        "This metric accepts multiple answers, and averages the score across the answers.",
        "We did not experiment with the OOT (top 10 answers) and MULTIWORD metrics.",
        "In the remainder of this paper we briefly introduce the basic Relatives in Context algorithm in Section 2.",
        "Next we describe our experiments on the trial data in Section 3.",
        "Our final system and its results are described in Section 4.",
        "Finally, our conclusions are outlined in Section 5."

        "Our basic algorithm is an unsupervised method presented in Martinez et al. (2006).",
        "This technique makes use of the WordNet relatives of the target word for disambiguation, by way of the following steps: (i) obtain a set of close relatives from WordNet for each sense of the target word; (ii) for each test instance define all possible word sequences that include the target word; (iii) for each word sequence, substitute the target word with each relative, and then query Google; (iv) rank queries according to the following factors: length of the query, distance of the relative to the target word, and number of hits; and (v) select the relative from the highest ranked query.1 For the querying step, first we tokenise each target sentence, and then we apply sliding windows of different sizes (up to 6 tokens) that include the target word.",
        "For each window and each relative in the pool, we substitute the target word for the relative, and query Google.",
        "The algorithm stops augmenting the window for the relative when one of its sub-strings returns zero hits.",
        "The length of the query is measured as the number of words, and the distance of the relative to the target words gives preference to synonyms over hypernyms, and immediate hypernyms over further ones.",
        "One important parameter in this method is the candidate set.",
        "We performed different experiments to measure the expected score we could achieve",
        "from WordNet relatives, and the contribution of different types of filters (syntactic, frequency-based, etc.)",
        "to the overall result.",
        "We also explored other settings of the algorithm, such as the ranking criteria, and the number of answers to return.",
        "These experiments and some other modifications of the basic algorithm are covered in Section 3."

      "text": [
        "The most obvious resource for selecting substitution candidates was WordNet, due to its size and availability.",
        "We used version 2.0 throughout this work.",
        "In our first experiment, we tried to determine which kind of relationships to use, and the coverage of the gold-standard annotations that we could expect from WordNet relations only.",
        "As a basic set of relations, we used the following: SYNONYMY, SIMILAR-TO, ENTAILMENT, CAUSE, ALSO-SEE, and INSTANCE.",
        "We created two extended candidate sets using immediate and 2-step hypernyms (hype and hype2, respectively, in Table 1).",
        "Given that we are committed to using WordNet, we set out to measure the percentage of gold-standard substitutes that were ?reachable?",
        "using different WordNet relations.",
        "Table 1 shows the coverage for the three sets of candidates.",
        "Instance-coverage indicates the percentage of instances that have at least one of the gold-standard instances covered from the candidate set.",
        "We can see that the percentage is surprisingly low.",
        "Any shortcoming in coverage will have a direct impact on performance, suggesting the need for alternate means to obtain substitution candidates.",
        "One possibility is to extend the candidates from WordNet by following links from the relatives (e.g. collect all synonyms of the synonymous words), but this could add many noisy candidates.",
        "We can also use other lexical repositories built by hand or automatically, such as the distributional theusauri built",

        "At this point, we separated the instances by PoS, and studied the following parameters: Candidate set: From WordNet, we tested four possible datasets for each target word: basic-set, 1stsense (basic relations from the first sense only), hype (basic set and immediate hypernyms), and hype2 (basic set and up to two-step hypernyms).",
        "Semcor-based filters: Semcor provides frequency information for WordNet senses, and can be used to identify rare senses.",
        "As each candidate is obtained via WordNet semantic relations with the target word, we can filter out those candidates that are related with unfrequent senses in Semcor.",
        "We tested three configurations: (1) no filter, (2) filter out candidates when the candidate-sense in the relation does not occur in Semcor, (3) and filter out candidates when the target-sense in the relation does not occur in Semcor.",
        "The filters can potentially lead to the removal of all candidates, in which case a back-off is applied (see below).",
        "Relative-ranking criteria: Our algorithm ranks relatives according to the length in words of their context-match.",
        "In the case of ties, the number of returned hits from Google is applied.",
        "The length can be different depending on whether we count punctuation marks as separate tokens, and whether the word-length of substitute multiwords is included.",
        "We tested three options: including the target word, not including the target word (multiwords count as a single word), and not counting punctuation marks.",
        "Back-off: We need a back-off method in case the basic algorithm does not find any matches.",
        "We tested the following: sense-ordered synonyms from WordNet (highest sense first, randomly breaking ties), and most frequent synonyms from the first system (using two corpora: Semcor and BNC).",
        "Number of answers: We also measured the performance for different numbers of system outputs (1, 2, or 3).",
        "All in all, we performed 324 (4x3x3x3x3) runs for each PoS, based on the different combinations.",
        "The best scores for each PoS are shown in Table 2, together with the baselines.",
        "We can see that the precision is above the official WordNet baseline, but is still very low.",

        "In error analysis, we observed that the performance and settings varied greatly depending on the PoS of the target word.",
        "Adverbs produced the best performance, followed by nouns.",
        "The scores were very low for adjectives and verbs (the baseline score for verbs was only 2%).",
        "We will now explain the main conclusions extracted from the parameter analysis.",
        "Regarding the candidate set, we observed that using synonyms only was the best approach for all PoS, except for verbs, where hypernyms helped.",
        "The option of limiting the candidates to the first sense only helped for adjectives, but not for other PoS.",
        "For the Semcor-based filter, our results showed that the target-sense filter improved the performance for verbs and adverbs.",
        "For nouns and adjectives, the candidate-sense filter worked best.",

        "Not counting the length of the target word helped slightly for nouns and adverbs, and removing punctuation improved results for adjectives.",

        "Scores correspond to precision (which is the same as recall).",
