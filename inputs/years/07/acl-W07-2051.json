        "The SemEval 2007 preposition sense disambiguation task provides a common test bed for the evaluation of preposition sense disambiguation systems.",

        "We first discuss the preprocessing steps used in our system (Section 2), and outline the features our preposition disambiguation method uses (Section 3) and our parameter tuning method (Section 4).",
        "We then discuss and analyse the results of our method (Section 5) and conclude the paper (Section 6)."

        "We then summed up the individual ranks, and used the sums to create a set of final rankings for the features.",
        "The feature selection process is based on 10-fold cross validation: we divided our training data into 10 pairs of training-test datasets; then for each fold, we extracted the top N% ranked features using our feature selection heuristic from the cv-training set (where N was set to values 5, 10, .., 100), and used these features to test the held-out test set.",
        "The best N as determined by the cross validation was then applied to the entire training data set.",

        "The overall precision (%) obtained by the three classifiers for the fine-grained senses are as follows:",
        "The best overall results were achieved when both the features and the Gaussian smoothing parameters were automatically tuned, achieving a 1.4% absolute precision gain over the non-tuned system.",
        "However, such parameter tuning may not always be useful: the same tuning process was found to be detrimental in a Senseval-2 verb sense disambiguation task (Ye and Baldwin, 2006b).",
        "Consistent with the findings of Ye and Baldwin (2006b), the improvement caused by the tuning of the Gaussian smoothing parameter is only marginal compared with the improvement caused by the tuning of the features.",
        "We also evaluated our features based on their categories and types.",
        "Collocation features performed the best among the three feature categories.",
        "Without any parameter tuning, the collocation-feature-only classifier achieved an overall precision of 67.4% on the test set; the semantic-role-feature-only classifier and the syntactic-feature-only classifier achieved precision of 46.9% and 50.5% respectively.",
        "The best-performing individual features are the bag-of-words features and bag-of-synsets features.",
        "types in the top N% ranked features On the test set, the bag-of-words-only classifier and the bag-of-synsets-only classifier achieved overall precision of 63.2% and 61.9% respectively.",
        "We also analysed the top ranking features as calculated by our feature selection algorithm, as presented in Table 2.",
        "The results show the percentages of the top-performing feature types of each feature category in the top N% ranked features.",
        "It can be observed that none of the top-performing features seem to have a significantly disproportional representation in the top-ranked features.",
        "This indicates that the disambiguation power of a particular type of features is determined mostly by the number of features of that type.",
        "On the other hand, the bag-of-words features appear to be the most effective, considering that they account for only 13.4% of the total features, but outperformed the bag-of-synsets features which account for nearly 60% of the total features.",
        "It is also disappointing to see that the syntactic and semantic-role based features had little positive influence in the disambiguation process.",
        "However, this is perhaps caused by the sparseness of these features since they together only account for less than 10% of all the extracted features.",
        "The overall finding from all this is that, similar to nouns and verbs, preposition sense is determined primarily by word context, and that syntactic and semantic role-based features play only a minor role."
