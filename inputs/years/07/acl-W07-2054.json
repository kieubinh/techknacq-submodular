        "In the coarse-grained English all-words task, systems have to perform word sense disambiguation (WSD) of all content words (noun, adjective, verb, and adverb) occurring in five documents, using a coarse-grained version of the WordNet sense inventory.",
        "In the fine-grained English all-words task, systems have to predict the correct sense of verbs and head nouns of the verb arguments occurring in three documents, according to the fine-grained sense inventory of WordNet.",
        "Results from previous SENSEVAL English all-words task have shown that supervised learning gives the best performance.",
        "Further, the best performing system in SENSEVAL-3 English all-words task (Decadt et al., 2004) used training data gathered from multiple sources, highlighting the importance of having a large amount of training data.",
        "Hence, besides gathering examples from the widely used SEMCOR corpus, we also gathered training examples from 6 English-Chinese parallel corpora and the DSO corpus (Ng and Lee, 1996).",
        "We developed 2 separate systems; one for each task.",
        "For both systems, we performed supervised word sense disambiguation based on the approach of (Lee and Ng, 2002) and using Support Vector Machines (SVM) as our learning algorithm.",

        "To gather examples from these parallel corpora, we followed the approach in (Ng et al., 2003).",
        "Briefly, after ensuring the corpora were sentence-aligned, we tokenized the English texts and performed word segmentation on the Chinese texts (Low et al., 2005).",
        "We then made use of the GIZA++ software (Och and Ney, 2000) to perform word alignment on the parallel corpora.",
        "Then, we assigned some possible Chinese translations to each sense of an English word w. From the word alignment output of GIZA++, we selected those occurrences of w which were aligned to one of the Chinese translations chosen.",
        "The English side of these occurrences served as training data for w, as they were considered to have been disambiguated and ?sense-tagged?",
        "by the appropriate Chinese translations.",
        "We note that frequently occurring words are usually highly polysemous and hard to disambiguate.",
        "To maximize the benefits of using parallel texts, we gathered training data from parallel texts for the set of most frequently occurring noun, adjective, and verb types in the Brown Corpus (BC).",

Offsets i and j denote the starting and ending position (relative to w) of the sequence, where a negative (positive) offset refers to a token to its left (right).",
