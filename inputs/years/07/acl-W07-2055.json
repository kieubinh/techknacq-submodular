        "Our official entry (OE1) in Senseval-4 Task 17 (coarse-grained English lexical sample task) contained many design flaws and thus failed to show the whole potential of the method, finishing -4.9% behind top system (+0.5 gain over best base system).",
        "A fixed system (OE2) finished only -3.4% behind (+2.0% net gain).",
        "All our systems were 'closed', i.e. used the official training data only (average 56 training examples per each sense).",

        "The essential difference from other ensembling methods (such as various types of voting ensembles and cross-validation based best machine selection) is that best machine is predicted using factors calculated from words (e.g. number of senses) and their training data (e.g. number of training examples per sense).",
        "The method is loosely based on findings of system performance differences in both WSD (different machines by Yarowsky et al., 2002 and different feature sets by Mihalcea, 2002) and other classification tasks such as text categorization (Forman et al., 2004, Bay et al., 2002)."

        "Original batch of candidate machines that we tested for OE using Senseval-2 dataset included the following classifiers: Decision Stump, Decision Tree with various values of confidence (c) parameter 0.05, 0.15, 0.25 and instance-based classifier with k values ranging from 1..15 at intervals of two 1.",

        "(2007).",
        "This is based on accounts by e.g. Vapnik (1995) that lower c value makes the classifier generate a more complex training model which is more suitable for tougher words (lower posex, higher negex).",

        "OE2 (unofficial): This system incorporated the following fixes to OE1 (see Discussion below for motivations for these fixes): First, we significantly reduced the base system grain.",
        "We only used two machines strongest in 10CV runs (SVMc=0.1 and NB) and these machines were trained with fsets found best for those machines in 10CV runs: pos3 for both machines, SVMc=0.1 was additionally trained with 1g and NB with 2g respectively.",
        "This resulted in a 2 * 2 = 4-system ensemble.",
        "Best fset was still selected on the basis of 10CV runs.",
        "As training data for the best-machine predictor, we used the performance profiles of about 50 systems (both our own and Senseval systems) run mainly against Senseval-2 English lexical sample dataset.",
        "We decided to use only two prediction factors (posex and negex, see Figure 1) to predict best machine for each word.",
        "This was because previously we had found these two machines (SVM and NB) particularly differing with regard to the combination or cross-section of these two factors.",

        "Only 27 words kept the same machine in same configuration and fset.",

        "We can first note that results are largely in line with our previous findings with OEs and other types of ensembles (see Saarikoski et al., 2007).",
        "In what follows we attempt to account for the results: why OE1 finished as much behind top system and also why OE2 performed that much better than OE1.",
        "This first 'known issue' concerns both OEs: (1) Base system accuracy was low because we did not use strong fsets: Our official entry finished at 7th place in the evaluation, -4.9% behind top system while the inofficial entry would have finished in 5th place (-3.4% behind).",
        "We attribute this mainly to the absence of more advanced feature sets.",
        "For example, we did not employ syntactic parse features (such as predicate-object pairs) from which Yarowsky et al. (2002) showed +2% gain.",
        "We would also naturally lose to any systems using extra training or lexical knowledge (e.g. 2nd place finisher UBC-ALM, at 86.9 accuracy, used both semantic domains and SemCor corpus).",
        "But without knowing how much extra knowledge such 'open' systems used, we cannot say by how much.",
        "3 Best base system in both OEs was NB-pos3 (83.3).",
        "Specifically in OE1 entry, there were two basic design flaws which we address next.",
        "(2) Base system grain was too high to produce enough net gain: The base system grain (18 base systems) we attempted to predict in OE1 was far too great since prediction accuracy rapidly decreases when adding new systems.",
        "The grain was also unnecessarily great, since the 4-grain we used for OE2 could harvest most of the gross gain (cf. gross gains of the two systems in Table 1).",
        "(3) Using 10CV runs uncritically for best fset selection: This was ill-advised because of many reasons.",
        "First, selecting best fset for WSD based on CV runs is known to be a difficult task (Mihalcea, 2002).",
        "Prediction accuracy for the three fsets we used for OE1 was 0.74, i.e. for 26 words out of 100 best fset was mispredicted.",
        "About half of these were cases where machine was mispredicted as well and average loss tended to be even greater.",
        "Second, multifsets could not be 10CV-tested with the Weka machine-learning toolkit we used (Witten, 2005).",
        "Our custom resolution to this multifset selection task was to select best and next best fset.",
        "This turned out to produce many false predictions, some of which were quite substantial (> 10% loss to best fset).",
        "For instance, at system.n we lost > 30% from selecting NB-2g instead of actual best system (NB-pos3).",
        "Third, only after submitting the entry, we also realized two strongest fsets are not necessarily complementary (i.e. that each would contain relevant clues for different test instances) and that learning machines might be confused (i.e. could not effectively carry out feature selection and weighting) by the profusion and heterogeneity of features in multifsets.",
        "In fact, we found that omitting multifsets from OE1 (i.e. having 3 single fsets with the same 3 machines = 6-system OE) would have worked slightly better than OE1 (3*3=9): the accuracy rose from 83.8 to 84.1.",
        "Fourth, it was found previously (Saarikoski et al., 2007) that CV-based best system prediction scheme tends to produce less gain than OE (cf. accuracy of OE1 < OE2 in Table 1).",
        "The remaining argument discusses Senseval evaluation measure (applies to all OE systems):",
        "instances in test dataset.",
        "This measure (termed 'macro-averaged accuracy' in Sebastiani, 2002) is known to upweigh classification cases (words) that have more test instances.",
        "While we recognize the usefulness of this measure, we calculated in Table 1 the alternative measure (termed 'micro-averaged accuracy' in Sebastiani, 2002).",
        "It differs from the former (defined by e.g. Sebastiani, 2002) in that all words are treated equally (i.e. 'normalized') regardless of number of test instances.",
        "In addition, it has been Senseval practice (Edmonds et al. 2002, Mihalcea et al. 2004) that words with great number of test instances tend to have an equally great number of training instances.",
        "At such 'easier' words, system performance differences (sysdiff) occur much less and since OE is based on locating and making use of sysdiff, it cannot perform well.",
        "Therefore, it is liable to lose to single-machine systems with inherently stronger fsets (see point 1 above).",
        "For these reasons, the measures are very different with the latter revealing the OE potential more appropriately.",
        "In fact, we estimate that only 40 out of the 100 test words in this dataset show any kind of sysdiff between most participating systems (> 5% macro-averaged sysdiff per word).",
        "Furthermore, only 20 of them only are likely to produce substantial sysdiff (> 10%).",
        "For example, in our 10CV runs, we got 0.99 accuracies by all base systems for the very highly trained word say.v with posex > 500.",
        "If there was a participating system that achieved 1.00 in such a single high-train word (say.v), the huge number of test instances of that word raised its macro-averaged accuracy, winning considerably over systems performing well with low-train words (e.g. propose.v with posex=11 and negex=24 and grain=3 where both OE1 and OE2 performed at 0.93 accuracy owing to correct best system choice).",
        "In other words, the official measure does not account for the finding (Yarowsky et al., 2002 and Saarikoski et al., 2007) that systems considerably differ precisely in terms of their ability to disambiguate high/low-train words (measured by posex/negex factors).",
        "Therefore, it can be said that the official measure fails to treat all systems equally."

        "Though OE systems run the risk that OE may in fact be inferior to its best base system, we would like to note that thus far no OE of ours (around 10-15 different tests) has failed to produce net gain."
