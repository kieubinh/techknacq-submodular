        "Exponential family models are a mainstay of modern statistical modeling (Brown, 1986) and they are widely and successfully used for example in text classification (Berger et al., 1996).",
        "In statistical machine learning research, a general methodology and many algorithms were developed for undirected graphical model representation of exponential families (Jordan, 2004), providing a solid basis for efficient inference.",
        "Our model differs from other probabilistic models used for word sense disambiguation in that it captures not only word-sense co-occurrences but also contextual sense-sense co-occurrences, thereby breaking the naive Bayes assumption.",
        "Although spare in the types of features, the model is extremely expressive.",
        "Our model has parameters that control for word-sense interaction and sense-sense similarity, allowing us to capture many of the salient features of word and sense use.",
        "After fitting the parameters of our model from a labeled corpus, the task of word sense disambiguation immediately follows by considering the posterior distribution of senses given words.",
        "We used this model to participate in SemEval2007 on the coarse-and fine-grained all-words tasks.",
        "In both of these tasks, a series of sentences are given with certain words tagged.",
        "Each competing system must assign a sense from a sense inventory to the tagged words.",
        "In both tasks, performance was gauged by comparing the output of each system to human-tagged senses.",
        "In the fine-grained task, precision and recall were simply and directly computed against the golden annotations.",
        "However, in the coarse-grained task, the sense inventory was first clustered semi-automatically with each cluster representing an equivalence class over senses (Navigli, 2006).",
        "Precision and recall were computed against equivalence classes.",
        "This paper briefly derives the model and then explores its properties for WSD.",
        "We show how common algorithms, such as 'dominant sense'",
        "and 'most frequent sense,'",
        "can be expressed in the exponential family framework.",
