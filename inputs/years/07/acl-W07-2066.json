        "An obvious way to view the problem of lexical substitution is as a sense disambiguation task.",
        "For example, one possible approach is to identify the sense of the target word and then to pick a synonym based on the identified sense.",
        "Following Dagan et al.",
        "(2006), we refer to this as an indirect approach.",
        "A system using an indirect approach must have access to a list of senses for each target word, and each sense must have a corresponding list of synonyms.",
        "Though one can use a predefined sense inventory, such as WordNet, the granularity of the sense inventory may not be appropriate for the task.",
        "If the sense inventory is too fine-grained, then picking the correct sense may be needlessly difficult.",
        "Conversely, if it is too coarse, picking the correct sense may not narrow down the list of potential substitutions sufficiently.",
        "To avoid these problems, we propose a direct approach, which will break the problem into two steps: for each target word, generate a list of candidate synonyms; then rank each synonym for its quality as a replacement.",
        "Although our second system makes use of some sense information, it is used only to re-rank candidates generated using a direct approach.",
        "We describe two systems: the first is a purely direct method based on local context matching, and the second is a hybrid of local context matching and wider context bag-of-words matching.",
        "Both are knowledge-light and unsupervised."

        "We begin by compiling a list of candidate synonyms for each target word.",
        "Following Dagan et al. (2006), we will refer to this list of synonyms as our substitution lexicon.",
        "The performance of our system is limited by the substitution lexicon because it can only pick the correct replacements if they are in the lexicon.",
        "The substitution lexicon available to our scoring system therefore determines both the maximum attainable recall and the baseline probability of randomly guessing a correct replacement.",
        "One approach to generating a substitution lexicon is to query WordNet for lists of synonyms grouped by the senses of each word.",
        "While WordNet has its advantages, we aimed to create a knowledge-light",
        "system.",
        "A more knowledge-free system would have used a machine readable dictionary or a large natural language sample to retrieve its synonyms (see, for example, Lin (1998)), but our system falls short of this, relying on Roget's New Millennium Thesaurus1 (henceforth RT) as a source of synonyms.",
        "Though this thesaurus is similar to WordNet in some ways, it does not contain semantic relationships beyond synonyms and antonyms.",
        "One important advantage of a thesaurus over WordNet is that it is easier to obtain for languages other than English.",
        "We used the trial data to ensure that the quality of the list compiled from RT would be satisfactory for this task.",
        "We found that by using the synonyms in WordNet synsets2 as our substitution lexicon, we could achieve a maximum recall of 53% when using an oracle to select the correct synonyms.",
        "However, using the synonyms from RT as the substitution lexicon led to a maximum recall of 85%.",
        "Querying RT for the synonyms of a word returns multiple entries.",
        "For our purposes, each entry consists of a Main Entry, a part of speech, a definition, and a list of synonyms.",
        "Many of the returned entries do not list the query word as the Main Entry.",
        "For instance, given the query ?tell?, RT returns 115 entries: 7 whose Main Entry is ?tell?, an additional 3 that contain ?tell?",
        "(e.g. ?show and tell?",
        "), and the remaining 105 entries are other words (e.g.",
        "?gossip?)",

        "as a synonym.",
        "Where the Main Entry matches the query, RT entries roughly correspond to the traditional notion of ?sense?.",
        "In order to reduce the number of potentially spurious synonyms that could be picked, we created a simple automatic filtering system.",
        "For each RT query, we kept only those entries whose Main Entry and part of speech matched the target word exactly3.",
        "In addition, we removed obscure words which we believed human annotators would be unlikely to pick.",
        "We used the unigram counts from the Web 1T 5-gram corpus (Brants and Franz, 2006) to determine the frequency of use of each candidate synonym.",

        "Though this corpus provides us with a very large amount of data4, to increase the likelihood of finding an appropriate match, we mapped inflected words to their roots in both the corpus and the test data (Baayen et al., 1996).",
        "The context of a target word consists of a set of up to 3 trigrams, specifically those trigrams in the test sentence that contain the target word.",

        "To identify content words, we used the NLTK-Lite tagger to assign a part of speech to each word (Loper and Bird, 2002).",
        "We considered open class words (with the exception of the verb to be) and pronouns to be content words.",
        "We call the filtered set of trigrams the test trigrams.",
        "From the above example, we would remove the tri-gram ?was a bright?",
        "since it does not contain a content word other than the target word.",
        "We match the test trigrams against trigrams in the Web 1T corpus.",
        "A corpus trigram is said to match one of the test trigrams if the only difference between them is that the target word is replaced with a candidate synonym.",
        "A scoring algorithm is then applied to each candidate.",

        "grams, denoted by T , the set of candidate synonyms, C, and the frequencies of the trigrams in the corpus.",

        "The normalization factor prevents high frequency test trigrams from dominating the score of candidates.",
        "The candidates are ranked by score, and the top ten candidates are returned as substitutions.",
        "In some cases, the words in the local context did not help identify a replacement synonym.",
        "For example, in test instance 391 the trigrams used in the local context model were: ?by a coach?, ?a coach and?, and ?coach and five?.",
        "The first two trigrams were removed because they did not contain content words.",
        "The final trigram does not provide conclusive evidence: the correct synonym in this case can be determined by knowing whether the next word is ?players?",
        "(coach = instructor) or ?horses?",

        "Without backoff, extending the local context model to 5-grams led to sparse data problems.",

        "For each instance, an ?instance vector?",
        "was created by counting the unigrams in the target sentence.",
        "Since the Web 1T corpus does not contain full sentences, we matched each of the instance vectors against vectors derived from the British National Corpus6.",
        "For each candidate synonym, we created a single vector by summing the unigram counts in all sentences containing the candidate synonym (or one of its morphological variants).",
        "We ranked each candidate by the cosine similarity between the candidate vector and the instance vector.",
        "Manual inspection of the trial data key revealed that, for many instances, a large majority (if not all) of the human-selected synonyms in that instance",
        "altogether unexpected insight led to the creation of a second nearest neighbor cosine model.",
        "We first created instance vectors, following the method described above.",
        "However, instead of creating a single vector for each candidate synonym, we created a single vector for each ?sense?",
        "(RT entry): for each RT entry, we created a single vector by summing the unigram counts in all BNC sentences containing any of that entry's candidate synonyms (or morphological variants).",
        "We ranked each candidate sense by the cosine similarity between the sense vector and the instance vector.",

        "This result led us to filter the nearest neighbor results by keeping only those words listed as synonyms of the highest ranked senses, as determined by the nearest sense neighbor model.",
        "This proved successful, increasing accuracy from .41 to .44 (for instances which had a mode) when we kept only those synonyms found in the top half of the senses returned by the nearest sense model.7 We attempted the sense filtering method on the local context model but found that it was less successful.",
        "No matter what threshold we set for filtering, we always did best by not doing the filtering at all.",
