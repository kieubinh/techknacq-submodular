        "Personal names are often submitted to search engines as query keywords, as described in a report1 indicating that about 10% of the English queries from the search engine ALLTheWeb2 contain personal names.",
        "However, in response to a personal name query, search engines return a long list of search results containing that contains Web pages about several namesakes.",
        "For example, when a user submits a personal name like 'William Cohen' as a query to the search engine Google3, the returned results represent more than one person named ?William Cohen.?",
        "In the results, a computer science professor, an American politician, a surgeon, 1http://tap.stanford.edu/PeopleSearch.pdf 2http://www.alltheweb.com/ 3http://www.google.com/ and others are not classified into separate clusters but mixed together.",
        "Most of the previous works on disambiguating personal names in Web search results employ several kinds of agglomerative clustering approach as described in Section 2.",
        "However, in these approaches, a lot of clusters that contain only one element tend to be generated, depending on a certain criterion for merging similar clusters.",
        "In addition, in person search results from the World Wide Web (WWW), we can often observe that a small number of entities have a lot of search-result Web pages, while others have only one or two.",
        "In light of these facts, if a labeled Web page that describes a person is introduced, clustering for personal name disambiguation would be much more accurate.",
        "In the following, we refer to such a labeled Web page as the ?seed page.?",
        "Then, in order to disambiguate personal names in Web search results, we introduce semi-supervised clustering that uses the seed page to aid the clustering of unlabeled search-result Web pages.",
        "Our semi-supervised clustering approach is characterized by controlling the fluctuation of the centroid of a cluster.",
        "2 Related Work (Mann and Yarowsky, 2003) first extract biographical information, such as birthdates, birthplaces, occupations, and so on.",
        "Then, for each document, they generate a feature vector composed of the extracted biographical information, proper nouns, and the TF-IDF score computed from the documents in the search results.",
        "Finally, using this feature vector, they disambiguate personal names by generating clusters based on a bottom-up centroid agglomerative clustering algorithm.",
        "(Wan et al., 2005) employ an approach similar to that of (Mann and Yarowsky, 2003), and have developed a system called Web-Hawk.",
        "(Pedersen et al., 2005) recently proposed a method for discriminating names by clustering the instances of a given name into groups.",
        "They extract the context of each instance of an ambiguous name and generate second-order context vectors using significant bigrams.",
        "The vectors are then clustered such that instances that are similar to each other are grouped into the same cluster.",
        "(Bekkerman and McCallum, 2005) propose the following three unsupervised approaches: (1) an approach based on the hyperlink structures of Web pages; (2) an approach based on agglomerative/conglomerative double clustering (Bekkerman et al., 2005); and (3) a hybrid approach combining the first two.",
