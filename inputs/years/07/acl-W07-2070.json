        "Regarding that meaningful senses of words in a textual unit must be coherently related, our proposal uses sense clustering with the aim of determining cohesive groups of senses that reflect the connectivity of the disambiguating words.",
        "The way this proposal uses clustering for disambiguation purposes is different from those usages reported in other works of the WSD area.",
        "For example, in (Pedersen et al., 2005) textual contexts are clustered in order to represent senses for Word Sense Discrimination.",
        "Other works like (Agirre and Lo?pez, 2003), cluster fine-grained word senses into coarse-grained ones for polysemy reduction.",
        "Instead, our method clusters all possible senses corresponding to all words in a disambiguating textual unit.",
        "Thus, our system implements a novel clustering approach for the contextual disambiguation of words.",
        "We use the lexical resource WordNet (version 2.1) as the repository of word senses, and also as the provider of sense representations.",

        "Such a clustering tries to identify cohesive groups of word senses, which are assumed to represent the different meanings for the set of disambiguating words.",
        "Then, clusters that match the best with the context are selected via a filtering process.",
        "If the selected clusters disambiguate all words, the process is stopped and the senses belonging to the selected clusters are interpreted as the disambiguating ones.",
        "Otherwise, the clustering and filtering steps are performed again (regarding the remaining senses) until the disambiguation is achieved.",
        "Algorithm 1 shows the general steps of our proposal for the disambiguation of a set of words W .",
        "In the algorithm, clustering represents the basic clustering method, filter is the function that selects the clusters, and T denotes the intended textual context from which words in W are disambiguated (typically, a broader bag of words than W ).",
