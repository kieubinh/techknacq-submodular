        "For each pair, we compute the Mutual Information Score which is obtained from the web occurrences of an emotion and the content words.",
        "Our approach is based on the hypothesis that group of words which co-occur together across many documents with a given emotion are highly probable to express the same emotion."

        "The subjective analysis of a text is becoming important for many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications such as Question Answering, Information Extraction, Text Categorization among others (Shanahan et al., 2006).",
        "The resolution of this problem can lead to a complete, realistic and coherent analysis of the natural language, therefore major attention is drawn to the opinion, sentiment and emotion analysis, and to the identification of beliefs, thoughts, feelings and judgments (Quirk et al., 1985), (Wilson and Wiebe, 2005).",
        "The aim of the Affective Text task is to classify a set of news headlines into six types of emotions: ?anger?, ?disgust?, ?fear?, ?joy?, ?sadness?",
        "and ?surprise?.",
        "In order to be able to conduct such multi-category analysis, we believe that first we need a comprehensive theory of what a human emotion is, and then we need to understand how the emotion is expressed and transmitted within the natural language.",
        "These aspects rise the need of syntactic, semantic, textual and pragmatic analysis of a text (Polanyi and Zaenen, 2006).",
        "However, some of the major drawbacks in this field are related to the manual or automatic acquisition of subjective expressions, as well as to the lack of resources in terms of coverage.",
        "For this reason, our current emotion classification approach is based on frequency and co-occurrence bag of word counts collected from the World Wide Web.",
        "Our hypothesis is that words which tend to co-occur across many documents with a given emotion are highly probable to express this emotion.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we review some of the related work, in Section 3 we describe our web-based emotion classification approach for which we show a walk-through example in Section 4.",
        "A discussion of the obtained results can be found in Section 5 and finally we conclude in Section 6."

        "Our approach for emotion classification is based on the idea of (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997) and is similar to those of (Turney, 2002) and (Turney and Littman, 2003).",
        "According to Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997), adjectives with the same polarity tended to appear together.",
        "For example the negative adjectives ?corrupt and brutal? co-occur very often.",
        "The idea of tracing polarity through adjective co-occurrence is adopted by Turney (2002) for the binary (positive and negative) classification of text reviews.",
        "They take two adjectives, for instance ?excellent? and ?poor? in a way that the first adjective expresses positive meaning, meanwhile the second one expresses negative.",
        "Then, they extract all adjectives from the review text and combine them with ?excellent? and ?poor?.",
        "The co-occurrences of these words are searched on the web, and then the Mutual Information score for the two groups of adjectives is measured.",
        "When the adjective of the review appear more often with ?excellent?, then the review is classified as positive, and when the adjectives appear more often with ?poor?, then the review is classified as negative.",
        "Following Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) and Turney (2002), we decided to observe how often the words from the headline co-occur with each one of the six emotions.",
        "This study helped us deduce information according to which ?birthday?",
        "appears more often with ?joy?, while ?war?",
        "appears more often with ?fear?.",
        "Some of the differences between our approach and those of Turney (2002) are mentioned below: ?",
        "objectives: Turney (2002) aims at binary text classification, while our objective is six class classification of one-liner headlines.",
        "Moreover, we have to provide a score between 0 and 100 indicating the presence of an emotion, and not simply to identify what the emotion in the text is.",
        "Apart from the difficulty introduced by the multi-category classification, we have to deal with a small number of content words while Turney works with large list of adjectives.",
        "?",
        "word class: Turney (2002) measures polarity using only adjectives, however in our approach we consider the noun, the verb, the adverb and the adjective content words.",
        "The motivation of our study comes from (Polanyi and Zaenen, 2006), according to which each content word can express sentiment and emotion.",
        "In addition to this issue we saw that most of the headlines contain only nouns and verbs, because they express objectivity.",
        "?",
        "search engines: Turney (2002) uses the Al-tavista web browser, while we consider and combine the frequency information acquired from three web search engines.",
        "?",
        "word proximity: For the web searches, Turney (2002) uses the NEAR operator and considers only those documents that contain the adjectives within a specific proximity.",
        "In our approach, as far as the majority of the query words appear in the documents, the frequency count is considered.",
        "?",
        "queries: The queries of Turney (2002) are made up of a pair of adjectives, and in our approach the query contains the content words of the headline and an emotion.",
        "There are other emotion classification approaches that use the web as a source of information.",
        "For instance, (Taboada et al., 2006) extracted from the web co-occurrences of adverbs, adjectives, nouns and verbs.",
        "Gamon and Aue (2005) were looking for adjectives that did not co-occur at sentence level.",
        "(Baroni and Vegnaduzzo, 2004) and (Grefenstette et al., 2004) gathered subjective adjectives from the web calculating the Mutual Information score.",
        "Other important works on sentiment analysis are those of (Wilson et al., 2005) and (Wiebe et al., 2005; Wilson and Wiebe, 2005), who used linguistic information such as syntax and negations to determine polarity.",
        "Kim and Hovy (2006) integrated verb information from FrameNet and incorporated it into semantic role labeling."
