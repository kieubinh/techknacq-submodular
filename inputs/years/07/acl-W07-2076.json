        "Our motivation in building unsupervised systems comes from the difficulty of creating hand-tagged data for all words and all languages, which is colloquially known as the knowledge acquisition bottleneck.",
        "There have also been promising results in recent work on the combination of unsupervised approaches that suggest the gap with respect to supervised systems is narrowing (Brody et al., 2006).",
