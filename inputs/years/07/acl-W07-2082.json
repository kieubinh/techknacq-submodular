        "This paper describes a system for participating in SemEval 2007 task 4; ?Classification of Semantic Relations Between Nominals?.",
        "This SemEval task required systems to establish whether or not a particular semantic relation held between two nominals in a sentence.",
        "There were 7 semantic relations, with approximately 70 positive and 70 negative example sentences for each relation.",
        "There were approximately 70 examples in the test sets for each relation.",
        "This task is similar to the problem of determining what semantic relation holds between the constituents of a noun-noun compound.",
        "Work in this area has used both statistical information about the frequencies of lexical patterns and hand-built knowledge databases such as WordNet and the-saura.",
        "In our system we combine these two knowledge sources and build a set of features to use as input to a Support Vector Machine learning algorithm.",
        "The use of hit counts from web search engines to obtain lexical information was introduced by Turney (2001).",
        "The idea of searching a large corpus for specific lexico-syntactic phrases to indicate a semantic relation of interest was first described by Hearst (1992).",
        "A lexical pattern specific enough to indicate a particular semantic relation is usually not very frequent, and using the web as a corpus alleviates the data sparseness problem.",
        "However, it also introduces some problems.",
        "The number of results returned is unstable as pages are created and deleted all the time, and the major search engines return only rounded frequency estimates and do not allow a very sophisticated query interface.",
        "Na-kov and Hearst (2005) examined the use of web-based n-gram frequencies for an NLP task and concluded that these issues do not greatly impact the interpretation of the results.",
        "Turney and Littman (2005) use web queries to the AltaVista search engine as the basis for their system to assign semantic relations to modifier-noun phrases.",
        "They use a set of 64 short prepositional and conjunctive phrases (joining terms) to generate exact queries of the form ?noun joining term modifier?, and ?modifier joining term noun?.",
        "Using 64 joining terms and trying the noun and modifier in either order resulted in a vector of 128",
        "hit counts for each noun-modifier pair.",
        "These hit counts were used with a supervised (nearest neighbor) algorithm to label the modifier-noun phrases.",
        "Nakov and Hearst (2006) use queries of the form ?noun that * modifier?",
        "where '*' is a wildcard operator.",
        "By retrieving the words that most commonly occurred in the place of the wildcard they were able to identify very specific predicates that are likely to represent the relation between noun and modifier.",
        "There have also been several approaches which used hand built knowledge sources.",
        "Rosario and Hearst (2001) used MeSH, a lexical hierarchy of medical terms.",
        "They use this hierarchy to assign semantic properties to head and modifier words in the medical domain.",
        "They use a neural network trained on these attributes to assign the noun phrases a semantic relation.",
        "Nastase and Szpakowicz (2003) use the position of the noun and modifier words within general semantic hierarchies (Roget's Thesaurus and WordNet) as attributes for their learning algorithms.",
        "They experiment with decision trees, a rule induction system, a relational learner and memory based learning.",
        "They conclude that the rule induction system is capable of generalizing to characterize the noun phrases.",
        "Moldovan et al(2004) also use WordNet.",
        "They experiment with a Bayesian algorithm, decision trees, and their own algorithm; semantic scattering.",
        "As far as we are aware ours is the first system to combine features derived from a hand-built lexical database with corpus frequencies of lexical patterns."

        "We did make use of the WordNet sense for the features we obtained from WordNet.",
        "There are 48 features derived from WordNet.",
        "Most of these are boolean values indicating whether or not each of the nominals in the sentence appear below certain other high-level concepts in the hypernym hierarchy.",
        "We chose 22 high level concepts we believed may be good predictors of whether or not a nominal could be an argument of the semantic relations used in this task.",

        "Concepts in the WordNet hierarchy used to generate features.",
        "For each of these WordNet entries we checked whether or not each of the nominals in the example sentence appeared below the entry in the WordNet hypernym tree.",
        "This gave us 44 features.",
        "We also checked whether the first nominal was a hypernym of the second; and vice-versa; and whether the first nominal was a meronym of the second; and vice versa.",

        "The system was held back particularly by two relations, theme-tool and origin-entity.",
        "There are many potential avenues for future work in this area.",
        "We chose 48 features based on WordNet and 28 lexical patterns to search the web for.",
        "These were chosen arbitrarily on the basis that they looked like they would be informative in general, over all seven relations.",
        "A more principled approach would be to begin with a much larger number of features and use information gain to select the most informative features for each relation individually.",
        "This should improve performance by ensuring that only the most relevant features for a specific relation are used to train the classifier for that relation.",
        "Also, there is room for more investigation into how short prepositional joining phrases map onto underlying semantic relations (Girjiu 2006)."
