        "WordNet::SenseRelate::TargetWord1 (Patwardhan et al., 2005; Patwardhan et al., 2003) is an unsupervised Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) system, which is based on the hypothesis that the intended sense of an ambiguous word is related to the words in its context.",
        "For example, if the 'financial institution' sense of bank is intended in a context, then it is highly likely the context would contain related words such as money, transaction, interest rate, etc.",
        "The algorithm, therefore, determines the intended sense of a word (target word) in a given context by measuring the relatedness of each sense of that word with the words in its context.",
        "The sense of the target word that is most related to its context is selected as the intended sense of the target word.",
        "The system uses WordNet-based measures of semantic relatedness [2] (Pedersen et al., 2004) to measure the relatedness between the different senses of the target word and the words in its context.",
        "This system is completely unsupervised and requires no annotated data for training.",
        "The lexical database WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) is the only resource that the system uses to measure the relatedness between words and concepts.",
        "Thus, our system is classified under the closed track of the task."

        "Our WSD system consists of a modular framework, which allows different algorithms for the different subtasks to be plugged into the system.",

        "The context selection module tries to select words from the context that are most likely to be indicative of the sense of the target word.",
        "The sense selection module then uses the set of selected context words to choose one of the senses of the target word as the answer.",
        "Figure 1 shows a block schematic of the system, which takes SemEval-2007 English Lexical Sample instances as input.",
        "Each instance is a made up of a few English sentences, and one word from these sentences is marked as the target word to be disambiguated.",
        "The system processes each instance through multiple modules arranged in a sequential pipeline.",

        "This algorithm algorithm selects 2n + 1 content words surrounding the target word (including the target word) as the context.",
        "A stop list is used to identify closed-class non-content words.",
        "Additionally, any word not found in WordNet is also discarded.",

        "In this work, we use the local algorithm, which is faster and was shown to perform as well as the global algorithm.",
        "The local sense selection algorithm measures the semantic relatedness of each sense of the target word with the senses of the words in the context, and selects that sense of the target word which is most related to the context word-senses.",
        "Given the 2n + 1 context words, the system scores each sense of the target word.",
