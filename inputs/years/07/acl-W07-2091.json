        "Lexical substitution is defined as the task of identifying the most likely alternatives (substitutes) for a target word, given its context (McCarthy, 2002).",
        "Many natural language processing applications can benefit from the availability of such alternative words, including word sense disambiguation, lexical acquisition, machine translation, information retrieval, question answering, text simplification, and others.",
        "The task is closely related to the problem of word sense disambiguation, with the substitutes acting as synonyms for the input word meaning.",
        "Unlike word sense disambiguation however, lexical substitution is not performed with respect to a given sense inventory, but instead candidate synonyms are generated ?on the fly?",
        "for a given word occurrence.",
        "Thus, lexical substitution can be regarded in a way as a hybrid task that combines word sense disambiguation and distributional similarity, targeting the identification of semantically similar words that fit the context.",
        "2 A system for lexical substitution SUBFINDER is a system able to provide the most likely set of substitutes for a word in a given context.",
        "?Contact author.",
        "In SUBFINDER, the lexical substitution task is carried out as a sequence of two steps.",
        "First, candidates are extracted from a variety of knowledge sources; so far, we experimented with WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), Microsoft Encarta encyclopedia, Roget, as well as synonym sets generated from bilingual dictionaries, but additional knowledge sources can be integrated as well.",
        "Second, provided a list of candidates, a number of ranking methods are applied in a weighted combination, resulting in a final list of lexical substitutes ranked by their semantic fit with both the input target word and the context."

      "heading": "3 Candidate Extraction",
      "text": [
        "Candidates are extracted using several lexical resources, which are combined into a larger comprehensive resource.",
        "WordNet: WordNet is a large lexical database of English, with words grouped into synonym sets called synsets.",
        "A problem we encountered with this resource is that often times the only candidate in the synset is the target word itself.",
        "Thus, to enlarge the set of candidates, we use both the synonyms and the hypernyms of the target word.",
        "We also remove the target word from the synset, to ensure that only viable candidates are considered.",
        "Microsoft Encarta encyclopedia: The Microsoft Encarta is an online encyclopedia and thesaurus resource, which provides for each word the part of speech and a list of synonyms.",
        "Using the part of speech as identified in the context, we are able to extract synsets for the target word.",
        "An important feature in the Encarta Thesaurus is that the first word in the synset acts as a definition for the synset, and therefore disambiguates the target word.",
        "This definition is maintained as a separate entry in the com",
        "prehensive resource, and it is also added to its corresponding synset.",
        "Other Lexical Resources: We have also experimented with two other lexical resources, namely the Roget thesaurus and a thesaurus built using bilingual dictionaries.",
        "In evaluations carried out on the development data set, the best results were obtained using only WordNet and Encarta, and thus these are the resources used in the final SUBFINDER system.",
        "All these resources entail different forms of synset clustering.",
        "In order to merge them, we use the largest overlap among them.",
        "It is important to note that the choice of the first resource considered has a bearing on the way the synsets are clustered.",
        "In experiments ran on the development data set, the best results were obtained using a lexical resource constructed starting with the Microsoft Encarta Thesaurus and then mapping the WordNet synsets to it."

      "heading": "4 Candidate Ranking",
      "text": [
        "Several ranking methods are used to score the candidate substitutes, as described below.",
        "Lexical Baseline (LB): In this approach we use the pre-existing lexical resources to provide a ranking over the candidate substitutes.",
        "We rank the candidates based on their occurrence in the two selected lexical resources WordNet and Encarta, with those occurring in both resources being assigned a higher ranking.",
        "This technique emphasizes the resources annotators?",
        "agreement that the candidates belong indeed to the same synset.",
        "Machine Translation (MT): We use machine translation to translate the test sentences back-and-forth between English and a second language.",
        "From the resulting English translation, we extract the replacement that the machine translation engine provides for the target word.",
        "To locate the translated word we scan the translation for any of the candidates (and their inflections) as obtained from the comprehensive resource, and score the candidate synset accordingly.",
        "We experimented with a range of languages such as French, Italian, Spanish, Simplified Chinese, and German, but the best results obtained on the development data were based on the French translations.",
        "This could be explained because French is part of the Romance languages family and synonyms to English words often find their roots in Latin.",
        "If we consider again the word bright, it was translated into French as intelligent and then translated back into English as intelligent for obvious reasons.",
        "In one instance, intelligent was the best replacement for bright in the trial data.",
        "Despite the fact that we also used Italian and Spanish (which are both Latin-based) we can only assume that French worked better because translation engines are better trained on French.",
        "From the resulting English translation, we extract the replacement that the machine translation engine provides for the target word.",
        "To locate the translated word we scan the translation for any of the candidates (and their inflections) as obtained from the comprehensive resource, and score the candidate synset accordingly.",
        "The translation process was carried out using Google and AltaVista translation engines resulting in two systems MTG and MTA respectively.",
        "The translation systems feature high precision when a candidate is found (about 20% of the time), at the cost of low recall.",
        "The lexical baseline method is therefore used when no candidates are returned by the translation method.",
        "Most Common Sense (MCS): Another method we use for ranking candidates is to consider the first word appearing in the first synset returned by WordNet.",
        "When no words other than the target word are available in this synset, the method recursively searches the next synset available for the target word.",
        "In order to guarantee a sufficient number of candidates, we use the lexical baseline method as a baseline.",
        "Language Model (LM): We model the semantic fit of a candidate substitute within the given context using a language model, expressed using the conditional probability:",
        "where c represents a possible candidate and g represents the context.",
        "The probability P (g) of the context is the same for all the candidates, hence we can ignore it and estimate P (c|g) as the N-gram frequency of the context where the target word is replaced by the proposed candidate.",
        "To avoid skewed counts that can arise from the different morphological inflections of the target word or the candidate and the bias that the context might have toward any specific inflection, we generalize P (c|g) to take into account all the inflections of the selected candidate as shown in equation 2.",
        "where n is the number of possible inflections for the candidate c. We use the Google N-gram dataset to calculate the term Count(ci g).",
        "The Google N-gram corpus is a",
        "collection of English N-grams, ranging from one to five N-grams, and their respective frequency counts observed on the Web (Brants and Franz, 2006).",
        "In order for the model to give high preference to the longer N-grams, while maintaining the relative frequencies of the shorter N-grams (typically more frequent), we augment the counts of the higher order N-grams with the maximum counts of the lower order N-grams, hence guaranteeing that the score assigned to an N-gram of order N is higher than the the score of an N-gram of order N ?",
        "1.",
        "Semantic Relatedness using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA): We expect to find a strong semantic relationship between a good candidate and the target context.",
        "A relatively simple and efficient way to measure such a relatedness is the Latent Semantic Analysis (Landauer et al., 1998).",
        "Documents and terms are mapped into a 300 dimensional latent semantic space, providing the ability to measure the semantic relatedness between two words or a word and a context.",
        "We use the InfoMap package from Stanford University's Center for the Study of Language and Information, trained on a collection of approximately one million Wikipedia articles.",
        "The rank of a candidate is given by its semantic relatedness to the entire context sentence.",
        "Information Retrieval (IR): Although the Language Model approach is successful in ranking the candidates, it suffers from the small N-gram size imposed by using the Google N-grams corpus.",
        "Such a restriction is obvious in the following 5-gram example who was a bright boy in which the context is not sufficient to disambiguate between happy and smart as possible candidates.",
        "As a result, we adapt an information retrieval approach which uses all the content words available in the given context.",
        "Similar to the previous models, the target word in the context is replaced by all the generated inflections of the selected candidate and then queried using a web search engine.",
        "The resulting rank represents the sum of the total number of pages in which the candidate or any of its inflections occur together with the context.",
        "This also reflects the semantic relatedness or the relevance of the candidate to the context.",
        "Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD): Since previous work indicated the usefulness of word sense disambiguation systems in lexical substitution (Da-gan et al., 2006), we use the SenseLearner word sense disambiguation tool (Mihalcea and Csomai, 2005) to disambiguate the target word and, accordingly, to propose its synonyms as candidates.",
        "Final System: Our candidate ranking methods are aimed at different aspects of what constitutes a good candidate.",
        "On one hand, we measure the semantic relatedness of a candidate with the original context (the LSA and WSD methods fall under this category).",
        "On the other hand, we also want to ensure that the candidate fits the context and leads to a well formed English sentence (e.g., the language model method).",
        "Given that the methods described earlier aim at orthogonal aspects of the problem, it is expected that a combination of these will provide a better overall ranking.",
        "We use a voting mechanism, where we consider the reciprocal of the rank of each candidates as given by one of the described methods.",
        "The final score of a candidate is given by the decreasing order of the weighted sum of the reciprocal ranks:",
        "To determine the weight ?",
        "of each individual ranking we run a genetic algorithm on the development data, optimized for the mode precision and recall.",
        "Separate sets of weights are obtained for the best and oot tasks.",
        "Table 1 shows the weights of the individual ranking methods.",
        "As expected, for the best task, the language model type of methods obtain higher weights, whereas for the oot task, the semantic methods seem to perform better."

        "The lexical substitution task goes beyond simple word sense disambiguation.",

        "To accomplish this, we built a system that incorporates lexical, semantic, and probabilistic methods to capture both the semantic similarity with the target word and the semantic fit in the context.",
