        "We participated in the metonymy task with a very basic system.",
        "The idea was to investigate the efficiency of a minimalist (though, not Chomskian) system.",
        "This system tags entities on the basis of discriminative (plain) word forms occurring in a given window only.",
        "Our aim was to find out which word forms are discriminative enough to be considered as parameters.",
        "In the past, we developed a system for metonymy resolution for French, evaluated in the framework of the ESTER evaluation (Gravier, 2004).",
        "This system, described in Poibeau (2006), uses various kinds of information, among others: plain word forms, part-of-speech tags, and syntactic and semantic tags (conceptual word classes).",
        "The usefulness of complex linguistic features (especially syntactic and semantic tags) is questionable: they may be hard to compute, error-prone and their contribution is not clear.",
        "We therefore developed a new version of the system mainly based on 1) a distributional analysis (on surface word forms) along with 2) a filtering process.",
        "The latter restricted metonymic readings to country and capital names (as opposed to other location names), since they include a vast majority of the metonymic readings (this proved to be efficient but is of course a harsh pragmatic oversimplification without real linguistic basis).",
        "We nevertheless obtained a highly versatile system, performing reasonably well, compared to our previous, much more complex implementation (F-score was .58 instead of .63; we computed F-score with ?=1).",
        "In the framework of the Semeval evaluation, the filtering process is irrelevant since only country names are considered as entities.",
        "However, we thought that it would be interesting to develop a very basic system, to evaluate the performance one can obtain using plain word forms only."

        "We chose not to use any part-of-speech tagger or syntactic or semantic analyzer; we did not use any external knowledge or any other annotated corpus than the one provided for the training phase.",
        "Since no NLP tool was used, we had to duplicate most of the words in order to get the singular and the plural form.",
        "Our system is thus very simple compared to",
        "the state-of-art in this domain (e.g. Nissim and Markert, 2003).",
        "We used discriminative plain words only.",
        "These are gathered as follows: all the words in a given window (here we use a 7 word window, before and after the target entity since it gave the best results on the training data) are extracted and associated with two classes (literal vs. non literal).",
        "We thus consider the most discriminative words, i.e. words that appear frequently in some contexts but not in others (literal vs. non-literal readings).",
        "Discriminative words are elements that are abnormally frequent or rare in one corpus compared to another one.",
        "Characteristic features are selected based on their probabilities.",
        "Probability levels measure the significance of the differences between the relative frequency of an expression or a feature within a group (or a category) with its global relative frequency calculated over the entire corpus (Lafon, 1980).",
        "They are calculated under the hypothesis of a random distribution of the forms.",
        "The smaller the probability levels, the more characteristic the corresponding forms (Lebart and Salem, 1997).",
        "We thus obtained 4 lists of discriminative words (literal vs. non-literal ?",
        "before vs. after the target entity).",
        "As the result, some semantic families emerged, especially for words appearing before literal readings: lists of prepositions (in, at, within?)",
        "and geographical items (east, west, western?).",
        "Some lists were manually completed, when a ?natural?",

        "Figure 1 shows that detecting the preposition in in front of a location name discriminates almost perfectly 23% of the literal readings.",
        "(result tag = literal) A simple discriminative analysis of the training corpus produces the following list of prepositions and geographical discriminative features: \"at\", \"within\", \"in\", \"into\", \"from\", \"coast\", \"land\", \"area\", \"southern\", \"south\", \"east\", \"north\", \"west\", \"western\", \"eastern\", etc 1 .",
        "Table 2 presents the results obtained from this list of words (occurring in a 7 word window, on the left of the target word):",

        "The presence of 's on the right side of the target entity is highly discriminative (table 3):",
        "(result tag = literal) This strategy may seem strange, since the task is to find metonymic readings rather than literal ones (the baseline is to tag all the target entities as literal).",
        "However, it is useful in reducing the size of the search space by approximately 50%.",
        "This means that more than 70% of the entities with a literal meaning can be tagged with a confidence around 90% using this technique, thus reducing the number of problematic cases.",
        "The resulting file is relatively balanced: it contains about 50-60% of literal meaning and 40-50% of metaphorical meaning (instead of a classical ratio 80% vs. 20%)."
