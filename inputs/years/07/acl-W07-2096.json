        "In information retrieval, for instance, the expansion of query terms is a very investigated topic which has shown to improve results with respect to when query expansion is not employed (Qiu and Frei, 1993; Ruge, 1992; R.Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999; Grefenstette, 1994; Rijsber-gen, 1979).",

        "In (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2002) we may see the typical example of using a external knowledge database for determining the correct sense of a word given in some context.",
        "In this approach, every word close to the one we would like to determine its correct sense is expanded with its different senses by using the WordNet lexicon (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "Then, an overlapping factor is calculated in order to determine the correct sense of the ambiguous word.",
        "Different other approaches have made use of a similar procedure.",
        "By using dictionaries, the proposals presented in (Lesk, 1986; Wilks et al., 1990; Nancy and Ve?ronis, 1990) are the most sucessful in WSD.",
        "Yarowsky (Yarowsky, 1992) used instead thesauri for their experiments.",
        "Finally, in (Sussna, 1993; Resnik, 1995; Banerjee and Pedersen, 2002) the use of lexicons in WSD has been investigated.",
        "Although in some cases the knowledge resource seems not to be used strictly for term expansion, the aplication of co-occurrence terms is included in their algorithms.",
        "Like in information retrieval, the application of term expansion in WSD by using co-related terms has shown to improve the baseline results if we carefully select the external resource to use, with a priori knowledge of the domain and the broadness of the corpus (wide or narrow domain).",
        "Evenmore, we have to be sure that the Lexical Data Base (LDB) has been suitable constructed.",
        "Due to the last facts, we consider that the use of a self automatically constructed LDB (using the same test corpora), may be of high benefit.",
        "This assumption is based on the intrinsic properties extracted from the corpus itself.",
        "Our proposal is related somehow with the investigations presented in (Schu?tze, 1998) and (Purandare and Pedersen, 2004), where words are also expanded with co-ocurrence terms for word sense discrimination.",
        "The main difference consists in the use of the same corpora for constructing the co-ocurrence list.",

        "This measure is named pointwise Mutual Information (MI), and its applications for finding collocations are analysed by determining the co-ocurrence degree among two terms.",
        "This may be done by calculating the ratio between the number of times that both terms appear together (in the same context and not necessarily in the same order) and the product of the number of times that each term ocurrs alone.",
        "Given two terms X1 and X2, the pointwise mutual information between X1 and X2 can be calculated as follows:",
        "The numerator could be modified in order to take into account only bigrams, as presented in (Pinto et al., 2006), where an improvement of clustering short texts in narrow domains has been obtained.",
