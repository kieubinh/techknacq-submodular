        "One of the lessons learned from our previous experience at Senseval-31 (Buscaldi et al., 2004; Vazquez et al., 2004) is that the integration of different systems usually works better than a standalone system.",
        "In our opinion this reflects the reality where humans do not apply always the same rule in order to disambiguate the same ambigue word; for instance, if we consider the sentences ?He hit a home run?",
        "and ?The thermometer hit 100 degrees?, in the first case the sport domain helps in determining the right sense for",
        "hit, whereas in the latter the disambiguation is carried out mostly depending on the fact that the subject of the sentence is an object.",
        "The combination of distinct methods represents itself a major problem.",
        "If the methods return different answers, how can we select the best one?",
        "In this sense the available choices are the following: ?",
        "Rule-based selection: a set of rules that can be both handmade or automatically learned from examples; ?",
        "Probability-based: the output of the methods is normalized in the range [0, 1] and is considered as a probability.",
        "Then the values are multiplied in order to obtain the sense with a maximum probability.",
        "?",
        "Vote-based: the output of the methods is considered as a weighted vote.",
        "Then a voting scheme is used in order to obtain the most voted sense.",
        "In our previous participation with the R2D2 project (Vazquez et al., 2004) the selection was rule-based, with handmade rules that attempted to take into account the reliability of the various method.",
        "We subsequently attempted to learn automatically the rules, but the results of these experiments did not allow to determine clearly which method was to be used in each context.",
        "Working with probabilities can be problematic due to the null probabilities that make necessary the adoption of smoothing techniques.",
        "Therefore, we opted for a voting scheme, in this case the fuzzy Borda (Nurmi, 2001; Garc?",
        "?a Lapresta and Mart?",
        "?nez",
        "Panero, 2002), one of the best known methods in the field of collective decision making.",
        "With this scheme the disambiguation methods are considered as experts providing a preference ranking over the sense of the word.",
        "The methods we choose as experts are the sense probability calculated over SemCor, the Conceptual Density algorithm by (Rosso et al., 2003), the extended Lesk by (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2002), and an algorithm that takes into account the domains of the word to be disambiguated and the context words.",
