        "While the features employed by these approaches are mostly considered to be ?shallow?, that is, extracted from corpus or provided by shallow syntactic tools like part-of-speech taggers, it is generally thought that significant progress in automatic WSD would require a ?deep?",
        "approach in which access to substantial body of linguistic and world knowledge could assist in resolving ambiguities.",
        "Although the access to large amounts of knowledge is now possible due to the availability of lexicons like WordNet, parsers, etc., the incorporation of such knowledge has been hampered by the limitations of the modelling techniques usually employed for WSD.",
        "Using certain sources of information, mainly relational information, is beyond the capabilities of such techniques, which are based on feature-value vectors.",
        "Arguably, Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) systems provide an appropriate framework for dealing with such data: they make explicit provisions for the inclusion of background knowledge of any form; the richer representation language used, based on first-order logic, is powerful enough to capture contextual relationships; and the modelling is not restricted to being of a particular form (e.g., classification).",
        "We describe the investigation of the use of ILP for WSD in the Lexical Sample task of SemEval2007 in two different ways: (a) the construction of models that can be used directly to disambiguate words; and (b) the construction of interesting features to be used by a standard feature-based algorithm, namely, SVMs, to build disambiguation models.",
