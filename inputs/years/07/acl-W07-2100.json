        "Grained All Words and English Lexical Sample Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) tasks, and in the Lexical Substitution task.",
        "The Lexical Substitution system relies entirely on the substitutability measure to rank potential synonyms, and only uses manual sense inventories to preferentially select words which have been identified by lexicographers as being synonyms for the original word in some contexts.",
        "It does not make use of any machine learning, and is thus unsupervised.",
        "The WSD systems are supervised, using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to learn from sense-tagged examples of ambiguous words and predict the class of the test instances.",
        "Classifiers for both systems use a small number of additional feature types beyond those derived from the n-gram counts, including Bag of Words (BOW) and local context features.",
        "A single separate model was trained for each ambiguous lemma.",
        "For verbs in the lexical sample, the classifier also uses the syntactic category assigned to the target verb by a parser as additional information for disambiguation.",

        "It is clear that in a sufficiently large quantity of text, the fragments: the court found it was clear that and a republic governed by the people would be substantially more common than the sequences: the court governed it was clear that or a republic found by the people and thus found should be considered more substitutable in the context of the first fragment, and governed in the second.",
        "Church et al. (1994) show that Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) is a suitable measure to capture the degree to which a given word may substitute for another; we have adopted PMI as the quantified measure of substitutability in the systems used for these tasks.",

        "As the system does not attempt to disambiguate words not selected for modeling, the exclusion of the most frequent sense (MFS) baseline would be likely to have a severe adverse impact on this type of supervised approach.",
        "Extension of the substitutability measure to directly select a sense related to good substitutes, similar to the approach outlined in Lin (1997) would be one possible approach to resolve this consistently.",
        "The classifier used for the system was an SVM (libsvm) (Chang and Lin, 2001).",
        "Linear kernels were used, as previous experiments using similar features with other data sets for WSD had shown that these kernels outperformed radial basis function and polynomial kernels; this disparity became particularly pronounced with larger number of features compared to training instances, and with the combination of different feature types.",
        "The number of unique features for each lemma was, on average, more than an order of magnitude higher than the number of training instances: 4475 compared to 289.",

        "All windows at all sizes covered by the Web1T corpus that included the target word were used to determine the overall substitutability.",

Following Church et al. (1994) the Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) is used for both probabilities in the denominator.",
        "p(sub) is estimated from the unigram frequency of the substitute word, while p(context) is derived from the counts of the context ignoring the token in the target location.",
        "Features were also created that harnessed the idea that it is not only the level of substitutability for each candidate word that is useful, but also that it may be informative to recognise that some words are better substitutes than others.",
        "This information was captured by adding additional features consisting of the pairwise differences between PMI values for all candidate substitute words.",
        "To further draw the differing levels of substitutability into relief, features representing the rank of each pair's PMI difference were also included.",
        "Finally, each of the above feature types yields real-valued features.",
        "Before being used in classification, these features were converted to binary features using supervised Entropy-Based Discretisation (Fayyad and Irani, 1993).",
        "This process characterises the partition selection as a message coding problem: the class labels in the training data are a message to be encoded given that the value of the feature is known for each instance, and the process aims to minimise the length of that message.",
        "This is achieved by recursively bifurcating each feature's values at the partition point that would result in the shortest message.",
        "Useful boundaries are those where knowing which side of the partition the feature value falls on can be used to reduce the message length beyond any increase required to specify the partition.",

        "As for the WSD systems, the Lexical Substitution system concentrated on words whose occurrence in local contexts similar to that of the target was more frequent than expected in the Web1T corpus.",
        "Aside from preferring sets of potential synonyms obtained from lexical resources, the system is entirely unsupervised.",
        "Consequently, no sense-annotated corpus resources were used.",
        "The lexical resources used were WordNet version 2.1 (Fellbaum, 1998) and the Macquarie Thesaurus (Bernard, 1985), a pre-defined, manually constructed Thesaurus.",
        "The only information used from these resources was a list of potential synonyms for all listed senses that matched the target word's part-of-speech.",
        "These synonyms were used to preferentially choose potential substitutes obtained from the corpus data, as described below.",
        "The union of potential synonyms from both resources was used, although MWEs were not included due to limitations with the corpus.",
        "Although these lexical resources were not augmented, the system was capable of producing substitutes not present in these resources by using high-scoring words found in the corpus.",
        "The ordering of synonyms in these resources was not used directly, nor was their association with particular senses.",
        "The PMI for potential substitutes that occurred in the target position of each local context window was determined using the Web1T corpus, as for coarse WSD above.",
        "The strategy differed slightly from the supervised process employed for WSD however, in that rather than testing a fixed set of potential substitutes, every word that occurred in the correct location in a matching context was considered as a substitute.",
        "This introduced an additional computational burden which restricted the set of n-grams used to 4 and 5 grams.",
        "In particular, this is because the set of words occurring in the target position grew prohibitively large for 2 and 3 grams.",
        "As for WSD, the PMI for each potential substitute was combined by summing the individual PMIs over all locations and size of n-gram where it occurred.",
        "This sum was used to rank the substitutes.",
        "After the production of the ranked list, the set of synonyms obtained from the lexical resources was used for preferential selection.",
        "Substitutes in the ranked list that also occurred in the synonym pool were chosen first.",
        "The exact manner of the preferential selection differed for the two evaluation measures the system participated in.",
        "For the BEST measure, the highest PMI-ranked substitute that occurred in the synonym pool was given as the only substitute.",
        "If no substitutes from the synonym pool were present in the ranked list, the top three substitutes from the list were given.",
        "For the out-of-ten (OOT) measure, the ten highest-ranked substitutes that were in the synonym pool were given.",
        "If fewer than 10 substitutes were present in the list, the remaining best ranked substitutes not in the synonym pool were used to make up the ten answers.",
        "As with the Coarse-Grained All Word WSD, limitations in the current implementation of the Web1T processing software meant that it was not possible to examine MWEs, and there was thus no provision to detect or handle MWEs in the system.",

        "Notably, recall is always lower than precision.",
        "If no substitutes were found to have finite PMI at any position, no substitute was rendered by the system.",

        "This was the case for around 3% of the evaluation set.",
        "As the query retrieval software was limited to single word substitutions, this should be expected to occur for MWEs more frequently than for single word substitutions.",
        "The results for both BEST and OOT confirm this, showing that the system's performance is uniformly better when MWEs are excluded.",
