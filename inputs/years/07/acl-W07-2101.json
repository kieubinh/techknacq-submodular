        "Two of the SemEval 2007 tasks, namely Task 4 (Classification of Semantic Relations between Nom-inals)and Task 8 (Metonymy Resolution) employed distinct theories for the interpretation of their corresponding semantic phenomena, but, nevertheless, they also shared several lexico-semantic resources, and, furthermore, both these tasks could have been cast as classification problems, in vein with most of the recent work in computational semantic processing.",
        "Based on this observation, we have designed and implemented a semantic architecture that was used in both tasks.",
