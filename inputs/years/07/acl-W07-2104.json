        "The goal of the Web People Search task at SemEval 2007 was to disambiguate person names in a web searching scenario (Artiles et al., 2007).",
        "Participants were presented with the following setting: given a list of documents retrieved from a web search engine using a person's name as a query, group documents that refer to the same individual.",
        "Our aim with the participation was to adapt language modeling techniques to this task.",
        "To this end, we employed two methods: single pass clustering (SPC) and probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA).",
        "Our main finding is that the former leads to high purity, while the latter leads to high inverse purity scores.",
        "Furthermore, we experimented with various document representations, based on the snippets and body text.",
        "Highest overall performance was achieved with the combination of both.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we present the two approaches we employed for clustering documents.",
        "Next, in Section 3 we discuss document representation and preprocessing.",

        "We employed single pass clustering (Hill., 1968) to automatically assign pages to clusters, where we assume that each cluster is a set of pages related to one particular sense of the person.",
        "The process for assignment was performed as follows: The first document was taken and assigned to the first cluster.",
        "Then each subsequent document was compared against each cluster with a similarity measure based on the log odds ratio (initially, there was only the initial one created).",
        "A document was assigned to the most likely cluster, as long as the similarity score was higher than a threshold ?",
        "; otherwise, the document was assigned to a new cluster, unless the maximum number of desired clusters ?",
        "had been reached; in that case the document was assigned to the last cluster (i.e., the left overs).",
        "The similarity measure we employed was the log odds ratio to decide whether the document was more likely to be generated from that cluster or not.",
        "This approach follows Kalt (1996)'s work on document classification using the document likelihood by representing the cluster as a multinomial term distribution (i.e., a cluster language model) and predicting the probability of a document D, given the cluster language model, i.e., p(D|?C).",
        "It is assumed that the terms t in a document are sampled independently and identically, so the log odds ratio is calculated as",
        "follows:",
        "where n(t,D) is the number of times a term appears in a document, and the ?C represents the language model that represents not being in the cluster.",
        "Note this is similar to a well-known relevance modeling approach, where the clusters are relevance and non-relevance, except, here, it is applied in the context of classification as done by Kalt (1996).",
        "The cluster language model was estimated by performing a linear interpolation between the empirical probability of a term occurring in the cluster p(t|C) and the background model p(t), the probability of a term occurring at random in the collection, i.e.,",
        "set to 0.5.1 The ?not in the cluster?",

        "The second method for disambiguation we employed was probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) (Hofmann, 1999).",
        "PLSA clusters documents based on the term-document co-occurrence which results in semantic decomposition of the term document matrix into a lower dimensional latent space.",
        "Formally, PLSA can be defined as:",
        "where p(t, d) is the probability of term t and document d co-occurring, p(t|z) is the probability of a term given a latent topic z and p(z|d) is the probability of a latent topic in a document.",
        "The prior probability of the document, p(d), was assumed to be uniform.",
        "This decomposition can be obtained automatically using the EM algorithm (Hofmann, 1999).",
        "Once estimated, we assumed that each latent topic represents one of the different senses of the person,",
        "forming range suggested by Lavrenko and Croft (2001).",
        "so the document is assigned to one of the person-topics.",
        "Here, we made the assignment based on the maximum p(z|d), so if p(z|d) = max p(z|d), then d was assigned to z.",
        "In order to automatically select the number of person-topics, we performed the following process to decide when the appropriate number of person-topics (defined by k) have been identified: (1) we set k = 2 and computed the log-likelihood of the decomposition on a held out sample of data; (2) we incremented k and computed the log-likelihood; if the log-likelihood had increased over a given threshold (0.001) then we repeated step 2, else (3) we stopped as we have maximized the log-likelihood of the decompositions, with respect to the number person-topics.",
        "This point was assumed to be the optimal with respect to the number of person senses.",
        "Since, we are focusing on identifying the true number of classes, this should result in higher inverse purity, whereas with the single pass clustering the number of clusters is not restricted, and so we would expect single pass clustering to produce more clusters but with a higher purity.",
        "We used Lemur2 and the PennAspect implementation of PLSA (Schein et al., 2002) for our experiments, where the parameters for PLSA where set as follows.",

        "For tempering the setting suggested in (Hofmann, 1999) were used.",
