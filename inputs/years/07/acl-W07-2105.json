        "Each classifier predicts for each instance of the relation whether it holds or not.",
        "The predictions of all the classifiers are aggregated for each instance by disjunction.",
        "That is to say, each instance is predicted to be false by default unless any of the classifiers gives evidence against this.",
        "To generate the submitted predictions we used two parallel classifiers: (1) a classifier that combines eleven WordNet-based similarity measures, see Sec. 2.1, and (2) a classifier that learns lexical patterns from Google and the Waterloo Multi-Text System (WMTS)(Turney, 2004) snippets and applies these on the same corpora, see Sec. 2.2.",
        "Three other classifiers we experimented with, but that were not used to generate the submitted predictions: (3) a classifier that uses string kernel methods on the dependency paths of the training sentences, see Sec. 3.1, (4) a classifier that uses string kernels on the local context of the subject and object nominals in the training sentences, see Sec. 3.2 and (5) a classifier that uses handmade lexical patterns on Google and WMTS, see Sec. 3.3."

        "As this resource consists of lexical and semantic relations, its use constitutes an appealing option to learning relations.",
        "In particular, we believe that given two mentions of the same semantic relation, their arguments should also be similar.",
        "Or, in analogy learning terms, if R1(X1,Y1) and R2(X2,Y2) are relation mentions ofthe same type, then X1 :: Y1 as X2 :: Y2.",
        "Our preliminary experiments with WordNet suggested that few arguments of each relation are connected by immediate hyperonymy or meronymy relations.",
        "As a result, we decided to use similarity measures defined over WordNet (Pedersen et al., 2004).",
        "The Word-Net::Similarity package (Pedersen et al., 2004) includes 11 different measures, which mostly use either the WordNet glosses (lesk or vector measures) or the paths between a pair of concepts (lch; wup) to determine their relatedness.",
        "To be able to use WordNet::Similarity, we mapped all WordNet sense keys from the training and test sets to the earlier WordNet version (2.1).",

        "This classifier models the intuition that when a pair of nominals is used in similar phrases as another pair they share at least one relation, and when no such phrases can be found they do not share any relation.",
        "Applied to the semantic relation classification problem this means that when a pair in the test set can be found in the same patterns as pairs from the training set, the classification for the pair will be true.",
        "To find the patterns we followed step 1 to 6 described in (Turney, 2006), with the exception that we used both Google and the WMTS to compute pattern frequency.",
        "First we extracted the pairs of nominals ?X ,Y ?",
        "from the training sentences and created one Google query and a set of WMTS queries for each pair.",

        "The WMTS queries looked like [n]>([5]..\"X\"..[i]..\"Y\"..[5]) and [n]>([5]..\"Y\"..[i]..\"X\"..[5]) for i = 1,2,3 and n = i+12, and for each variation of X and Y .",
        "Then we extracted sentences from the Google snippets and cut out a context of size 5, so that we were left with similar text segments as those returned by the WMTS queries.",
        "We merged the lists of text segments and counted all n-grams that contained both nominals for n = 1 to 6.",
        "We substituted the nominals by variables in the n-grams with a count greater than 10 and used these as patterns for the classifier.",
        "An example of such a pattern for the Cause-Effect relation is \"generation of Y by X\".",
        "After this we followed step 3 to 6 of (Turney, 2006), which left us with a matrix for each of the seven semantic relations, where each row represented a pair of nominals and each column represented the frequency of a pattern, and where each pair was classified as either true or false.",
        "The straightforward way to find pattern frequencies for the pairs in the test set would be to fill in these patterns with the pairs of nominals from the test set.",
        "This was not feasible given the time limitation on the task.",
        "So instead, for each pair of nominals in the test set we gathered the top-1000 snippets and computed pattern frequencies by counting how often the nominals occur in every pattern on this set text segments.",
        "We constructed a matrix from these frequencies in the same way as for the training set, but without classifications for the pairs.",
        "We experimented with various machine learning algorithms to predict the classes of the pairs.",
        "We chose to use k-nearest neighbors, because it was the only algorithm that gave more subtle predictions than true for every pair or false for every pair.",
