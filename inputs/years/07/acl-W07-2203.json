        "However, there are disadvantages to this approach.",
        "Firstly, treebanks are expensive to create manually.",
        "Secondly, the richer the annotation required, the harder it is to adapt the treebank to train parsers which make different assumptions about the structure of syntactic analyses.",
        "For example, Hockenmeier (2003) trains a statistical parser based on Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) on the WSJ PTB, but first maps the treebank to CCG derivations semi-automatically.",
        "Thirdly, many (lexical) parameter estimates do not generalize well between domains.",
        "For instance, Gildea (2001) reports that WSJ-derived bilexical parameters in Collins' (1999) Model 1 parser contribute about 1% to parse selection accuracy when test data is in the same domain, but yield no improvement for test data selected from the Brown Corpus.",
        "Tadayoshi et al.",
        "(2005) adapt a statistical parser trained on the WSJ PTB to the biomedical domain by retraining on the Genia Corpus, augmented with manually corrected derivations in the same format.",
        "To make statistical parsing more viable for a range of applications, we need to make more effective and flexible use of extant training data and minimize the cost of annotation for new data created to tune a system to a new domain.",
        "Unsupervised methods for training parsers have been relatively unsuccessful to date, including expectation maximization (EM) such as the inside-outside algorithm (IOA) over PCFGs (Baker, 1979; Prescher, 2001).",
        "However, Pereira and Schabes (1992) adapted the IOA to apply over semi-supervised data (unlabeled bracket-ings) extracted from the PTB.",

        "Elworthy (1994) and Merialdo (1994) demonstrated that Baum-Welch does not necessarily improve the performance of an HMM part-of-speech tagger when deployed in an unsupervised or semi-supervised setting.",
        "These somewhat negative results, in contrast to those of Pereira and Schabes (1992), suggest that EM techniques require fairly determinate training data to yield useful models.",
        "Another motivation to explore alternative non-iterative methods is that the derivation space over partially-bracketed data can remain large (>1K) while the confidence-based methods we explore have a total processing overhead equivalent to one iteration of an IOA-based EM algorithm.",
        "As we utilize an initial model to annotate additional training data, our methods are closely related to self-training methods described in the literature (e.g. McClosky et al.",

        "However these methods have been applied to fully-annotated training data to create the initial model, which is then used to annotate further training data derived from unannotated text.",
        "Instead, we train entirely from partially-bracketed data, starting from the small proportion of 'unambiguous' data whereby a single parse is consistent with the annotation.",
        "Therefore, our methods are better described as semi-supervised and the main focus of this work is the flexible reuse of existing treebanks to train a wider variety of statistical parsing models.",

        "To investigate whether such data would be of value, we considered W to be the corpus over which we were tuning and applied the best performing model trained over S, Cr(IL(y(S)), a(S)), as our initial model.",
        "Figure 5 illustrates the performance of Cr compared to EM.",
        "Tuning using Cr was not significantly different from the model built directly from the entire data set with Cr, achieving 76.57% as opposed to 76.54% Fi (see Table 2).",
        "By contrast, EM performs better given all the data from the beginning rather than tuning to the new domain.",
        "Susanne Corpus (S).",
        "Cr generally outperforms EM, though it is worth noting the behavior of EM given only the tuning data (W) rather than the data from both domains (SW).",
        "In this case, the graph illustrates a combination of Elworthy's 'initial' and 'classical' patterns.",
        "The steep drop in performance (down to 69.93% F1) after the first iteration is probably due to loss of information from S. However, this run also eventually converges to similar performance, suggesting that the information in S is effectively disregarded as it forms only a small portion of SW, and that these runs effectively converge to a local maximum over W.",
        "Bacchiani et al.",
        "(2006), working in a similar framework, explore weighting the contribution (frequency counts) of the in-domain and out-of-domain training datasets and demonstrate that this can have beneficial effects.",
        "Furthermore, they also tried unsupervised tuning to the indomain corpus by weighting parses for it by their normalized probability.",
        "This method is similar to our Cp method.",
        "However, when we tried unsupervised tuning using the WSJ and an initial model built from S in conjunction with our confidence-based methods, performance degraded significantly."

      "text": [
        "We have presented several semi-supervised confidence-based training methods which have significantly improved performance over an extant (more supervised) method, while also reducing the manual effort required to create training or tuning data.",
        "We have shown that given a medium-sized unlabeled partially bracketed corpus, the confidence-based models achieve superior results to those achieved with EM applied to the same PGLR parse selection model.",
        "Indeed, a bracketed corpus provides flexibility as existing treebanks can be utilized despite the incompatibility between the system grammar and the underlying grammar of the treebank.",
        "Mapping an incompatible annotated treebank to a compatible partially-bracketed corpus is relatively easy compared to mapping to a compatible fully-annotated corpus.",
        "An immediate benefit of this work is that (re)training parsers with incrementally-modified grammars based on different linguistic frameworks should be much more straightforward -see, for example Oepen et al.",
        "(2002) for a good discussion of the problem.",
        "Furthermore, it suggests that it may be possible to usefully tune a parser to a new domain with less annotation effort.",
        "Our findings support those of Elworthy (1994) and Merialdo (1994) for POS tagging and suggest that EM is not always the most suitable semi-supervised training method (especially when some in-domain training data is available).",
        "The confidence-based methods were successful because the level of noise introduced did not outweigh the benefit of incorporating all derivations compatible with the bracketing in which the derivations contained a high proportion of correct constituents.",
        "These findings may not hold if the level of bracketing available does not adequately constrain the parses considered - see Hwa (1999) for a related investigation with EM.",
        "In future work we intend to further investigate the problem of tuning to a new domain, given that minimal manual effort is a major priority.",
        "We hope to develop methods which required no manual annotation, for example, high precision automatic partial bracketing using phrase chunking and/or named entity recognition techniques might yield enough information to support the training methods developed here.",
        "Finally, further experiments on weighting the contribution of each dataset might be beneficial.",
        "For instance, Bacchiani et al.",
        "(2006) demonstrate imrpovements in parsing accuracy with unsupervised adaptation from unannotated data and explore the effect of different weighting of counts derived from the supervised and unsupervised data."
