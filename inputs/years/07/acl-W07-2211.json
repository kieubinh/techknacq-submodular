        "But in some situations, if such a dispreference were given a large negative score, the parser could be forced into very odd readings not compensated for by other factors.",
        "In the early 1990's, the increasing availability and use of corpora, together with a sense that multilevel symbolic preference scores were based on ad-hoc judgments, led to experiments and systems that used empirical methods to obtain preference weights.",

        "Optimality Theory (OT) was originally developed to explain phonological rules (Prince and Smolensky, 1993).",
        "In that use, potential rules are given one \"optimality mark\" for each constraint they violate.",
        "The marks, all implicitly negative, are ranked by level of severity.",
        "A best rule R is one for which (a) the most severe level of constraint violation L is < the level violated by any other rule, and (b) if other rules also violate level L constraints, the number of such violations is > the number of violations by R.",
        "As adapted for use in the XLE processor for LFG (Frank et al.",
        "1998) optimality marks are associated with parser and generator outputs.",
        "Positive marks are added, and also labeled inter-mark positions within the optimality mark ranking.",
        "The labeled positions influence processor behavior.",
        "For generation, they are used to disprefer infelicitous strings accepted in a parse direction.",
        "And for parsing they can be used to disprefer (actually ignore) rarely-applicable rules, in order to reduce parse time (Kaplan et al., 2004).",
        "However, because the optimality marks are global, a single dispreference can rule out an entire parse.",
        "To partially overcome this limitation, a further extension (see XLE Online Documentation) allows direct comparisons of alternative readings for the same input extent.",
        "A different optimality mark can be set for each reading, and the use of one such mark in the ranking can be conditioned on the presence of another particular mark for the same extent.",
        "For example, a conditional disprefer-ence can be set for an adjunct reading if an argument reading also exists.",
        "The extension does not address more global interactions, and is said (Forst et al.",
        "2005) to be used mostly as a pre-filter to limit the readings disambiguated by a follow-on stochastic process.",
        "A slightly different view of preference-based parsing is that the business of a preference system is to work in tandem with a permissive syntactic grammar, to manipulate outcomes.",
        "The difference focuses on the pragmatic role of preference in coercing the parser.",
        "In this light, the principles of section 2.1 are guidelines for desired outcomes, not bases for judging the goodness of a relationship or setting preference values.",
        "Instead, preference values should be set based on their effectiveness in isolating best parses.",
        "Also, in this light, the utility of a preference system lies not only in its contribution to accuracy, but also in its software-engineering convenience.",

        "It consists of the XIP processor, plus grammars for a number of languages.",

        "These \"important\" tokens include commas, and leftward phrase heads that might serve as alternative attachment points.",
        "Special attention is given to coordination, a constant source of inefficiency and inaccuracy for all parsers.",
        "To limit this problem, an input string is divided into spans ending at coordinating conjunctions, and the chunks following a span are examined to determine what kinds of coordination might be present in the span.",
        "For example, if a chunk following a span Sp is a noun phrase, and there are no verbs in the input following that noun phrase, only noun phrase coordination is considered within Sp.",
        "Also, with heuristic exceptions, the locator phase disallows searching for appositives within long sequences of noun and prepositional phrases ending with a coordinating conjunction.",

        "A recursive control mechanism traverses the grammar networks depth-first to build constituents.",

        "Each arc of the network references either a basic chunk, or a final state of a subordinate output network.",

        "To obtain the preference system, an initial set of tests is identified, based primarily on subcategori-zation considerations, and then refined and extended based on manual \"training\" on large numbers of documents.",
        "Several problem situations result in changes to the system, besides random inspection of scores:",
        "(a) the best parse identified is not the correct one, either because the correct parse is not the highest scoring one, or because another parse with the same score was considered \"best\" because of low-attach considerations.",
        "(b) The best parse obtained is the correct one, but there are many other parses with the same score, suggesting a need for refinement, both to improve performance and to avoid errors in related circumstances when the correct parse does not \"float\" to the top.",
        "(c) No parse is returned for an input, because of imposed space constraints, which indirectly control the amount of time that can be spent to obtain a parse.",
        "In some cases the above problems can be solved by adjusting the base grammar, or by extending lexical information to obtain the appropriate preferences.",
        "For example, the preference scoring problems of Figure 1 can be corrected by adding sub-categorization information, as described above.",
        "In other cases, one or more modifications to the preference system are made, adding positive tests to better distinguish best parses, adding negative tests to disprefer incorrect parses, and/or refining existing tests to narrow or expand applicability.",
        "Positive tests often just give credit to expected structures not previously considered to require recognition beyond acceptance by the grammar.",
        "Negative tests fall into many classes, such as: (a) Tests for \"ungrammatical\" phenomena that should not be ruled out entirely by the grammar.",
        "These include lack of agreement, lack of expected punctuation, and presence of unexpected punctuation (such as a comma between a subject and a verb when there is no comma within the subject).",
        "(b) Tests for probably incomplete constituents, based on the chunk types that follow them.",
        "(c) Tests for unexpected arguments, except in some circumstances.",
        "For example, \"benefac-tive\" indirect objects (\"John baked Mary a cake\") are dispreferred if they are not in appropriate semantic classes.",
        "Also, a large, complex collection of positive and negative tests, based on syntactic and semantic factors, are used to distinguish among coordinated and appositive readings, and among alternative attachments of appositives.",
        "If the addition or modification of preference tests does not solve a particular problem, then some more basic changes can be made, such as the introduction of new semantic classes.",
        "And, in rare cases, new features are added to output network states in order to make properties of non-head constituents encountered along a path available for testing both further along the path and in the development of higher-level constituents.",
        "An example is the person and number of syntactic subjects, allowing contexted preference tests for finite verb phrases to check for subject consistency.",
        "To illustrate the relationship between the above symbolic training method for preference scoring and corpus-based methods, perhaps the easiest way is to compare it to an adaptation (Collins and Roark, 2004) of the perceptron training method to the problem of obtaining a best parse (either directly, or for parse reranking), because the two methods are analogous in a number of ways.",
        "The basic adapted perceptron training assumes a generator function producing parses for inputs.",
        "Each such parse is associated with a vector of feature values that express the number of times the feature appears in the input or parse.",
        "The features used are those identified by Roark (2001) for a top-down stochastic parser.",
        "The training method obtains a weight vector W (initially 0) for the feature values, by iterating multiple times over pairs <xi, yi> where xi is a training input, and yi is the correct parse for xi.",
        "For each pair, the best current parse zi for xi produced by the generator, with feature value vector V(zi), is selected based on the current value of (W â¢ V(zi)).",
        "Then if zi 4 yi, W is incremented by V(yi), and decremented by V(zi).",
        "After training, the weights in W are divided by the number of training steps (# inputs * # iterations).",
        "The method is analogous to the RH manual training process for preference in a number of ways.",
        "First, the features used were developed for suitability to a top-down parser, for example taking into account superordinate categories at several levels, some lexical information associated with non-head, left-side siblings of a node, and some right-hand lookahead.",
        "Although only one superordinate category is routinely used in RH preference tests, in order to allow caching of output networks for a category, the preference system allows for and occasionally uses the promotion of non-head features of nested constituents to provide similar capability.",
        "Also, the feature weights obtained by the per-ceptron training method can be seen to focus on patterns that actually matter in distinguishing correct from incorrect parses, as does RH preference training.",
        "Intuitively, the difference is that while symbolic training for RH explicitly pinpoints patterns that distinguish among parses, the perceptron training method accomplishes something similar by postulating some more general features as negative or positive based on particular examples, but allowing the iterations over a large training set to filter out potentially indicative patterns that do not actually serve as such.",
        "These analogies highlight the fact that preference system training, whether symbolic or corpus-based, is ultimately an empirical engineering exercise."
