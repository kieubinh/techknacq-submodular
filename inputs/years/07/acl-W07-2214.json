        "Computational linguistis have explored adding crossing dependency and discontinuous constituency, i.e. a structural context sensitivity (Seki et al., 1991; Vijay-Shankeretal., 1987; Stabler, 1996).",
        "Research considering the combination of two dimensions ofexpressing contextsensitivityhave been sparse, e.g. (Becker et al., 1991), with research dedicated to this topic virtually nonexistent.",
        "Natural languages are not well expressed by either form of context sensitivity alone.",
        "For example, in Table 1, sentences 1-8 are valid, but 9, 10 are invalid constructions of Norwegian.",
        "In addition to the crossing dependency between the determiner and adverb phrase, this example can be described by either",

        "In other words, the two structurally context sensitive components (due to the crossing dependency between them) can be shuffled arbitrarily, leading to concurrent context sensitivity.",
