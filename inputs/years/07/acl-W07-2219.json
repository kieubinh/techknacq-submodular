        "In Semitic languages, where arguments may move around rather freely and phrase-structures are often shallow, there are additional morphological factors that govern the generation process.",
        "Here we propose that agreement features percolated up the parse-tree form a third dimension of parametrization that is orthogonal to the previous two.",
        "This dimension differs from mere \"state-splits\" as it applies to a whole set of categories rather than to individual ones and encodes linguistically motivated co-occurrences between them.",
        "This paper presents extensive experiments with extensions of unlexicalized PCFGs for parsing Modern Hebrew in which tuning the parameters in three dimensions gradually leads to improved performance.",
        "Our best result introduces a new, stronger, lower bound on the performance of treebank grammars for parsing Modern Hebrew, and is on a par with current results for parsing Modern Standard Arabic obtained by a fully lexicalized parser trained on a much larger treebank.",
        "Probabilistic Context Free Grammars (PCFGs) are the formal backbone of most high-accuracy statistical parsers for English, and a variety of techniques was developed to enhance their performance relative to the naive treebank implementation – from unlexicalized extensions exploiting simple category splits (Johnson, 1998; Klein and Manning, 2003) to fully lexicalized parsers that condition events below a constituent upon the head and additional lexical content (Collins, 2003; Charniak, 1997).",
        "While it is clear that conditioning on lexical content improves the grammar's disambiguation capabilities, Klein and Manning (2003) demonstrate that a well-crafted unlexicalized PCFG can close the gap, to a large extent, with current state-of-the-art lexicalized parsers for English.",
        "The factor that sets apart vanilla PCFGs (Char-niak, 1996) from their unlexicalized extensions proposed by, e.g., (Johnson, 1998; Klein and Manning, 2003), is the choice for statistical parametrization that weakens the independence assumptions implicit in the treebank grammar.",
        "Studies on accurate unlex-icalized parsing models outline two dimensions of parametrization.",
        "The first, proposed by (Johnson, 1998), is the annotation of parental history, and the second encodes a head-outward generation process (Collins, 2003).",
        "Johnson (1998) augments node labels with the label of their parent, thus incorporating a dependency on the node's grandparent.",

        "By varying the value of the parameters along the grid, Klein and Manning (2003) tune their treebank grammar to achieve improved performance.",
        "This two-dimensional parametrization has been instrumental in devising parsing models that improve disambiguation capabilities for English as well as other languages, such as German (Dubey and Keller, 2003) Czech (Collins et al., 1999) and Chinese (Bikel and Chiang, 2000).",
        "However, accuracy results for parsing languages other than English still lag behind.",
        "We propose that for various languages including the Semitic family, e.g. Modern Hebrew (MH) and Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), a third dimension of parametrization is necessary for encoding linguistic information relevant for breaking false independence assumptions.",
        "In Semitic languages, arguments may move around rather freely and the phrase-structure of clause-level categories is often shallow.",
        "For such languages agreement features play a role in disambiguation at least as important as the vertical and horizontal conditioning.",
        "We propose a third dimension of parameterizations that encodes morphological features such as those realizing syntactic agreement.",
        "These features are percolated from surface forms in a bottom-up fashion and express information that is complementary to the horizontal and vertical generation histories proposed before.",
        "Such morphological information refines syntactic categories based on their morpho-syntactic role, and captures linguistically motivated co-occurrences and dependencies manifested via, e.g., morpho-syntactic agreement.",

        "We present extensive experiments that gradually lead to improved performance as we extend the degree to which the three dimensions are exploited.",
        "Our best model uses all three dimensions of parametrization, and our best result is on a par with those achieved for MSA using a fully lexicalized parser and a much larger treebank.",

        "Within the noun phrase constituents, however, determiners always precede nouns.",

        "Figure 1 also shows that agreement features help to reveal such relations between higher levels of constituents as well.",
        "Determining the child constituents that contribute each of the features is not a trivial matter either.",
        "To illustrate the extent and the complexity of that matter let us consider definiteness in MH, which is morphologically marked (as an h prefix to the stem, glossed here explicitly as \"the-\") and behaves as a syntactic property (Danon, 2001).",
        "Definite noun-phrases exhibit agreement with other modifying phrases, and such agreement helps to determine the internal structure, labels, and the correct level of attachment as illustrated in figure 2.",
        "The agreement on definiteness helps to determine the internal structure ofnoun phrases 2(a), and the absence thereof helps in determining the attachment to predicates in verb-less sentences, as in 2(b).",
        "Finally, definiteness may be percolated from a different form than the one determining the gender and number of a phrase.",

        "(The direction of head-dependencies in MH typically coincides with that of percolating gender.)",
        "To summarize, agreement features are helpful in analyzing and disambiguating syntactic structures in MH, not only at the lexical level, but also at higher levels of constituency.",
        "In MH, features percolated from different surface forms jointly determine the features of higher-level constituents, and such features manifest multiple dependencies, which in turn cannot be collapsed onto a single head.",
        "The annotation scheme of version 2.0 of the MH treebank (Sima'an et al., 2001) aims to capture the morphological and syntactic properties of MH just described.",
        "This results in several aspects that distinguish the MH treebank from, e.g., the WSJ Penn treebank annotation scheme (Marcus et al., 1994).",
        "The MH treebank is built over word segments.",
        "This means that the yields of the syntactic trees do not correspond to space delimited words but rather to morphological segments that carry distinct syntactic roles, i.e., each segment corresponds to a single POS tag.",
        "(This in turn means that prefixes marking determiners, relativizers, prepositions and definite articles are segmented away and appear as leaves in a syntactic parse tree.)",
        "The POS categories assigned to segmented words are decorated with features such as gender, number, person and tense, and these features are percolated higher up the tree according to predefined syntactic dependencies (Kry-molowski et al., 2007).",
        "Since agreement features of non-terminal constituents may be contributed by more than one child, the annotation scheme defines multiple dependency labels that guide the percolation of the different features higher up the tree.",
        "Definiteness in the MH treebank is treated as a segment at the POS tags level and as a feature at the level of non-terminals.",
        "As any other feature, it is percolated higher up the tree according to marked dependency labels.",
        "Table 1 lists the features and values annotated on top of syntactic categories and table 2 describes the dependencies according to which these features are percolated from child constituents to their parents.",

        "The MH treebank scheme also features null elements that mark traces and additional labels that mark functional features (e.g., SBJ,OBJ) which we strip off and ignore throughout this study.",
        "Morphological features percolated up the tree manifest dependencies that are marked locally yet have a global effect.",
        "We propose to learn treebank grammars in which the syntactic categories are augmented with morphological features at all levels of the hierarchy.",

        "This setup is more appropriate for using general-purpose parsing tools and it makes our results comparable to studies in other languages.",
        "Transliterate The lexical items (leaves) in the MH treebank are written left-to-write and are encoded in utf8.",

        "The treebank provided by the knowledge center does not define unique heads, but rather, mark multiple dependencies for some categories and none for others.",

        "We used two versions of Markovization, one which conditions only on the head and a distance function, and another which conditions also on immediately neighboring sister(s).",
        "Decorate Our software implements an additional general transform which selects the features that are to be annotated on top of syntactic categories to implement various parametrization decisions.",

        "We transform the treebank trees based on various points in the (to, v, d) two-dimensional space to evaluate the performance of the resulting PCFG extensions.",
        "Table 5 reports the accuracy results for all models on section 0 (devset) of the treebank.",
        "The accuracy results for the vanilla PCFG are approximately 10% lower than reported by (Charniak, 1996) for English demonstrating that parsing MH using the currently available treebank is a harder task.",
        "For all unlexical-ized extensions learned from the transfromed treebanks, the resulting grammars show enhanced disambiguation capabilities and improved parsing accuracy.",

        "A qualitative error analysis reveals that parent annotation strategy distinguishes effectively various kinds of distributions clustered together under a single category.",
        "For example, S categories that appear under TOP tend to be more flat than S categories appearing under SBAR (SBAR clauses typically generate a non-finite VP node under which additional PP modifiers can be attached).",
        "Orthogonal morphological marking provide additional information that is indicative of the kind of dependencies that exist between a category and its various child constituents, and we see that the d dimension instantiated with definiteness not only contribute more than 2% to the overall parsing accuracy of a vanilla PCFG, but also contributes as much to the improvement obtained from a treebank already annotated with the vertical dimension.",
        "The contributions are thus additive providing preliminary empirical support to our claim that these two dimensions provide information that is complementary.",
        "In our next set of experiments we evaluate the contribution of the depth dimension to extensions of the head-driven unlexicalized variety a la (Collins, 2003).",
        "We set our baseline at the (0,0,0) coordinate and evaluate models that combine one, two and three dimensions of parametrization.",
        "Table 6 shows the accuracy results for parsing section 0 using the resulting models.",
        "The first outcome of these experiments is that our new baseline improves on the accuracy results of a simple treebank PCFG.",
        "This result indicates that head-dependencies which play a role in determining grammatical structures in English are also instrumental for parsing MH.",
        "However, the marginal contribution of the head-driven variation is surprisingly low.",
        "Next we observe that for one-dimensional models the vertical dimension still contributes the most to parsing accuracy.",
        "However, morphological information represented by the depth dimension contributes more to parsing accuracy than information concerning immediately preceding sisters on the horizontal dimension.",
        "This outcome is consistent with our observation that the grammar of MH puts less significance on the position of constituents relative to one others and that morphological information is more indicative of the kind of syntactic relations that appear between them.",
        "For two-dimensional models, incorporating the depth dimension (orthogonal morphological marking) is better than not doing so, and relying solely on horizontal/vertical parameters performs slightly worse than the vertical/depth combination.",
        "The best performing model for two-dimensional head-driven extensions is the one combining vertical history and morphological depth.",
        "This is again consistent with the properties of MH highlighted in section 2 – parental information gives cues about the possible expansion on the current node, and morphological information indicates possible interrelation between child constituents that may be generated in a flexible order.",
        "Our second set of experiments shows that a three-dimensional annotation strategy strikes the best balance between bias and variance and achieves the best accuracy results among all models.",
        "Different dimensions provide different sorts of information which are complementary, resulting in a model that is capable of generalizing better.",
        "The total error reduction from a plain PCFG is more than 20%, and our best result is on a par with those achieved for other languages (e.g., 75% for MSA).",

        "The MH treebank (Sima'an et al., 2001), a morphologically and syntactically annotated corpus, has been successfully used for various NLP tasks such as morphological disambiguation, POS tagging (Bar-Haim et al., 2007) and NP chunking (Goldberg et al., 2006).",
        "However its use for statistical parsing has been more scarce and less successful.",
        "The only previous studies attempting to parse MH we know of are (Sima'an et al., 2001), applying a variation of the DOP tree-gram model to 500 sentences, and (Tsar-faty, 2006), using a treebank PCFG in an integrated system for morphological and syntactic disambiguation.",
        "The adaptation of state-of-the-art parsing models to MH is not immediate as the flat variable structures of phrases are hard to parse and a plentiful of morphological features that would facilitate disambiguation are not exploited by currently available parsers.",
        "Also, the MH treebank is much smaller than the ones for, e.g., English (Marcus et al., 1994) and Arabic (Maamouri and Bies, 2004), making it hard to apply data-intensive methods such as the all-subtrees approach (Bod, 1992) or full lexicalization (Collins, 2003).",
        "Our best performing model incorporates three dimensions of parametrization and our best result (75.25%) is similar to the one obtained by the parser of (Bikel, 2004) for Modern Standard Arabic (75%) using a fully lexicalized model and a training corpus about three times as large as our newest MH treebank.",
        "This work has shown that devising an adequate baseline for parsing MH requires more than simple category-splits and sophisticated head-driven extensions, and our results provide preliminary evidence for the variation in performance of different parametrization strategies relative to the properties and structure of a given language.",
        "The comparison with parsing accuracy for MSA suggests that parametrizing an orthogonal depth dimension may be able to compensate, to some extent, on the lack of sister-dependencies, lexical information, and perhaps even the lack of annotated data, but establishing empirically its contribution to parsing MSA is a matter for further research.",

        "Morphologically rich languages introduce a new dimension into the expansion possibilities of a nonterminal node in a syntactic parse tree.",
        "This dimension is orthogonal to the vertical (Collins, 2003) and horizontal (Johnson, 1998) dimensions previously outlined by Klein and Manning (2003), and it cannot be collapsed into any one of the previous two.",
        "These additional dependencies exist alongside the syntactic head dependency and are attested using morphosyntactic phenomena such as long distance agreement.",
        "We demonstrate using syntactic definiteness in MH that incorporating morphologically marked features as a third, orthogonal dimension for annotating syntactic categories is invaluable for weakening the independence assumptions implicit in a treebank PCFG and increasing the model's disambiguation capabilities.",
        "Using a three-dimensional model we establish a new, stronger, lower bound on the performance of unlexicalized parsing models for Modern Hebrew, comparable to those achieved for other languages (Czech, Chinese, German and Arabic) with much larger corpora.",
        "Tuning the dimensions and value of the parameters for learning treebank grammars is largely an empirical matter, and we do not wish to claim here that a three-dimensional annotation strategy is the best for any given language.",
        "Rather, we argue that for different languages different optimal parametrization strategies may apply.",
        "MH is not a free-wordorder language in the canonical sense, and our qualitative analysis shows that all dimensions contribute to the models' disambiguation capabilities.",
        "Orthogonal dimensions provide complementary information that is invaluable for the parsing process to the extent that the relevant linguistic phenomena license grammatical structures in the language.",
        "Our results point out a principled way to quantitatively characterizing differences between languages, thus guiding the selection of parameters for the development of annotated resources, custom parsers and cross-linguistic robust parsing engines.",
