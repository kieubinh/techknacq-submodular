        "Addressing the task of acquiring semantic relations between events from a large corpus, we first argue the complementarity between the pattern-based relation-oriented approach and the anchor-based argument-oriented approach.",
        "We then propose a two-phased approach, which first uses lexico-syntactic patterns to acquire predicate pairs and then uses two types of anchors to identify shared arguments.",
        "The present results of our empirical evaluation on a large-scale Japanese Web corpus have shown that (a) the anchor-based filtering extensively improves the accuracy of predicate pair acquisition, (b) the two types of anchors are almost equally contributive and combining them improves recall without losing accuracy, and (c) the anchor-based method also achieves high accuracy in shared argument identification."

        "The growing interest in practical NLP applications such as question answering, information extraction and multi-document summarization places increasing demands on the processing of relations between textual fragments such as entailment and causal relations.",
        "Such applications often need to rely on a large amount of lexical semantic knowledge.",
        "For example, a causal (and entailment) relation holds between the verb phrases wash something and something is clean, which reflects the commonsense notion that if someone has washed something, this object is clean as a result of the washing event.",
        "A crucial issue is how to obtain and maintain a potentially huge collection of such event relation instances.",
        "This paper addresses the issue of how to automatically acquire such instances of relations between events (henceforth, event relation instances) from a large-scale text collection.",
        "Motivated by this issue, several research groups have reported their experiments on automatic acquisition of causal, temporal and entailment relations between event expressions (typically verbs or verb phrases) (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Inui et al., 2003; Chklovski and Pantel, 2005; Torisawa, 2006; Pekar, 2006; Zanzotto et al., 2006; Abe et al., 2008, etc.).",
        "As we explain below, however, none of these studies fully achieves the goal we pursue in this paper.",
        "An important aspect to consider in event relation acquisition is that each event has arguments.",
        "For example, the causal relation between wash something and something is clean can be represented naturally as:",
        "where X is a logical variable denoting that the filler of the object slot of the wash event should be shared (i.e. identical) with the filler of the subject slot of the is-dean event.",
        "To be more general, an instance of a given relation R can be represented as:",
        "where predi is a natural language predicate, typically a verb or adjective, and X is a logical variable denoting which argument of one predicate and which argument of the other are shared.",
        "The goal we pursue in this paper is therefore not only (a) to find predicate pairs that are of a given relation type, but also (b) to identify the arguments shared between the predicates if any.",
        "We call the former subtask predicate pair acquisition and the latter shared argument identification.",
        "As we review in the next section, however, existing state-of-the-art methods for event relation acquisition are designed to achieve only either of these two subtasks but not both.",
        "In this paper, we propose a two-phased method, which first uses lexico-syntactic patterns to acquire predicate pairs for a given relation type and then uses two kinds of anchors to identify shared arguments."

        "Existing methods for event relation acquisition can be classified into two approaches, which we call the pattern-based approach and anchor-based approach in this paper.",
        "The common idea behind the pattern-based approach is to use a small number of manually selected generic lexico-syntactic co-occurrence patterns (LSPs or simply patterns).",
        "Perhaps the simplest way of using LSPs for event relation acquisition can be seen in the method Chklovski and Pantel (2005) employ to develop their knowledge resource called VerbOcean.",
        "Their method uses a small number of manually selected generic LSPs such as to (Verb-X) and then (Verb-Y) to obtain six types of semantic relations including strength (e.g. taint - poison) and happens-before (e.g. marry - divorce).",
        "The use of such generic patterns, however, tends to be high recall but low precision.",
        "Chklovski and Pantel (2005), for example, report that their method obtains about 29,000 verb pairs with 65.5% precision.",
        "This low-precision problem requires an additional component for pruning extracted relations.",
        "This issue has been addressed from a variety of angles.",
        "For example, some devise heuristic statistical scores and report their impact on precision (Chklovski and Pantel, 2005; Torisawa, 2006; Zanzotto et al., 2006).",
        "Another way is to incorporate a classifier trained with supervision.",
        "Inui et al.",
        "(2003), for example, use a lapanese generic causal connective marker tame (because) and a supervised classifier learner to separately obtain four types of causal relations: cause, precondition, effect and means.",
        "More recently, Abe et al.",
        "(2008) propose to extend Pantel and Pennacchiotti (2006)'s Espresso algorithm, which induces specific reliable LSPs in a bootstrapping manner for entity-entity relation extraction, so that the extended algorithm can apply to event relations.",
        "Their method learns a large number of relatively specific patterns such as cannot (find out (something)) due to the lack of (investigation) in a bootstrapping fashion, which produces a remarkable improvement on precision.",
        "The anchor-based approach, on the other hand, has emerged mainly in the context of paraphrase and entailment acquisition.",
        "This approach uses information of argument fillers (i.e. anchors) of each event expression as a useful clue for identifying event relations.",
        "A popular way of using such argument information relies on the distributional hypothesis (Harris, 1968) and identifies synonymous event expressions by seeking a set of event expressions whose argument fillers have a similar distribution.",
        "Such algorithms as DIRT (Lin and Pantel, 2001) and TE/ASE (Szpektor et al., 2004) represent this line of research.",
        "Another way of using argument information is proposed by Pekar (2006), which identifies candidate verb pairs for the entailment relation by imposing criteria: (a) the two verbs must appear in the same local discourse-related context and (b) their arguments need to refer to the same participant, i.e. anchor.",
        "For example, if a pair of clauses Mary bought a house, and The house belongs to Mary, appear in a single local discourse-related context, two pairs of verbs, buy{ob'y.X) -belong(suby.X) and buy(suby.X) - belong(to:X) are identified as candidate entailment pairs.",
        "It is by now clear that the above two approaches, which apparently have emerged somewhat independently, could play a complementary role with each other.",
        "Pattern-based methods, on the one hand, are designed to be capable of discriminating relatively fine-grained relation types.",
        "For example, the patterns used by Chklovski and Pantel (2005) identify six relation types, while Abe et al.",
        "(2008) identify two of the four causal relation types defined by Inui et al.",
        "(2003).",
        "However, these methods are severely limited for the purpose of shared argument identification because lexico-syntactic patterns are not a good indication of argument-shared structure in general.",
        "The anchor-based approach, on the other hand, works well for identifying shared arguments simply because it relies on argument information in identifying synonymous or entailment verb pairs.",
        "However, it has no direct means to discriminate more fine-grained specific relations such as causality and backward presupposition.",
        "To sum up, the pattern-based approach tends to be rather relation-oriented while the anchor-based approach tends to be argument-oriented.",
        "In spite of this complementarity, however, to our best knowledge, the issue of how to benefit from both approaches has never been paid enough attention.",
        "An interesting exception could be found in Torisawa (2006)'s method of combining verb pairs extracted with a highly generic connective pattern (Verb-X) and (Verb-Y) together with the co-occurrence statistics between verbs and their arguments.",
        "While the reported results for inference rules with temporal ordering look promising, it is not clear yet, however, whether the method applies to other types of relations because it relies on relation-specific heuristics."

        "As an example, let us consider discourse (2a) in Figure 1.",

        "In such a case, we assume the two breads refer to the same object, namely anchor, and the subject of burn and the object of bake are shared with each other.",

        "To summarize so far, the pattern-based method we adopted in the experiment generated a substantial number of predicate pairs with a accuracy comparative to the state of the art.",
        "The accuracy was, however, further boosted by applying both instance-based and type-based anchors.",
        "This effect is particularly important because, to our best knowledge, very few pattern-based relation acquisition models have been reported to achieve as high a accuracy as what we achieved.",
        "In the case of our pattern-based model, for reference, the 254 highly ranked pairs of the 400 samples included only 185 correct pairs, which is worse than the 206 pairs covered by anchors for both accuracy and recall (see the \"top-N\" column under \"LSPs\" in Table 2.",
        "This difference also leads us to consider incorporating our anchor-based filtering into the bootstrapping cycles of pattern-based predicate pair acquisition.",
        "We next investigated the accuracy of shared argument identification.",
        "For each of the aforementioned predicate pairs covered by anchors (the 254 pairs for action-effect and 254 for action-means), we asked the same two annotators as above to judge the correctness of the shared argument information.",
        "The results of combination are shown in Table 3.",
        "\"arg-strict\" shows the results of the strict judgments where the shared argument was considered to be correctly identified only when the most frequent argument pair was judged correct, while \"arg-lenient\" shows the results of the lenient judgments where the shared argument was considered to be correctly identified when either of the three most frequent argument pairs was judged correct.",
        "For judging the correctness of an argument pair, we had three degrees of strictness.",
        "In the most strict criterion (\"anc-strict\"), an argument pair was judged correct only when its maximally three anchor words were all correct, while in \"anc-lenient\", an argument pair was judged correct when any of the three most frequent anchor words was correct.",
        "In \"anc-any\", an argument pair was judged correct as far as an annotator could think of any appropriate anchor word for it.",
        "While the inter-annotator agreement was not very high, with the kappa coefficient in the \"arg-strict\" and \"anc-any\" setting 0.47 for action-effect and 0.42 for action-effect), one was again consistently more tolerant than the other.",
        "For the same reason as argued in 4.2.1, we considered an acquired relation correct only if both annotators judged it correct.",
        "In this experiment, predicate pairs that had been judged wrong with respect to relation types were all considered wrong in all the settings.",
        "The upper bounds of accuracy, therefore, are given by those in Table 2.",
        "For \"arg-*\" with the \"combined\" anchors, for example, the upper bound of accuracy is 0.81.",
        "Since \"arg-lenient\" with \"combined\" and \"anc-lenient\" achieved 0.76 accuracy, our method turned out to be reasonably precise in identifying argument pairs and their fillers.",
        "Paying attention to \"arg-strict\" and \"anc-strict\", on the other hand, one can see a considerable drop from the lenient case, which needs to be further investigated."

        "Motivated by the complementarity between the pattern-based relation-oriented approach and the anchor-based argument-oriented approach to event relation acquisition, we have explored a two-phased approach, which first uses patterns to acquire predicate pairs and then uses two types of anchors to identify shared arguments, reporting on the present results of our empirical evaluation.",
        "The results have shown that (a) the anchor-based filtering extensively improves the accuracy of predicate pair acquisition, (b) the instance-based and type-based anchors are almost equally contributive and combining them improves recall without losing accuracy, and (c) the anchor-based method also achieves high accuracy in shared argument identification.",
