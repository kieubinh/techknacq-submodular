        "In many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks we find that a large collection of manually-annotated text is used to train and test supervised machine learning models.",
        "While these models have been shown to perform very well when tested on the text collection related to the training data (what we call the source domain), the performance drops considerably when testing on text from other domains (called target domains).",
        "In order to build models that perform well in new (target) domains we usually find two settings (Daumé III, 2007): In the semi-supervised setting the goal is to improve the system trained on the source domain using unlabeled data from the target domain, and the baseline is that of the system trained on the source domain.",
        "In the supervised setting, training data from both source and target domains are used, and the baseline is provided by the system trained on the target domain.",
        "The semi-supervised setting is the most attractive, as it would save developers the need to hand-annotate target corpora every time a new domain is to be processed.",
        "The main goal of this paper is to use unlabeled data in order to get better domain-adaptation results for Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) in the semi-supervised setting.",
        "Singular Value Decomposition (svd) has been shown to find correlations between terms which are helpful to overcome the scarcity of training data in WSD (Gliozzo et al., 2005).",
        "This paper explores how this ability of svd can be applied to the domain-adaptation of WSD systems, and we show that svd and unlabeled data improve the results of two state-of-the-art WSD systems (fc-nn and svm).",
        "For the sake of this paper we call this set of experiments the domain adaptation scenario.",
        "In addition, we also perform some related experiments on just the target domain.",
        "We use unlabeled data in order to improve the results of a system trained and tested in the target domain.",
        "These results are complementary to the domain adaptation experiments, and also provide an upperbound for semi-supervised domain adaptation.",
        "We call these experiments the target domain scenario.",
        "Note that both scenarios are semi-supervised, in that our focus is on the use of unlabeled data in addition to the available labeled data.",
        "The experiments were performed on a publicly available corpus which was designed to study the effect of domain in WSD (Koeling et al., 2005).",
        "It comprises 41 nouns closely related to the Sports and finances domains with 300 examples for each.",
        "The 300 examples were drawn from the British National Corpus (Leech, 1992) (Bnc), the Sports section of the Reuters corpus (Leech, 1992), and the Finances section of Reuters in equal number.",

        "Syntactic dependencies use the object, subject, noun-modifier, preposition, and sibling lemmas, when available.",

        "The fact that we attain robustness rather than domain adaptation proper deserves some analysis.",
        "In the domain adaptation scenario only source unlabeled data helped, but the results on the target scenario show that it is the target unlabeled data which is helping, and not the source one.",
        "Given that svd basically finds correlations among features, it seems that constructing the term-by-document (or feature-by-example) matrix with the training data and the unlabeled corpus related to the training data is the key factor in play here.",
        "The reasons for this can be traced back as follows.",
        "Our source corpus is the bnc, which is a balanced corpus containing a variety of genres and domains.",
        "The 100 examples for each word that have been hand-tagged were gathered at random, and thus cover several domains.",
        "For instance, the omt strategy for building the matrix extracts hundreds of other examples from the bnc, and when svd collapses the features into a reduced space, it effectively captures the most important correlations in the feature-by-example matrix.",
        "When faced with examples from a new domain, the reduced matrix is able to map some of the features found in the test example to those in the train example.",
        "Such overlap is more difficult if only 100 examples from the source domain are available.",

        "The newly found correlations come at the price of possibly ignoring effective original features, causing information loss.",
        "Only when the correlations found in the reduced space outweigh this information loss do we get better performance on the reduced space than in the original space.",
        "The experiment in Section 6 is important in that it shows that the improvement is much smaller and only significant in the target domain scenario, which is in accordance with the hypothesis above.",
        "This information loss is a motivation for the combination of the features from the reduced space with the original features, which will be the focus of our future work.",

        "The target scenario results confirm this trend, as fc-nn-omt is superior to fc-nn-sma in both domains.",
        "These results are in accordance with our previous experience on WSD (Agirre et al., 2005), where our omt method got better results than sma and those of (Gliozzo et al., 2005) (who also use a method similar to sma) on the Senseval-3 lexical sample.",
        "While omt reduces the feature-by-example matrix of each target word, sma reduces a single term-by-document matrix.",
        "sma is able to find important correlations among similar terms in the corpus, but it misses the rich feature set used by WSD systems, as it focuses on bag-of-words alone, omt on the other hand is able to find correlations between all features which are relevant to the target word only."

        "In this paper we explore robustness and domain adaptation issues for Word Sense Disambiguation using svd and unlabeled data.",
        "We focus on the semi-supervised scenario, where we train on the source corpus (Bnc), test on two target corpora (Sports and Finances sections of Reuters), and improve the results using unlabeled data.",
        "Our method yields up to 16.3% error reduction compared to svm and fc-nn on the labeled data alone, showing the first positive results on domain adaptation for WSD.",
        "In fact, we show that our results are due to the use of a large, general, unlabeled corpus, and rather than domain-adaptation proper we show robustness in face of a domain shift.",
        "This kind of robustness is even more cost-effective than semi-supervised domain adaptation, as it does not require large unlabeled corpora and repeating the computations for each new target domain.",
        "This paper shows that the omt technique to apply svd that we proposed in (Agirre et al., 2005) compares favorably to sma, which has been previously used in (Gliozzo et al., 2005), and that fc-nn excels svm on the features from the reduced space.",
        "We also show that the unlabeled data needs to be related to the training data, and that the benefits of our method are larger when faced with a domain shift (compared to test data coming from the same domain as the training data).",
        "In the future, we plan to combine the features from the reduced space with the rest of features, either using a combination of fc-nn classifiers (Agirre et al., 2005; Agirre and Lopez de Lacalle, 2007) or a complex kernel (Gliozzo et al., 2005).",
