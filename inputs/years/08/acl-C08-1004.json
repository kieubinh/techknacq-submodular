        "Document classification is one of the key technologies in the emerging digital world: as the amount of textual information existing in electronic form increases exponentially, reliable automatic methods to sift through the haystack and pluck out the occasional needle are almost a necessity.",
        "Previous comparative studies of different classifiers (for example, (Yang and Liu, 1999; Joachims, 1998; Rennie et al., 2003; Dumais et al., 1998)) have consistently shown linear Support Vector Machines to be the most appropriate method.",
        "Generative probabilistic classifiers, often represented by the multinomial classifier, have in these same studies performed poorly, and this empirical evidence has been bolstered by theoretical arguments (Lasserre et al., 2006).",
        "In this paper we revisit the theme of generative classifiers for mutually exclusive classification problems, but consider classifiers employing more complex models of language; as a starting point we consider recent work (Madsen et al., 2005) which relaxes some of the multinomial assumptions.",
        "We continue and expand upon the theme of that work, but identify some weaknesses both in its theoretical motivations and practical applications.",
        "We demonstrate a new approximate model which overcomes some of these concerns, and demonstrate substantial improvements that such a model achieves on four classification tasks, three of which are standard and one of which is a newly created task.",
        "We also show the new model to be highly competitive to an SVM where the previous models are not.",
        "§2 of the paper describes previous work which has sought a probabilistic model of language and its application to document classification.",
        "§3 describes the models we consider in this paper, and gives details of parameter estimation.",
        "§4 describes our evaluation of the models, and §5 presents the results of this evaluation.",
        "§6 explores reasons for the observed results, and finally §7 ends with some concluding remarks."

        "The problem of finding an appropriate and tractable model for language is one which has been studied in many different areas.",
        "In many cases, the first (and often only) model is one in which counts of words are modelled as binomial-or Poisson-distributed random variables.",
        "However, the use of such distributions entails an implicit assumption that the occurrence of words is the result of a fixed number of independent trials – draws from a \"bag of words\" – where on each trial the probability of success is constant.",
        "Several authors, among them (Church and Gale, 1995; Katz, 1996), observe empirically such models are not always accurate predictors of actual word behaviour.",
        "This moves them to suggest distributions for word counts where the underlying probability varies between documents; thus the expected behaviour of a word in a new document is a combination of predictions for all possible probabilities.",
        "Other authors (Jansche, 2003; Eyhera-mendy et al., 2003; Lowe, 1999) use these same ideas to classify documents on the basis of subsets of vocabulary, in the first and third cases with encouraging results using small subsets (in the second case, the performance of the model is shown to be poor compared to the multinomial).",
        "When one moves to consider counts of all words in some vocabulary, the proper distribution of the whole vector of word counts is multinomial.",
        "(Madsen et al., 2005) apply the same idea as for the single word (binomial) case to the multinomial, using the most convenient form of distribution to represent the way the vector of multinomial probabilities varies between documents, and report encouraging results compared to the simple multinomial.",
        "However, we show that the use of the most mathematically convenient distribution to describe the way the vector of probabilities varies entails some unwarranted and undesirable assumptions.",
        "This paper will first describe those assumptions, and then describe an approximate technique for overcoming the assumptions.",
        "We show that, combined with some alterations to estimation, the models lead to a classifier able to outperform both the multinomial classifier and a linear SVM.",

        "Finally, we make no explicit distinction in notation between univariate and multivariate quantities; however, we use 0j to refer to the j-th component of the vector 6.",
        "We consider documents to be represented as vectors of count-valued random variables such that d = {d\\...dv}.",
        "For classification, interest centres on the conditional distribution of the class variable, given such a document.",
        "Where documents are to be assigned to one class only (as in the case of this paper), this class is judged to be the most probable class.",
        "For generative classifiers such as those considered here, the posterior distribution of interest is modelled from the joint distribution of class and document; thus if c is a variable representing class and d is a vector of word counts, then:",
        "For the purposes of this work we also assume a uniform prior on c, meaning the ultimate decision is on the basis of the document alone.",

        "The multinomial model assumes that documents are the result of repeated trials, where on each trial a word is selected at random, and the probability of selecting the j-th word from class c is 9Cj.",
        "However, in general we will not use the subscript c - we estimate one set of parameters for each possible class.",
        "Using multinomial sampling, the term p(d\\c) has distribution:",

        "In this section, we briefly describe the use of a generative model of language as applied to the problem of document classification, and also how we estimate all relevant parameters for the work which follows.",
        "In terms of notation, we use c to represent a random variable and c to represent an outcome.",
        "We use roman letters for observed or observable quantities and greek letters for unobservables (i.e. parameters).",

        "A simple Bayes estimator for 6 can be obtained by taking the prior for 6 as a Dirichlet distribution, in which case the posterior is also Dirichlet.",
        "Denote the total training data for the class in question as V = {(d\\\\...d\\v)... (dki-.-dkv)} (that is, counts of each of v words in k documents).",

        "We follow common practice and use the standard reference Dirichlet prior, which is uniform on 0, such that ctj = 1 for all j.",
        "In contrast to the model above, a hierarchical sampling model assumes that 0 varies between documents, and has distribution which depends upon parameters rj.",
        "This allows for a more realistic model, letting the probabilities of using words vary between documents subject only to some general trend.",
        "For example, consider documents about politics: some will discuss the current British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown.",
        "In these documents, the probability of using the word brown (assuming case normalisation) may be relatively high.",
        "Other politics articles may discuss US politics, for example, or the UN, French elections, and so on, and these articles may have a much lower probability of using the word brown: perhaps just the occasional reference to the Prime Minister.",
        "A hierarchical model attempts to model the way this probability varies between documents in the politics class.",
        "Starting with the joint distribution p(0, d\\rj) and averaging over all possible values that 0 may take in the new document gives:",
        "where integration is understood to be over the entire range of possible 0.",
        "Intuitively, this allows 0 to vary between documents subject to the restriction that 0 ~ p{0\\rj), and the probability of observing a document is the average of its probability for all possible 0, weighted by p{6\\rj).",
        "The sampling process is 1) 0 is first sampled from p{6\\rj) and then 2) d is sampled from p(d\\0), leading to the hierarchical name for such models.",
        "Dirichlet Compound Multinomial Sampling Model",
        "(Madsen et al., 2005) suggest a form of (4) where p{6\\rj) is Dirichlet-distributed, leading to a Dirichlet-Compound-Multinomial sampling distribution.",
        "The main benefit of this assumption is that the integral of (4) can be obtained in closed form.",
        "Thus p(d\\ct) (using the standard a notation for Dirichlet parameters) has distribution:",
        "Maximum likelihood estimates for the a are difficult to obtain, since the likelihood for a is a function which must be maximised for all components simultaneously, leading some authors to use approximate distributions to improve the tractability of maximum likelihood estimation (Elkan, 2006).",
        "In contrast, we reparameterise the Dirichlet compound multinomial, and estimate some of the parameters in closed form.",
        "We reparameterise the model in terms of p, and A - p, is a vector of length v, and A is a constant which reflects the variance of 0.",
        "Under this parametrisation, ctj = \\iij.",
        "The estimate we use for p,j is simply:",
        "n.",
        "where rij and n, are defined above.",
        "This simply matches the first moment about the mean of the distribution with the first moment about the mean of the sample.",
        "Once again letting:",
        "denote the training data such that the di are individual document vectors and dij are counts of the j'-th word in the i-th document, the likelihood for A is:",
        "This is a one-dimensional function, and as such is much more simple to maximise using standard optimisation techniques, for example as in (Minka, 2000).",
        "As before, however, simple maximum likelihood estimates alone are not sufficient: if a word fails to appear at all in V, the corresponding p,j will be zero, in which case the distribution is improper.",
        "The theoretically sound solution would be to incorporate a prior on either a or (under our parameterisation) 11; however, this would lead to high computational cost as the resulting posterior would be complicated to work with.",
        "(Madsen et al., 2005) instead set each dj as the maximum likelihood estimate plus some e, in some ways echoing the estimation of 9 for the multinomial model.",
        "Unfortunately, unlike a prior this strategy has the same effect regardless of the amount of training data available, whereas any true prior would have diminishing effect as the amount of training data increased.",
        "Instead, we supplement actual training data with a pseudo-document in which every word occurs once (note this is quite different to setting e = 1); this echoes the effect of a true prior on ii, but without the computational burden.",
        "A Joint Beta-Binomial Sampling Model",
        "Despite its apparent convenience and theoretical well-foundedness, the Dirichlet compound multinomial model has one serious drawback, which is emphasised by the reparameterisation.",
        "Under the Dirichlet, there is a functional dependence between the expected value of 0j, iij and its variance, where the relationship is regulated by the constant A.",
        "Thus two words whose iij are the same will also have the same variance in the 0j.",
        "This is of concern since different words have different patterns of use - to use a popular turn of phrase, some words are more \"bursty\" than others (see (Church and Gale, 1995) for examples).",
        "In practice, we may hope to model different words as having the same expected value, but drastically different variances -unfortunately, this is not possible using the Dirichlet model.",
        "The difficulty with switching to a different model is the evaluation of the integral in (4).",
        "The integral is in fact in many thousands of dimensions, and even if it were possible to evaluate such an integral numerically, the process would be exceptionally slow.",
        "We overcome this problem by decomposing the term p(d\\rj) into a product of independent terms of the form p(dj\\r]j).",
        "A natural way for each of these terms to be distributed is to let the probability p(dj\\0j) be binomial and to let p(0j\\r]j) be beta-distributed.",
        "The probability p(d:)■]rjj) (where rjj = {ctj,/3j}, the parameters of the beta distribution) is then:",
        "where B(») is the Beta function.",
        "The term p(d\\rj) is then simply:",
        "This allows means and variances for each of the 0j to be specified separately, but this comes at a price: while the Dirichlet ensures that J2j &j = 1 for all possible 6, the model above does not.",
        "Thus the model is only an approximation to a true model where components of 6 have independent means and variances, and the requirements of the multinomial are fulfilled.",
        "However, given the inflexibility of the Dirichlet multinomial model, we argue that such a sacrifice is justified.",
        "In order to estimate parameters of the Beta-Binomial model, we take a slight departure from both (Lowe, 1999) and (Jansche, 2003) who have both used a similar model previously for individual words.",
        "(Lowe, 1999) uses numerical techniques to find maximum likelihood estimates of the ctj and [3j, which was feasible in that case because of the highly restricted vocabulary and two-classes.",
        "(Jansche, 2003) argues exactly this point, and uses moment-matched estimates; our estimation is similar to that, in that we use moment-matching, but different in other regards.",
        "Conventional parameter estimates are affected (in some way or other) by the likelihood function for a parameter, and the likelihood function is such that longer documents exert a greater influence on the overall likelihood for a parameter.",
        "That is, we note that if the true binomial parameter Oij for the j-th word in the i-th document were known, then the most sensible expected value for the distribution over 9i would be:",
        "Whereas the expected value of conventional method-of-moments estimate is:",
        "That is, a weighted mean of the maximum likelihood estimates of each of the with weights given by p (%), i.e. the length of the i-th document.",
        "Similar effects would be observed by maximising the likelihood function numerically.",
        "This is to our minds undesireable, since we do note believe that longer documents are necessarily more representative of the population of all documents than are shorter ones (indeed, extremely long documents are likeliy to be an oddity), and in any case the goal is to capture variation in the parameters.",
        "This leads us to suggest estimates for parameters such that the expected value of the distribution is as in 10 but with the 9ij (which are unknown) replaced with their maximum likelihood estimates, 9ij.",
        "We then use these estimates to specify the desired variance, leading to the simultaneous equations:",
        "As before, we supplement actual training documents with a pseudo-document in which every word occurs once to prevent any ctj being zero."
