        "Supertagging involves assigning words lexical entries based on a lexicalized grammatical theory, such as Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) (Steedman, 2000) Tree-adjoining Grammar (Joshi, 1988), or Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (Pollard and Sag, 1994).",
        "Supertag sets are larger than part-of-speech (POS) tag sets and their elements are generally far more articulated.",
        "For example, the English verb join has the POS VB and the CCG category ((Sb\\NP)/PP)/NP in CCG-bank (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2007).",
        "This category indicates that join requires a noun phrase to its left, another to its right, and a prepositional phrase to the right of that.",
        "Supertags convey such detailed syntactic sub-categorization information that supertag disambiguation is referred to as almost parsing (Bangalore and Joshi, 1999).",
        "Standard sequence prediction models are highly effective for supertagging, including Hidden Markov Models (Bangalore and Joshi, 1999; Nielsen, 2002), Maximum Entropy Markov Models (Clark, 2002; Hockenmaier et al., 2004; Clark and Curran, 2007), and Conditional Random Fields (Blunsom and Baldwin, 2006).",
        "The original motivation for supertags-parse pre-filtering for lexicalized grammars-of Bangalore and Joshi (1999) has been realized to good effect: the supertagger of Clark and Curran (2007) provides staged n-best lists of multi-tags that dramatically improve parsing speed and coverage without much loss in accuracy.",
        "Espinosa et al.",
        "(2008) have shown that hypertagging (predicting the supertag associated with a logical form) can improve both speed and accuracy of wide-coverage sentence realization with CCG.",
        "Supertags have gained further relevance as they are increasingly used as features for other tasks, including machine translation (Birch et al., 2007; Hassan et al., 2007).",
        "Supertaggers typically rely on a significant amount of carefully annotated sentences.",
        "As with many problems, there is pressing need to find strategies for reducing the amount of supervision required for producing accurate supertaggers, but as yet, no one has explored the use of weak supervision for the task.",
        "In particular, there are many dialog systems which rely on hand-crafted lexicons that both provide a starting point for bootstrapping a supertagger and which could benefit greatly from supertag pre-parse filter.",
        "For example, the dialog system used by Kruijff et al.",
        "(2007) uses a handcrafted CCG grammar for OpenCCG (White and Baldridge, 2003).",
        "It is important to stress that there are many such uses of CCG and related frameworks which do not rely on first annotating (even a small number of) sentences in a corpus: these define a lexicon that maps from words to categories (supertags) for a particular domain/application.",
        "This scenario is a natural fit for learning taggers from tag dictionaries using hidden Markov models with Expectation-Maximization (EM).",
        "Here, 1 investigate such weakly supervised learning for supertagging and demonstrate the importance of proper initialization of the tag transition distributions of the HMM.",
        "In particular, such initialization can be done using inherent properties of the CCG formalism itself regarding how categoriesmay combine.",
        "Informed initialization should help with supertagging for two reasons.",
        "First, categories have structure-lacking in POS tags-waiting to be exploited.",
        "For example, it is far more likely a priori to see the category sequence (S\\NP)/NP NP/N than the sequence S/S NP\\NP.",
        "Given the categories for a word, this information can be used to influence our expectations about categories for adjacent words.",
        "Second, this kind of information truly matters for the task: a key aspect of supertagging that differentiates it from POS tagging is that the contextual information is much more important for the former.",
        "Lexical probabilities handle most of the ambiguity for POS tagging, but supertags are inherently about context and, furthermore, lexical ambiguity is much greater for supertagging, making lexical probabilities less effective.",
        "I start by defining a distribution over lexical categories and then use this distribution as part of creating a CCG-informed transition distribution that appropriately breaks the symmetry of uniform HMM initialization.",
        "After describing how these components are included in the HMM, I describe experiments with CCGbank varying the ambiguity of the lexicon provided.",
        "I show that using knowledge about the formalism consistently improves performance, and is especially important as cate-gorial ambiguity increases."

        "That the simpler category is more prevalent is unsurprising: a general strategy when creating CCG lexicons is to use simpler categories whenever possible.",
        "This points to the possibility of defining distributions over CCG lexicons based on measures of the complexity of categories.",

        "Languages also tend to prefer lexicons with one or the other slash direction predominating (Villavicencio, 2002).",

        "Both produce the same dependencies, guaranteed by the semantic consistency of CCG's rules (Steedman, 2000).",
        "This property of CCG of supporting multiple derivations of the same analysis has been termed spurious ambiguity.",
        "However, the extra constituents are anything but spurious: they are implicated in a range of CCG (along with other forms of categorial grammar) linguistic analyses, including coordination, long-distance extraction, intonation, and incremental processing.",
        "This all boils down to associativity: just as (1 + (4 + 2)) = ((1 + 4) + 2) = 7, CCG ensures that (Ed-(saw-Ted)) = {{Ed-saw)-Ted) = S Such multiple derivations arise when adjacent categories can combine through either application or composition.",

        "On the other hand, Bangalore and Joshi (1999) use constraints that act at greater distances than I have considered here.",
        "For example, if one wishes to provide a word with the category ((S\\NP)/PP)/NP, then there should be a word with a category which results in a PP two or more words to its right - this is something which the bigram transitions considered here cannot capture.",
        "An interesting way to extend the present approach would be to enforce such patterns as posterior constraints during EM (Graca et al., 2007).",
        "Recent work considers a damaged tag dictionary by assuming that tags are known only for words that occur more than once or twice (Toutanova and Johnson, 2007).",
        "A very interesting aspect of this work is that they explicitly model ambiguity classes to exploit commonality in the lexicon between different word forms, which could be even more useful for supertagging.",
        "In a grammar development context, it is often the case that only some of the categories for a word have been assigned.",
        "This is the scenario considered by Haghighi and Klein (2006) for POS tagging: how to construct an accurate tagger given a set of tags and a few example words for each of those tags.",
        "They use distributional similarity of words to define features for tagging that effectively allow such prototype words to stand in for others.",
        "This idea could be used with my approach as well; the most obvious way would be to use prototype words to suggest extra categories (beyond the tag dictionary) for known words and a reduced set of categories for unknown words.",
        "Other work aims to do truly unsupervised learning of taggers, such as Goldwater and Griffiths (2007) and Johnson (2007).",
        "No tag dictionaries are assumed, and the models are parametrized with Dirichlet priors.",
        "The states of these models implicitly represent tags; however, it actually is not clear what the states in such models truly represent: they are (probably interesting) clusters that may or may not correspond to what we normally think of as parts-of-speech.",
        "POS tags are relatively inert, passive elements in a grammar, whereas CCG categories are the very drivers of grammatical analysis.",
        "That is, syntax is projected, quite locally, by lexical categories.",
        "It would thus be interesting to consider the induction of categories with grammar-based priors with such models."

        "I have shown that weakly supervised learning can indeed be used to induce supertaggers from a lexicon mapping words to their possible categories, but that the extra ambiguity in the supertagging task over that of POS tagging makes performance much more sensitive to rare categories that occur in larger, more ambiguous lexicons.",
        "However, I have also shown that the CCG formalism itself can provide the basis for useful distributions over lexical categories and tag transitions in a bitag HMM.",
        "By using these distributions to initialize the HMM, it is possible to improve performance regardless of the underlying ambiguity.",
        "This is especially important for reducing error when the lexicon used for bootstrapping is highly ambiguous and contains very rare categories."
