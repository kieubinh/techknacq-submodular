        "As the linguistic diversity of textual resources increases, and need for access to those resources grows, there is also greater demand for efficient information retrieval (IR) methods which are truly language-independent.",
        "In the ideal but possibly unattainable case, an IR algorithm would produce equally reliable results for any language pair: for example, a query in English would retrieve equally good results in Arabic as in French.",
        "A number of developments in recent years have brought that goal more within reach.",
        "One of the factors that severely hampered early attempts at machine translation, for example, was the lack of available computing power.",
        "However, Moore's Law, the driving force of change in computing since then, has opened the way for recent progress in the field, such as Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) (Koehn et al.",
        "2003).",
        "Even more closely related to the topic of the present paper, implementations of the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) (which is at the heart of LSA), and related algorithms such as PARAFAC2 (Harshman 1972), have become both more widely available and more powerful.",
        "SVD, for example, is available in both commercial off-the-shelf packages and at least one open-source implementation designed to run on a parallel cluster (Heroux et al.",
        "2005).",
        "Despite these advances, there are (as yet) not fully surmounted obstacles to working with certain language pairs, particularly when the languages are not closely related.",
        "This is demonstrated in Chew and Abdelali (2008).",
        "At least in part, this has to do with the lexical statistics of the languages concerned.",
        "For example, because Arabic has a much richer morphological structure than English and French (meaning is varied through the addition of prefixes and suffixes rather than separate terms such as particles), it has a considerably higher type-to-token ratio.",
        "Exactly this type of language-specific statistical variation seems to lead to difficulties for statistics-based techniques such as LSA, as evidenced by lower cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) precision for Arabic/English than for French/English (Chew and Abdelali 2008).",
        "In this paper, we present a strategy for overcoming these difficulties.",
        "In section 2, we outline the basic problem and the thinking behind our approach: that breaking words down into morphemes, or at least morphologically significant subconstituents, should enable greater inter-language comparability.",
        "This in turn should in theory lead to improved CLIR results.",
        "Several alternatives for achieving this are considered in section 3.",
        "One of these, a novel combination of mutual-information-based morphological tokeni-zation (a step beyond simple n-gram tokeniza-tion) and SVD, is what we call LMSA.",
        "Section 4 discusses the framework for testing our intuitions, and the results of these tests are presented and discussed in section 5.",
        "Finally, we draw some conclusions and outline possible directions for future research in section 6."

        "In many approaches to IR, the underlying method is to represent a corpus as a term-by-document matrix in which each row corresponds to a unique term, and each column to a document in the corpus.",
        "The standard LSA framework (Deerwester et al.",
        "1990) is no different, except that the (sparse) term-by-document matrix X is subjected to SVD, where U is a smaller but dense term-by-concept matrix, S is a diagonal matrix of singular values, and V is a dense document-by-concept matrix for the documents used in training.",
        "Effectively, U and V respectively map the terms and documents to a single set of arbitrary concepts, such that semantically related terms or documents (as determined by patterns of co-occurrence) will tend to be similar; similarity is usually measured by taking the cosine between two (term or document) vectors.",
        "New documents can also be projected into the LSA 'semantic space' by multiplying their document vectors (formed in exactly the same way as the columns for X) by the product US-1, to yield document-by-concept vectors.",
        "LSA is a completely unsupervised approach to IR in that associations between terms simply fall out when SVD is applied to the data.",
        "With cross-language or multilingual LSA, the approach differs little from that just outlined.",
        "The only required modification is in the training data: the term-by-document matrix must be formed from a parallel corpus, in which each document is the combination of text from the parallel languages (as described in Berry et al.",
        "1994).",
        "Clearly, this IR model cannot be deployed to any languages not in the parallel corpus used for training SVD.",
        "However, recent work (Chew et al.",
        "2007) shows not only that there is no limit (at least up to a certain point) to the number of languages that can be processed in parallel, but that precision actually increases for given language pairs as more other languages are included.",
        "In practice, the factors which limit the addition of parallel languages are likely to be computational power and the availability of parallel aligned text.",
        "As noted in section 1, the first of these is less and less of an issue; and regarding the second, parallel corpora (which are the mainstay of many current approaches to computational linguistics and IR, particularly in real-world applications) are becoming increasingly available.",
        "Substantially all of the Bible, in particular, is already electronically available in at least 40-50 languages from diverse language families (Biola",
        "University 2005-2006).",
        "Yet, there are clearly variations in how well CLIR works.",
        "In previous results (Chew et al.",
        "in particular that the results for Arabic and Russian (the two most morphologically complex languages for which they present results) are consistently poorer than they are for other languages.",
        "To our knowledge, no solution for this has been proposed and validated.",
        "Ideally, a solution would both make sense theoretically (or linguistically) and be statistics-based rather than rule-based, consistent with the general framework of LSA and other recent developments in the field, such as SMT, and avoiding the need to build a separate grammar for every new language",

        "Some examples illustrating differences between Russian and English in this respect are given in Table 2._ Russian__qmaio__qirraeiiih__hhtniot",
        "The element in Russian, of course, which corresponds to 'read' is the stem 'HHTa', but this is embedded within a larger term.",
        "Hence, in all three examples, Russian takes one term to express what in English takes two terms.",
        "The same occurs (although to a lesser extent) in English, in which 'read' and 'reads' are treated as distinct terms.",
        "Without any further context (such as sentences in which these terms are instantiated), the similarity in meaning between 'read' and 'reads' will be readily apparent to any linguist, simply because of the shared orthography and morphology.",
        "But for an approach like standard LSA in which terms are defined simply as distinct entities delimited by non-word characters, the morphology is considered immaterial - it is invisible.",
        "The only way a standard term-based approach can detect any similarity between 'read' and 'reads' is through the associations of terms in documents.",
        "Clearly, then, such an approach operates under a handicap.",
        "Two unfortunate consequences will inevitably result from this.",
        "First, some terms will be treated as out-of-vocabulary even when at least some of the semantics could perhaps have been derived from a part of the term.",
        "For example, if the training corpus contains 'read' and 'reads' but not 'reading', valuable information is lost every time 'reading' is encountered in a new document to which LSA might be deployed.",
        "Secondly, associations that should be made between in-vocabulary terms will also be missed.",
        "Perhaps a reason that more attention has not been devoted to this is that the problem can largely be disregarded in highly analytic languages like English.",
        "But, as previous results such as Chew and Abde-lali's (2008) show, for a language like Arabic, the adverse consequences of a morphology-blind approach are more severe.",
        "The question then is: how can information which is clearly available in the training corpus be more fully leveraged without sacrificing efficiency?"

        "2004 and Abdou et al.",
        "2005).",
        "We are not aware, however, of any previous results that show unequivocally that stemming is beneficial specifically in CLIR.",
        "Chew and Abdelali (2008) examine the use of a light stemmer for Arabic (Darwish 2002), and while this does result in a small overall increase in overall precision, there is paradoxically no increase for Arabic.",
        "The problem may be that the approach for Arabic needs to be matched by a similar approach for other languages in the parallel corpus.",
        "However, since stemmers are usually tailored to particular languages - and may even be unavailable for some languages - use of existing stemmers may not always be an option.",
        "Another more obviously language-independent approach is to replace terms with character n-grams.",
        "This is feasible for more or less any language, regardless of script.",
        "Moreover, implementation of a similar idea is described in McNamee and Mayfield (2004) and applied specifically to CLIR.",
        "However, McNamee and May-field's CLIR results are solely for European languages written in the Roman script.",
        "This is why they are able to obtain, in their words, 'surprisingly good results... without translation [of the query]', and without using LSA in any form.",
        "With related languages in the same script, and particularly when n-grams are used in place of terms, the existence of cognates means that many translations can easily be identified, since they probably share many of the same n-grams (e.g. French 'parisien' versus English 'Parisian').",
        "When languages do not all share the same script or come from the same language family, however, the task can be considerably harder.",
        "Since the approach of n-gram tokenization has the advantages of being entirely statisticallybased and language-independent, however, we examined whether it could be combined with LSA to allow CLIR (including cross-script retrieval), and whether this would lead to any advantage over term-based LSA.",
        "Our intuition was that some (although not all) n-grams would correspond to morphologically significant subcon-stituents of terms, such as 'read' from 'reading', and therefore associations at the morpheme level might be facilitated.",
        "The steps for this approach are listed in Table 3.",
        "Form a term-by-document array from the parallel corpus as described above",
        "Subject the n-gram-by-document array to SVD to produce an n-gram-by-concept U matrix, singular values (the diagonal S matrix), and document-by-concept V matrix_",

        "Under all approaches, we selected the same log-entropy term weighting scheme that we used for standard LSA.",
        "Thus, whether a term t stands for a wordform or an n-gram, its weighted frequency W in a particular document k is given by:",
        "where F is the raw frequency of t in k, Ht is the entropy of the term or n-gram across all documents, N is the number of documents in the corpus, and X is some arbitrary constant (a power to which the global weight is raised).",
        "We have found that an a > 1 improves precision by changing the relative distribution of weighted frequencies.",
        "Common terms with high entropy become much less influential in the SVD.",
        "It should be noted that step (2) in Table 3 is similar to McNamee and Mayfield's approach, except that we did not include word-spanning n-grams, owing to computational constraints.",
        "We also tried two variants of step (2), one in which all n-grams were of the same length (as per McNamee and Mayfield 2004), and one in which n-grams of different lengths were mixed.",
        "Under the second of these, the number of rows in both the term-by-document and U matrices is of course considerably larger.",
        "For example, Table 4 shows that the number of rows in the n-gram-by-document matrix for English (EN) under the first variant (with n = 6) is 19,801, while under the second (with n Z 6) it is 58,907.",
        "Comparable statistics are given for Arabic (AR), Spanish (ES), French (FR) and Russian (RU).",
        "We also attempted a related approach with non-overlapping n-grams.",
        "This set of experiments was guided by the intuition that not all n-grams are morphologically significant.",
        "Before we discuss the details of this approach, consider the English example 'comingle'.",
        "Here, 'co' + 'mingle' are likely to be more significant to the overall meaning than 'coming' + 'le' - in fact, the presence of the n-gram 'coming' could be misleading in this case.",
        "One way to model this would be to change the weighting scheme.",
        "The problem with this is that the weighting for one token has to be contingent on the weighting for another in the same term.",
        "Otherwise, in this example, the n-gram 'coming' would presumably receive a high weighting based on its frequency elsewhere in the corpus.",
        "An alternative is to select the tokenization which maximizes mutual information (MI).",

        "Here, the best results (with n<=5) more clearly improve upon LSA: the increases in both P1 and MP5, though each only about 0.03 in absolute terms, are highly significant (p < 0.005).",
        "Very likely this is related to the fact that when n-grams are used in place of words, the out-of-vocabulary problem is alleviated.",
        "But there is quite a high computational cost, which will become apparent in Table 10 and the discussion accompanying it.",
        "A practical advantage of the 'morpheme'-by-document array of LMSA, on the other hand, is that this cost is substantially reduced.",
        "This is because, as already mentioned, the vast majority of n-grams are eliminated from consideration.",

        "For P1, the results are comparable to standard LSA when we select settings of n Z 7 (maximum permitted morpheme length) or above.",

        "The improvement in MP5 is comparable to that for P1 - 0.677 to 0.707 - when Chew and Abdelali (2008) use the Darwish Arabic light stemmer to provide input to LSA; our approach, however, has the advantage that it is fully unsupervised.",
