        "Automatic sentence compression can be broadly described as the task of creating a grammatical summary of a single sentence with minimal information loss.",
        "It has recently attracted much attention, in part because of its relevance to applications.",
        "Examples include the generation of subtitles from spoken transcripts (Vandeghinste and Pan, 2004), the display of text on small screens such as mobile phones or PDAs (Corston-Oliver, 2001), and, notably, summarisation (ling, 2000; Lin, 2003).",
        "Most prior work has focused on a specific instantiation of sentence compression, namely word deletion.",
        "Given an input sentence of words, W\\, W2 ■ ■ ■ wn, a compression is formed by dropping any subset of these words (Knight and Marcu, 2002).",
        "The simplification renders the task computationally feasible, allowing efficient decoding using a dynamic program (Knight and Marcu, 2002; Turner and Charniak, 2005; McDonald, 2006).",
        "Furthermore, constraining the problem to word deletion affords substantial modeling flexibility.",
        "Indeed, a variety of models have been successfully developed for this task ranging from instantiations of the noisy-channel model (Knight and Marcu, 2002; Galley and McKeown, 2007; Turner and Charniak, 2005), to large-margin learning (McDonald, 2006; Cohn and Lapata, 2007), and Integer Linear Programming (Clarke, 2008).",
        "However, the simplification also renders the task somewhat artificial.",
        "There are many rewrite operations that could compress a sentence, besides deletion, including reordering, substitution, and insertion.",
        "In fact, professional abstractors tend to use these operations to transform selected sentences from an article into the corresponding summary sentences (ling, 2000).",
        "Therefore, in this paper we consider sentence compression from a more general perspective and generate abstracts rather than extracts.",
        "In this framework, the goal is to find a summary of the original sentence which is grammatical and conveys the most important information without necessarily using the same words in the same order.",
        "Our task is related to, but different from, paraphrase extraction (Barzilay, 2003).",
        "We must not only have access to paraphrases (i.e., rewrite rules), but also be able to combine them in order to generate new text, while attempting to produce a shorter resulting string.",
        "Quirk et al.",
        "(2004) present an end-to-end paraphrasing system inspired by phrase-based machine translation that can both acquire paraphrases and use them to generate new strings.",
        "However, their model is limited to lexical substitution – no reordering takes place – and is lacking the compression objective.",
        "Once we move away from extractive compression we are faced with two problems.",
        "First, we must find an appropriate training set for our abstractive task.",
        "Compression corpora are not naturally available and existing paraphrase corpora do not normally contain compressions.",
        "Our second problem concerns the modeling task itself.",
        "Ideally, our learning framework should handle structural mismatches and complex rewriting operations.",
        "In what follows, we first present a new corpus for abstractive compression which we created by having annotators compress sentences while rewriting them.",
        "Besides obtaining useful data for modeling purposes, we also demonstrate that abstractive compression is a meaningful task.",
        "We then present a tree-to-tree transducer capable of transforming an input parse tree into a compressed parse tree.",
        "Our approach is based on synchronous tree substitution grammar (STSG, Eisner (2003)), a formalism that can account for structural mismatches, and is trained discriminatively.",
        "Specifically, we generalise the model of Cohn and Lapata (2007) to our abstractive task.",
        "We present a novel tree-to-tree grammar extraction method which acquires paraphrases from bilingual corpora and ensure coherent output by including a ngram language model as a feature.",
        "We also develop a number of loss functions suited to the abstractive compression task.",
        "We hope that some of the work described here might be of relevance to other generation tasks such as machine translation (Eisner, 2003), multi-document summarisation (Barzilay, 2003), and text simplification (Carroll et al., 1999)."

        "A stumbling block to studying abstractive sentence compression is the lack of widely available corpora for training and testing.",

        "Unfortunately, none of these data sources are suited to our problem since they have been produced with a single rewriting operation, namely word deletion.",
        "Although there is a greater supply of paraphrasing corpora, such as the Multiple-Translation Chinese (MTC) corpus and the Microsoft Research (MSR) Paraphrase Corpus (Quirk et al., 2004), they are also not ideal, since they have not been created",
        "Available by the LDC, Catalog Number LDC2002T01, ISBN 1-58563-217-1.",

        "They contain ample rewriting operations, however they do not explicitly target information loss.",
        "For the reasons just described, we created our own corpus.",
        "We collected 30 newspaper articles (575 sentences) from the British National Corpus (BNC) and the American News Text corpus, for which we obtained manual compressions.",
        "In order to confirm that the task was feasible, five of these documents were initially compressed by two annotators (not the authors).",
        "The annotators were given instructions that explained the task and defined sentence compression with the aid of examples.",
        "They were asked to paraphrase while preserving the most important information and ensuring the compressed sentences remained grammatical.",
        "They were encouraged to use any rewriting operations that seemed appropriate, e.g., to delete words, add new words, substitute them or reorder them.",
        "Assessing inter-annotator agreement is notoriously difficult for paraphrasing tasks (Barzilay, 2003) since there can be many valid outputs for a given input.",
        "Also our task is doubly subjective in deciding which information to remove from the sentence and how to rewrite it.",
        "In default of an agreement measure that is well suited to the task and takes both decisions into account, we assessed them separately.",
        "We first examined whether the annotators compressed at a similar level.",
        "The compression rate was 56% for one annotator and 54% for the other.",
        "We also assessed whether they agreed in their rewrites by measuring BLEU (Pap-ineni et al., 2002).",
        "The inter-annotator BLEU score was 23.79%, compared with the source agreement BLEU of only 13.22%.",
        "Both the compression rate and BLEU score indicate that the task is well-defined and the compressions valid.",
        "The remaining 25 documents were compressed by a single annotator to ensure consistency.",
        "All our experiments used the data from this annotator.",
        "Table 1 illustrates some examples from our corpus.",
        "As can be seen, some sentences contain a single rewrite operation.",

        "Each output tree is created by applying a series of grammar rules, where each rule matches a fragment of the source and creates a fragment of the target tree.",

        "For this reason, we extract a grammar from our abstractive corpus in the manner of Cohn and Lapata (2007) (see Section 5 for details) and augment it with a larger grammar obtained from a parallel bilingual corpus.",
        "Crucially, our second grammar will not contain compression rules, just paraphrasing ones.",
        "We leave it to the model to learn which rules serve the compression objective.",
        "Our paraphrase grammar extraction method uses bilingual pivoting to learn paraphrases over syntax tree fragments, i.e., STSG rules.",
        "Pivoting treats the paraphrasing problem as a two-stage translation process.",

        "Our results are summarised in Table 4, where we show the mean ratings for our system (Abstract), the baseline (Extract), and the gold standard.",
        "We first performed an Analysis of Variance (Anova) to examine the effect of different system compressions.",
        "The Anova revealed a reliable effect on both grammaticality and importance (significant over both subjects and items (p < 0.01)).",
        "We next examined in more detail between-system differences.",
        "Post-hoc Tukey tests revealed that our abstractive model received significantly higher ratings than the baseline in terms of importance (a < 0.01).",
        "We conjecture that this is due to the synchronous grammar we employ which is larger and more expressive than the baseline.",
        "In the extractive case, a word sequence is either deleted or retained.",
        "We may, however, want to retain the meaning of the sequence while rendering the sentence shorter, and this is precisely what our model can achieve, e.g., by allowing substitutions.",
        "As far as grammaticality is concerned, our abstractive model is numerically better than the extractive baseline but the difference is not statistically significant.",
        "Note that our model has to work a lot harder than the baseline to preserve grammaticality since we allow arbitrary rewrites which may lead to agreement or tense mismatches, and selectional preference violations.",
        "The scope for errors is greatly reduced when performing solely deletions.",
        "Finally, both the abstractive and extractive outputs are perceived as significantly worse than the gold standard both in terms of grammaticality and importance (a < 0.01).",
        "This is not surprising: human-authored compressions are more fluent and tend to omit genuinely superfluous information.",
        "This is also mirrored in the compression rates shown in Table 4.",

        "Although the system can be forced to match the human compression rate, the grammaticality and information content both suffer.",
        "More sophisticated features could allow the system to narrow this gap.",
        "We next examined the output of our system in more detail by recording the number of substitutions, deletions and insertions it performed on the test data.",
        "Deletions accounted for 67% of rewrite operations, substitutions for 27%, and insertions for 6%.",
        "Interestingly, we observe a similar ratio in the human compressions.",
        "Here, deletions are also the most common rewrite operation (69%) followed by substitutions (24%), and insertions (7%).",
        "The ability to perform substitutions and insertions increases the compression potential of our system, but can also result in drastic meaning changes.",
        "In most cases (63%) the compressions produced by our system did not distort the meaning of the original.",
        "Humans are clearly better at this, 96.5% of their compressions were meaning preserving.",
        "We illustrate example output of our system in Table 5.",
        "For comparison we also present the gold standard compressions and baseline output.",
        "In the first sentence the system rendered Kurtz the subject of hitch-hiked.",
        "At the same time it deleted the verb and its adjunct from the first conjunct (came from Missouri) as well as the temporal modifier at the age of 14 from the second conjunct.",
        "The second sentence shows some paraphrasing: the verb intended is substituted with planned and poor is now modifying people rather than means.",
        "In the third example, our system applies multiple rewrites.",
        "It deletes last Thursday at his home, moves wife author Margo Kurtz to the subject position, and substitutes fall with decline.",
        "Unfortunately, the compressed sentence expresses a rather different meaning from the original.",
        "It is not Margo Kurtz who died but her husband.",
        "Finally, our last sentence illustrates a counter-intuitive substitution, the pronoun her is rewritten as him.",
        "This is because they share the French translation lui and thus pivoting learns to replace the less common word (in legal corpora) her with him.",
