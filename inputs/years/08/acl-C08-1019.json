        "ROUGE (Lin, 2004) and its linguistically-motivated descendent, Basic Elements (BE) (Hovy et al., 2005), evaluate a summary by computing its overlap with a set of model (human) summaries; ROUGE considers lexical n-grams as the unit for comparing the overlap between summaries, while Basic Elements uses larger units of comparison based on the output of syntactic parsers.",
        "The ROUGE/BE toolkit has become the standard automatic method for evaluating the content of machine-generated summaries, but the correlation of these automatic scores with human evaluation metrics has not always been consistent.",
        "In this paper, we analyze the state of current human and automatic evaluation of topic-focused summarization.",
        "Using the results of the Document Understanding Conference main task for 2005-2007 we explore the correlation between variants of ROUGE and the human metrics of responsiveness and linguistic quality.",
        "The analyses expose a number of challenges and several surprising results.",
        "In particular, while ROUGE has very strong correlation with responsiveness for both human and system summaries, there is a significant gap in responsiveness between humans and systems which is not accounted for by the ROUGE metrics.",
        "One cause of the gap is that many automatic summarizers truncate the last sentence of their summary, which shows significant reduction in the responsiveness score but does not result in a statistically significant drop in ROUGE scores.",
        "In addition to teasing out gaps in the current automatic evaluation, we propose a method to maximize the strength of current automatic evaluations by using the method of canonical correlation.",
        "We apply this new evaluation method, which we call ROSE (ROUGE Optimal Summarization Evaluation), to find the optimal linear combination of ROUGE metrics to maximize correlation with human responsiveness.",
        "The main task for DUC 2005-2007 was a complex question-focused summarization task that required summarizers to piece together information from multiple documents to answer a question or set of questions as posed in a DUC topic statement.",
        "The topic statement was a request for information that could not be met by just stating a name, date, quantity, etc.",
        "The summarization task was the same for both human and automatic summarizers: Given a topic statement and a set of 25-50 relevant newswire documents, the summarization task was to create from the documents a brief, well-organized, fluent summary that answered the need for information expressed in the topic statement.",
        "The summary could be no longer than 250 words.",
        "Summaries over the size limit were truncated, and no bonus was given for creating a shorter summary.",
        "NIST Assessors developed the DUC topics used as test data.",
        "There were 50 DUC topics each year in 2005-2006, and 45 topics in DUC 2007.",
        "Each year, 10 NIST assessors produced a total of 4 human summaries for each of the topics.",
        "The assessor who developed a particular topic always wrote one of the 4 summaries for that topic.",
        "NIST manually assessed each summary for both content and readability.",
        "Readability was assessed using a set of linguistic quality questions; summary content was assessed using the pseudo-extrinsic measure of content responsiveness.",
        "All summaries for a given topic were judged by a single assessor who was usually the same as the topic developer.",
        "In all cases, the assessor was one of the summarizers for the topic.",
        "Assessors first judged each summary for a topic for readability, assigning a separate score for each of 5 linguistic qualities; each summary for the topic was then judged for content responsiveness.",
        "Each of these manual evaluations was based on a five-point scale (l=very poor, 5=very good), resulting in 6 scores for each summary.",
        "The readability of the summaries was assessed using five linguistic quality questions which measured qualities of the summary that did not involve comparison with a reference summary or DUC topic.",
        "The linguistic qualities measured were Ql: Grammaticality, Q2: Non-redundancy, Q3: Referential clarity, Q4: Focus, and Q5: Structure and coherence.",
        "NIST performed manual pseudo-extrinsic evaluation of peer summaries in the form of assessment of responsiveness.",
        "Responsiveness differs from other measures of summary content such as SEE coverage (Lin and Hovy, 2002) and Pyramid scores (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004) in that it does not compare a peer summary against a set of known human summaries.",
        "Rather, the assessor is given a list of randomly ordered, unlabeled summaries (both human and system-generated) for a topic, and must assign a responsiveness score to each summary (after having read all the summaries first).",
        "In DUC 2005-2007, NIST assessors assigned a content responsiveness score to each summary; content responsiveness indicated the amount of information in the summary that helped to satisfy the information need expressed in the topic statement.",
        "For content responsiveness, the linguistic quality of the summary was to play a role in the assessment only insofar as it interfered with the expression of information and reduced the amount of information that was conveyed.",
        "In DUC 2006, assessors assigned an additional overall responsiveness score, which was based on both information content and readability.",
        "Assessors judged overall responsiveness only offer judging all their topics for readability and content responsiveness; however, they were not given direct access to these previously assigned scores, but were told to give their \"gut\" reaction to the overall responsiveness of each summary.",
        "The content responsiveness score provides a coarse manual measure of information coverage; overall responsiveness reflects a combination of readability and content.",
        "Content responsiveness was largely responsible for determining how assessors perceived the overall quality of a summary, but readability also played an important role.",
        "While poor readability could downgrade the overall responsiveness of a summary that had very good content responsiveness, very good readability could sometimes bolster the overall responsiveness score of a less information-laden summary (Dang, 2006).",
        "Attempts at greater readability in 2006 paid off among the peers with the best overall responsiveness scores.",
        "However, the automatic peers generally had poor readability, and the average overall responsiveness for each peer was generally much lower than its average content responsiveness.",
        "In addition to the human assessment of responsiveness, NIST computed three \"official\" automatic scores using ROUGE and Basic Elements: ROUGE-2, ROUGE-SU4, and ROUGE-BE recall.",
        "For the BE evaluation, summaries were parsed with Minipar (Lin, 2005), and BE-F were extracted and matched using the Head-Modifier criterion.",

        "This line could be used to extrapolate the system performance if ROUGE scores were to increase.",
        "As seen in Figure 1, while both the manual and the automatic ROUGE scores of the human summarizers remained relatively constant over the years, the systems made significant progress in their automatic scores, with the top systems performing within statistical confidence of the human summarizers in the ROUGE metrics as reported by Conroy et al.",
        "(2007).",

        "This bias adds to the gap in content responsiveness between the human and automatic summarizers.",
        "Fortunately, this effect is dampened by the fact that NIST used 10 assessors and on average a human got to assess their own abstract only 25% of the time.",

        "In DUC 2006 and 2007, the linguistic question which rewards summaries for not having redundancy (Q2) has a significant negative correlation with content responsiveness in the group of systems.",

        "Rarely does any system have sentences which are near duplicates.",

        "We contrast the correlations for DUC 2006 in Table 2 vs. those in Table 3.",
        "Not surprisingly, overall responsiveness, which intentionally penalizes summaries for linguistic problems, does correlate more strongly with the linguistic questions than content responsiveness.",
        "Also, we note that the DUC 2007 correlations for content responsiveness appear more like those for DUC 2006 overall responsiveness than the corresponding correlations for DUC 2006 content responsiveness.",
        "NIST did not have sufficient time in 2007 to perform an overall responsiveness evaluation.",
        "We hypothesize that the assessors, many of whom worked on DUC 2006, may have inadvertently taken linguistic quality into account more in 2007 than in 2006 for the content responsiveness, since only one measure was done in 2007.",
        "Finally, it was hypothesized at the DUC 2006 workshop that the human assessors penalize systems in content responsiveness which end with a sentence fragment, more than could be accounted for by the missing content of the sentence fragment.",

        "In these experiments we measure the stability of a ROSE model from one year to the next.",
        "(Note, we have also computed a model based on the combined data of DUC 2005 and DUC 2006 for use with DUC 2007 and these results are comparable to those presented.)",
        "Here, for simplicity, we restrict the ROSE model to use only the \"official\" ROUGE metrics to build a model based on a given year and then evaluate that model on a subsequent year.",
        "Table 6 gives results for ROSE models constructed from only ROUGE-2, ROUGE-SU4, ROUGE-BE, and content responsiveness to create the ROSE model for each year; results are also given for ROSE models (ROSE+qi^) which also includes the linguistic questions on grammaticality (Ql) and focus (Q4).",
        "The ROSE models built from only ROUGE scores had mixed results, sometimes performing worse than a single ROUGE score (e.g., the ROSE model trained on DUC 2005 and evaluated on DUC 2006), but in other cases performing as well as or better than single ROUGE scores.",
        "These preliminary results with ROSE illustrate the difficulty in finding a single canonical variate that can be used from year to year to build ROSE models based on previous years' data.",
        "We hypothesize that the task is made more difficult due to humans changing their criteria for judging content responsiveness over the years.",
        "On the other hand, ROSE+qi;4 models that included the linguistic questions Ql and Q4 always yielded the best correlation with content responsiveness both for the systems and for the group of combined systems and human summarizers."

        "We analyzed the results of the topic-focused summarization task using the data from DUC 2005-2007.",
        "Our main concern was to expose causes of the gap that currently exists between automatic and human evaluation of summary content.",
        "As the automatic ROUGE scores of system summaries approaches that of human summaries, the disparity between automatic and manual measures of summary content becomes a more important concern.",
        "We find that there is a slight bias in the human evaluation: humans give their own summaries significantly higher scores.",
        "Furthermore, the responsiveness metric appears to be time varying, i.e., the humans changed their standards for judging responsiveness over the years, making it difficult to use automatic scores from one year to predict responsiveness in another year.",
        "Assessors naturally tend toward taking linguistic quality into account when assessing summaries.",
        "The instructions for assessing content responsiveness implicitly acknowledges this; what is surprising is the extent to which linguistic quality does influence content responsiveness.",
        "In particular, we demonstrated that content responsiveness in DUC 2006 and 2007 correlated with the linguistic quality questions of grammar (Ql) and focus (Q4), and that systems were significantly penalized in content responsiveness when their summary ended",
