        "Lhe field of research in natural language processing (NLP) applications for L2 language is constantly growing.",

        "Lhese include applications for use by the individual and within instructional contexts.",
        "Among the key tools are error-checking applications, focusing particularly on areas which learners find the most challenging.",
        "Prepositions and determiners are known to be one of the most frequent sources of error for L2 English speakers, a finding supported by our analysis of a small error-tagged corpus we created (determiners 17% of errors, prepositions 12%).",
        "Lhere-fore, in developing a system for automatic error detection in L2 writing, it seems desirable to focus on these problematic, and very common, parts of speech (POS).",
        "Lhis paper gives a brief overview of the problems posed by these POS and of related work.",

        "For example, we say / study in Boston but / study at MIT; or He is independent of his parents, but dependent on his son.",
        "As it is hard even for LI speakers to articulate the reasons for these differences, it is not surprising that learners find it difficult to master prepositions.",
        "Determiners pose a somewhat different problem from prepositions as, unlike them, their choice is more dependent on the wider discourse context than on individual lexical items.",
        "Lhe relation between a noun and a determiner is less strict than that between a verb or noun and a preposition, the main factor in determiner choice being the specific properties of the noun's context.",
        "For example, we can say boys like sport or the boys like sport, depending on whether we are making a general statement about all boys or referring to a specific group.",
        "Equally, both she ate an apple and she ate the apple are grammatically well-formed sentences, but only one may be appropriate in a given context, depending on whether the apple has been mentioned previously.",

        "For the preposition task, we extract 2523 instances of preposition use from the CLC (1282 correct, 1241 incorrect) and ask the classifier to mark them Instance type Accuracy",
        "Table 10: Accuracy on L2 data - prepositions.",
        "Accuracy on incorrect instances refers to the classifier successfully identifying the preposition in the text as not appropriate for that context.",
        "as correct or incorrect.",
        "The results from this task are presented in Table 10.",
        "These first results suggest that the model is fairly robust: the accuracy rate on the correct data, for example, is not much lower than that on the LI data.",
        "In an application designed to assist learners, it is important to aim to reduce the rate of false alarms - cases where the original is correct, but the model flags an error - to a minimum, so it is positive that this result is comparatively high.",
        "Accuracy on error identification is at first glance even more encouraging.",
        "However, if we look at the suggestions the model makes to replace the erroneous preposition, we find that these are correct only 51.5% of the time, greatly reducing its usefulness.",
        "A first analysis of the classifier's decisions and its errors points to various factors which could be impairing its performance.",
        "Spelling mistakes in the input are one of the most immediate ones.",
        "For example, in the sentence I'm Franch, responsable on the computer services, the classifier is not able to suggest a correct alternative to the erroneous on: since it does not recognise the adjective as a misspelling of responsible, it loses the information associated with this lexical feature, which could potentially determine the preposition choice.",
        "A more complex problem arises when poor grammar in the input misleads the parser so that the information it gives for a sentence is incorrect, especially as regards PP attachment.",
        "In this example, / wold like following equipment to my speech: computer, modem socket and microphone, the missing the leads the parser to treat following as a verb, and believes it to be the verb to which the preposition is attached.",
        "It therefore suggests from as a correction, which is a reasonable choice given the frequency of phrases such as to follow from.",
        "However, this was not what the PP was meant to modify: impaired performance from the parser could be a significant negative factor in the model's performance.",
        "It would be interesting to test the model on texts written by students of different levels of proficiency, as their grammar may be more error-free and more likely to be parsed correctly.",
        "Alternatively, we could modify the parser so as to skip cases where it requires several attempts before producing a parse, as these more challenging cases could be indicative of very poorly structured sentences in which misused prepositions are dependent on more complex errors.",
        "A different kind of problem impacting our accuracy scores derives from those instances where the classifier selects a preposition which can be correct in the given context, but is not the correct one in that particular case.",
        "In the example / received a beautiful present at my birthday, the classifier identifies the presence of the error, and suggests the grammatically and pragmatically appropriate correction for.",
        "The corpus annotators, however, indicate on as the correct choice.",
        "Since we use their annotations as the benchmark against which to evaluate the model, this instance is counted as the classifier being wrong because it disagrees with the annotators.",
        "A better indication of the model's performance may be to independently judge its decisions, to avoid being subject to the annotators' bias.",
        "Finally, we are beginning to look at the relations between preposition errors and other types of error such as verb choice, and how these are annotated in the data.",
        "An overview of the classifier's error patterns for the data in this task shows that they are largely similar to those observed in the LI data.",
        "Lhis suggests that the gap in performance between LI and L2 is due more to the challenges posed by learner text than by inherent shortcomings in the model, and therefore that the key to better performance is likely to lie in overcoming these problems.",
        "In future work we plan to use L2 data where some of the spelling errors and non-preposition or determiner errors have been corrected so that we can see which of the other errors are worth focussing on first.",
        "Our work on determiner error correction is still in the early stages.",
        "We follow a similar procedure to the prepositions task, selecting a number of both correct and incorrect instances.",
        "On the former (set size 2000) accuracy is comparable to that on LI data: 92.2%.",
        "Lhe danger of false alarms, then, appears not to be as significant as for the prepositions task.",
        "On the incorrect instances (set size ca.",
        "1200), however, accuracy is less than 10%.",
        "Preliminary error analysis shows that the model is successful at identifying cases of misused determiner, e.g. a for the or vice versa, doing so in over two-thirds of cases.",
        "However, by far the most frequent error type for determiners is not confusion between indefinite and definite article, but omitting an article where one is needed.",
        "At the moment, the model detects very few of these errors, no doubt influenced by the preponderance of null cases seen in training.",
        "Furthermore, some of the issues raised earlier in discussing the application of NLP tools to L2 language hold for this task, too.",
        "In addition to those, though, in this task more than for prepositions we believe that differences in text type between the training texts - the BNC and the testing material - learner essays - has a significant negative effect on the model.",
        "In this task, the lexical items play a crucial role in class assignment.",
        "If the noun in question has not been seen in training, the classifier may be unable to make an informed choice.",
        "Although the BNC comprises a wide variety of texts, there may not be a sufficient number covering topics typical of learner essays, such as 'business letters' or 'postcards to penpals'.",
        "Also, the BNC was created with material from almost 20 years ago, and learners writing in contemporary English may use lexical items which are not very frequently seen in the BNC.",
        "A clear example of this discrepancy is the noun internet, which requires the definite article in English, but not in several other languages, leading to countless sentences such as / saw it in internet, I booked it on internet, and so on.",
        "This is one of the errors the model never detects: a fact which is not surprising when we consider that this noun occurs only four times in the whole of the training data.",
        "It may be therefore necessary to consider using alternative sources of training data to overcome this problem and improve the classifier's performance."

        "In developing this model, our first aim was not to create something which learns like a human, but something that works in the best and most efficient possible way.",
        "However, it is interesting to see whether human learners and classifiers display similar patterns of errors in preposition choice.",
        "This information has twofold value: as well as being of pedagogical assistance to instructors of English L2, were the classifier to display student-like error patterns, insights into 'error triggers' could be derived from the L2 pedagogical literature to improve the classifier.",
        "The analysis of the types of errors made by human learners yields some insights which might be worthy of further investigation.",
        "A clear one is the confusion between the three locative and temporal prepositions at, in, and on (typical sentence: The training programme will start at the 1st August).",
        "This type of error is made often by both learners and the model on both types of data, suggesting that perhaps further attention to features might be necessary to improve discrimination between these three prepositions.",
        "There are also interesting divergences.",
        "For example, a common source of confusion in learners is between by and from, as in / like it because it's from my favourite band.",
        "However, this confusion is not very frequent in the model, a difference which could be explained either by the fact that, as noted above, performance on from is very low and so the classifier is unlikely to suggest it, or that in training the contexts seen for by are sufficiently distinctive that the classifier is not misled like the learners.",
        "Finally, a surprising difference comes from looking at what to is confused with.",
        "The model often suggests at where to would be correct.",
        "This is perhaps not entirely unusual as both can occur with locative complements (one can go to a place or be at a place) and this similarity could be confusing the classifier.",
        "Learners, however, although they do make this kind of mistake, are much more hampered by the confusion between for and to, as in She was helpful for me or This is interesting for you.",
        "In other words, for learners it seems that the abstract use of this preposition, its benefactive sense, is much more problematic than the spatial sense.",
        "We can hypothesise that the classifier is less distracted by these cases because the effect of the lexical features is stronger.",
        "A more detailed discussion of the issues arising from the comparison of confusion pairs cannot be had here.",
        "However, in noting both divergences and similarities between the two learners, human and machine, we may be able to derive useful insights into the way the learning processes operate, and what factors could be more or less important for them."
