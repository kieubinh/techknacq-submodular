        "Multidocument summarization (MDS) research efforts have resulted in significant advancements in algorithm and system design (Mani, 2001).",
        "Many of these efforts have focused on summarizing news articles, but not significantly explored the research issues arising from processing educational content to support pedagogical applications.",
        "This paper describes our research into the application of MDS techniques to educational science content to generate pedagogically useful summaries.",
        "Knowledge maps are graphical representations of domain information laid out as networks of nodes containing rich concept descriptions interconnected using a fixed set of relationship types (Holley and Dansereau, 1984).",
        "Knowledge maps are a variant of the concept maps used to capture, assess, and track student knowledge in education research (Novak and Gowin, 1984).",
        "Learning research indicates that knowledge maps may be useful cognitive scaffolds, helping users lacking domain expertise to understand the macro-level structure of an information space (O'Donnell et al., 2002).",
        "Knowledge maps have emerged as an effective representation to generate conceptual browsers that help students navigate educational digital libraries, such as the Digital Library for Earth System Education (DLESE.org) (Butcher et al., 2006).",
        "In addition, knowledge maps have proven useful for domain and instructional experts to capture domain knowledge from digital library resources and to analyze student understanding for the purposes of providing formative assessments (Ahmad et al., 2007).",
        "Knowledge maps have proven useful both as representations of knowledge for assessment purposes and as learning resources for presentation to students.",
        "However, domain knowledge map construction by experts is an expensive knowledge engineering activity.",
        "In this paper, we describe our progress towards the automated generation of pedagogically useful extractive summaries from educational texts about a science domain.",
        "In the context of automated knowledge map generation, summary sentences correspond to concepts.",
        "While the detection of relationships between concepts is also part of our overall research agenda, this paper focuses solely on concept identification using MDS techniques.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "First, we review related work in the areas of automated concept extraction from texts and extractive summarization.",
        "We then describe the empirical study we have conducted to understand how domain and instructional design experts identify pedagogically important science concepts in educational digital library resources.",
        "Next, we provide a detailed description of the algorithms we have designed based on expert strategies elicited from our empirical study.",
        "We then present and discuss our evaluation results using automated summarization metrics and human judgments.",
        "Finally, we present our conclusions and future work in this area.",
        "Related Work",
        "Our work is informed by efforts to automate the acquisition of ontology concepts from text.",
        "On-toLearn (Navigli and Velardi, 2004) extracts domain terminology from a collection of texts using a syntactic parse to identify candidate terms that are filtered based on domain relevance and connected using a semantic interpretation based on word sense disambiguation.",
        "The newly identified concepts and relationships are used to update an existing ontology.",
        "Knowledge Puzzle focuses on n-grams to produce candidate terms filtered based on term frequency in the input documents and on the number of relationships associated with a given term (Zouaq et al., 2007).",
        "This approach leverages pattern extraction techniques to identify concepts and relationships.",
        "While these approaches produce ontologies useful for computational purposes, the identified concepts are of a very fine granularity and therefore may yield graphs not suitable for identifying student misconceptions or for presentation back to the student.",
        "Clustering by committee has also been used to discover concepts from a text by grouping terms into conceptually related clusters (Lin and Pantel, 2002).",
        "The resulting clusters appear to be tightly related, but operate at a very fine level of granularity.",
        "Our approach focuses on sentences as units of knowledge to produce concise representations that may be useful both as computational objects and as learning resources to present back to the student.",
        "Therefore, extractive summarization research also informs our work.",
        "Topic representation and topic themes have been used to explore promising MDS techniques (Harabagiu and Lacatusu, 2005).",
        "Recent efforts in graph-based MDS have integrated sentence affinity, information richness and diversity penalties to produce very promising results (Wan and Yang, 2006).",
        "Finally, MEAD is a widely used multi-document summarization and evaluation platform (Radev et al., 2000).",
        "MEAD research efforts have resulted in significant contributions to support the development of summarization applications (Radev et al., 2000).",
        "While all these systems have produced promising results in automated evaluations, none have directly targeted educational content as input or the generation of pedagogically useful summaries.",
        "We are directly building upon MEAD due its focus on sentence extraction and its high degree of modularization."

        "We have conducted a study to capture how human experts construct and use knowledge maps.",
        "In this 10-month study, we examined how experts created knowledge maps from educational digital libraries and how they used the maps to assess student work and provide personalized feedback.",
        "In this paper, we are focusing on the knowledge map construction aspects of the study.",
        "Four geology and instructional design experts collaboratively selected 20 resources from DLESE to construct a domain knowledge map on earthquakes and plates tectonics for high school age learners.",
        "The experts independently created knowledge maps of individual resources which they collaboratively merged into the final domain knowledge map in a one-day workshop.",
        "The resulting domain knowledge map consisted of 564 nodes containing domain concepts and 578 relationships.",
        "The concepts consist of 7,846 words, or 5% of the total number of words in the original resources.",
        "Figure 1 shows a fragment of the domain knowledge map created by our experts.",
        "over 1 million earthquakes occur each year Not all faults intersect Earth's surface, and most earthquakes do no rupture the surface.",
        "elaborates an earthquake is the sudden slip of part of the Earth's crust, relative to another part, along a fault surface.",
        "Experts created nodes containing concepts of varying granularity, including nouns, noun phrases, partial sentences, single sentences, and multiple sentences.",
        "Our analysis of this domain knowledge map indicates that experts relied on copying-and-pasting (58%) and paraphrasing (37%) to create most domain concepts.",
        "Only 5% of the nodes could not be traced directly to the original resources.",
        "Experts used relationship types in a Zipf-like distribution with the top 10 relationship types accounting for 64% of all relationships.",
        "The top 2 relationship types each accounted for more than 10% of all relationships: elaborations (19% or 110 links) and examples (14% or 78 links).",
        "We have established the completeness of this domain knowledge map by asking a domain expert to assess its content coverage of nationally-recognized educational goals on earthquakes and plate tectonics for high school age learners using the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Benchmarks (Project 2061, 1993).",
        "The results indicate adequate content coverage of the relevant AAAS Benchmarks achieved through 82 of the concepts (15%) with the remaining 482 concepts (85%) providing very detailed elaborations of the associated learning goals.",
        "Qualitative analysis of the verbal protocols captured during the study indicates that all experts used external sources to construct the domain knowledge map.",
        "Experts made references to their own knowledge (e.g., \"I know that...\"), to content learned or taught in geology courses, to other resources used in the study, and to the National Science Education Standards (NSES), a comprehensive collection of nationally-recognized science learning goals for K-12 students (National Research Council, 1996).",
        "We have examined sentence extraction agreement between experts using a kappa measure that accounts for prevalence of judgments and conflicting biases amongst experts, called PABA-kappa (Byrt et al., 1993).",
        "The average PABA-kappa value of 0.62 indicates that our experts substantially agree on sentence extraction from digital library resources.",
        "While this study was not designed as an annotation project to support summarization evaluation, this level of agreement indicates that the concepts selected by the experts may serve as the reference summary to evaluate the performance of our summarizer."

        "We have extended MEAD with sentence scoring features based on domain content, document structure, and sentence length.",
        "We have designed two sentence-scoring features that aim to capture the domain content relevance of each sentence: the educational standards feature and the gazetteer feature.",
        "We have developed a feature that models how human experts used external sources to identify and extract concepts.",
        "The educational standards feature uses the textual description of the relevant AAAS Benchmarks on earthquakes and plate tectonics for high-school age learners and the associated NSES.",
        "Each sentence receives a score based on its similarity to the text contents of the learning goals and educational standards computed using a TFIDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) approach (Salton and Buckley, 1988).",
        "We have used KinoSearch, a Perl implementation of the Lucene search engine (lucene.apache.org), to create an index that includes the AAAS Benchmarks learning goal description (boosted by 2), subject (boosted by 8), and keywords (boosted by 2), plus the text of the associated national standards (not boosted).",
        "Sentence scores are based on the similarity scores generated by KinoSearch in response to a query consisting of the sentence text.",

        "A gazetteer is a georeferencing resource containing information about locations and place-names, including latitude and longitude as well as type information about the corresponding geographical feature.",
        "Each sentence receives a score based on a TFIDF approach where the TF is the number of times a particular location name appears in the sentence and the IDF is the inverse of the count of gazetteer entries matching the location name.",
        "If the ADL Gazetteer returns a large number of results for a given place-name, it means there are many geographical locations identified by that name.",
        "Our assumption is that unique names may be more pedagogically relevant.",
        "For example, Ohio receives an IDF score of 0.0625 because the ADL Gazetteer contains 16 entries so named, while the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the distinctive underwater mountain range dividing the Atlantic Ocean, receives a score of 1.0 as it appears only once.",
        "Based on the intuition that the HTML structure of a web site reflects content relevancy, we have developed the hypertext feature.",
        "The hypertext feature assigns a higher score to sentences contained under higher level HTML headings.",
        "Within a given heading level, the hypertext feature assigns a higher score to sentences that appear earlier within that level based on both relative paragraph order within the heading and relative sentence position within each paragraph.",
        "The equation used to compute the hypertext score for a sentence is",
        "hypertext _ score = heading _ bonus * Vpar _ no * tfij sent_ no",
        "where heading_bonus is obtained from Table 1, par_no is the paragraph number within the heading, and sent_no is the sentence number within the paragraph.",
        "We use the f^x function to attenuate the contributions to the feature score of later paragraphs and sentences.",
        "Initially, we used the same function MEAD uses to modulate its position feature (ffix), but initial experimentation indicated this function decayed too rapidly, resulting in later sentences being over-penalized.",
        "To promote the extraction of sentences containing scientific concepts, we have developed the content word density feature.",
        "This feature makes a cut-off decision based on the ratio of content words to function words in a sentence.",
        "The content word density feature uses a pre-populated list of function words (a stopword list) to calculate the ratio of content to function words within each sentence, keeping sentences that meet or exceed the ratio of 50%.",
        "This cut-off value implies that the extracted sentences contain relatively more content words than function words.",
        "We compute the final score of each sentence by adding the scores obtained for the MEAD default configuration features (centroid and position) to the scores for the COGENT features (educational standards, gazetteer, and hypertext).",
        "After the sentences have been sorted according to their cumulative scores, we keep sentences that pass the cut-off constraints, including the MEAD length feature equal or greater than 9 and COGENT content word density equal or greater than 50%.",

        "The expert used a 5-point Likert scale to judge whether each concept would be pedagogically useful in the context of a concept inventory on earthquakes and plate tectonics knowledge for high school age learners.",
        "The expert agreed or strongly agreed that 60% of the sentences would be pedagogically useful, with 30% of the sentences being potentially useful and only 10% of the sentences being judged as not useful.",
        "These results indicate that COGENT appears to perform quite well at identifying sentences that contain information relevant for learning about the domain.",
        "We have also completed an ablation study to identify the relative contribution of the COGENT features to the quality of the summary.",
        "We have focused on the cosine metric to capture the overall similarity between the COGENT concept inventory and the concepts from the expert-created knowledge map.",
        "Table 5 shows the cosine similarity between the concept inventory generated after taking the feature shown in parentheses out of the summarizer.",
        "The results are ordered from low-to-high such that the feature contributing the most to the all-features cosine score appears at the top of the table.",
        "Removing either the gazetteer or the hypertext feature causes the largest drops in similarity indicating the importance of the use of examples and the relevance of document structure for the quality of the COGENT-generated summary.",
        "Meanwhile both the educational standards and content word density appear to provide modest but useful improvements to the quality of the COGENT summary.",
        "Given that our algorithms have only been evaluated on the topic of earthquakes and plate tectonics for high school age learners, COGENT may be limited in its ability to transcend domains due to its reliance on two domain-aware sentence scoring features: educational standards and gazetteer.",
        "However, the educational standards feature may be applicable across other science topics because the AAAS Benchmarks and NSES provide very thorough and detailed coverage of a wide range of topics for the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math disciplines for grades K-12.",
        "Only the gazetteer feature would need to be replaced, especially given its significant contribution to the quality of the generated summary as indicated by the results of the ablation study.",
        "We believe these results highlight the need to generalize our approach, perhaps using a classifier for identifying examples in educational texts without resorting to overly domain-specific language resources, such as the ADL Gazetteer.",
        "Overall, the evaluation results indicate that our approach holds promise for effectively identifying concepts for inclusion in the construction of a pedagogically useful domain knowledge map from educational science content."

        "In this paper, we have presented a multi-document summarization system, COGENT, that integrates bottom-up and top-down sentence scoring features to identify pedagogically relevant concepts from educational digital library resources.",
        "Our results indicate that COGENT generates concept inventories that resemble those identified by experts and outperforms existing multi-document summarization systems.",
        "We have also used the COGENT concept inventory as input to our misconception identification algorithms and the evaluation results indicate the algorithms perform as well as when using an expert-created domain knowledge map.",
        "In the context of generating domain knowledge maps, our next step is to explore how machine learning techniques may be employed to connect concepts with links.",
        "Automating the process of creating inventories of important pedagogical concepts represents an important step towards creating scalable intelligent learning and tutoring systems.",
        "We hope our progress in this direction may contribute to increase the interest within the computational linguistics research community in novel educational technology research.",
