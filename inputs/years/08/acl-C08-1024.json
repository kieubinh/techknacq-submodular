        "The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy defines an artifact as \"... an object that has been intentionally made or produced for a certain purpose\".",
        "Because of this purpose-orientedness, most human actions relating to an object or artifact fall into two broad categories – actions relating to its intended use (e.g. reading a book), and the preparations necessary therefore (like buying the book).",
        "Information concerning potential obstacles, harmful effects or troubles that interfere with this intended use is therefore highly relevant to the user.",
        "While some such troubles are self-evident, others represent a genuine obstacle whose existence was thusfar unknown to the user.",
        "For example, in early 2008 a food poisoning case caused a big media stir in Japan when dozens of people fell ill after eating Chinese-imported frozen food products containing residual traces of toxic pesticides.",
        "While supposedly the presence of toxic chemicals in imported frozen foods had already been established on several occasions before, until the recent incidents public awareness of these facts remained low.",
        "In retrospect, a publicly available system suggesting \"residual agrichemicals\" as a potential danger with the consumption of \"frozen foods\" based on information mined from a large collection of Web documents might have led to earlier detection of this crisis.",
        "From the viewpoint of manufacturers as well, regularly monitoring the Internet for product names and associated troubles may allow them to find out about perceived flaws in their products sooner and avoid large scale recalls and damage to their brand.",
        "For a less dramatic example, searching for \"Tokyo Disneyland\" on the Internet typically yields many commercial sites offering travel deals, but little or no information about potential obstacles such as \"height restrictions\" (constraints on who can enjoy a given attraction) and \"traffic jams\" (a necessary preparation for enjoying a theme park is actually getting there in time).",
        "Ofter users have no way of finding out about this until they actually go there.",
        "These examples demonstrate the importance of a highly accurate automatic method for acquiring what we will call \"object-trouble\" relations – pairs (e0,et) in which the thing referred to by e* constitutes an (actual or potential) trouble, obstacle or risk in the context of use of an object e0.",
        "Large scale acquisition of this type of contextual knowledge has not been thoroughly studied so far.",
        "In this paper, we propose a method for automatically acquiring Japanese noun phrases referring to troubles, (henceforth referred to as trouble expressions), and associating them with expressions denoting artifacts, objects or facilities.",
        "Our acquisition method consists of three steps.",
        "As a first step, we use an unsupervised method for efficiently collecting training data from a Web corpus.",
        "Then, a set of expressions denoting troubles is acquired by a supervised learning method – Support Vector Machines (Vapnik, 1998) – trained on this data.",
        "Finally, the acquired trouble expressions are paired with noun phrases referring to objects, using a combination of pairwise mutual information and a verb-noun dependency filter based on statistics in a Web corpus.",
        "A broad focus on noun-verb dependencies – and in particular the distinction between dependency relations with negated versus non-negated verbs - is the main characteristic of our method.",
        "While this distinction did not prove useful for improving the supervised classifier's performance in step 2, it forms the basis underlying the unsupervised method for training sample selection in the first step, and the final filtering mechanism in the third step.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 points out related work.",

        "Our goal of automatically acquiring object-trouble pairs from Web documents is perhaps best viewed as a problem of semantic relation extraction.",
        "Recently the Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) program (Doddington et al., 2004) is a well-known benchmark task concerned with the automatic recognition of semantic relations from unstructured text.",
        "Typical target relations include \"Reaction\" and \"Production\" (Pantel and Pennacchiootti, 2006), \"person-affiliation\" and \"organization-location\" (Zelenko et al., 2002), \"part-whole\" (Berland and Charniak, 1999; Girju et al., 2006) and temporal precedence relations between events (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004; Tori-sawa, 2006).",
        "Our current task of acquiring \"object-trouble\" relations is new and object-trouble relations are inherently more abstract and indirect than relations like \"person-affiliation\" – they crucially depend on additional knowledge about whether and how a given object's use might be hampered by a specific trouble.",
        "Another line of research closely related to our work is the recognition of semantic orientation and sentiment analysis (Turney, 2002; Takamura et al., 2006; Kaji and Kitsuregawa, 2006).",
        "Clearly troubles should be associated with a negative orientation of an expression, but studies on the acquisition of semantic orientation traditionally do not bother with the context of evaluation.",
        "While recent work on sentiment analysis has started to associate sentiment-related attribute-evaluation pairs to objects (Kobayashi et al., 2007), these attributes usually concern intrinsic properties of the objects, such as a digital camera's colors – they do not extend to sentiment-related factors external to the object like \"traffic jams\" for theme parks.",
        "The acquisition method proposed in this work addresses both these matters.",
        "Finally, our task of acquiring trouble expressions can be regarded as hyponymy acquisition, where target expressions are hyponyms of the word \"trouble\".",
        "Although we used the classical lexico-syntactic patterns for hyponymy acquisition (Hearst, 1992; Imasumi, 2001; Ando et al., 2003) to reflect this intuition, our experiments show we were unable to attain satisfactory performance using lexico-syntactic patterns alone.",
        "Thus, we also use verb-noun dependencies as evidence in learning (Pantel and Ravichandran, 2004; Shinzato and Torisawa, 2004).",
        "We treat the evidences uniformly as elements in a feature vector given to a supervised learning method, which allowed us to extract a considerably larger number of trouble expressions than could be acquired by sparse lexico-syntactic patterns alone, while still keeping decent precision.",
        "What kind of hyponymy relations can be acquired by noun-verb dependencies is still an open question in NLP In this work we show that at least trouble expressions can successfully be acquired based on noun-verb dependency information alone."

        "Hence one source of evidence for acquisition are hyponymy relations with \"trouble\" or its synonyms.",
        "Another characterization of trouble expressions is to think of them as obstacles in a broad sense: things that prevent certain actions from being undertaken properly.",
        "In this sense traffic jams and sickness are troubles since they prevent people from going places and doing things.",
        "This assumption underlies a second important class of evidences for learning.",
        "More precisely, the evidence used for learning is classified into three categories: (i) lexico-syntactic patterns for hyponymy relations, (ii) dependency relations between expressions and negated verbs, and (Hi) dependency relations between expressions and non-negated verbs.",
        "The first two categories are assumed to contain positive evidence of trouble expressions, while we assumed the third to function mostly as negative evidence.",
        "Our experiments show that (i) turns out to be less useful than expected, while the combination of (ii) and (Hi) alone already gave quite reasonable precision in acquiring trouble expressions.",
        "Each category of evidence is described further below.",
        "Since trouble expressions are hyponyms of \"trouble\", one obvious way of acquiring trouble expressions is to use classical lexico-syntactic patterns for hyponymy acquisition (Hearst, 1992).",
        "Table 1 lists some of the patterns proposed in studies on hyponymy acquisition for Japanese (Ando et al., 2003; Imasumi, 2001) that are utilized in this work.",
        "In actual acquisition, we instantiated the hypernym positions in the patterns by Japanese translations of \"trouble\" and its synonyms, namely toraburu (troubles), sainan (accidents), saigai (disasters) and shougai (obstacles or handicaps), and used the instantiated patterns as evidence.",
        "Hereafter, we call these patterns LSPHs (Lexico-Syntactic Patterns for Hyponymy).",
        "We expect expressions that frequently refer to troubles to have a distinct dependency profile, by which we mean a specific set of dependency relations with verbs (i.e. occurrences in specific argument positions).",
        "If T is a trouble expression, then given a sufficiently large corpus one would expect to find a reasonable number of instantiations of patterns like the following:",
        "• T kept X from doing Y.",
        "• X didn't enjoy Y because of T.",
        "Similarly, \"X enjoyed T\" would present negative evidence for T being a trouble expression.",
        "Rather than single out a set of particular dependency relations suspected to be indicative of trouble expressions, we let a supervised classifier learn an appropriate weight for each feature in a large vector of dependency relations.",
        "Two classes of dependency relations proved to be especially beneficial in determining trouble candidates in an unsupervised manner, so we discuss them in more detail below.",
        "Dependency relations with negated verbs Following our characterization of troubles as things that prevent specific actions from taking place, we expect a good deal of trouble expressions to appear in patterns like the following.",
        "• X cannot go to Y because ofT.",
        "• X did not enjoy Y because ofT.",
        "The important points in the above are (i) the negated verbs and (ii) the mention of T as the reason for not verb-ing.",
        "The following are Japanese translations of the above patterns.",

        "P P V (cannot go)",
        "T de X ga tanoshikunakatta.",
        "We refer to the following dependency relations between expressions marked with the postposition de and negated verbs in these patterns as DNVs (Dependencies to Negated Verbs).",
        "T de – > negated verb",
        "We allow any verb to be the negated verb, expecting that inappropriate verbs will be less weighted by machine learning techniques.",
        "For instance, the dependency relations to negated verbs with an originally negative orientation such as \"suffer\" and \"die\" will not work as positive examples for trouble expressions.",
        "Unfortunately, these patterns still present only weak evidence for trouble expressions.",
        "The precision of the trouble expressions collected using DNV patterns is extremely low – around 6.5%.",
        "This is due to the postposition de's ambiguity – besides \"because of\" relations it also functions as a marker for location, time and instrument relations, among others.",
        "As a result, non-trouble expressions such as \"by car\" (instrument) and \"in Tokyo\" (location) are marked by the postposition de as well.",
        "We consider a second class of dependency relations, acting mostly as a counter to the noisy expressions introduced by the ambiguity of the postposition de.",
        "Dependency relations with non-negated verbs",
        "The final type of evidence is formulated as the following dependency relation.",
        "T de – > non-negated verb",
        "We call this type of relation DAVs (Dependencies to Affirmative Verbs).",
        "The use of these patterns is motivated by the intuition that noisy expressions found with DNVs, such as expressions about locations or instruments, will also frequently appear with non-negated verbs.",
        "That is, if you observe \"cannot go to Y (by / because of) X\" and X is not a trouble expression, then you can expect to find \"can go to Y (by / because of) X\" as well.",
        "Our initial expectation was that the DNV and DAV evidences observed with the postposition de alone would contain sufficient information to obtain an accurate classifier, but this expectation was not borne out by our early experiments.",
        "As it turns out, using dependency relations to verbs in all argument positions as features to the SVM resulted roughly in a 10~15% increase in precision.",
        "Therefore in our final experiments we let the DNV and DAV evidence consist of dependencies with four additional postpositions (ha, ga, wo and ni), which are used to indicate topicalization, subject, object and indirect object.",
        "We found that the SVM was quite successful in learning a dependency profile for trouble expressions based on this information.",

        "Because of the diversity of our evidences (dependencies with verbs) we need a reasonable amount of positive samples in order to obtain an accurate classifier.",
        "Without some sample selection scheme, we would have to manually annotate about 8000 samples in order to obtain only 560 positive samples in the training data.",

        "In our experiments, the top elements included a reasonable number of positive samples (25.8%) while there were almost none in the worst elements.",
        "In this step our aim is to acquire expressions often associated with troubles.",
        "We use a supervised classifier, namely Support Vector Machines (SVMs) (Vapnik, 1998) for distinguishing troubles from non-troubles, based on the evidences described above.",
        "Each dimension of the feature vector presented to the SVM corresponds to the observation of a particular evidence (i.e., these are binary features).",

        "Of this list, 58,570 pairs survived the DNV filtering step and form the final output of our method.",
        "For the DNV filtering, we used the top 30 verbs most frequently co-occurring with the object.",
        "We again evaluated the resulting object-trouble pairs by asking three human raters whether the presented pairs consist of an object and an expression referring to an actual or potential trouble in using the object.",
        "The kappa statistic was 0.60, indicating moderate inter-rater agreement.",
        "Fig.",
        "2 shows the precision of the acquired pairs when comparing with what are considered true object-trouble relations by all three raters.",
        "Some examples of the pairs obtained by our method are listed in table 3 along with their ranking and the number of raters who judged the pair to be correct.",
        "The precision for our proposed method when considering the top 10% of pairs ranked by the / score and filtered by the method described in section 4.3 is 71.5% (\"top 10% proposed\" in Fig. 2), which is actually worse than the results obtained without the final DNV filtering (\"top 10% MI\", 74%).",
        "For the first half of all samples however, we do observe some performance increase by the filtering, though both methods appear to converge in the second half of the graph.",
        "This tendency is mirrored closely when considering the results for the top 50% of all pairs (respectively \"top 50% proposed\" and \"top 50% MI\" in Fig. 2).",
        "The 15% decrease in precision compared to top 10% results indicates that performance drops gradually when moving to the lower ranked pairs.",
