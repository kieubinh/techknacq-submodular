        "In order to obtain the meaning of a sentence automatically, it is necessary to have access to its syntactic analysis at some level of complexity.",
        "Many NLP applications like translation, question-answering, etc.",
        "might benefit from the availability of syntactic parses.",
        "Probabilistic parsers trained over labeled data have high accuracy on in-domain data: lexicalized parsers get an /-score of up to 90.0% on Wall Street Journal data (Charniak and Johnson (2005)'s re-ranking parser), while recently, unlexicalized PCFGs have also been shown to perform much better than previously believed (Klein and Manning, 2003).",
        "However, the limited size of annotated training data results in many parameters of a PCFG being badly estimated when trained on annotated data.",
        "The Zipfian nature of a text corpus results in PCFG parameters related to the properties of specific words being especially badly estimated.",
        "For instance, about 38% of verbs in the training sections of the Penn Treebank (PTB) (Marcus et al., 1993) occur only once - the lexical properties of these verbs (such as their most common subcategorization frames) cannot be represented accurately in a model trained exclusively on the Penn Treebank.",
        "The research reported here addresses this issue.",
        "We start with an unlexicalized PCFG trained on the PTB.",
        "We then re-estimate the parameters of this PCFG from raw text using an unsupervised estimation method based on the Inside-Outside algorithm (Lari and Young, 1990), an instance of the Expectation Maximization algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977) for PCFG induction.",
        "The re-estimation improves /-score on the standard test section of the PTB significantly.",
        "Our focus is on learning lexical parameters i.e. those parameters related to the lexico-syntactic properties of open-class words.",
        "Examples of such properties are: subcategorization frames of verbs and nouns, attachment preference of adverbs to sentential, verbal or nominal nodes, attachment preference of PPs to a verbal or nominal node, etc.",
        "The current research is related to semi-supervised training paradigms like self-training these methods are currently being explored to improve the performance of existing PCFG models by utilizing unlabeled data.",
        "For example, Mc-Closkey et al.",
        "(2006) achieve a 1.1% improvement in labeled bracketing /-score by the use of unlabeled data to self-train the parser-reranker system from Charniak and Johnson (2005).",
        "Earlier research on inside-outside estimation of PCFG models has reported some positive results as well (Pereira and Schabes, 1992; Carroll and Rooth, 1998; Beil et al., 1999; imWalde, 2002).",
        "In some of these cases, an initial model is derived by other means - inside-outside is used to re-estimate the initial model.",
        "However, many questions still remain open about its efficacy for PCFG re-estimation.",
        "Grammars used previously have not been treebank grammars (for e.g., Carroll and Rooth (1998) and Beil et al.",
        "(1999) used handcrafted grammars), hence these models could not be evaluated according to standardized evaluations in the parsing literature.",
        "In the current work, we use a Perm Treebank based grammar; hence all re-estimated grammars can be evaluated using standardized criteria.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows: First, we describe in brief the construction of an unlexicalized PCFG from the PTB.",
        "We then describe a procedure based on the inside-outside algorithm to re-estimate the lexical parameters of this PCFG from unlabeled Wall Street Journal data.",
        "Finally, we present evaluations of the re-estimated models, based on labeled bracketing measures and on the detection of subcategorization frames of verbs: there is a 31.6% reduction in error for novel verbs and up to 8.97% reduction in overall subcategorization error."

        "In our framework, treebank trees are augmented with extra features; the methodology involves constructing a feature-constraint grammar from a context-free treebank backbone grammar.",

        "), the subject type of clausal nodes, the attachment of adverbs, valence of nouns, etc.",

        "To measure the impact of more unlabeled training data, we ran the interleaved procedure with 8M words of WSJ text.",
        "The sf error for novel verbs reduces to 22.06% in the 2nd iteration (significantly different from the best error of 22.81% in the 5thiteration for 4M words of training data)).",
        "We also get an improved overall error reduction of 9.9% on Testset II for the larger training data, as compared to 8.97% previously.",
        "While there has been substantial previous work on the task of sf acquisition from corpora (Brent (1991); Manning (1993); Briscoe and Carroll (1997); Korhonen (2002), amongst others), we find that relatively few parsing-based evaluations are reported.",
        "Since their goal is to build probabilistic sf dictionaries, these systems are evaluated either against existing dictionaries, or on distributional similarity measures.",
        "Most are evaluated on testsets of Az'gA-frequency verbs (unlike the present work), in order to gauge the effectiveness of the acquisition strategy.",
        "Briscoe and Carroll (1997) report a token-based evaluation for seven verb types-their system gets an average recall accuracy of 80.9% for these verbs (which appear to be high-frequency verbs).",
        "This is slightly lower than the present system, which has an overall accuracy of 83.16% (on Testset II (It 1), as shown in Table 4).",
        "However, for low frequency verbs (exemplars <10) they report that their results are around chance.",
        "A parsing evaluation of their lexicon using an unlexicalized grammar as baseline, on 250 sentences from the Suzanne treebank gave a small (but not statistically significant) improvement in /-score (from 71.49 to 72.14%).",
        "Korhonen (2002) reports a parsing-based evaluation on 500 test sentences.",
        "She found a small increase in/score (of grammatical relations markup) from 76.03 to 76.76.",
        "In general parse-val measures are not very sensitive to subcatego-rization (Carroll et al., 1998); they therefore use a dependency-based evaluation.",
        "In the present research as well, we obtain statistically significant but quite small improvements in /-score (§4).",
        "Since we are interested in acquisition of PCFG lexicons, we focus our evaluations on verbal subcategorization of token occurrences of verbs in viterbi parses."

        "We have presented a methodology for incorporating additional lexical information from unlabeled data into an unlexicalized treebank PCFG.",
        "We obtain a large error reduction (31.6%) in sf detection for novel verbs as compared to a treebank baseline.",
        "The interleaved re-estimation scheme gives a significant increase in labeled bracketing scores from a relatively small unlabeled corpus.",
        "The interleaved scheme has an advantage over standard inside-outside PCFG estimation, as measured both by labeled bracketing scores and on the task of detecting sfs of novel verbs.",
        "Since our re-estimated models are treebank models, all evaluations are against treebank standards.",
        "The grammar we worked with has very few incorporated features compared to the grammar used by, say Klein and Manning (2003).",
        "It would make sense to experiment with grammars with much richer sets of incorporated features.",
        "Features related to structure-selection by categories other than verbs - nouns, adverbs and adjectives - might be beneficial.",
        "These features should be incorporated as PCFG parameters, similar to verbal subcate-gorization.",
        "Experiments with 8 million words of training data gave significantly better results than with 4 million words, indicating that larger training sets will be beneficial as well.",
        "It would also be useful to make the transformation T of lexical parameters sensitive to treebank frequency of words.",
        "For instance, more weight should be given to the treebank model rather than the corpus model for mid-to-high frequency words, by making the parameter A in T sensitive to frequency.",
        "This methodology is relevant to the task of domain-adaption.",
        "Hara et al.",
        "(2007) find that retraining a model of HPSG lexical entry assignments is more critical for domain adaptation than retraining a structural model alone.",
        "Our PCFG captures many of the important dependencies captured in a framework like HPSG; in addition, we can use unlabeled data from a new domain in an unsupervised fashion for re-estimating lexical parameters, an important consideration in domain-adaption.",
        "Preliminary experiments on this task using New York Times unlabeled data with the PTB-trained PCFG show promising results."
