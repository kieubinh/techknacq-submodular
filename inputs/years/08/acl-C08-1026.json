        "Category induction techniques generally rely on local contexts, i.e., surrounding words, to cluster word types together (e.g., Clark, 2003; Schiitze, 1995), using information of a kind also found in human category acquisition tasks (e.g., Mintz, 2002, 2003).",
        "Such information is also at the core of standard part-of-speech (POS) tagging, or disambiguation, methods (see, e.g., Manning and Schiitze, 1999, ch.",
        "10), with the contexts generally abstracted to POS tags.",
        "The contextual information is similar in both tasks because induction is founded in part upon the notion that local contexts are useful for disambiguation: one morphosyntac-tically clusters words which should have the same category in the same contexts.",
        "But which contexts count as being the \"same\"?",
        "And to what extent do categories based on context distributions resemble corpus annotation categories?",
        "Since disambiguation is in some sense more primary, to begin to answer these questions we investigate which representations are effective for category disambiguation.",
        "Disambiguating a word's category in context has of course been explored in other situations, especially POS tagging.",
        "Rarely, however, has it been shown as to which information is the most accurate at disambiguation and which information is absolutely necessary, without mixing these issues with other tagging issues, such as smoothing and unknown word tagging.",
        "We need techniques which isolate disambiguation, placing less emphasis on generalizing contexts to new data.",
        "To determine the essential information needed for accurate disambiguation, we start with a precise model and generalize it.",
        "Changing the model in small ways and evaluating the resulting precision will indicate how particular aspects of the representation are contributing to successful disambiguation.",
        "The central question of this paper is: which representation (of a word and its context) indicates that two situations should be categorized the same?",
        "In this context, POS annotation error detection provides an ideal setting to explore representations for disambiguation.",
        "Error detection relies on the assumption that words should be annotated consistently – in other words, contexts are grouped which accurately identify the category of a word as being consistent – and it does this with an emphasis on high precision.",
        "In essence, error detection already investigates where disambiguation can be done, often using local contexts (e.g., Dickinson, 2005).",
        "With an emphasis on high precision, however, many corpus instances are essentially uncat-egorized and are thus in need of generalization.",
        "To get at the central question of an appropriate representation for disambiguation, then, our task is to generalize error detection and increase the recall of errors found in a corpus by exploiting more general properties of a corpus.",
        "Given that annotation errors can have a profound impact on the quality of training and testing on such data (see Dickinson, 2005, ch.",
        "1), this task also serves an immense practical need in its own right.",
        "In exploring error detection recall, we can connect the task to another with much of the same emphasis.",
        "Human category acquisition experiments have also focused on precision: instead of asking how every word is categorized, they examine how some words are categorized, from which others can be bootstrapped.",
        "As outlined in sections 2 and 3, we can use such studies as a starting point for generalizing error detection."

        "The error detection method we build from is the variation n-gram method (Dickinson and Meur-ers, 2003; Dickinson, 2005).",
        "The approach detects items which occur multiple times in the corpus with varying annotation, the so-called variation nuclei.",
        "A nucleus with its repeated surrounding context is referred to as a variation n-gram.",
        "Every detected variation in the annotation of a nucleus is classified as an error or a genuine ambiguity using a basic heuristic requiring at least one word of context on each side of the nucleus.",
        "For example, in the WSI corpus, part of the Penn Treebank 3 release (Marcus et al., 1993), the string in (1) is a variation 12-gram since off is a variation nucleus that is tagged preposition (IN) in one corpus occurrence and particle (RP) in another.",
        "Dickinson (2005) shows that examining those cases with identical local context – in this case, looking at ward off a – results in an estimated error detection precision of 92.5%.",
        "(1) toward off a hostile takeover attempt by two European shipping concerns",
        "This method can be applied to syntactic annotation, and for this annotation, one can increase the recall of errors found by abstracting the nuclei to POS tags (Boyd et al., 2007).",
        "Clearly, this is not a feasible abstraction here, given that we are attempting to detect errors in POS annotation.",
        "Research on language acquisition has addressed the question of how humans discover and learn categories of words, using virtually the same contexts as in the variation n-gram method.",
        "Mintz (2002) shows that local context, in the form of a frame of two words surrounding a target word, leads to categorization in adults of the target, and Mintz (2003) shows that frequent frames supply category information, consistent across child language corpora.",
        "A frame is defined as \"two jointly occurring words with one word intervening\" (Mintz, 2003), e.g., you __ it.",
        "The frame is not decomposed into its left side and right side (cf., e.g., Redington et al., 1998; Clark, 2003), but instead is taken as the occurrence of both sides.",
        "The target word is the intervening word, but it is not included in the frame (unlike variation nuclei).",
        "For category acquisition, only frequent frames are used, those with a frequency above a certain threshold.",
        "Frequent frames predict category membership: the set of words appearing in a given frame should represent a single category.",
        "The frequent frame you __ it, for example, largely identifies verbs, as shown in (2), taken from the CHILDES database of child-directed speech (MacWhinney, 2000).",
        "Analyzing the frequent frames in six subcorpora of CHILDES, Mintz (2003) obtains both high type and high token accuracy in grouping words into the same categories.",
        "To take this work as a basis for investigating disambiguation, some points are in order about the results.",
        "First, accuracies slightly degrade when moving from the \"Standard Labeling\" category set to the more fine-grained \"Expanded Labeling\" category set, i.e., a .98 to .91 drop in token accuracy and .93 to .91 drop in type accuracy.",
        "It is not clear what happens with even more fine-grained corpus tagsets.",
        "Secondly, Mintz (2003) assumes that, at least for his experiments, each word has only one class (see also Redington et al., 1998, p. 439-440).",
        "The tasks of category induction and category disambiguation are thus conflated into a single step.",
        "We do not know for sure whether frames induce coherent sets of words or whether they accurately disambiguate a word, or both.",
        "In other words, can frames be used to group the target words (induction) or to group the contexts (disambiguation)?",
        "While we investigate using frames for disambiguation in English (and somewhat in German), the concept of a frame has been shown to be cross-linguistically viable (Chemla et al., in press), and in principle could extend to languages encoding relations through morphology instead of linear order (see the discussion in Mintz, 2003)."

        "As a (frequent) frame does not include the target, predicting that the category within that context is always the same, a first step in abstracting the nucleus is to require no similarity between nuclei.",
        "We thus search for all identical nuclei with frame context – or what we will call framed variation nuclei – such that there is variation in labeling for the nucleus, but we require no identity of the nucleus.",
        "We investigate the WSJ portion of the Penn Treebank, and, to provide more robust evaluation, also compare the TIGER corpus of German, version 2 (Brants et al., 2002) where appropriate.",

        "Of the 100, 79 of the cases contain at least one error, and 15 of these cases are new examples, i.e., cases without identical words.",
        "With a point estimate of .79, we estimate 3263 errors and obtain a 95% confidence interval of (0.7102,0.8698), meaning that we predict between 2933 and 3593 of the 4131 cases contain errors.",
        "The 79 erroneous cases point to 134 token errors, of which 23 are new.",
        "In addition to increasing the recall of the method, the cases are arguably more thoroughly grouped than before.",
        "For instance, we see in (5) that both pretax and third-quarter vary between JJ and NN in the variation said JJ/NN profit, with first-half additionally appearing only as JJ.",
        "Since JJ is the correct tag for all instances, the two NN errors are detected with word nuclei, but here all the relevant examples are together.",
        "This provides evidence for the claim that an ambiguity class is a level of abstraction supporting identical disambiguation in the same context.",
        "pretax/JJ , third-quarter/NN , pretax/NN } profit",
        "The recall has increased, but 79% is below the 92.5% precision previously obtained for the variation n-gram method with word nuclei (Dickinson, 2005).",
        "However, that result used distinct variation nuclei, meaning that the longest contexts were examined before working down to shorter contexts.",
        "Furthermore, it is not clear how well the original word nuclei method scales up to larger corpora.",
        "Some of the new false positives we observe would likely be false positives for word nuclei, given more data.",
        "For example, the new method turns up generally VBD/VBN the as a false positive, as in (6), because of the non-local tagset distinction and short context.",

        "For error detection, this means 84 of the 100 samples lead to some kind of POS error; for investigating disambiguation contexts, this means that 83% (79/95) of the cases support complete disambiguation.",
        "Thus, when abstracting to ambiguity class nuclei, local context generally provides sufficient information for disambiguation (see also section 6).",
        "One limitation of the variation n-gram method is the fact that some distinctions often need non-local information (cf. (6)).",
        "A bigger problem for grouping words by ambiguity classes is the fact that annotation can be semantically-based.",

        "In addition to the disambiguation accuracy of frames, we can look at the accuracy of word tokens identified by frames.",
        "To gauge this, we identify the most likely tag of each framed variation nucleus and assign it to all instances of the nucleus.",
        "In the case of ties, one tag is randomly selected; since we are only calculating overall word token accuracy, the exact tag selected is unimportant.",
        "The results of comparing to the benchmark tags are given in table 2.",
        "Even though the abstraction to no information identifies more word tokens, the ambiguity class abstraction correctly categorizes nearly as many words.",
        "With the smaller and likely more accurately tagged TIGER corpus, we find exactly the same trends, as shown in table 3.",

        "The poor accuracy for framed nuclei with no information indicates that methods which intend to match corpus annotation categories could face difficulties in obtaining a single category without using more information.",

        "Motivated by work on category acquisition, we have shown that local contexts – i.e., immediately surrounding words, or frames – can delineate corpus categories when the level of abstraction for the word to be disambiguated indicates some inherent properties of the word, namely the categories it can have.",
        "By abstracting away from lexical items to broader classes of words, we have been able to increase the recall of an error detection method without much drop in its precision.",
        "Having successfully defined a representation for disambiguation, the next step is to make the representation more general, in order to include more comparable instances.",
        "As what we have done is essentially a form of nearest neighbor classification, one could in the future explore more sophisticated techniques to cluster contexts.",
        "At the same time, we wish to use as little annotated knowledge as possible.",
        "Thus, an orthogonal line of research can involve inducing classes for words which are more general than single categories, i.e., something akin to ambiguity classes (see, e.g., the discussion of ambiguity class guessers in Goldberg et al., 2008).",
        "This could make error detection completely independent of the annotation and, more importantly, lead to an improved understanding of the best knowledge-free representation for disambiguation.",
        "Since induction is founded to some extent upon disambiguating contexts, this work has some bearing on the evaluation of induced categories with corpus annotation; not only is there more than one tagset in existence (see discussion in Clark, 2003), but annotation schemes make distinctions that morphosyntactic contexts cannot readily capture.",
        "For example, there is an implicit notion of inherency in the distinction between JJ and NN in the Penn Treebank (Santorini, 1990, p. 12-13).",
        "Fully outlining these inherent properties could provide insights into induction and its evaluation.",
