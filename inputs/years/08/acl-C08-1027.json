        "Lhe emergence of phrase-based statistical machine translation (PSML) (Koehn et al., 2003) has been one of the major developments in statistical approaches to translation.",
        "Allowing translation of word sequences (phrases) instead of single words provides SML with a robustness in word selection and local word reordering.",
        "PSML has two means of reordering the words.",
        "Either a phrase pair has been learned where the target word order differs from the source (phrase internal reordering), or distance penalized orderings of target phrases are attempted in decoding (phrase external reordering).",
        "Lhe first solution is strong, the second is weak.",
        "Lhe second solution is necessary for reorderings within a previously unseen sequence or over distances greater than the maximal phrase length.",
        "In this case, the system in essence relies on the target side language model to get the correct word order.",
        "Lhe choice is made without knowing what the source is.",
        "Basically, it is a bias against phrase external reordering.",
        "It seems clear that reordering often depends on higher level linguistic information, which is absent from PSML.",
        "In recent work, there has been some progress towards integrating syntactic information with the statistical approach to reordering.",
        "In works such as (Xia and McCord, 2004; Collins et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2007; Habash, 2007), reordering decisions are done \"determinis-tically\", thus placing these decisions outside the actual PSML system by learning to translate from a reordered source language.",
        "(Crego and Marino, 2007; Zhang et al., 2007; Li et al., 2007) are more in the spirit of PSML, in that multiple reorderings are presented to the PSML system as (possibly weighted) options.",
        "Still, there remains a basic conflict between the syntactic reordering rules and the PSML system: one that is most likely due to the discrepancy between the translation units (phrases) and units of the linguistic rules, as (Zhang et al., 2007) point out.",
        "In this paper, we proceed in the spirit of the non-deterministic approaches by providing the decoder with multiple source reorderings.",
        "But instead of scoring the input word order, we score the order of the output.",
        "By doing this, we avoid the integration problems of previous approaches.",
        "It should be noted that even though the experimerits are conducted within a source reordering approach, this scoring is also compatible with other approach.",
        "We will, however, not look further into this possiblity in the present paper.",
        "In addition, we automatically learn reordering rules based on several levels of linguistic information from word form to subordination and syntactic structure to produce reordering rules that are not restricted to operations on syntactic tree structure nodes.",
        "In the next section, we discuss and contrast related work.",
        "Section 3 describes aspects of English and Danish structure that are relevant to reordering.",
        "Section 4 describes the automatic induction of reordering rules and its integration in PSMT.",

        "While several recent authors have achieved positive results, it has been difficult to integrate syntactic information while retaining the strengths of the statistical approach.",
        "Several approaches do deterministic reordering.",
        "These do not integrate the reordering in the PSMT system; instead they place it outside the system by first reordering the source language, and then having a PSMT system translate from reordered source language to target language.",
        "(Collins et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2007) do this using manually created rules, and (Xia and McCord, 2004) and (Habash, 2007) use automatically extracted rules.",
        "All use rules extracted from syntactic parses.",
        "As mentioned by (Al-Onaizan and Papineni, 2006) , it can be problematic that these deterministic choices are beyond the scope of optimization and cannot be undone by the decoder.",
        "That is, there is no way to make up for bad information in later translation steps.",
        "Another approach is non-deterministic.",
        "This provides the decoder with both the original and the reordered source sentence.",
        "(Crego and Marino, 2007) operate within Ngram-based SMT.",
        "They make use of syntactic structure to reorder the input into a word lattice.",
        "Since the paths are not weighted, the lattice merely narrows down the size of the search space.",
        "The decoder is not given reason to trust one path (reordering) over another.",
        "(Zhang et al., 2007) assign weights to the paths of their input word lattice.",
        "Instead of hierarchical linguistic structure, they use reordering rules based on POS and syntactic chunks, and train the system with both original and reordered source word order on a restricted data set (<500K words).",
        "Their system does not outperform a standard PSMT system.",
        "As they themselves point out, a reason for this might be that their reordering approach is not fully integrated with PSMT.",
        "This is one of the main problems addressed in the present work.",
        "(Li et al., 2007) use weighted n-best lists as input for the decoder.",
        "They use rules based on a syntactic parse, allowing children of a tree node to swap place.",
        "This is excessively restrictive.",
        "For example, a common reordering in English-Danish translation has the subject change place with the finite verb.",
        "Since the verb is often embedded in a VP containing additional words that should not be moved, such rules cannot be captured by local reordering on tree nodes.",
        "In many cases, the exact same word order that is obtained through a source sentence reordering, is also accessible through a phrase internal reordering.",
        "A negative consequence of source order (SO) scoring as done by (Zhang et al., 2007) and (Li et al., 2007) is that they bias against the valuable phrase internal reorderings by only promoting the source sentence reordering.",
        "As described in section 4.3, we solve this problem by reordering the input string, but scoring the output string, thus allowing the strengths of PSMT to coexist with rule-based reordering."

        "Translation 2) illustrates the handling of adverbials.",
        "The first reordering is in a main clause, therefore, the adverbial is moved to the right of the finite verb.",

        "The English 'aims to' corresponds to the Danish 'sigter mod', which the SPTO approach gets correct.",
