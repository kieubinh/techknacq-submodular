        "A wide variety of grammar formalisms have been explored in the past for parsing natural language sentences.",
        "The most prominent of these formalisms has been context free grammars (CFGs) but a collection of formalisms known as categorial grammar (CG) (Ajdukiewicz, 1935; Dowty et al., 1981; Steedman, 2000) has received interest because of some significant advantages over CFGs.",
        "First, CG is inherently lexicalized due to the fact that all of the variation between grammars is captured by the lexicon.",
        "This is a result of the rich categories which CG uses in its lexicon to specify the functor-argument relationships between lexical items.",
        "A distinct advantage of this lexicalization is that the processing of sentences depends upon only those categories contained in the string and not some global set of rules.",
        "Second, CG has the advantage that it centrally adopts the principle of compositionality, as outlined in Montague grammar (Montague, 1974), allowing the semantic derivation to exactly parallel the syntactic derivation.",
        "This leads to a semantical form which is easily extractable from the syntactic parse.",
        "A large number of CG formalisms have been introduced including, among others, the Lambek calculus (Lambek, 1958) and Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) (Steedman, 2000).",
        "Of these, CCG has received the most zealous computational attention.",
        "Impressive results have been achieved culminating in the state-of-the-art parser of Clark and Curran (2004) which has been used as the parser for the Pascal Rich Textual Entailment Challenge entry of Bos and Markert (2005).",
        "The appeal of CCG can be attributed to the existence of efficient parsing algorithms for it and the fact that it recognizes a mildly context-sensitive language class (Joshi et al., 1989), a language class more powerful than the context free languages (CFLs) that has been argued to be necessary for natural language syntax.",
        "The Lambek calculus provides an ideal contrast between CCG and CFGs by being a CG formalism like CCG but by recognizing the CFLs like CFGs (Pentus, 1997).",
        "The primary goal of this paper is to provide an algorithm for parsing with the Lambek calculus and to sketch its correctness.",
        "Furthermore, a time bound of 0(n) will be shown for this algorithm when restricted to product-free categories of bounded order (see section 2 for a definition).",
        "The restriction to bounded order is not a significant restriction, due to the fact that categories in CCG-bank (Hockenmaier, 2003), a CCG corpus, have a maximum order of 5 and an average order of 0.78 by token.",
        "In addition to the presentation of the algorithm, we will provide a parameterized set of inputs (of unbounded order) on which the algorithm has exponential running time.",
        "The variant of the Lambek calculus considered here is the product-free Lambek calculus chosen for three reasons.",
        "First, it is the foundation of all other non-associative variants of the Lambek calculus including the original Lambek calculus (Lambek, 1958) and the multi-modal Lambek calculus (Moortgat, 1996).",
        "Second, the calculus with product is NP-complete (Pentus, 2006), while the sequent derivability in the product-free fragment is still unknown.",
        "Finally, the only connectives included are / and \\, which are the same connectives as in CCG, providing a corpus for future work such as building a probabilistic Lambek calculus parser."

        "For example, the category for transitive verbs is (NP\\S)/NP and the category for adverbs is (S/NP)\\(S/NP).",
        "Intuitively, the \\ and / operators specify the arguments of a word and the direction in which those arguments need to be found.",
        "Next, the sequent is built by combining the sequence of the categories for the words with the h symbol and the sentence category (e.g. S).",
