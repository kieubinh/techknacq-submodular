        "Inspired by Ge et al. (1998) probabilistic model for pronoun resolution, we have developed a model for resolution of non-pronominal anaphora in biomedical texts.",
        "The probabilistic model results from a simple decomposition process applied to a conditional probability equation that involves several parameters (features).",
        "The decomposition makes use of Bayes' theorem and independence assumptions, and aims to decrease the impact of data sparseness on the model, so that even small training corpora can be viable.",
        "The decomposed model can be understood as a more sophisticated version of the naive-Bayes algorithm, since we consider the dependence among some of the features instead of full independence as in naive Bayes.",
        "Probabilistic models can return a confidence measure (probability) for each decision they make, while decision trees, for example, cannot.",
        "Another advantage of this type of model is the fact that they consider the prior probability of each class, while other machine-learning techniques such as SVMs and neural networks do not.",
        "Our model seeks to classify the relation between an anaphoric expression and an antecedent candidate as coreferent, associative or neither.",
        "It computes the probability of each pair of anaphor and candidate for each class.",
        "The candidate with the highest overall probability for each class is selected as the antecedent for that class, or no antecedent is selected if the probability of no relation overcomes the positive probabilities; in this case, the expression is considered to be new to the discourse.",
        "Coreferent cases are the ones in which the anaphoric expression and its antecedent refer to the same entity in the real world, as below:",
        "(1) \"The expression of reaper has been shown ... the gene encodes ...\"",
        "Associative cases are the ones in which the anaphoric expression and its antecedent refer to different entities, but where the antecedent plays a role in defining the meaning of the anaphoric expression, as in Example 2:",
        "(2) \"Drosophila gene Bok interacts with ... expression of Bok protein",
        "promotes apoptosis ...\"",
        "Discourse new cases usually consist of the first mention of an entity in the text, so no antecedent can be found for it.",
        "We have focused on the biomedical domain for two reasons.",
        "Firstly, there is a vast demand from the biomedical field for information extraction efforts (which require NLP processing, including anaphora resolution), in order to process the exponentially increasing number of journal publications, which are the major source of novel knowledge to be extracted and condensed into domain databases for easy access.",
        "Secondly, anaphora resolution can benefit from the several sources of refined semantic knowledge that are not commonly available for other domains, such as biomedical databases, ontologies, and terminologies.",
        "In the next section, we describe the anaphoric relations that we found in biomedical texts, which we are considering for the resolution process.",
        "In Section 3 we describe our probabilistic model, and in Section 4 the corpus created for training it.",
        "In Section 5 we present and discuss the results achieved by the model, and compare it with a baseline system and a decision-tree-based system."

        "Biomedical texts differ from other genres of text (e.g. newswire, fiction) in several points.",
        "Different types of NPs have a particular distribution in biomedical articles.",
        "For example, pronouns are very rare, accounting for a very small percentage of the noun phrases; on the other hand, proper names occur very often, given the frequent mention of gene and protein names and the names of other biomedical entities.",
        "A system for anaphora resolution in the biomedical domain can benefit from focusing on the most common types of noun phrases, that is, non-pronominal ones.",
        "In biomedical articles, the reader needs background knowledge to understand the underlying relation between the entities mentioned in the text in order to understand the text.",
        "For instance, in Example 2 the reader is expected to know that a gene encodes a protein (which usually carries its name), so that he/she can capture the anaphoric relation and understand the sentence.",
        "This aspect emphasises the need for semantic information as part of the anaphora resolution process.",
        "Another aspect affecting the anaphoric relations in biomedical texts are the writing conventions adopted in the biomedical domain to distinguish between the mention of a gene name and the mention of the protein encoded by that gene.",
        "The most usual convention is writing gene names with lowercase italicised letters and protein names with non-italicised uppercase letters.",
        "The existence of such conventions allows for constructions where the reader keeps the conventions in mind to understand the text, as below.",

        "Among the associative cases present in biomedical text, we were able to distinguish two main types of relations.",
        "The first, which we call \"bio-type\" relations, are associative relations between biomedical entities with different semantic types, which we call biotypes (e.g. gene, gene product, part of gene).",

        "If we take into account the specific biotype of the entities that are involved in a biotype relation, it is possible to determine a WordNet-like semantic relation behind the anaphora relation.",
        "For example, a biotype relation between a 'gene' and a 'variant' of gene can be considered an hyponymy relation, the relation between a 'gene' and a transcript (part of gene) can be seen as a meronymy relation.",
        "The second type of associative relation is more common to other domains as well, we call it \"set-member\" relation.",

        "(2006).",
        "To identify all NPs, their subconstituents (head, modifiers, determiner) and broader pre-and post-modification patterns, we have used the RASP parser (Briscoe et al., 2006).",
        "To classify the NPs according to their type in biomedical terms, we have adopted the Sequence Ontology (SO) (Eilbeck and Lewis, 2004).",
        "SO is a fine-grained ontology, which contains the names of practically all entities that participate in genomic sequences, besides the relations among these entities (e.g. is-a, part-of, derived-from relations).",
        "We derived from SO seven biotypes to be used to classify the entities in the text, namely: \"gene\", \"gene product\", \"part of gene\", \"part of product\", \"gene variant\", \"gene subtype\", and \"gene supertype\".",

        "More than 70% of the proper names take part in coreference relations, as they inherently refer to a specific named entity, but nevertheless 5% of them take part in associative biotype relations, due to the fact that a gene and the protein it synthesizes usually share the same name.",

        "If no antecedent that matches these criteria is found, the anaphor is considered discourse new.",
        "Column 'baseline' on Table 5 shows the performance scores for the baseline system.",
        "The scores for coreferent cases are reasonable, despite being below our probabilistic model, while the scores for associative cases, especially recall, are considerably lower.",
        "The baseline system relies on some sort of string matching between anaphor and antecedent, and is not able to infer a relation between expressions when the matching does not happen.",
        "That is one of the main aspects that the probabilistic system tries to overcome by weighting the contribution of all features.",
        "We also compared our model to a system based on decision trees, since this approach has been taken by several corpus-based anaphora resolution systems (Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002; Strube et al., 2002).",
        "We have induced a decision tree using the C4.5 algorithm implemented in the Weka tool (Witten and Frank, 2005); we have used the same features used for our probabilistic model.",
        "We selected as the antecedent the candidate which is the closest one to the anaphor for which a class other then 'none' is assigned by the decision tree.",
        "The 'perfect' and 'relaxed' scores for C4.5 are presented in the last two columns of Table 5.",
        "We note that the difference between 'perfect' and 'relaxed' scores is not as large as for our probabilistic model; that shows that decision trees are more often getting even the coreference chain wrong, not just the closest antecedent.",
        "We assume this is due to the lack of ranking among the candidates, since we adopt the default strategy of selecting the closest candidate that gets a positive class according to the tree.",
        "The main disadvantage of both the baseline and decision tree systems when compared to the probabilistic model, besides the lower performance, is that they do not provide a probability assigned to each decision they make, which makes it impossible to know how confident the model is for different cases and to take advantage of that information to improve the system.",
        "This aspect also makes it difficult to develop a consistent strategy for returning multiple antecedents for set-member cases, since there is no obvious way to do it."
