        "Semantic Web and knowledge management applications require to populate the concepts of their domain ontologies with individuals and find their relationships from various data sources, including databases and natural language texts.",
        "As the extensional part of an ontology (the ABox) is often manually populated, this activity can be very time-consuming, requiring considerable human effort.",
        "The development of automatic techniques for ontology population is then a crucial research area.",
        "Natural language processing techniques are natural candidates to solve this problem as most of the data contained in the Web and in the companies' intranets is free text.",
        "Information extraction (IE) is commonly employed to (semi-) automate such a task.",
        "Current state-of-the-art IE systems are mostly based on general purpose supervised machine learning techniques (e.g., kernel methods).",
        "However, supervised systems achieve acceptable accuracy only if they are supplied with a sufficiently large amount of training data, usually consisting of manually annotated texts.",
        "Consequently, they can be only used to populate top-level concepts of ontologies (e.g., people, locations, organizations).",
        "In fact, when the number of subclasses increases the number of annotated documents required to find sufficient positive examples for all subclasses becomes too large to be practical.",
        "As domain ontologies usually contain hundreds of concepts arranged in deep class/subclass hierarchies, alternative techniques have to be found to recognize fine-grained distinctions (e.g., to categorize people as scientists and scientists as physicists, mathematicians, biologists, etc.",
        ").",
        "In this paper, we present an approach to the classification of named entities into fine-grained ontological categories based on a method successfully employed in lexical substitution.",
        "In particular, we predict the fine-grained category of a named entity, previously recognized, by simply estimating the plausibility of sentences where the entity to be classified is substituted with the ones contained in the training data, in our case, a partially populated ontology.",
        "In most of the cases, ontologies are partially populated during the development phase and after that the annotation cost is practically negligible, making this method highly attractive in many applicative domains.",
        "This allows us to define an instance-based learning approach for fine-grained entity categorization that exploits the Web to collect evidence of the new entities and does not require any labeled text for supervision, only a partially populated ontology.",
        "Therefore, it can be used in different domains and languages to enrich an existing ontology with new entities extracted from texts by a named-entity recognition system and/or databases.",
        "We evaluated our method on the benchmark proposed by Tanev and Magnini (2006) to provide a fair comparison with other approaches, and on a general purpose ontology of people derived from WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) to perform a more extensive evaluation.",
        "Specifically, the experiments were designed to investigate the effectiveness of our approach at different levels of generality and with different amounts of training data.",
        "The results show that it significantly outperforms the baseline methods and, where a comparison is possible, other approaches and achieves a good performance with a small number of examples per category.",

        "Our approach is based on the assumption that entities that occur in similar contexts belong to the same concept(s).",
        "This can be seen as a special case of the distributional hypothesis, that is, terms that occur in the same contexts tend to have similar meanings (Harris, 1954).",
        "If our assumption is correct, then given an instance in different contexts one can substitute it with another of the same ontological type (i.e., of the same category) and probably generate true statements.",
        "In fact, most of the predicates that can be asserted for an instance of a particular category can also be asserted for other instances of the same category.",
        "For instance, the sentence \"Ayr-ton Senna is a Fl Legend\" preserves its truthfulness when Ayrton Senna is replaced with Michael Schumacher, while it is false when Ayrton Senna is replaced with the MotoGP champion Valentino Rossi.",
        "For our purposes, the Web provides a simple and effective solution to the problem of determining whether a statement is true or false.",
        "Due to the high redundancy of the Web, the high frequency of a statement generated by a substitution usually provides sufficient evidence for its truth, allowing us to easily implement an automatic method for finegrained entity classification.",
        "Following this intuition, we developed an ontology population technique adopting pre-classified entities as training data (i.e., a partially populated ontology) to classify new ones.",
        "When a new instance has to be classified, we first collect snippets containing it from the Web.",
        "Then, for each snippet, we substitute the new instance with each of the training instances.",
        "The snippets play a crucial role in our approach because we expect that they provide the features that characterize the category to which the entity belongs.",
        "Thus, it is important to collect a sufficiently large number of snippets to capture the features that allow a fine-grained classification.",
        "To estimate the correctness of each substitution, we calculate a plausibility score using a modified version of the lexical substitution algorithm introduced in Giuliano et al.",
        "(2007), that assigns higher scores to the substitutions that generate highly frequent sentences on the Web.",

        "This technique achieved the state-of-the-art performance on the English Lexical Substitution task at SemEval 2007 (McCarthy and Navigli, 2007).",

        "For instance, 3 snippets for the candidate instance Ayrton Senna are \"The death of Ayrton Senna at the 1994 San Marino GP\", \"triple world champion Ayrton Senna\", and \"about Fl legend Ayrton Senna\".",

        "(2007).",
        "In our case, Sj is given by the sum of the point-wise mutual information (PMI) of all the n-grams (1 < n ^ 5) that contain j divided by the self-information of the right and left contexts.",
        "Dividing by the self-information allows us to penalize the hypotheses that have contexts with a low information content, such as sequences of stop words.",
        "The frequency of the n-grams is estimated from the Web IT 5-gram corpus.",
        "For instance, from the hypothesis phrase \"about Fl legend Michael Schumacher\", we generate and score the following n-grams: \"legend Michael Schumacher\", \"Fl legend Michael Schumacher\", and \"about Fl legend Michael Schumacher\".",
        "Step 4 To obtain an overall score sc for the category c, we sum the scores obtained from each training instance of category c for all snippets, as defined in Equation 1.",

        "WordNet and Wikipedia were used as primary data sources for populating the evaluation ontology.",
        "In total, the ontology is populated with 280 instances which were not ambiguous (with respect to the ontology).",

        "The benchmark described in the previous section is clearly a toy problem, and it does not allow us to evaluate the effectiveness of our method, in particular the ability to perform fine-grained classifications.",
        "To address this problem, we developed a larger ontology of people (called People Ontology), characterized by a complex taxonomy having multiple layers and containing thousands of instances.",
        "This ontology has been extracted from WordNet, that we adapted to our purpose after a re-engineering phase.",
        "In fact, we need a formal specification of the conceptualizations that are expressed by means of WordNet's synsets, and, in particular, we need a clear distinction between individuals and categories, as well as a robust categorization mechanism to assign individuals to general concepts.",
        "This result can be achieved by following the directives defined by Gangemi et al.",

        "Brin (1998) defined a methodology to extract information from the Web starting from a small set of seed examples, then alternately learning extraction patterns from seeds, and further seeds from patterns.",
        "Despite the fact that the evaluation was on relation extraction the method is general and might be applied to entity extraction and categorization.",
        "The approach was further extended by Agichtein and Gravano (2000).",
        "Our approach differs from theirs in that we do not learn patterns.",
        "Thus, we do not require ad hoc strategies for generating patterns and estimating their reliability, a crucial issue in these approaches as \"bad\" patterns may extract wrong seeds instances that in turn may generate even more inaccurate patterns in the following iteration.",
        "Fleischman and Hovy (2002) approached the ontology population problem as a supervised classification task.",
        "They compare different machine learning algorithms, providing instances in their context as training examples as well as more global semantic information derived from topic signature and WordNet.",
        "Alfonseca and Manandhar (2002) and Cimiano and Volker (2005) present similar approaches relying on the Harris' distributional hypothesis and the vector-space model.",
        "They assign a particular instance represented by a certain context vector to the concept corresponding to the most similar vector.",
        "Contexts are represented using lexical-syntactic features.",
        "KnowItAll (Etzioni et al., 2005) uses a search engine and semantic patterns (similar to those defined by Hearst (1992)) to classify named entities on the Web.",
        "The approach uses simple techniques from the ontology learning field to perform extraction and then annotation.",
        "It also is able to perform very simple pattern induction, consisting of looking at n words before and n words after the occurrence of an example in the document.",
        "With pattern learning, KnowItAll becomes a bootstrapped learning system, where rules are used to learn new seeds, which in turn are used to learn new rules.",
        "A similar approach is used in C-PANKOW (Cimiano et al., 2005).",
        "Compared to KnowItAll and C-PANKOW, our approach does not need handcrafted patterns as input.",
        "They are implicitly found by substituting the training instances in the contexts of the input entities.",
        "Another key difference is that concepts in the ontology do not need to be lexicalized.",
        "Tanev and Magnini (2006) proposed a weakly-supervised method that requires as training data a list of terms without context for each category under consideration.",
        "Given a generic syntactically parsed corpus containing at least each training entity twice, the algorithm learns, for each category, a feature vector describing the contexts where those entities occur.",
        "Then, it compares the new (unknown) entity with the so obtained feature vectors, assigning it to the most similar category.",
        "Even though we used a significantly smaller number of training instances, we obtained better results on their benchmark.",
        "More recently, Giuliano and Gliozzo (2007) proposed an unsupervised approach based on lexical entailment, consisting in assigning an entity to the category whose lexicalization can be replaced with its occurrences in a corpus preserving the meaning.",
        "A disadvantage is that the concepts in the ontology have to be lexicalized, as they are used as training examples.",
        "Our approach is based on a similar idea, but with the main difference that an instance is substituted with other instances rather than with their category names.",
        "Considering that, in most of the cases, ontologies are partially populated during the development phase, and hence the annotation cost is marginal, our approach is a realistic alternative for practical ontology population problems."

        "We have described an instance-based algorithm for automatic fine-grained categorization of named entities, previously identified by an entity recognition system or already present in a database.",
        "This method is meant to provide an effective solution to the ontology population problem.",
        "It exploits the Web or a domain corpus to collect evidence of the new instances and does not require labeled texts for supervision, but a partially populated ontology.",
        "The experimental results show that, where a comparison is possible, our method outperforms previous methods and it can be applied to different domains and languages to (semi-) automatically enrich an existing ontology.",
        "Future work will address the definition of a hierarchical categorization strategy where instances are classified in a top-down manner, in order to efficiently populate very large ontologies, since we plan to apply this method to extract structured information from Wikipedia.",
        "Furthermore, we will investigate how co-reference resolution might well benefit from our ontology classification.",
        "Finally, we plan to exploit the IB OP algorithm for ontology mapping and multilingual alignment of lexical resources."
