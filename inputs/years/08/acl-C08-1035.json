        "might be assigned its monetary sense, based on the occurrence of the term financial.",
        "Often referred to as 'topical features', these are an important part of many NLP methods, such as WSD (Yarowsky 1995) and Topic Area Detection (TAD) (Hearst 1997).",
        "Furthermore, in the SENSEVAL WSD competitions they are included in the highest performing systems.",
        "We assert that the effectiveness of topical features in NLP depends upon the level of topic homogeneity in the text.",
        "To illustrate two extremes: the disambiguation of the word bank might be more difficult if occurring in i) a work of fiction describing a series of activities which includes the phrases: 'stroll along the river' and 'pick up her cheque book'; than in ii) a news report on a bank in financial difficulty (a topically homogeneous text).",
        "This paper contributes a set of unsupervised Topic Homogeneity measures requiring no knowledge of correct senses.",
        "A variety of NLP resources are utilized and a set of evaluation methods devised, providing useful results.",

        "This paper presents a first attempt to measure Topic Homogeneity using a variety of NLP resources.",
        "A set of 5 unsupervised homogeneity measures are presented that require no prior knowledge of correct senses and which exhibit moderate to high degrees of correlation with their correct-sense-only equivalents.",
        "When used to measure word-sets created using the Word-Net::Domains package and which have varying levels of homogeneity, they are found to correlate well with expected results, further supporting our conjecture that they represent topical homogeneity information.",
        "Finally, when compared with WSD topic-content word accuracies, the effect of topic homogeneity is shown to surpass that of polysemy and sense-entropy, which have been recognized previously as having an influence on such results.",
        "By combining these measures, correlations are improved further, often outperforming the individual methods and achieving up to .52 for over 1000 random Sem-cor sub-documents, again indicating their potential importance.",
        "Correlations in SENSEVAL are often higher, but due to the lower number of documents, it is more difficult to obtain statistically significant results.",
        "Our results provide evidence that improvements could be made to WSD and other NLP methods which utilise topic features, by adapting the algorithms used depending on the level of topic cohesion of the input text.",
        "For example, window-sizes for obtaining contextual data might be expanded or reduced, based on the homogeneity level of the target text.",
        "Furthermore, non-topical features such as collocation and grammatical cues might be given more emphasis when disambiguating heterogeneous documents.",
        "Further work includes testing the measures on other NLP tasks.",
        "A machine learning approach might also be used to further optimize the combination of homogeneity measures.",
        "Finally, it is intended that our approach should eventually be combined with a TAD method to improve WSD results.",
