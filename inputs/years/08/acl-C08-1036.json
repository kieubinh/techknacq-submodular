        "The propensity of words to appear together in texts, also known as their distributional similarity is an important part of Natural Language Processing (NLP): 'The need to determine semantic relatedness... between two lexically expressed concepts is a problem that pervades much of [NLP](Budanitsky and Hirst 2006)",
        "Such requirements are evident in word sense disambiguation (WSD) (Patwardhan et-al 2003), spelling correction (Budanitsky and Hirst 2006) and Lexical Chaining (Morris and Hirst 1991).",
        "As well as measuring the co-occurrence of word-pairs, it is also considered useful to extend these measures to calculate the likelihood of sets of words to appear together.",
        "For example, Carac-ciolo et-al (2004) evaluate two established topic area detection (TAD) algorithms and indicate text homogeneity as a document feature affecting the results.",
        "Furthermore, Gliozzo et-al (2004) and McCarthy et-al (2007) highlight the importance of topic features for WSD and Navigli and Velardi (2005) report differing WSD results for 3 types of text: unfocussed, mid-technical (eg finance articles) and overly technical (eg interoperability and computer networks).",
        "Measures of word-group similarity can be used to calculate the level of topic cohesion in texts, and the potential for this to be used to benefit NLP areas such as WSD and TAD has been indicated in Gledson and Keane (2008).",
        "We consider web-searching an important part of measuring similarity, as it provides up-to-date information on word co-occurrence frequencies in the largest available collection of English language documents.",
        "We propose a simple measure that uses internet search counts by measuring the decline in the number of hits as more words (from the word-set to be measured) are appended to a query string using the 'AND' operator.",
        "To offset against the effect of individual word hit-counts, the above gradient is compared to that of the individual word hit counts - arranged in descending order of hits returned.",
        "The paper is structured as follows: in Section 2 we describe related work in the areas of word similarity and the use of search-engine counts in NLP.",
        "Section 3 outlines the algorithm to be used for our similarity measure which can utilise any search-engine that is web-service enabled.",
        "Section 4 describes and discusses the results of the evaluation techniques used, one for evaluating word-pair similarities, which compares with previous work and human judgements, and three for evaluating word-group similarities.",
        "Section 5 outlines the conclusions drawn from these experiments and Section 6 discusses further work."

        "The most commonly used similarity measures are based on the WordNet lexical database (eg Budanitsky and Hirst 2006, Hughes and Ramage 2007) and a number of such measures have been made publicly available (Pedersen et-al 2004).",
        "The problem with such methods is that they are confined to measuring words in terms of the lexical connections manually assigned to them.",
        "Language is evolving continuously and the continual maintenance and updating of such databases is highly labour intensive, therefore, such lexical resources can never be fully up-to-date.",
        "In addition, the lexical connections made between words and concepts do not cover all possible relations between words.",
        "An important relationship between words is distributional similarity and Budanitsky and Hirst (2006) conclude that the capture of these 'non-classical' relationships is an important area of future research.",
        "Weeds and Weir (2006) use a 'co-occurrence retrieval method to compute word relatedness, which is described as analogous to the precision and recall metrics of document retrieval.",
        "They observe the 'plausibility' of substituting word-1 for word-2 within verb/object-noun grammatical relationships.",
        "This method is restricted to document retrieval from the BNC corpus, due to the prerequisite that words are part-of-speech tagged and that some grammatical parsing is performed.",
        "The similarity measure that we have developed is simpler and does not rely on preprocessing of texts.",
        "This distributional similarity measure calculates the propensity of words to appear together, regardless of part-of-speech or grammatical functions.",
        "We assert that the world-wide-web can be used to capture distributional similarity, and is less likely to suffer from problems of coverage, found in smaller corpora.",
        "The web as a corpus has been successfully used for many areas in NLP (Kilgarriff and Grefenstette 2003) such as WSD (Mihalcea and Moldovan 1999), obtaining frequencies for bigrams (Keller and Lapata 2003) and noun compound bracketing (Nakov and Hearst 2005).",
        "Such reliance on web searchengine results does come with caveats, the most important (in this context) being that the reported hit counts may not be entirely trustworthy (Kilgarriff 2007).",
        "Strube and Ponzetto's (2006) use the Wikipe-dia database, which includes a taxonomy of categories, and they adapt 'well established semantic relatedness measures originally developed for WordNet'.",
        "They achieve a correlation coefficient of 0.48 with human judgments, which is stated as being higher than a Google-only and WordNet-only based measure for the largest of their test datasets (the 353 word-pairs of 353-TC)",
        "Chen et-al (2006) use the snippet's returned from web-searches, in order to perform word similarity measurement that captures 'new usages' of ever evolving, 'live' languages.",
        "A double checking model is utilized which combines the number of occurrences of the first word in the snippets of the second word, and vice-versa.",
        "This work achieves a correlation coefficient of 0.85 with the Miller and Charles (1998) dataset of 28 word-pairs, but to achieve the best results, 600700 snippets are required for each word-pair, requiring extra text-processing and searching.",
        "The work most similar to ours is the set of page-counting techniques of Bollegala et-al (2007).",
        "They combine the use of web-search page-counts with the analysis of the returned text snippets and achieve impressive correlations with human judgment (0.834 with the Miller and Charles dataset).",
        "The text-snippet analysis is more complex than that of Chen et-al (2006), as the optimal number of snippets is over 1000, and their process involves complex pattern matching, which may not scale well to measuring word-groups similarity.",
        "Their page counting heuristics utilize 4 popular co-occurrence methods: Jac-card, Overlap (Simpson), Dice and PMI (Point-wise mutual information) but again, these techniques are not designed to scale up to larger numbers of input words.",
        "Mihalcea et-al (2006) and Gabrilovich and Markovitch (2007) achieve good results when comparing texts, the former utilizing the inverse-document frequency heuristic and the latter indexing the entire Wikipedia database and comparing vector representations of the two inputs.",
        "None of the above work is adapted to be used on single groups of words as a measure of topic cohesion.",
        "They could be adapted by combining similarity results between many pairs, but this might similarly have a high computational cost.",
        "In addition, no comparisons of different web-search engines are made when using web-counts.",
        "As the use of web-counts is precarious (Kigarriff 2007), these types of comparisons are of high practical value."

        "Step 7: WebSim[search-engine] is calculated for d as gradIndiv minus gradCombi.",
        "As WebSim[search-engine] is taken as the difference between the two descending gradients, the measure is more likely to reveal the affects of the probability of the set of lemmas co-occurring in the same documents, rather than by influences such as duplicate documents.",
        "If the decline in hit-counts from IndivHitsDesc[i-1] to IndivHits-Desc[i] is high, then the decline in the number of hits from CombiHitsDesc[i-1] to CombiHits-Desc[i] is also expected to be higher, and the converse, for lower drops is also expected.",
        "Deviations from these expectations are reflected in the final homogeneity measure and are assumed to be caused by the likelihood of lemmas co-occurring together in internet texts.",

        "Secondly, our measure relies on the use of web-search page counts (as opposed to word instance counts) as we are measuring the likelihood of cooccurrence in the same text.",
        "Finally, measures are taken to try to avoid the problem of arbitrary search-engine counts.",
        "For example, each measure is the result of a comparison between the decline rates of 2 sets of hit counts and the full set of queries for each input text are taken within a 20 second interval (for groups of 10 words).",

        "The selection of the most frequent words from natural language documents is another important part of our evaluation, as it is representative of real-world data-sets.",
        "As it is anticipated that our results could be of use for WSD, we opted to measure the topic homogeneity of a publicly available set of documents from a well established WSD competition.",
        "The documents of the SENSEVAL 2 & 3 English all-words WSD task were divided into 73 sub-documents, each containing approximately 50 content-words.",
        "The stop-words and non-topical content words of each sub-document were then removed and the remaining words lemmatised and aggregated by lemma.",
        "This list of lemmas was then arranged in descending order of the number of occurrences in the sub-document.",
        "The top-10 most frequent lemmas were selected as input to the similarity measure.",
        "The results for each set along with descriptions of the documents used are displayed in",
        "Table 7.",
        "The scientific documents (d01) could be viewed as the most homogeneous, with the earthquake accounts (d002) and the work of fiction (d000) being considered the most heterogeneous.",
        "With this in mind, it is evident in Table 7 that the WebSim[MSN] measure performed the least well and other two methods performed as expected, and with identical rankings.",
        "Further analysis is required to compare these results with the WSD results for the same",
        "Rankings for each measure are shown in brackets",

        "We proposed a simple web-based similarity measure which relies on page-counts only, can be utilized to measure the similarity of entire sets of words in addition to word-pairs and can use any web-service enabled search engine.",
        "When used to measure similarities between two words, our technique is comparable with other state-of-the art web-search page-counting techniques (and outperforms most).",
        "The measure is found to correlate to a moderate level (the highest being .60 correlation) with human judgments.",
        "When used to measure similarities between sets of 10 words, the results are similarly encouraging and show the expected variations for word-groups with different levels of homogeneity.",
        "Where word-groups are manually created, with known expectations of the similarities between each word-set, correlations with these expected results are as high as .80.",
        "Noticeable differences between the performances of each of the 3 search-engines, for each evaluation method, are evident.",
        "Google performs poorly for the word-pair similarity measures and Yahoo and Live Search both perform substantially better.",
        "For the word-set comparisons, Google performance improves (perhaps as the erratic single counts are stabilised as larger sets of words are used), but Yahoo is again superior and MSN performs much less well.",
        "Overall, our results indicate that the Yahoo measure is the most consistent and reliable."

        "The group similarity measure calculates the propensity of words to co-occur with one-another, which can be described as a measure of the topic homogeneity of the set of input words.",
        "Gledson and Keane (2008) propose the use of further measures of topic homogeneity using a variety of available resources.",
        "These measures are compared with the results of WSD approaches reliant on topic features and low to moderate correlations are found to exist.",
        "It is also proposed that useful correlations with other NLP techniques utilising topical features (such as TAD and Malapropism Detection) might also exist.",
        "The word-group similarity measures performed better for extreme levels of topic homogeneity.",
        "The measures must be improved to enable them to distinguish between moderate homogeneity levels.",
        "This may be achieved by combining our simple measure with other word simi-larity/relatedness techniques such as the use of WordNet Domains, or Lexical Chaining.",
        "It is expected that polysemy counts of words influence the outcome of these experiments, especially for the word-pairs which have less data and are more susceptible to erratic counts.",
        "Results might be improved by measuring and offsetting these effects.",
        "In addition, an upper limit of word-set cardinality should be determined, which is the maximum number of input words that can be measured.",
        "Further testing is necessary using a range of set cardinalities, to obtain optimal values.",
