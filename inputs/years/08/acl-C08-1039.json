        "But each of these alternatives is problematic: the ad-hoc strategy does not work well in general; the EM algorithm ignores the labeled data almost entirely; and using held-out data involves finding a good step size for the search, but small changes in A may cause drastic changes in the estimated parameters and the performance of the resulting model.",

        "In many NLP tasks, the addition of unlabeled data to labeled data can decrease the performance on that task.",
        "This is often because the unlabeled data can overwhelm the information obtained from the labeled data.",
        "In this paper, we have described a methodology and provided efficient algorithms for an approach that attempts to ensure that unlabeled data does not hurt performance.",
        "The experimental results show that homotopy-based training performs better than other commonly used competitive methods.",
        "We plan to explore faster ways for computing the (approximate) covariance matrix, e.g., label sequences can be sampled from P(y|x, 6) and an approximation of the covariance matrix can be computed based on these samples.",
        "Also, it is possible to compute the covariance matrix in polynomial-time for labels which have richer interdependencies such as those generated by a context free grammars (Haffari and Sarkar, 2008).",
        "Finally, in Algorithm 1 we used a fixed step size; the number of iterations in the homotopy path following can be reduced greatly with adaptive step size methods (Allgower and Georg, 1993).",
