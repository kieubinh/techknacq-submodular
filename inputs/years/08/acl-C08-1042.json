        "There has been a great deal of recent interest in the unsupervised discovery of syntactic structure from text, both parts-of-speech (Johnson, 2007; Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007; Biemann, 2006; Dasgupta and Ng, 2007) and deeper grammatical structure like constituency and dependency trees (Klein and Manning, 2004; Smith, 2006; Bod, 2006; Seginer, 2007; Van Zaanen, 2001).",
        "While some grammar induction systems operate on raw text, many of the most successful ones presume prior part-of-speech tagging.",
        "Meanwhile, most recent work in part-of-speech induction focuses on increasing the degree to which their tags match hand-annotated ones such as those in the Perm Treebank.",
        "In this work our goal is to evaluate how improvements in part-of-speech tag induction affects grammar induction.",
        "Using several different unsupervised taggers, we induce tags and train three grammar induction systems on the results.",
        "We then explore the relationship between the performance on common unsupervised tagging metrics and the performance of resulting grammar induction systems.",
        "Disconcertingly we find that they bear little to no relationship.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we discuss unsupervised part-of-speech induction systems and common methods of evaluation.",
        "In Section 3, we describe grammar induction in general and discuss the systems with which we evaluate taggings.",
        "We present our experiments in Section 4, and finally conclude in Section 5."

        "Part-of-speech tag induction can be thought of as a clustering problem where, given a corpus of words, we aim to group word tokens into syntactic classes.",
        "Two tasks are commonly labeled unsupervised part-of-speech induction.",
        "In the first, tag induction systems are allowed the use of a tagging dictionary, which specifies for each word a set of possible parts-of-speech (Merialdo, 1994; Smith and Eisner, 2005; Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007).",
        "In the second, only the word tokens and sentence boundaries are given.",
        "In this work we focus on this latter task to explore grammar induction in a maximally unsupervised context.",
        "Tag induction systems typically focus on two sorts of features: distributional and morphological.",
        "Distributional refers to what sorts of words appear in close proximity to the word in question, while morphological refers to modeling the internal structure of a word.",
        "All the systems below make use of distributional information, whereas only two use morphological features.",
        "We primarily focus on the metrics used to evaluate induced taggings.",
        "The catalogue of recent part-of-speech systems is large, and we can only test the tagging metrics using a few systems.",
        "Recent work that we do not explore explicitly includes (Biemann, 2006; Dasgupta and Ng, 2007; Freitag, 2004; Smith and Eisner, 2005).",
        "We have selected a few systems, described below, that represent a broad range of features and techniques to make our evaluation of the metrics as broad as possible.",
        "Schiitze (1995) presents a series of part-of-speech inducers based on distributional clustering.",
        "We implement the baseline system, which Klein and Manning (2002) use for their grammar induction experiments with induced part-of-speech tags.",
        "For each word type w in the vocabulary V, the system forms a feature row vector consisting of the number of times each of the F most frequent words occur to the left oiw and to the right of w. It normalizes these row vectors and assembles them into a \\V\\ x 2F matrix.",
        "It then performs a Singular Value Decomposition on the matrix and rank reduces it to decrease its dimensionality to d principle components (d < 2F).",
        "This results in a representation of each word as a point in a d dimensional space.",
        "We follow Klein and Manning (2002) in using K-means to cluster the d dimensional word vectors into parts-of-speech.",
        "We use the F = 500 most frequent words as left and right context features, and reduce to a dimensionality of d = 50.",
        "We refer to this system as SVD in our experiments.",
        "The other systems described in Schiitze (1995) make use of more complicated feature models.",
        "We chose the baseline system primarily to match previous evaluations of grammar induction using induced tags (Klein and Manning, 2002).",
        "One simple family of models for part-of-speech induction are the Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), in which there is a sequence of hidden state variables t\\...tn (for us, the part-of-speech tags).",
        "Each state ti is conditioned on the previous n â€“ 1 states ti-\\...ti-n+\\, and every ti emits an observed word Wi conditioned on ti.",
        "There is a single start state that emits nothing, as well as a single stop state, which emits an end-of-sentence marker with probability 1 and does not transition further.",
        "In our experiments we use the bitag HMM, in which each state ti depends only on state U-i.",
        "The classic method of training HMMs for part-of-speech induction is the Baum-Welch (Baum, 1972) variant of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, which searches for a local maximum in the likelihood of the observed words.",
        "Other methods approach the problem from a Bayesian perspective.",
        "These methods place Dirichlet priors over the parameters of each transition and emission multinomial.",
        "For an HMM with a set of states T and a set of output symbols V:",
        "One advantage of the Bayesian approach is that the prior allows us to bias learning toward sparser structures, by setting the Dirichlet hyperparame-ters a, [3 to a value less than one (Johnson, 2007; Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007).",
        "This increases the probability of multinomial distributions which put most of their mass on a few events, instead of distributing them broadly across many events.",
        "There is evidence that this leads to better performance on some part-of-speech induction metrics (Johnson, 2007; Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007).",
        "There are both MCMC and variational approaches to estimating HMMs with sparse Dirichlet priors; we chose the latter (Variational Bayes or VB) due to its simple implementation as a minor modification to Baum-Welch.",
        "Johnson (2007) evaluates both estimation techniques on the Bayesian bitag model; Goldwater and Griffiths (2007) emphasize the advantage in the MCMC approach of integrating out the HMM parameters in a tritag model, yielding a tagging supported by many different parameter settings.",
        "Following the setup in Johnson (2007), we initialize the transition and emission distributions to be uniform with a small amount of noise, and run EM and VB for 1000 iterations.",
        "We label these systems as HMM-EM and HMM-VB respectively in our experiments.",
        "In our VB experiments we set a% = fa = 0.1, Vi G {1,\\T\\} ,j G {1,\\V\\}, which yielded the best performance on most reported metrics in Johnson (2007).",
        "We use maximum marginal decoding, which Johnson (2007) reports performs better than Viterbi decoding.",
        "Clark (2003) presents several part-of-speech induction systems which incorporate morphological as well as distributional information.",
        "We use the implementation found on his website.",
        "The simplest model is based on work by (Ney et al., 1994).",
        "It uses a bitag HMM, with the restriction that each word type in the vocabulary can only be generated by a single part-of-speech.",
        "Thus the tag induction task here reduces to finding a multi-way partition of the vocabulary.",
        "The learning algorithm greedily reassigns each word type to the part-of-speech that results in the greatest increase in likelihood.",
        "In order to incorporate morphology, Clark (2003) associates with each part-of-speech a HMM with letter emissions.",
        "The vocabulary is generated by generating a series of word types from the letter HMM of each part-of-speech.",
        "These can model very basic concatenative morphology.",
        "The parameters of the HMMs are estimated by running a single iteration of Forward-Backward after each round of reassigning words to tags.",
        "In our experiments we evaluate both the model without morphology (NE in our experiments), and the morphological model, trying both 5 and 10 states in the letter HMM (NEMorph5, NEMorphlO respectively).",
        "The final part-of-speech inducer we try from Clark (2003) is a two-level HMM.",
        "This is similar to the previous model, except it lifts the restriction that a word appear under only one part-of-speech.",
        "Alternatively, one could think of this model as a standard HMM, whose emission distributions incorporate a mixture of a letter HMM and a standard multinomial.",
        "Training uses a simple variation of Forward-Backward.",
        "In the experiments in this paper, we initialize the mixture parameters to .5, and try 5 states in the letter HMM.",
        "We refer to this model as 2HMM.",
        "Objective evaluation in any clustering task is always difficult, since there are many ways to define good clusters.",
        "Typically it involves a mixture of subjective evaluation and a comparison of the clusters to those found by human annotators.",
        "In the realm of part-of-speech induction, there are several common ways of doing the latter.",
        "These split into two groups: accuracy and information-theoretic criteria.",
        "Accuracy, given some mapping between the set of induced classes and the gold standard labels, is the number of words in the corpus that have been marked with the correct gold label divided by the total number of word tokens.",
        "The main challenge facing these metrics is deciding how to to map each induced part-of-speech class to a gold tag.",
        "One option is what Johnson (2007) calls \"many-to-one\" (M-to-1) accuracy, in which each induced tag is labeled with its most frequent gold tag.",
        "Although this results in a situation where multiple induced tags may share a single gold tag, it does not punish a system for providing tags of a finer granularity than the gold standard.",
        "In contrast, \"one-to-one\" (1-to-l) accuracy restricts each gold tag to having a single induced tag.",
        "The mapping typically is made to try to give the most favorable mapping in terms of accuracy, typically using a greedy assignment (Haghighi and Klein, 2006).",
        "In cases where the number of gold tags is different than the number of induced tags, some must necessarily remain unassigned (Johnson, 2007).",
        "In addition to accuracy, there are several information theoretic criteria presented in the literature.",
        "These escape the problem of trying to find an appropriate mapping between induced and gold tags, at the expense of perhaps being less intuitive.",
        "Let Tj be the tag assignments to the words in the corpus created by an unsupervised tagger, and let TG be the gold standard tag assignments.",
        "Clark (2003) uses Shannon's conditional entropy of the gold tagging given the induced tagging H(TG\\Tj).",
        "Lower entropy indicates less uncertainty in the gold tagging if we already know the induced tagging.",
        "Freitag (2004) uses the similar \"cluster-conditional tag perplexity\" which is merely exp(H\\TG\\Tj)).",
        "Since cluster-conditional tag perplexity is a monotonic function oi H(TG\\Tj), we only report the latter.",
        "Goldwater and Griffiths (2007) propose using the Variation of Information of Meila (2003):",
        "VI represents the change in information when going from one clustering to another.",
        "It holds the nice properties of being nonnegative, symmetric, as well as fulfilling the triangle inequality."

        "Each tagging and grammar induction metric gives us a ranking over the set of taggings of the data generated over the course of our experiments.",
        "These are ordered from best to worst according to the metric, so for instance H(Tc\\Tj) would give highest rank to its lowest value.",
        "We can compare the two rankings using Kendall's r (see Lapata (2006) for an overview), a nonparametric measure of correspondence for rankings, r measures the difference between the number of concordant pairs (items the two rankings place in the same order) and discordant pairs (those the rankings place in opposite order), divided by the total number of pairs.",
        "A value of 1 indicates the rankings have perfect correspondence, 1 indicates they are in the opposite order, and 0 indicates they are independent.",
        "The r values are shown in Table 2.",
        "The scatter-plot in Figure 1 shows the r with the greatest magnitude.",
        "However, we can see that even these rankings have barely any relationship.",
        "An objection one might raise is that the lack of correspondence reflects poorly not on these metrics, but upon the grammar induction systems we use to evaluate them.",
        "There might be something about these models in particular which yields these low correlations.",
        "For instance these grammar inducers all estimate their models using EM, which can get caught easily in a local maximum.",
        "To this possibility, we respond by pointing to performance on gold tags, which is consistently high for all grammar induction metrics.",
        "There is clearly some property of the gold tags which is exploited by the grammar induction systems even in the absence of better estimation procedures.",
        "This property is not reflected in the tagging metrics.",
        "The scores for each system for tagging and grammar induction, averaged over the 10 runs, are shown in Table 1.",
        "Additionally, we included runs of the SVD-tagger for 100 and 200 tags, since running this system is still practical with these numbers of tags.",
        "The Ney-Essen with Morphology taggers perform at or near the top on the various tagging metrics, but not well on the grammar induction tasks on average.",
        "HMM-EM seems to perform on average quite well on all the grammar induction tasks, while the SVD-based systems yield the top bracketing F-scores, making use of larger numbers of tags.",
        "One question we might ask is whether these tagging metrics capture information relevant to any parsing task.",
        "We explored this by experimenting with a supervised parser, training off trees where the gold parts-of-speech have been removed and replaced with induced tags.",
        "Our expectation was that the brackets, the head propagation paths, and the phrasal categories in the training trees would be sufficient to overcome any loss in information that the gold tags might provide.",
        "Additionally it was possible the induced tags would ignore rare parts-of-speech such as FW, and make better use of the available tags, perhaps using new distributional clues not in the original tags.",
        "To this end we modified the Charniak Parser (Charniak, 2000) to train off induced parts-of-speech.",
        "The Charniak parser is a lexicalized PCFG parser for which the part-of-speech of a head word is a key aspect of its model.",
        "During training, the head-paths from the gold part-of-speech tags are retained, but we replace the tags themselves.",
        "We ran experiments using the bitag HMM from Section 2.2 trained using EM, as well as with the SchÃ¼tze SVD tagger from Section 2.1.",
        "The parser was trained on sections 2-21 of the Perm Treebank for training and section 24 was used for evaluation.",
        "As before we calculated r scores between each tagging metric and supervised f-score.",
        "Unlike the unsupervised evaluation where we used the metric UF1, we use the standard EVALB calculation of unlabeled f-score.",
        "The results are shown in Table 3.",
        "The contrast with the unsupervised case is vast, with very high rs for both accuracy metrics.",
        "Consider f-score vs. many-to-one, plotted in Figure 3.",
        "The correspondence here is very clear: taggings with high accuracy do actually reflect on better parser performance.",
        "Note, however, that the correspondence between the information theoretic measures and parsing performance is still rather weak.",

        "In this work, we found that none of the most common part-of-speech tagging metrics bear a strong relationship to good grammar induction performance.",
        "Although our experiments only involve English, the poor correspondence we find between the various tagging metrics and grammar induction performance raises concerns about their relationship more broadly.",
        "We additionally found that while tagging accuracy measures do correlate with better supervised parsing, common information theoretic ones do not strongly predict better performance on either task.",
        "Furthermore, the supervised experiments indicate that informative part-of-speech tags are important for good parsing.",
        "The next step is to explore better tagging metrics that correspond more strongly to better grammar induction performance.",
        "A good metric should use all the information we have, including the gold trees, to evaluate.",
        "Finally, we should explore grammar induction schemes that do not rely on prior parts-of-speech, instead learning them from raw text at the same time as deeper structure."
