        "Chinese couplets have also been used effectively in teaching Chinese in China.",

        "As far as we know, there is no previous work to tackle this problem.",
        "The general process of generating a SS given a FS is like this: for each word in the FS, find some words that can be used as the counterparts in the SS; then from the word lattice, select one word at each position in the SS so that the selected words form a fluent sentence satisfying the constraints of Chinese couplets.",
        "This process is similar to translating a source language sentence into a target language sentence without word insertion, deletion and reordering, but the target sentence should satisfy some linguistic constraints.",

        "Motivation",
        "Chinese couplets vary widely in length.",
        "A short couplet could consist of two sentences each containing only one or two characters while a longer couplet may reach several hundred characters.",
        "However, the length of sentences in most Chinese couplets is between 5 and 10 characters.",
        "There are also diverse forms of writing couplets.",
        "For instance, in one form, the FS and SS are similar in meaning, while in another, they have to oppose in meaning.",
        "However, no matter which form a couplet follows, it generally must conform to the following constraints:",
        "Constraint 1: The two sentences of a couplet agree in length and word segmentation.",
        "For example, if a FS contains 7 characters and the first two characters form a word, then the qualified SS should also contain 7 characters with the first two forming a word.",
        "Constraint 2: Tones are generally \"coinciding and harmonious\": In Chinese, every character is pronounced either \"Ping\" (^) or \"Ze\" (]X).",
        "In a Chinese couplet, the character at the end of the FS should be \"Ze\" (pronounced in a sharp downward tone); the character at the end of the SS should be \"Ping\" (pronounced in a level tone).",
        "Constraint 3: Corresponding words in the two sentences should agree in their part of speech and characteristics.",
        "For instance, a noun in the SS should correspond to a noun at the same position in the FS.",
        "A named entity should correspond to a named entity.",
        "Constraint 4: The contents of the two sentences should be related, but not duplicated.",
        "Constraint 5: The two sentences should be identical in their writing styles.",
        "For instance, if there is a repetition of words, characters, or pronunciations in the FS, the SS should contain an identical repetition.",
        "And if there is a character decomposition in the FS, i.e., the FS contains a character and its \"component characters\", the SS should contain a character decomposition at the corresponding positions.",
        "Character decomposition is an interesting language phenomenon in Chinese: some Chinese characters can be decomposed into other characters.",
        "For example, \"U\" (good) can be decomposed into \"^C\" (daughter) and \"f (son).",
        "As illustrated in Figure 2, the left part of \" U\" is and the right part is \".",
        "and \" are called the \"component characters\" of \"U\".",
        "Compared to western couplets, which also consist of two sentences that usually rhyme and have the same number of syllables, Chinese couplets have much stronger constraints.",
        "Because in Chinese each character has one and only one syllable, the same number of syllables means the same number of characters.",
        "Moreover, the constraints of the FS and SS on consistency of part of speech sequence and writing style make Chinese couplets have more regular form.",
        "Given the FS, writing a good SS to match it is a difficult task because the SS must conform to constraints on syntax, rhyme and semantics, as described above.",
        "It also requires the writer to innovatively use extensive knowledge in different disciplines.",
        "Some of the difficulties can be seen from the following example:",
        "& W f 7 ^ tt; $ $ J % ^ (Once one has a daughter and son, one's life is complete; who would dare call a meal without fish and mutton delicious?",
        "In China, there is an old saying that courses made of fish and mutton are most delicious).",
        "The FS contains a repeated character \"W\" (have), and a character decomposition: \"tt\" (good) and its \"component characters\" \"(daughter) and \"-f\" (son).",
        "So it requires that the qualified FS should contain identical character repletion and character decomposition.",
        "A perfect SS worked out after multiple attempts by many people for this FS is \"$ ft $ J % P4 t¥\", which equally contains a repeated character \"$\" (lack), and a character decomposition: \"t¥\" (fresh) and its \"component characters\" \"ft\" (fish) and \"J\" (mutton) at the corresponding positions.",
        "And the meanings of the two sentences are also parallel: they tell us what is important in life and what is important in cuisine, respectively."

        "However, what is more important is that our system can provide users diversified SSs and many unacceptable SSs generated by our system can be easily refined by users to become acceptable.",
