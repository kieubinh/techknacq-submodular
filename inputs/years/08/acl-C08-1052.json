        "Increasingly we can access many opinions towards products, services, or companies through electronic documents including questionnaires, call logs, and other consumer-generated media (CGM) such as Internet discussion forums and blogs.",
        "It is very important for companies to get insights from their customers' opinions by analyzing such documents in large numbers.",
        "The most popular way to utilize such data has involved sentiment analysis (SA) (Nasukawa and Yi, 2003; Yi et al., 2003), which is the task of recognizing the writers' feelings as expressed in positive or negative comments.",
        "Typically, a SA system focuses on expressions to identify the strong or weak points of the subjects as in (1) or in the writers' evaluations as in (2).",
        "(1) I think the pictures are beautiful.",
        "(2) I don't like this camera very much.",
        "Here we call them polar expressions because they convey positive or negative polarities.",
        "By counting the polar expressions related to products or services, one can quantitatively compare the goodness of competing services, find the drawbacks of specific products, and so on.",
        "In addition to polar expressions, there are other types of expressions that provide valuable information, especially for the supplier side rather than the consumer side.",
        "Examples (3) and (4) express the demands of the writers.",
        "(3) I'd be happy if it is equipped with a crisp LCD.",
        "(4) I'm waiting for a single-lens reflex less than 30,000 yen to come on the market.",
        "We call such expressions \"demand expressions\", and the underlined phrases \"demand targets.\"",
        "While sentiment analysis reveals evaluations of existing products or services, the task proposed here, textual demand analysis, gives more direct suggestions to companies: things they should do to attract customers.",
        "For example, by investigating demand targets, companies can add new functions to products on the market or plan new services to satisfy customers.",
        "These activities should lead to positive evaluations in the future.",
        "Interestingly, demand expressions may be noise in sentiment analysis, because the demand expressions do not actually convey positive or neg-",

        "The detection of novel demand targets requires deep syntactic information because such demand targets themselves can not be predefined.",
        "For example, to regard the underlined parts of (3) and (4) as demand targets, the non-underlined parts of these sentences have to be properly interpreted as triggers.",
        "Lhis is a major difference from sentiment analysis where the polar expressions can be defined in the lexicon.",
        "The left parts of Figure 1 illustrate the concepts of a system that visualizes the users' demands described in the input opinion data, where the main analysis component processes the documents and extracts the demand targets.",
        "The output of the system is created by a demand outliner, which the company uses to grasp the trends of consumers' demands.",
        "The syntactic patterns that can be used as clues to demand expressions depend on the topic domain or the writing style.",
        "To organize this linguistic knowledge we propose an unsupervised induction method for syntactic patterns.",

        "Yi et al.",
        "(2003) pointed out that the multiple sentiment aspects in a document should be extracted, and Nasukawa and Yi (2003) clarified the need for deep syntactic analysis for the phrase-level SA.",
        "The acquisition of clues is a key technology in these research efforts, as seen in learning methods for document-level SA (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Turney, 2002) and for phrase-level SA (Wilson et al., 2005; Kanayama and Nasukawa, 2006).",
        "As well as the sentiment expressions leading to evaluations, there are many semantic aspects to be extracted from documents which contain writers' opinions, such as subjectivity (Wiebe and Mihal-cea, 2006), comparative sentences (Jindal and Liu, 2006) , or predictive expressions (Kim and Hovy, 2007) .",
        "However, the extraction of the contents of writers' demands which this paper handles is less studied while this type of information is very valuable for commercial applications.",
        "For the tasks of information extraction and relation extraction, bootstrapping approaches have been proven successful (Yangarber, 2003; Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006).",
        "The pattern induction method in this paper exploits their ideas, but their application to the demand detection is not trivial, because some instances of demands are previously unknown and do not appear frequently, so they have to be abstracted effectively.",
        "The work by Inui et al.",
        "(2003) handles semantics of a type similar to ours.",
        "They aimed to detect the requests in the responses to open-ended questionnaires, seeking direct requests such as \"... TI5 lv v' ('[I] would like you to ...') and other forms which can be paraphrased as direct requests.",
        "They classified sentences into requests or non-requests, where their source documents were responses to questionnaires, and where more than 60% of the utterances could be regarded as requests of some sort.",
        "In contrast, our method detects the content of the demands in the form of noun phrases, and handles more general target documents including",

        "As shown in Section 1, our goal is to create a system to enumerate in an easily understandable way the demand targets in the input text.",
        "This section describes the definition of a demand target and its representation format.",
        "Demands or requests written in opinion texts can be represented by verb phrases as in e.g. 'I want to V.' and 'I want you to V.', or noun phrases as in 'I want N.' In this paper we focus on the last type, i.e. noun phrases which represent desired objects, because they are easier to aggregate and grasp than verb phrases.",
        "Another reason is that some demands represented with a verb phrase only describe the objects that are desired.",
        "For example, 'I want to buy N' and 'I want you to provide N' can be simply interpreted as meaning that N is what the writer wants.",
        "We call such a noun phrase a demand target, and these are the outputs of our system.",
        "For applications, the demand targets to be detected by the system depend on the type of input documents.",
        "For example, from a consumers' forum on digital cameras, the underlined parts in Examples (3) and (4) from Section 1 apparently describe the writer's demands, so they are valuable information for such users of demand analysis such as the makers of digital camera.",
        "However, the request in Example (5) does not express the author's demands about any digital camera, but rather it is written for other participants in the forum.",
        "This type should be excluded from the output.",
        "(5) Please give me a good advice.",
        "In contrast, when the responses to a questionnaire about the activities of an organization are processed, statements such as Example (5) should be regarded as a demand target, since the writer wrote it as a request to the sponsor of the questionnaire and the 'advice' is indeed a thing that can be provided by the sponsoring organization.",

        "The headwords of such phrases {e.g. 'LCD' in (3) and 'reflex' in (4)) represent the main categories of the demanded objects, but they are not distinctive enough to recognize as knowledge of the authors' demands.",
        "Therefore the key task of this research was to find ways to markup the headword of a noun phrase that represents the content of a demand in the syntactic parse tree.",
        "Examples (6) and (7) are the original lapanese sentences corresponding to Examples (3) and (4).",

        "This simple representation is advantageous for both the collection of and the deeper investigation of the demand targets.",
        "One can easily grasp the content of a demand if the application shows the whole surface structure of the subtree under '*' in the tree, e.g. the underlined parts of Examples (6) and (7).",

        "This is because FDIs cannot be definitive triggers, and the first seed pattern \"N*-;&S-$C LV^\" ('I want N*') was a prominently reliable pattern compared with the other demand patterns.",

        "As a result, higher precision was achieved in this domain than in the digital camera domain, because the demands are stated more explicitly in the responses to the questionnaires.",
