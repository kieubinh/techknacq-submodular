        "Addressing coordination ambiguities is fundamental to natural language understanding.",
        "Previous studies on coordination disambiguation suggested that conjuncts in coordinate structures have syntactic or semantic similarities, and dealt with coordination ambiguities using (sub-)string matching, part-of-speech matching, semantic similarities, and so forth (Agarwal and Boggess, 1992).",
        "Semantic similarities are acquired from thesauri (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994; Resnik, 1999) or distributional similarity (Chantree et al., 2005).",
        "For instance, consider the following example:",
        "(1) eat Caesar salad and Italian pasta",
        "The above methods detect the similarity between salad and pasta using a thesaurus or distributional similarity, and identify the coordinate structure that conjoins salad and pasta.",
        "They do not use the information of the word eat.",
        "On the other hand, this coordinate structure can be analyzed by using selectional preference of eat.",
        "Since eat is likely to have salad and pasta as its objects, it is plausible that salad and pasta are coordinated.",
        "Such selectional preferences are thought to support the construction of coordinate structures and to yield similarity between conjuncts on the contrary.",
        "We present a method of coordination disambiguation without using similarities.",
        "Coordinate structures are supported by their surrounding dependency relations that provide selectional preferences.",
        "These relations implicitly work as similarities, and thus it is not necessary to use similarities explicitly.",
        "In this paper, we focus on Japanese.",
        "Coordination disambiguation is integrated in a fully-lexicalized generative dependency parser (Kawahara and Kurohashi, 2007).",
        "For the selectional preferences, we use lexical knowledge, such as case frames, which is extracted from a large raw corpus.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 summarizes previous work related to coordination disambiguation and its integration into parsing.",
        "Section 3 briefly describes the background of this study.",

        "Previous work on coordination disambiguation has focused mainly on finding the scope of coordinate structures.",
        "There are several methods that use similarities between the heads of conjuncts.",
        "Similarities are obtained from manually assigned semantic tags (Agarwal and Boggess, 1992), a thesaurus (Resnik, 1999) and a distributional thesaurus (Chantree et al., 2005).",
        "Other approaches used cooccurrence statistics.",
        "To determine the attachments of ambiguous coordinate noun phrases, Goldberg (1999) applied a cooccurrence-based probabilistic model, and Nakov and Hearst (2005) used web-based frequencies.",
        "The performance of these methods ranges from 50% to 80%.",
        "Of the above approaches, Resnik (1999) and Nakov and Hearst (2005) considered the statistics of noun-noun modification.",
        "For example, the coordinate structure \"((mail and securities) fraud)\" is guided by the estimation that mail fraud is a salient compound nominal phrase.",
        "On the other hand, the coordinate structure \"(corn and (peanut butter))\" is led because corn butter is not a familiar concept.",
        "They did not use the selectional preferences of the predicates that the conjuncts depend on.",
        "Therefore, this idea is subsumed into ours.",
        "The previously described methods focused on coordination disambiguation.",

        "Nilsson et al.",
        "tried to transform the tree representation of a treebank into a more suitable representation for data-driven dependency parsers (Nilsson et al., 2006; Nilsson et al., 2007).",
        "One of their targets is the representation of coordinate structures.",
        "They succeeded in improving a deterministic parser, but failed for a globally optimized discriminative parser.",
        "Kurohashi and Nagao proposed a Japanese parsing method that included coordinate structure detection (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994).",
        "Their method first detects coordinate structures in a sentence, and then determines the dependency structure of the sentence under the constraints of the detected coordinate structures.",
        "Their method correctly analyzed 97 out of 150 Japanese sentences.",
        "Kawahara and Kurohashi (2007) integrated this method into a generative parsing model.",
        "Shimbo and Hara (2007) considered many features for coordination disambiguation and automatically optimized their weights, which were heuristically determined in Kurohashi and Nagao (1994), using a discriminative learning model.",
        "A number of machine learning-based approaches to Japanese parsing have been developed.",
        "Among them, the best parsers are the SVM-based dependency analyzers (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2002; Sassano, 2004).",
        "In particular, Sassano added some features to improve his parser by enabling it to detect coordinate structures (Sassano, 2004).",
        "However, the added features did not contribute to improving the parsing accuracy.",

        "For example, in sentence (1), our model can recognize the correct coordinate structure that conjoins \"densya-no hassyaaizu\" (departure signals of trains) and \"keitaidenwa-no tyakushinon\" (ring tones of cell phones).",
        "This is because the case frame of \"ongaku-ni nam\" (become music) is likely to generate \"hassyaaizu\" (departure signal) and \"tyakushinon\" (ring tone).",
        "To compare our results with a state-of-the-art discriminative dependency parser, we input the same test corpus into an SVM-based lapanese dependency parser, CaboCha(Kudo and Mat-sumo to, 2002).",
        "Its dependency accuracy was 86.7% (3,807/4,389), which is close to that of \"rule-coord-w/sim\".",
        "This low accuracy is attributed to the lack of the consideration of coordinate structures.",
        "Though dependency structures are closely related to coordinate structures, the CaboCha parser failed to incorporate coordination features.",
        "Another cause of the low accuracy is the out-of-domain training corpus.",
        "That is, the parser is trained on a newspaper corpus, whereas the test corpus is obtained from the web, because of the non-availability of a tagged web corpus that is large enough to train a supervised parser.",
        "We presented a method for coordination disambiguation without using similarities, and this method achieved better performance than the conventional approaches based on similarities.",
        "Though we do not use similarities, we implicitly consider similarities between conjuncts.",
        "This is because the heads of pre-and post-conjuncts share a case marker and a predicate, and thus they are essentially similar.",
        "Our idea is related to the notion of distributional similarity.",
        "Chantree et al.",
        "(2005) applied the distributional similarity proposed by Lin (1998) to coordination disambiguation.",
        "Lin extracted from a corpus dependency triples of two words and the grammatical relationship between them, and considered that similar words are likely to have similar dependency relations.",
        "The difference between Chantree et al.",
        "(2005) and ours is that their method does not use the information of verbs in the sentence under consideration, but use only the cooccurrence information extracted from a corpus.",
        "On the other hand, the disadvantage of our model is that it cannot consider the parallelism of conjuncts, which still seems to exist in especially strong coordinate structures.",
        "Handling of such parallelism is an open question of our model.",
        "The generation process adopted in this work is similar to the design of dependency structure described in Hudson (1990), which lets the conjuncts have a dependency relation to the predicate.",
        "Nilsson et al.",
        "(2006) mentioned this notion, but did not consider this idea in their experiments of tree transformations for data-driven dependency parsers.",
        "In addition, it is not necessary for our method to transform dependency trees in pre-and post-processes, because we just changed the process of generation in the generative parser."
