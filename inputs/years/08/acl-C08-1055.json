        "A Noun Phrase (np) is a referring expression if its communicative purpose is to identify an object to a hearer.",
        "The Generation of Referring Expressions (gre) is an integral part of most Natural Language Generation (nlg) systems (Reiter and Dale, 2000).",
        "The gre task can informally be stated as follows.",
        "Given an intended referent (i.e., the object to be identified) and a set of distractors (i.e., other objects that can be confused with the referent), find a description that allows a hearer to identify its referent uniquely (Dale, f992).",
        "Such a description is called a Distinguishing Description (dd).",
        "In practice, however, most gre algorithms build sets of semantic properties available in a Knowledge Base (kb), rather than descriptions in natural language; surface issues are often ignored (exceptions are: (Stone and Webber, 1998; Krahmer and Theune, 2002; Siddharthan and Copestake, 2004)).",
        "This is an important limitation, for example because ambiguities can be introduced in the step from properties to language descriptions.",
        "Such \"surface ambiguities\" take centerstage in this paper.",
        "More specifically, we shall be investigating situations where they lead to referential ambiguity, that is, unclarity as to what the intended referent of a referring expression is.",
        "Example 1: Consider a scenario in which there are sheep and goats along with other animals, grazing in a meadow; some of the sheep and goats are black while others are either brown or yellow.",
        "Suppose our task is to single out the black sheep and black goats from the rest of the animals.",
        "Suppose an algorithm has generated the logical form (Black n Sheep) U (Black n Goats), which could be realised as either the black sheep and the black goats or, more briefly, as the black sheep and goats.",
        "The latter np expresses two non-equivalent logical formulae: (i) (Black n Sheep) U Goats, and (ii) (Black n Sheep) U (Black n Goats).",
        "Since both formulae correspond with a set of animals in the domain, referential ambiguity can result.",
        "On the other hand, the black sheep and goats is shorter and possibly more fluent.",
        "This example highlights the possible tension between brevity and lack of ambiguity.",
        "The question facing us in this paper is how to balance them.",
        "This paper examines how gre should deal with structural ambiguity, focussing on ambiguity of the form the Adj Nounl and Noun2, also known as coordination ambiguity.",

        "This suggests that, in gre as well, it might not be feasible to avoid all referential ambiguities all the time, and that the choice of referring expression should sometimes involve a balancing act in which degree of ambiguity is balanced against other properties of the generated expression, such as its length or fluency.",

        "Secondly, we observed that Chantree et al.",
        "take Coordination Force into account when they predict wide scope, but not when they predict narrow scope.",
        "It would be more systematic - and more useful to an nlg system, which has to cope with all possible inputs - to consider all four combinations, of strong and weak, coordination and modification force.",

        "For example, the formula Black n (Cats U Dogs) might be realised as the black cats and dogs, which could easily be misunderstood as (Black n Cats) U Dogs.",
        "For this purpose, we propose to use a set of transformation rules that allow us to find a set of formulae logically equivalent to the original formula; the aim is to make the set large enough that all the relevant expressive choices (as investigated in this paper) are represented.",
        "In particular, we need the following rules that operate on dnfs (where A is an adjective; B\\ and B2 are nouns; X and Y are combinations of adjectives and nouns).",
        "After application of these transformation rules, the original description tp (i.e., the formula produced by an algorithm such as gap) is replaced by a set of formulae F all of whose elements are logically equivalent to ip.",

        "To do this, we give preference to the shortest of all descriptions that are clear (measured in terms of number of words in the np).",
        "If ties still arise then we suggest that fluency is taken into account, for example by preferring np whose structure is most frequent in the bnc.",
        "This procedure will often result in nps that are 'clear' even though they are syntactically ambiguous.",

        "The nps (1) and (2) are structurally ambiguous, but the Word Sketches rule out the unintended reading of both nps (with narrow scope for the adjective), so they are both clear.",
