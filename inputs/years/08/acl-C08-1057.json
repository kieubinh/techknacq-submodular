        "Recent years have seen a massive growth in the scientific literature in the domain of biomedicine.",
        "Because future research in the biomedical sciences depends on making use of all this existing knowledge, there is a strong need for the development of natural language processing (nlp) tools which can be used to automatically locate, organize and manage facts related to published experimental results.",
        "Major progress has been made on information retrieval and on the extraction of specific relations (e.g. between proteins and cell types) from biomedical texts (Ananiadou et al., 2006).",
        "Other tasks, such as the extraction of factual information, remain a bigger challenge.",
        "Researchers have recently begun to use deeper NLP techniques (e.g. statistical parsing) for improved processing of the challenging linguistic structures (e.g. complex nominals, modal subordination, anaphoric links) in biomedical texts.",
        "For optimal performance, many of these techniques require richer syntactic and semantic information than is provided by existing domain lexicons (e.g. umls metathesaurus and lexicon).",
        "This particularly applies to verbs, which are central to the structure and meaning of sentences.",
        "Where the information is absent, lexical classification can compensate for it, or aid in obtaining it.",
        "Lexical classes which capture the close relation between the syntax and semantics of verbs provide generalizations about a range of linguistic properties (Levin, 1993).",
        "For example, consider the indicate and activate verb classes in Figure 1.",
        "Their members have similar subcatego-rization frames scfs (e.g. activate / up-regulate / induce / stimulate np) and selectional preferences (e.g. activate / up-regulate / induce / stimulate genes:waf1), and they can be used to make similar statements describing similar events (e.g. pro-teins:p53 activate genes:waf1).",
        "Lexical classes can be used to abstract away from individual words, or to build a lexical organization which predicts much of the behaviour of a new word by associating it with an appropriate class.",
        "They have proved useful for various nlp application tasks, e.g. parsing, word sense disambiguation, semantic role labeling, information extraction, question-answering, machine translation (Dorr, 1997; Prescher et al., 2000; Swier and Stevenson, 2004; Dang, 2004; Shi and Mi-halcea, 2005).",
        "A large-scale classification specific to the biomedical data could support key Bio-nlp tasks such as anaphora resolution, predicate-argument identification, event extraction and the identification of biomedical (e.g. interaction) relations.",
        "However, no such classification is available.",
        "Recent research shows that it is possible to automatically induce lexical classes from corpora with promising accuracy (Schulte im Walde, 2006; Joa-nis et al., 2007; Sun et al., 2008).",

        "Our lexical classification approach involves (i) extracting features from corpus data and (ii) clustering them.",
        "These steps are described in the following two sections, respectively.",
        "Lexical classifications are based on diathesis alternations which manifest in alternating sets of syntactic frames (Levin, 1993).",
        "Most verb classification approaches have therefore employed shallow syntactic slots or SCFs as basic features.",
        "Some have supplemented them with further information about verb tense, voice, and/or semantic selectional preferences on argument heads.",
        "The preliminary experiment on biomedical verb classification (Korhonen et al., 2006) employed basic syntactic features only: SCFs extracted from corpus data using the system of Briscoe and Carroll (1997) which operates on the output of a domain-independent robust statistical parser (rasp) (Briscoe and Carroll, 2002).",
        "Because such deep syntactic features seem ideally suited for challenging biomedical data, we adopted the same basic approach, but we designed and extracted a range of novel feature sets which include additional syntactic and semantic information.",
        "The scf extraction system assigns each occurrence of a verb in the parsed data as a member of one of the 163 verbal SCFs, builds a lexical entry for each verb (type) and scf combination, and filters noisy entries out of the lexicon.",
        "We do not employ the filter in our work because its primary aim is to filter out SCFs containing adjuncts (as opposed to arguments).",
        "Adjuncts have been shown to be beneficial for general language verb classification (Sun et al., 2008; Joanis et al., 2007) and particularly meaningful in biomedical texts (Cohen and Hunter, 2006).",
        "The lexical entries provide various information useful for verb classification, including e.g. the frequency of the entry in the data, the part-of-speech (pos) tags of verb tokens, the argument heads in argument positions, the prepositions in pp frames, and the number of verbal occurrences in active and passive.",
        "Making use of this information we designed ten feature sets for experimentation.",
        "The first three feature sets F1-F3 include basic SCF frequency information for each verb:",
        "Fl: SCFs and their relative frequencies.",
        "The SCFs abstract over lexically governed particles and prepositions.",
        "F2: Fl with two high frequency pp frames parameterized for prepositions: the simple pp and np-pp frames refined according to the prepositions provided in the lexical entries (e.g. pp_af, pp_on, PPJn).",
        "F3: F2 with 13 additional high frequency PP frames parameterized for prepositions.",
        "Although prepositions are an important part of the syntactic description of lexical classes and therefore F3 should be the most informative feature set, we controlled the number of PP frames parameterized for prepositions to examine the effect of sparse data in automatic classification.",
        "F4-F7 build on the most refined scF-based feature set F3, supplementing it with information about verb tense (F4-F5) and voice (F6-F7):",
        "F4: The frequencies of pos tags (e.g. WD for activated) calculated over all the scfs of the verb.",
        "F5: The frequencies of pos tags calculated specific to each scf of the verb.",
        "F6: The frequency of the active and passive occurrences of the verb (calculated over all the scfs of the verb).",
        "F7: The frequency of the active and passive occurrences of the verb (calculated specific to each scf of the verb).",
        "Also F8-F10 build on feature set F3.",
        "They supplement it with information about lexical or semantic selectional preferences (SPs) of the verbs in the following slots: subject, direct object, second object, and the NP within the PP complement.",
        "The SPs are acquired using argument head data in the ten most frequent scfs.",
        "We use two baseline methods (F8 and F9) which employ raw data and one method based on clustering (F10):",
        "F8: The raw argument head types are considered as SP classes.",
        "F9: Only those raw argument head types which occur with four or more verbs with frequency of > 3 are considered as SP classes.",
        "F10: SPs are acquired by clustering those argument heads which occur with ten or more verbs with frequency of > 3.",
        "We used the PC clustering method described below in section 2.",
        "The number of clusters Knp was set to 10, 20, and 50 to produce SP classes.",
        "We call the feature sets corresponding to these different values of Knp FIOa, FIOb and FlOc, respectively.",
        "Since the clustering algorithms have an element of randomness, clustering was ran 100 times.",
        "The output is a result of voting among the outputs of the runs.",
        "F3-F10 are entirely novel feature sets in biomedical verb classification.",
        "Variations of some of them have been used in earlier work on general language classification (see section 5 for details).",

        "However, tense-based features clearly improved the baseline performance in our experiments.",
        "This could be partly because we 'parameterize' pos information for scfs, and partly because semantically similar verbs in biomedical language tend to behave similarly also in terms of tense (Friedman et al., 2002).",

        "Joanis (2002) obtained no improvement over syntactic features while Schulte im Walde (2006) obtained, but the improvement was not significant.",
        "In our experiments, sp features gave the best results and the clearest improvement over the baseline features at the finer-grained levels of classification where class members are indeed likely to be the most uniform in terms of their SPs.",
        "We obtained this improvement despite using a fully unsupervised approach to sp acquisition.",
        "We did not exploit lexical resources like Joanis (2002) and Schulte im Walde (2006) because it would have required combining general resources (e.g. WordNet) with domain specific ones (e.g. umls).",
        "We opted for a simpler approach in this initial work - using raw argument heads and clustering - and obtained surprisingly good results.",
        "In our experiments filtering of raw argument heads and clustering with N=50 produced equivalent results, suggesting that relatively fine-grained clusters are optimal.",
        "Future work will require qualitative analysis of noun clusters and comparison of these against classes in lexical resources to determine an optimal method for sp acquisition.",

        "We do not believe so.",
        "The feature sets we experimented with are theoretically well-motivated and should, in principle, also aid general language verb classification.",
        "We believe they proved helpful in our experiments because being domain-specific, biomedical language is conventionalised and therefore less varied in terms of verb sense and usage than general language.",
        "For example, verbs have stronger SPs for their argument heads when many of their corpus occurrences are of similar sense.",
        "This renders SP-based features more useful for classification.",
        "Due to differences in the data, methods, and experimental setup, direct comparison of our performance figures with previously published ones is difficult.",
        "The closest comparison point with general language is (Korhonen et al., 2003) which reported 59% mPUR using IB to assign 110 polyse-mous English verbs into 34 classes.",
        "Our best results are substantially better (72-80% mPUR).",
        "It is encouraging that we obtained such good results despite focusing on a linguistically challenging domain.",
        "In addition to the points mentioned earlier, our future plans include seeding automatic classification with more sophisticated information acquired automatically from domain-specific texts (e.g. using named entity recognition and anaphoric linking (Vlachos et al., 2006)).",
        "We will also explore semi-automatic ml technology and active learning in aiding the classification.",
        "Finally, we plan to conduct a bigger experiment with a larger number of verbs, make the resulting classification publicly available, and demonstrate its usefulness for practical bio-nlp application tasks."
