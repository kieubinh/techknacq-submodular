        "A unique problem in Chinese language processing arises from the extensive lexical variations among major Chinese speech communities.",
        "Although different communities (e.g. Beijing, Hong Kong, Taipei and Singapore) often share a large core lexicon, lexical variations could occur in at least two ways.",
        "On the one hand, even the same word forms shared by various communities could be used with different meanings.",
        "For instance, the word ffflt (j'ulwul) refers to general housing in Mainland China but specifically to housing under the Home Ownership Scheme in Hong Kong.",
        "On the other hand, there are substantially different lexical items used for lexicalizing common or region-specific concepts.",
        "For example, while the word iiJ§ (zhu4fang2) is similarly used as ^ M to mean general housing in Mainland China, it is rarely seen in the Hong Kong context; and T\"fS} (xia4gang3) is specific, if not exclusive, to Mainland China for referring to a special concept of unemployment.",
        "Existing Chinese lexical resources are often based on language use in one particular region and are therefore not comprehensive enough to capture the substantial regional variation as an important part of the lexical knowledge, which will be useful and critical for many NLP applications, including natural language understanding, information retrieval, and machine translation.",
        "Tsou and Kwong (2006) proposed a comprehensive Pan-Chinese lexical resource, using a large and unique synchronous Chinese corpus as an authentic source of lexical variation among various Chinese speech communities.",
        "They also studied the feasibility of taking an existing Chinese thesaurus as leverage and classifying new words from various Chinese communities with respect to the classificatory structure therein (Kwong and Tsou, 2007).",
        "They used the catego-",
        "i The transcriptions in brackets are based on Hanyu Pinyin.",
        "ries at the subclass level of the Tongyici Cilin (|n] j|§sj§sj#, abbreviated as Cilin hereafter) for the task.",
        "The classification was done by comparing the similarity of a target word (i.e. the word to be classified) and individual categories of words in the thesaurus based on a feature vector of co-occurring words in a corpus.",
        "Since words in the thesaurus are mostly based on lexical items used in Mainland China, and the target words come from various Chinese communities, a major issue in the classification task is thus the heterogeneity of the data sources.",
        "It was hypothesized that the datasets from which the features were extracted (for the target words and words in the thesaurus respectively) may affect the performance of automatic classification.",
        "The experimental results supported the hypothesis in part, and the actual effect varied with datasets from individual regions.",
        "Moreover, there is room to improve the overall accuracy for the method to be useful in practice, and it appears that the duplicated words in the thesaurus might have skewed the similarity measurement to a certain extent.",
        "The current study thus attempts to extend this previous study in three respects: (1) to improve automatic classification by removing duplicated words from the thesaurus, (2) to experiment with classifying words at the subclass level and semantic head level (a finer level), and (3) to further investigate the possible effects of data heterogeneity between the region-specific words and words in the thesaurus on classification performance.",
        "In Section 2, we will briefly review related work and the background of the current study.",
        "In Sections 3 and 4, we will describe the materials used and the experimental setup respectively.",

        "To build a semantic lexicon, one has to identify the relation between words within a semantic hierarchy, and to group similar words together into a class.",
        "Previous work on automatic methods for building semantic lexicons could be divided into two main groups.",
        "One is automatic thesaurus acquisition, that is, to identify synonyms or topically related words from corpora based on various measures of similarity (e.g. Riloff and Shepherd, 1997; Lin, 1998; Caraballo, 1999; Thelen and Riloff, 2002; You and Chen, 2006).",
        "Another line of research, which is more closely related to the current study, is to extend existing thesauri by classifying new words with respect to their given structures (e.g. Tokunaga et al., 1997; Pekar, 2004).",
        "An early effort along this line is Hearst (1992), who attempted to identify hyponyms from large text corpora, based on a set of lexico-syntactic patterns, to augment and critique the content of WordNet.",
        "Ciaramita (2002) compared several models in classifying nouns with respect to a simplified version of WordNet and signified the gain in performance with morphological features.",
        "For Chinese, Tseng (2003) proposed a method based on morphological similarity to assign a Cilin category to unknown words from the Sinica corpus which were not in the Chinese Electronic Dictionary and Cilin; but somehow the test data were taken from Cilin, and therefore could not really demonstrate the effectiveness with unknown words found in the Sinica corpus.",
        "Kwong and Tsou (2007) attempted to classify words distinctly used in Beijing, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan, with respect to the Cilin classificatory structure.",
        "They brought up the issue of data heterogeneity in the task.",
        "In general, automatic classification of words via similarity measurement between two words, or between a word and a class of words, was often done on words from a similar data source, with the assumption that the feature vectors under comparison are directly comparable.",
        "In the Pan-Chinese context, however, the words to be classified come from corpora collected from various Chinese speech communities, but the words in the thesaurus are often based on usages found in a particular community, such as Mainland China in the case of Cilin.",
        "It is thus questionable whether the words in Cilin would appear in comparable contexts in texts from other places, thus affecting the similarity measurement.",
        "In view of this heterogeneous nature of the data, they experimented with extracting feature vectors for the Cilin words from different datasets and found that the classification of words from Taipei was most affected in this regard.",
        "In general, up to 85% accuracy was reached with the top 15 candidates for classification at the Cilin subclass level.",
        "This performance, however, should be improved for the method to be useful in practice.",
        "It is observed that Cilin, as most other thesauri, does not have a mutually exclusive classification.",
        "Many words appear in more than one category (at various levels).",
        "Such duplication may affect the similarity comparison between a target word and words in a category.",
        "The current study thus attempts to avoid this confounding factor by removing duplicated words from Cilin for the comparison of similarity, and to extend the classification to a finer level."

        "The various Chinese speech communities might differ not only in the lexical items they use, but also in the way they use the lexical items in common.",
        "The demand on cross-cultural knowledge thus poses a challenge for building a PanChinese lexical resource manually.",
        "Cilin, for instance, is quite biased in language use in Mainland China, and it requires experts with knowledge of a wide variety of Chinese terms to be able to manually classify lexical items specific to other Chinese speech communities.",
        "It is therefore even more important to devise robust ways for automatic classification of words from various regions.",
        "The data heterogeneity effect is quite different for the classification of SG words and TW words, but apparently not very significant for HK words.",
        "Beyond the top 5 to 10 candidates, features extracted from the SG subcorpus for Cilin words seem to have an advantage.",
        "This suggests that although the SG subcorpus shares those words in Cilin, the context in which they are used might be slightly different from their use in Mainland China.",
        "Thus extracting their contextual features from the SG subcorpus might better reflect their usage and make them more comparable with the target words from SG.",
        "For the TW words, on the contrary, features for Cilin words extracted from the BJ subcorpus always have an advantage over those extracted from the TW subcorpus.",
        "As Kwong and Tsou (2006) observed, Beijing and Taipei data share the least number of lexical items among the four regions under investigation.",
        "Words in Cilin therefore might not have the appropriate contextual feature vectors extracted from the TW subcorpus.",
        "In order to study the actual effect of various experimental conditions on the classification of individual target words, we also worked out the change in the ranking (Ar) of the correct category for each target word.",
        "A negative Ar thus corresponds to an improvement in the classification as the new ranking of the correct category is smaller (earlier) than the old one.",
        "Table 3 shows some examples with improvement in this regard.",
        "The Rank column refers to the rank of the correct category in Sub-{bj,hk,tw,sg}-bj, Ar(D) is the change after duplicates were removed from Cilin, and Ar(H) is the change from Sub-x-x conditions.",
        "Take the example of the BJ target word fall 4fc (xin4xi1hua4, informationize).",
        "Before duplicated words were removed from Cilin, the most appropriate subclass (Ih:Change) ranked 7th in the automatic classification.",
        "Upon the removal of duplicated words, subclass Ih ranked first in the results.",
        "The words shared by other top ranking subclasses (e.g. Je:influence, Da:condition, etc.)",
        "such as ]Q (jia1, increase), ffl (tui1, push), $jeMs (ti2gao1, raise), etc., may have skewed the similarity comparison by introducing many common co-occurring words which are not particularly characteristic of any subclass.",
        "For the TW target word Sfff (tou2xin4, investment trust), the appropriate subclass (Disorganization) soared from the 16th to the 3rd when features were extracted for the Cilin words from the BJ subcorpus instead of the TW subcorpus.",
        "It was observed that both vectors have a large part in common, but the one extracted from TW subcorpus contained many more spurious features which might not be characteristic of the subclass, thus affecting the similarity score.",
        "It is also apparent that region-specific but common concepts like Mfffll (xie3zi4lou2, office), ,|S JM (zu3wu1, apartment), and (si1zhai2, private residence), etc., are more adversely affected when features for Cilin words were extracted from the BJ subcorpus instead of the respective target subcorpora, while other more core financial concepts could often take advantage of the former.",
        "Thus it appears that the domain and concept specificity could also affect the effectiveness of the method.",
        "There is room to improve the results at both the subclass and semantic head level.",
        "More qualitative analysis is needed for the data heterogeneity effect.",
        "The category size, and as pointed out above, the domain and concept specificity are also worth further investigation.",
        "The latter will thus involve the classification of words from other special domains like sports, as well as those from the general domain.",
        "One problem we need to address in the next step is the class imbalance problem as Cilin categories could differ considerably in size, which will affect the number of features and subsequent classification.",
        "For this we plan to try the k nearest neighbours approach.",
        "In addition, the features might need to be constrained, as simple cooccurrence might be too coarse for distinguishing the subtle characteristics among Cilin categories."
