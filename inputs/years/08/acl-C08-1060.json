        "Several studies show the accuracy of prediction markets in predicting future events (Wolfers and Zitzewitz, 2004; Servan-Schreiber et al., 2004; Pennock et al., 2000), such as the success of upcoming movies (lank and Foutz, 2007), political stock markets (Forsythe et al., 1999) and sports betting markets (Williams, 1999).",
        "Market investors rely on daily news reports to dictate investment actions.",
        "If something positive happens for Bush (e.g. Saddam Hussein is captured), Bush will appear more likely to win, so demand increases for \"Bush to win\" shares, and the price rises.",
        "Likewise, if something negative for Bush occurs (e.g. casualties in Iraq increase), people will think he is less likely to win, sell their shares, and the price drops.",

        "Changes in public opinion should reflect changes in daily news coverage.",
        "Instead of constructing features for a single day, they can represent differences between two days of news coverage, i.e. the novelty of the coverage.",

        "Feature counts were smoothed by adding a constant (10).",
        "As shown by Wiebe et al.",
        "(2005), it is important to know not only what is being said but about whom it is said.",
        "The term \"victorious\" by itself is meaningless when discussing an election - meaning comes from the subject.",

        "Subjects can often be determined by proximity.",
        "If the word \"scandal\" and Bush are mentioned in the same sentence, this is likely to be bad for Bush.",

        "Context disambiguation comes at a high cost: about 70% of all sentences do not contain any predefined entities and about 7% contain more than one entity.",
        "These likely relevant sentences are unfortunately discarded, although future work could reduce the number of discarded sentences using coreference resolution.",
