        "The model can also translate phrases in the form uX or Xu (a single contiguous unit and a gap).",
        "If it learns that uX often translates as Xu', then in addition to learning that u translates as u', it has also learned that u switches places with a neighboring phrase during translation.",

        "Both improve over non-lexicalized Moses by about 1.4 BLEU.",
        "The hierarchical emulation owes its performance only partially to lexicalized reordering.",
        "Additional improvement is seen when we add discontiguous phrases.",
        "That the effect of lexicalized reordering is weaker in the hierarchical model is unsurprising, since its parameterization is much simpler than the one used by the Moses, which includes several specialized features for this purpose.",
        "This suggests that the hierarchical model could be improved through better parameterization, and still benefit from the translation of discontiguous phrases.",
        "Finally, we observe that using more gaps does not improve the hierarchical model.",
        "These are interesting scientific findings, but we have so far failed to show an improvement over the baseline.",
        "For this, we return to the tera-scale model of §2.",
        "Recall that in this model, we modify the baseline by adding 80 million words of UN data and using sparse maximum entropy alignments with a loose phrase extraction heuristic.",
        "To avoid conflating rules learned from in-domain newswire and out-of-domain UN data, we treat each corpus independently.",
