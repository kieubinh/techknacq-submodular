        "In traditional studies on authorship attribution, the focus is on small sets of authors.",
        "Trying to classify an unseen text as being written by one of two or of a few authors is a relatively simple task, which in most cases can be solved with high reliability and accuracies over 95%.",
        "An early statistical study by Mosteller and Wallace (1964) adopted distributions of function words as a discriminating feature to settle the disputed authorship of the Federalist Papers between three candidate authors (Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay).",
        "The advantage of distributions of function words and syntactic features is that they are not under the author's conscious control, and therefore provide good clues for authorship (Holmes, 1994).",
        "Frequencies of rewrite rules (Baayen et al., 1996), n-grams of syntactic labels from partial parsing (Hirst and Feiguina, 2007), n-grams of parts-of-speech (Diederich et al., 2000), function words (Miranda Garcia and Calle Martin, 2007), and functional lexical features (Argamon et al., 2007) have all been claimed to be reliable markers of style.",
        "There is of course a difference between claims about types of features and claims about individual features of that type.",
        "E.g., it may be correct to claim that distributions of function words are important markers of author identity, but the distribution of a particular function word, while useful to distinguish between one particular pair of authors, may be irrelevant when comparing another pair of authors.",
        "The field of authorship attribution is however dominated by studies potentially overestimating the importance of these specific predictive features in experiments discriminating between only two or a few authors.",
        "Taking into account a larger set of authors allows the computation of the degree of variability encountered in text on a single topic of different (types of) features.",
        "Recently, research has started to focus on authorship attribution on larger sets of authors: 8 (Van Halteren, 2005), 20 (Argamon et al., 2003), 114 (Madigan et al., 2005), or up to thousands of authors (Koppel et al., 2006) (see Section 5).",
        "A second problem in traditional studies are the unrealistic sizes of training data, which also makes the task considerably easier.",
        "Researchers tend to use over 10,000 words per author (Argamon et al., 2007; Burrows, 2007; Gamon, 2004; Hirst and Feiguina, 2007; Madigan et al., 2005; Stamatatos, 2007), which is regarded to be 'a reliable minimum for an authorial set' (Burrows, 2007).",
        "When no long texts are available, for example in poems (Coyotl-Morales et al., 2006) or student essays (Van Halteren, 2005), a large number of short texts is selected for training for each author.",
        "One of the few studies focusing on small texts is Feiguina and Hirst (2007), but they select hundreds of these short texts (here 100, 200 or 500 words).",
        "The accuracy of any of these studies with unrealistic sizes of training data is overestimated when compared to realistic situations.",
        "When only limited data is available for a specific author, the author attribution task becomes much more difficult.",
        "In forensics, where often only one small text per candidate author is available, traditional approaches are less reliable than expected from reported results.",
        "In this paper, we present a more realistic interpretation of the authorship attribution task, viz. as a problem of authorship verification.",
        "This is a much more natural task, since the group of potential authors for a document is essentially unknown.",
        "Forensic experts not only want to identify the author given a small set of suspects, they also want to make sure the author is not someone else not under investigation.",
        "They often deal with short emails or letters and have only limited data available.",
        "The central question in authorship verification is Did candidate author x write the document?",
        "Of the three basic approaches to authorship verification - also including a one-class learning approach (Koppel et al., 2007) - we selected a one vs. all approach.",
        "This approach is similar to the one investigated by Argamon et al.",
        "(2003), which allows for a better comparison of results.",
        "With only few positive instances and a large number of negative instances to learn from, we are dealing with highly skewed class distributions.",
        "We show, on the basis of a new corpus with 145 authors, what the effect is of many authors on feature selection and learning, and show robustness of a memory-based learning approach in doing authorship attribution and verification with many authors and limited training data when compared to eager learning methods such as SVMs and maximum entropy learning.",
        "As far as feature selection is concerned, we find that similar types of features tend to work well for small and large sets of authors, but that no generalisations can be made about individual features.",
        "Classification accuracy is clearly overestimated in authorship attribution with few authors.",
        "Experiments in authorship verification with a one vs. all approach reveal that machine learning methods are able to correctly classify up to 56% of the positive instances in test data.",
        "For our experiments, we use the Personae corpus, a collection of student essays by 145 authors (see Section 2).",
        "Most studies in stylometry focus on English, whereas our focus is on Dutch written language.",
        "Nevertheless, the techniques used are transferable to other languages."

        "lrThe Personae corpus can be downloaded from http://www.cnts.ua.ac.be/~kim/Personae.html",
        "egorization systems, we take a two-step approach-in which our system (i) achieves automatic selection of features that have high predictive value for the categories to be learned (see Section 3.1), and (ii) uses machine learning algorithms to learn to categorize new documents by using the features selected in the first step (see Section 3.2).",
        "Syntactic features have been proposed as more reliable style markers than for example token-level features since they are not under the conscious control of the author (Baayen et al., 1996; Arga-mon et al., 2007).",
        "To allow the selection of linguistic features rather than (n-grams of) terms, robust and accurate text analysis tools such as lem-matizers, part of speech taggers, chunkers etc., are needed.",
        "We use the Memory-Based Shallow Parser (MBSP) (Daelemans and van den Bosch, 2005), which gives an incomplete parse of the input text, to extract reliable syntactic features.",
        "MBSP tokenizes the input, performs a part-of-speech analysis, looks for noun phrase, verb phrase and other phrase chunks and detects subject and object of the sentence and a number of other grammatical relations.",
        "Word or part-of-speech (n-grams) occurring more often than expected with either of the categories are extracted automatically for every document.",
        "We use the % metric (see Figure 1), which calculates the expected and observed frequency for every item in every category, to identify features that are able to discriminate between the categories under investigation.",
        "Distributions of n-grams of lexical features (lex) are represented numerically in the feature vectors, as well as of n-grams of both fine-grained (pos) and coarse-grained parts-of-speech (cgp).",
        "The most predictive function words are present in the fwd feature set.",
        "For all of these features, the %value is calculated.",
        "An implementation of the Flesch-Kincaid metric indicating the readability of a text, along with its components (viz., mean word and sentence length) and the type-token ratio (which indicates vocabulary richness) are also represented (tok).",

        "(a) the effect of many authors on feature selection and learning;",
        "(b) the effect of limited data in authorship attribution;",
        "(c) the results of authorship verification using many authors and limited data on learning.",

        "We investigate (b) by performing authorship attribution on 2 and 145 authors while gradually increasing the amount of training data, keeping test set size constant at 20% of the entire corpus.",
        "The resulting learning curve will be used to compare performance of eager and lazy learners (see Section 5.1).",
        "The authorship verification task (c) - which is closer to a realistic situation in e.g. forensics using limited data and many authors is approximated as a skewed binary classification task {one vs. all).",
        "For each of the 145 authors, we have 80% of the text in training and 20% in test.",
        "The negative class contains 80% of each of the other 144 author's training data in training and 20% in test (see Section 5.2).",

        "Memory-based learning stores feature representations of training instances in memory without abstraction and classifies new instances by matching their feature representation to all instances in memory.",
