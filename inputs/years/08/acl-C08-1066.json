        "A necessary (if not sufficient) condition for true natural language understanding is a mastery of open-domain natural language inference (NLI): the task of determining whether a natural-language hypothesis can be inferred from a given premise.",
        "Indeed, NLI can enable more immediate applications, such as semantic search and question answering (Harabagiu and Hickl, 2006).",
        "In recent years a spectrum of approaches to robust, open-domain NLI have been explored within the context of the Recognizing Textual Entailment challenge (Dagan et al., 2005).",
        "Up to now, the most successful approaches have used fairly shallow semantic representations, relying on measures of lexical or semantic overlap (Jijkoun and de Ri-jke, 2005), pattern-based relation extraction (Romano et al., 2006), or approximate matching of predicate-argument structure (Hickl et al., 2006).",
        "Such methods, while robust and often effective, are at best partial solutions, unable to explain even simple forms of logical inference.",
        "For example, most shallow approaches would fail to license the introduction of large in the following example:",
        "(1) Every firm saw costs grow more than expected, even after adjusting for inflation.",
        "Every large firm saw costs grow.",
        "At the other extreme, some researchers have approached NLI as logical deduction, building on work in theoretical semantics to translate sentences into first-order logic (FOL), and then applying a theorem prover or model builder (Akhmatova, 2005; Fowler et al., 2005).",
        "Regrettably, such approaches tend to founder on the myriad complexities of full semantic interpretation, including tense, aspect, causality, intensionality, modality, vagueness, idioms, indexicals, ellipsis, and many other issues.",
        "(What is the right FOL representation of (1), for example?)",
        "FOL-based systems that have attained high precision (Bos and Markert, 2006) have done so at the cost of very poor recall.",
        "This work explores a middle way, by developing a computational model of what Lakoff (1970) called natural logic, which characterizes valid patterns of inference in terms of syntactic forms resembling natural language as much as possible.",
        "For example, natural logic might sanction (1) by observing that: in ordinary (upward monotone) contexts, deleting modifiers preserves truth; in downward monotone contexts, inserting modifiers preserves truth; and every is downward monotone in its restrictor NP.",
        "A natural logic system can thus achieve the expressivity and precision needed to handle a great variety of simple logical inferences, while sidestepping the difficulties of full semantic interpretation."

        "The natural logic approach originated in traditional logic (e.g., Aristotle's syllogisms), and was revived in a formal form by van Benthem (1986) and Sanchez Valencia (1991), who proposed a natural logic based on categorial grammar to handle inferences involving containment relations and upward and downward mono tonicity, such as (1).",
        "Their monotonicity calculus explains inferences involving even nested inversions of monotonicity, but because it lacks any representation of exclusion (as opposed to containment), it cannot explain simple inferences such as (38) and (205) in table 2, below.",
        "Another model which arguably follows the natural logic tradition (though not presented as such) was developed by Nairn et al.",
        "(2006) to explain inversions and nestings of implicative (and factive) predicates, as in Ed did not forget to force Dave to leave |= Dave left.",
        "Their implication projection algorithm bears some resemblance to the monotonicity calculus, but does not incorporate containment relations or explain interactions between implica-tives and monotonicity, and thus fails to license John refused to dance |= John didn't tango.",

        "'s model of implicatives.",
        "We (1) augment the set of entailment relations used in monotonicity calculus to include representations of exclusion; (2) generalize the concept of monotonicity to one of projectivity, which describes how the entailments of a compound expression depend on the entailments of its parts; and (3) describe a weak proof procedure based on composing entailment relations across chains of atomic edits.",
        "Entailment relations.",
        "We employ an inventory of seven mutually exclusive basic entailment relations, defined by analogy with set relations: equivalence {couch = sofa); forward entailment {crow rz bird) and its converse {European □ French); negation, or exhaustive exclusion {human ~ non-human); alternation, or non-exhaustive exclusion {cat | dog); cover, or non-exclusive exhaustion {animal ^ nonhuman); and independence {hungry # hippo), which covers all other cases.",
        "As in the monotonicity calculus, we define these relations for expressions of every semantic type: sentences, common and proper nouns, transitive and intransitive verbs, adjectives, and so on.",
        "For example, among generalized quantifiers, we find that all = every, every rz some, some ~ no, no \\ every, at least four ^ at most six, and most # ten or more.",
        "Projectivity.",
        "In order to explain the entailments of a compound expression as a function of the entailments of its parts, we categorize semantic functions according to their projectivity class, a concept which generalizes both Sanchez Valencia's monotonicity classes (upward, downward, and non-monotone) and the nine implication signatures of Nairn et al.",
        "The projectivity class of a function / describes how the entailment relation between f(x) and f(y) depends on the entailment relation between x and y.",
        "Consider simple negation {not).",
        "Like most functions, it projects = and # without change {not happy = not glad and isn't swimming # isn't hungry).",
        "As a downward monotone function, it swaps IZ and □ {didn't kiss □ didn't touch).",
        "But we can also establish that it projects \" without change {not human \" not nonhuman) and swaps | and ^ {not French ^ not German, not more than 4 \\ not less than 6).",

        "Projectivity thus allows us to determine the entailments of a compound expression recursively, by propagating entailments upward through a semantic composition tree according to the projectivity class of each node on the path to the root.",
        "For example, the semantics of Nobody can enter without a shirt might be represented by the tree {nobody {can {{without {a shirt)) enter))).",

        "If two expressions are connected by a chain of atomic edits, we can determine the entailment relation between them by composing (as in Tarskian relation algebra) the entailment relations generated by each edit.",
        "The result may be a basic entailment relation, or may be a union of such relations, with larger unions conveying less information about entailment.",
        "This possibility, coupled with the need to find a chain of atomic edits which preserves relevant entailment relations, limits the power of the proof procedure described.",
        "Implicatives.",
        "The account of implicatives and factives given by Nairn et al.",
        "hinges on a classification of implicative and factive operators into nine implication signatures, according to their implications – positive (+), negative (-), or null (o) – in both positive and negative contexts.",
        "Thus refuse has implication signature -lo, because it carries a negative implication in a positive context {refused to dance implies didn't dance), and no implication in a negative context {didn't refuse to dance implies neither danced nor didn't dance).",
        "Most of the phenomena observed by Nairn et al.",
        "can be explained within our framework by specifying, for each signature, the relation generated when an operator of that signature is deleted from a compound expression.",
        "For example, deleting signature lo generates | {Jim refused to dance \\ Jim danced); under negation, this is projected as ^ {Jim didn't refuse to dance ^ Jim didn't dance).",
        "By contrast, deleting signature o/- generates □ {Jim attempted to dance □ Jim danced); under negation, this is projected as rz {Jim didn't attempt to dance rz Jim didn't dance)?",
        "We can also account for monotonicity effects of implicative and factive operators by describing the projectivity properties of each implication signature: signatures +/-, +/o, and ol- are upward monotone {attempt to tango rz attempt to dance); signatures -/+, -lo, and o/+ are downward monotone {refuse to dance rz refuse to tango); and signatures +/+, -/-, and o/o are non-monotone {think dancing is fun # think tangoing is fun)."

        "Due to the character of RTE problems, we do not expect NatLog to be a good general-purpose solution to solving all RTE problems.",
        "First, most RTE problems depend on forms of inference, such as paraphrase, temporal reasoning, or relation extraction, which NatLog is not designed to address.",
        "Second, in most RTE problems, the edit distance between premise and hypothesis is relatively large.",
        "More atomic edits means a greater chance that errors made in lexical entailment classification or projection will propagate, via entailment composition, to the system's final output.",
        "Rather, in applying NatLog to RTE, we hope to make reliable predictions on a subset of RTE problems, trading recall for precision.",
        "If we succeed, then we may be able to hybridize with a broad-coverage RTE system to obtain better results than either system individually – the same strategy that was adopted by (Bos and Markert, 2006) for their FOL-based system.",
        "For this purpose, we have chosen to use the Stanford RTE system described in (de Marn-effe et al., 2006).",
        "We also use the Stanford system to generate alignments when evaluating NatLog on RTE problems.",
        "Table 6 shows the performance of NatLog on RTE3 data.",
        "Relative to the Stanford system, NatLog achieves high precision on its yes predictions – above 70% – suggesting that hybridizing may be effective.",
        "For comparison, the FOL-based system reported in (Bos and Markert, 2006) attained a similarly high precision of 76% on RTE2 problems, but was able to make a positive prediction in only about 4% of cases.",
        "Nat-Log makes positive predictions far more often – in about 25% of cases.",
        "The Stanford system makes yes/no predictions",
        "Table 6: Performance of various systems on RTE3 (two-way classification).",
        "The columns show the data set used (800 problems each), the proportion of yes predictions, precision and recall for the yes class, and accuracy.",
        "by thresholding a real-valued inference score.",
        "To construct a hybrid system, we adjust the Stanford inference scores by +A or – A, depending on whether or not NatLog predicts yes.",
        "We choose A by optimizing development set accuracy, while adjusting the threshold to generate balanced predictions (that is, equal numbers of yes and no predictions).",
        "As an additional experiment, we fix A at this value and then adjust the threshold to optimize development set accuracy, resulting in an excess of yes predictions.",
        "(Since this optimization is based solely on development data, its use on test data is fully legitimate.)",
        "Results for these two cases are shown in table 6.",
        "The parameters tuned on development data gave good results on test data.",
        "The optimized hybrid system attained an absolute accuracy gain of 4% over the Stanford system, corresponding to an extra 32 problems answered correctly.",
        "This result is statistically significant (p < 0.05, McNemar's test, 2-tailed).",
        "The gains attributable to NatLog are exemplified by problem 788 (table 5).",
        "NatLog sanctions the deletion of a restrictive modifier and an appos-itive from the premise, and recognizes that deleting a negation generates a contradiction; thus it correctly answers no.",
        "On the other hand, there are many RTE problems where NatLog's precision works against it.",
        "For example, NatLog answers no to problem 71 because it cannot account for the insertion of acts as in the hypothesis.",

        "We do not claim natural logic to be a universal solution for NLI.",
        "Many important types of inference are not amenable to natural logic, including paraphrase (Eve was let go |= Eve lost her job), verb alternation (he drained the oil |= the oil drained), relation extraction (Aho, a trader at UBS, ... |= Aho works for UBS), common-sense reasoning (the sink overflowed \\= the floor got wet), and so on.",
        "Moreover, because natural logic has a weaker proof theory than FOL, some inferences lie beyond its deductive power.",
        "For example, it cannot explain inferences involving DeMorgan's laws for quantifiers, as in Not all birds fly = Some birds don't fly.",
        "However, by incorporating semantic containment, semantic exclusion, and implicativity, the model of natural logic developed in this paper succeeds in explaining a great variety of everyday patterns of inference.",
        "Ultimately, open-domain NLI is likely to require combining disparate reasoners, and a facility for natural logic inference is a good candidate to be a component of such a solution.",
