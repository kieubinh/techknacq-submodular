        "Recently, there have been advancement made in the parsing techniques for large-scale lexicalized grammars (Clark and Curran, 2004; Ninomiya et al., 2005; Ninomiya et al., 2007), and it have presumably been accelerated by the development of the semi-automatic acquisition techniques of large-scale lexicalized grammars from parsed corpora (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2007; Miyao et al., 2005).",
        "In many of the studies on lexicalized grammar parsing, the accuracy of the parsing results is evaluated in terms of the accuracy of the semantic representations output by the parsers.",
        "Since the formalisms for the semantic representation are different across the grammar frameworks, it has been difficult to directly compare the performance of the parsers developed for different grammar frameworks.",
        "Several researchers in the field of lexicalized grammar parsing have recently started to seek a common representation of parsing results across different grammar frameworks (Clark and Curran, 2007; Miyao et al., 2007).",
        "For example, Clark and Curran (2007) developed a set of mapping rules from the output of a Combinatorial Catego-rial grammar parser to the Grammatical Relations (GR) (Carroll et al., 1998).",
        "They found that the manual development of such mapping rules is not a trivial task; their mapping rules covered only 85% of the GRs in a GR-annotated corpus; i.e., 15% of the GRs in the corpus could not be covered by the mapping from the gold-standard CCG analyses of those sentences.",
        "We propose another method for the cross-framework performance analysis of the parsers wherein the output of parsers are first converted to a CFG tree.",
        "Specifically, we use CFG trees of the style used in the Penn Treebank (PTB) (Marcus et al., 1994), in which the non-terminal labels are simple phrasal categories (i.e., we do not use function-tags, empty nodes, and co-indexing).",
        "We hereafter name such CFG trees, 'PTB-CFG trees.'",
        "We use an automatic tree converter based on a stochastic synchronous grammar in order to make the PTB-CFG trees from the analyses based on a lexicalized grammar.",
        "In such a shallow representation, some information given by the lexicalized parsers is lost.",
        "For instance, long-distance dependency and control/raising distinction cannot be directly represented in the PTB-CFG tree.",
        "From the viewpoint of NLP-application developer, the parser evaluation based on such a shallow representation may be not very informative because performance metrics based on the shallow representation, e.g., labeled bracketing accuracy, do not serve as a direct indicator of the usefulness of the parser in their applications.",
        "Nevertheless, we consider the parser performance analysis based on the shallow representation is still very useful from the viewpoint of parser developers because the accuracy of the structure of the CFG-trees is, though not an ideal one, a good indicator of the parsers' structural disambiguation performance.",
        "In addition, there are at least two advantages in using the CFG-trees as the common representation for the evaluation.",
        "The first advantage is that the conversion from the parser's output to the CFG-trees can be achieved with much higher accuracy than to deeper representations like GRs; we obtained a conversion accuracy of around 98% in our experiments using an HPSG grammar.",
        "The accuracy of the conversion is critical in the quantitative comparison of parsers that have similar performances because the difference in the parsers' ability would soon be masked by the errors introduced in the conversion process.",
        "The second advantage is that we can compare the converted output directly against the outputs of the well-studied CFG-parsers derived from PTB.",
        "In the experiments, we applied the conversion to an HPSG parser, and compared the results against several CFG parsers.",
        "We found that the parsing accuracy of the HPSG parser is a few points lower than state-of-the-art CFG parsers in terms of the labeled bracketing accuracy.",
        "By further investigating the parsing results, we have identified a portion of the reason for the discrepancy, which comes from the difference in the architecture of the parsers."

        "Next, we introduce a specific instance of the treebank-derived lexicalized grammars used in our experiment: the Enju English HPSG grammar.",
        "Using the Enju grammar as a concrete example, we present the motivations for our tree conversion method based on a stochastic synchronous grammar.",
        "We also provide a summary of the basic concepts and terminologies of the stochastic synchronous grammar.",
        "A lexicalized grammar generally has two components: a small set of grammar rules and a large set of lexical items.",

        "Find a lexical item for each word in the sentences so that it matches the reanalysis of the sentence, and extract it.",

        "We used the Enju English HPSG grammar (Miyao et al., 2005) in the experiments.",
        "The design of the grammar basically follows the definition in the text by Pollard and Sag (1994).",

        "Similarly to the PTB-CFG trees, the simplified HPSG trees do not include empty categories, co-indexing, and function-tags.",
        "However, we cannot attain a PTB-CFG tree by simply mapping those atomic symbols to the corresponding PTB non-terminal symbols, because the analyses by the PTB-CFG and the HPSG yield different tree structures for the same sentence.",
        "The conversion of the tree structure from HPSG trees to PTB-CFG trees can be regarded as the inverse-mapping of the transformation from PTB trees to HPSG trees implemented in the Mayz program.",
        "A most notable transformation is the bina-rization of the PTB trees; all the branches in the HPSG treebank are unary or binary.",
        "The binarization scheme used in Mayz is similar to the head-centered binarization, which is often used for the extraction of 'Markovised' PCFGs from the treebank.",
        "Mayz identifies the head daughters by using a modified version of Collins' head finding rules (Collins, 1999).",
        "It is also notable that the PTB-to-HPSG transformation by Mayz often makes a bracketing in the HPSG analyses that crosses with the original bracketing in the PTB.",
        "Such a transformation is used, for instance, to change the attachment level of an article to a noun phrase with a post-modifier (Figure 1).",
        "The tree transformation by Mayz is achieved by sequentially applying many tree transformation rules to an input PTB tree.",

        "Our objective of automatic conversion between syntactic analyses is similar to the tree-to-tree machine translation.",
        "An important difference is that, for our purpose, the generated tree pair should have the same yields since they are two analyses of the same sentence.",
        "We also want the synchronous grammar to be able to generate a pair of trees wherein some constituents in one tree cross with the constituents in the other tree; for example, such a tree-transformation is necessary to change the article-attachment levels.",

        "When only T\\ (or T2) includes one or more unary productions on a common span, we selected the uppermost node of the chain of the unary productions in Ti, and the corresponding node in T2 as the split points.",
        "A node on the yields of the resulting tree-fragments is either a terminal node or a node in a common-span node pair that is selected as a split node.",
        "We make the synchronous productions by placing links between the common-span node pairs on the yields of the tree-fragment pairs.",
        "We can show that the grammar obtained as above only generates pairs of identical sentences by noting that the terminal symbols on the yields of two local trees in a synchronous production, if any, are always identical.",

        "The results indicate, for example, that there is a significant difference between the two parsers in the ability to identify the root of a sentence (the first and third row).",
        "Investigation of the Enju parser's output including the root identification errors revealed that almost all of the errors of this type were caused by POS-tagging error; for example, when the matrix verb of a sentence, like 'costs,' is mistakenly tagged as a noun, the matrix verb is not identiied as the root (as in the case with the irst row), and the subject is often mistakenly identiied as the root (as in the case with the third row).",
        "This weak-point of the Enju parser is a consequence of the architecture of the parser, wherein the POS-tagging phase is completely separated from the parsing phase.",
        "Although this weak-point has already been pointed out (Yoshida et al., 2007), we expect that we can identify other reasons for the difference in the parsers' performances by investigating the other types of errors with small p-values as well."

        "The experimental results showed that our method gave a conversion accuracy of around 98% in terms of the labeled bracketing accuracy, which was suficiently high for extracting a meaningful conclusion from a quantitative comparison of the parsers' performance.",
        "Furthermore, we conducted a comparative analysis of the parsing results represented in word-word dependencies extracted from the shallow CFG analyses.",
        "As a result, we could identified a weak-point of the HPSG parser that comes from the parser's architecture."
