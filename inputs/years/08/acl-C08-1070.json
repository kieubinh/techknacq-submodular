        "Many temporal expressions in text are underspecified, requiring contextually-sourced information in order to determine their correct interpretation.",
        "In some cases, it is sufficient to determine what is sometimes called the temporal focus, so that the precise location of a relative temporal expression on a timeline can be determined with respect to this 'time of speaking'.",
        "Consider, for example, expressions like the following:",
        "Once we know the temporal focus, calculation of the temporal location referred to in each of these cases is straightforward, since the temporal expressions themselves explicitly indicate what we will call the direction of offset (here, respectively, past, past and future).",
        "However, in other cases there is no explicit indication of the direction of offset from the temporal focus.",
        "This is most obviously the case when bare expressions based on calendar cycles – i.e., weekday names and month names – are used, as in the following example:",
        "(4) lones met with Defense Minister Paulo Portas on Tuesday and will meet Foreign Minister Antonio Martins da Cruz before leaving Portugal Wednesday.",
        "Here, the proper interpretation of the references to Tuesday and Wednesday requires at the least a correct syntactic analysis of the sentence, in order to locate the controlling verb for each weekday name.",
        "The tense of this verb can then be used to determine the direction – either in the past or in the future – in which we need to look to establish the fully specified date referred to.",
        "In the case of example (4), this means determining that Tuesday is in the scope of the verb met, and that Wednesday is in the scope of the verb group will meet.",
        "As we note below, it turns out that there are cases where even the controlling verb does not provide sufficient information to determine the direction of offset.",
        "But even in those cases where the tense of the verb does provide the relevant information, there are two problems.",
        "First, especially when the sentences considered are complex, there is a non-negligible likelihood that the analysis returned by a parser may not be correct, and this is especially the case when the sentences in question contain structures such as prepositional phrases: the attachment of these is notoriously a source of ambiguity, and they just happen to often be the hosts to temporal expressions.",
        "Second, even if a parser provides the correct analysis, parsing technology is still computationally expensive to use when processing very large bodies of text; if we are interested in time-stamping events described in significant volumes of data, we would prefer to have a faster, more heuristic-based approach.",
        "In this paper, we explore the development of a fast and high accuracy algorithm for the interpretation of weekday names, in particular with regard to determining the direction of offset to be used in the temporal interpretation of these expressions: in essence, how can we determine whether the day referred to is in the past or in the future?",
        "The rest of the paper is structured as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we present some general observations on the interpretation of weekday names in text.",
        "Section 3 provides a review of related work.",
        "In Section 4 we describe the corpus used for evaluation, and in Section 5 we describe in detail the various algorithms we evaluated.",
        "Section 6 compares the results of the various algorithms when applied to the corpus, and Section 7 provides an error analysis.",
        "Finally, in Section 8 we draw some conclusions and point to future work."

      "heading": "2. The Problem",
      "text": [
        "The interpretation of relative temporal expressions can be seen as a two step process: (1) first we have to determine a reference point for the interpretation of the expression; (2) then we have to calculate the actual position of the referred-to time on the timeline.",
        "Once we have the reference point determined, the interpretation of the offset from this reference point requires us to determine the magnitude and direction of offset.",
        "As noted above, in some cases the tense of the controlling verb will indicate the direction of offset; but prepositional attachment ambiguity can easily damage the reliability of such an approach, as demonstrated by the following minimal pair:",
        "(5) We can show you some pictures on Monday.",
        "(6) We can show you some pictures from Monday.",
        "In example (5), the correct PP attachment is required in order to determine that Monday is in the",
        "!In the literature, a variety of different terms are used: (Schilder and Habel, 2001) call these expressions indexicals, and (Han et al., 2006b) uses the term relative for what we call anaphoric references: in our terminology, both deictic and anaphorical expressions are relative.",
        "scope of the verb group can show, allowing us to infer that the Monday in question is in the future.",
        "Example (6), on the other hand, is quite ambiguous and requires world knowledge in order to determine the correct attachment.",
        "We are interested, therefore, in determining whether some heuristic method might provide good results.",
        "In the rest of this paper, we focus on the determination of the direction of offset.",
        "We will not explicitly address the question of determining the temporal focus: although this is clearly a key ingredient, we have found that using the document creation date performs well for the kinds of documents (typically newswire stories and similar document types) we are working with.",
        "More sophisticated strategies for temporal focus tracking would likely be required in other genres."

        "Filatova and Hovy (2001) assign time stamps to clauses in which an event is mentioned.",
        "As part of the overall process, they use a heuristic for the interpretation of weekday names: if the day name in a clause is the same as that of the temporal focus, then the temporal focus is used; otherwise, they look for any 'signal words' or check the tense of the verb in the clause.",

        "In this formalism each temporal expression is converted to a formula in LCNL, which then can be processed to calculate the value of a temporal expression.",

        "Our new algorithm is a hybrid solution that incorporates ideas from both of these approaches.",
        "Our baselines are motivated by the observation that days referred to by bare weekday names are typically temporally close to the temporal focus.",
        "Past 7-day Window (inclusive): This baseline looks for the specified day in a 7-day window whose last day is the temporal focus.",
        "In other words, day names are always assumed to refer to days in the last week, including the 'day of speaking'.",
        "Past 7-day window (exclusive): This is the same as the approach just described, except that we look for the referred-to day in the week leading up to but not including the 'day of speaking'.",
        "Future 7-day window (inclusive): This is the future-oriented version of the first approach described above: we look for the specified day in a 7-day window whose first day is the temporal focus.",
        "This assumes that all day name references are to the present or future.",
        "Future 7-day window (exclusive): In this case the 7-day window starts on the day following the 'day of speaking'.",
        "This algorithm was presented in (Baldwin, 2002; lang et al., 2004).",
        "It is similar to our window-based baselines, but in this case the temporal focus is the middle day of the 7-day window.",
        "This approach was used in their research after observing that 96.97% of weekday name expressions in their English corpus referred to dates within such a window.",
        "Suppose we have the following sentence in a document with creation date 2003-06-16 (a Monday):",
        "(8) Police arrested her in Abilene, Texas, Saturday where she had moved with a friend lune 2.",
        "The 7-day window then spans from Friday (lune 13) to Thursday (lune 19).",
        "The reference to Saturday is assigned (correctly) the value of the second day in the window, i.e. 2003-06-14.",
        "Note that this method will deliver the wrong result when the referred-to day actually falls further than three days either side of the temporal focus.",
        "Suppose, for example, we have the following sentence in a document written on 2005-01-01 (a Saturday):",
        "(9) We got into Heathrow on Monday morning.",
        "Here the 7-day window spans from Wednesday to Tuesday, and so the reference to Monday will be assigned the incorrect interpretation 2005-01-03.",
        "In the system presented in (Mani and Wilson, 2000), weekday name interpretation is implemented as part of a sequence of interpretation rules for temporal expression interpretation more generally.",
        "This algorithm attempts to establish the tense of what we have called the controlling verb in the following way.",
        "First, it looks backwards from the temporal expression in question to any previous temporal expression in the sentence, or if there is none, to the beginning of the sentence.",
        "If no verb is found here, then it looks between the temporal expression and the end of the sentence; and if a verb is still not found, then it looks in front of any preceding temporal expression found back to the beginning of the sentence.",

        "(4) lones met with Defense Minister Paulo Portas on Tuesday and will meet Foreign Minister Antonio Martins da Cruz before leaving Portugal Wednesday.",
        "backwards; if the tense is future, then the forward direction is used.",
        "If the verb found is in present tense, then the temporal expression is passed to a further set of interpretation rules, which check for things like the occurrence of lexical markers such as since or until.",
        "For example, in example (4), repeated below, the algorithm would correctly pick met for Tuesday and will meet for Wednesday, interpreting Tuesday as a day in a past and Wednesday as a day in future.",

        "(10) Still a decision has to made on what, if any, punishment he will face in the wake of that incident Tuesday night.",
        "In this case, the wrong verb will be identified, and the direction of offset will be incorrect.",
        "As an alternative to Mani and Wilson's approach, we also implemented a much simpler tense estimation heuristic.",
        "This checks whether the sentence contains any tokens with the VBD (i.e., past tense) part of speech tag; if one is found, then the direction of offset is assumed to be backwards, and if not, then we use the forward direction.",
        "In the case of example (4), this will assign the correct value to Tuesday, but the wrong value to Wednesday.",
        "nWhere POS tags are required in our algorithms, we used Mark Hepple's part of speech tagger, an implementation of which is available as a plugin for the GATE platform (http://gate.ac.uk).",
        "The two previous algorithms attempt to determine the controlling verb using very simple heuristics.",
        "Of course, a more reliable way of determining the controlling verb is to use a parser.",
        "We used the Stanford parser's dependency information output (see (de Marneffe et al., 2006)) to find the controlling verb of a weekday name in a sentence.",
        "This algorithm does this by traversing the resulting dependency tree from the node containing the weekday name to its root until a verb is found, and then following further dependencies to identify the whole verbal sequence.",
        "Heuristic methods for determining tense are risky, especially as the distance between the controlling verb and the temporal expression increases.",
        "We therefore propose a hybrid approach that attempts to leverage both tense estimation approaches like Mani and Wilson's, and Baldwin's window-based approach.",
        "This algorithm was developed on the basis of an error analysis of the results of using Baldwin's algorithm.",
        "It embodies a two-step approach, where we first look only in the very local environment for clues as to the tense of the controlling verb, then fall back on Baldwin's algorithm if no such evidence is found close by.",
        "First, we check if the temporal preposition since appears immediately in front of a weekday name; if so, the direction of offset is assumed to be backwards; otherwise, the algorithm looks for any verbs in a window of three tokens before and three tokens after the temporal expression.",

        "In particular, other text types are likely to require more sophisticated approaches to temporal focus tracking than we have used here.",
        "Also, we have not attempted to replicate here the machine learning approaches described in (Ahn et al., 2005) and (Ahn et al., 2007), nor Han's use of constraint satisfaction problem methods (see (Han et al., 2006a)).",
