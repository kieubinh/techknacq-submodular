        "Disfluency is one obstacle preventing speech recognition systems from being able to recognize spontaneous speech.",
        "Perhaps the most challenging aspect of disfluency recognition is the phenomenon of speech repair, which involves a speaker realizing a mistake, cutting off the flow of speech, and then continuing on, possibly retracing and replacing part of the utterance to that point.",
        "This paper will describe a system which applies a syntactic model of speech repair to a time-series parsing model, and evaluate that system on the standard Switchboard corpus parsing task.",
        "The speech repair terminology used here follows that of Shriberg (1994).",
        "A speech repair consists of a reparandum, an interruption point, and the alteration.",
        "The reparandum contains the words that the speaker means to replace, including both words that are in error and words that will be retraced.",
        "The interruption point is the point in time where the stream of speech is actually stopped, and the repairing of the mistake can begin.",
        "The alteration contains the words that are meant to replace the words in the reparandum."

      "heading": "2. Background",
      "text": [
        "Historically, research in speech repair has focused on acoustic cues such as pauses and prosodic contours for detecting repairs, which could then be excised from the text for improved transcription.",
        "Recent work has also looked at the possible contribution of higher-level cues, including syntactic structure, in the detection of speech repair.",
        "Some of this work is inspired by Levelt's (1983) investigation of the syntactic and semantic variables in speech repairs, particularly his well-formedness rule, which states that the reparandum and alteration of a repair typically have the same constituent label, similar to coordination.",
        "Hale et al.",
        "(2006) use Levelt's well-formedness rule to justify an annotation scheme where unfinished categories (marked X-UNF) have the UNF label appended to all ancestral category labels all the way up to the topmost constituent beneath an EDITED label (EDITED labels denoting a reparandum).",
        "They reason that this should prevent grammar rules of finished constituents in the corpus from corrupting the grammar of unfinished constituents.",
        "While this annotation proves helpful, it also leads to the unfortunate result that a large reparandum requires several special repair rules to be applied, even though the actual error is only happening at one point.",
        "Intuitively, though, it seems that an error is only occurring at the end of the reparandum, and that until that point only fluent grammar rules are being applied by the speaker.",
        "This intuition has also been confirmed by empirical studies (Nakatani and Hirschberg, 1994), which show that there is no obvious error signal in speech up until the moment of interruption.",
        "Although speakers may retrace much of the reparandum for clarity or other reasons, ideally the reparandum contains nothing but standard grammatical rules until the speech is interrupted.",
        "Another recent approach to this problem (Johnson and Charniak, 2004) uses a tree-adjoining grammar (TAG) approach to define a mapping between a source sentence possibly containing a repair, and a target, fluent sentence.",
        "The use of the TAG channel model is justified by the putative crossing dependencies seen in repairs like ... a flight to Boston, uh, I mean, to Denver... where there is repetition from the reparandum to the repair.",
        "Essentially, this model is building up the reparandum and alteration in tandem, based on these crossing dependencies.",
        "While this is an interesting model, it focuses on detection and removal of EDITED sections, and subsequent parsing of cleaned up speech.",
        "As such, it introduces challenges for integrating the system into a real-time speech recognizer.",
        "Recent work by Miller and Schuler (2008) showed how a probabilistic grammar trained on trees modified by use of the right-corner transform can improve parsing accuracy over an unmodified grammar when tested on the Switchboard corpus.",
        "The approach described here builds on that work in using right-corner transformed trees, and extends it by mapping them to a time-series model to do parsing directly in a model of the sort used in speech recognition.",
        "This system is shown to be more accurate than a baseline CYK parser when used to parse the Switchboard corpus.",
        "The remainder of this section will review the right-corner transform, followed by Section 3, which will step through an extended example giving details about the transform process and its applicability to the problem of processing speech repairs.",
        "'One objection to this claim is the case of multiple nested repairs.",
        "In this case, though, we presume that all reparanda were originally intended by the speaker to be fluent at the time of generation.",
        "The right-corner transform rewrites syntax trees, turning all right branching structure into left branching structure, and leaving left branching structure as is.",
        "As a result, constituent structure can be explicitly built from the bottom up during incremental recognition.",
        "This arrangement is well-suited to recognition of speech with errors, because it allows constituent structure to be built up using fluent speech rules until the moment of interruption, at which point a special repair rule may be applied.",
        "Before transforming the trees in the grammar into right-corner trees, trees are binarized in the same manner as Johnson (1998b) and Klein and Manning (2003).",
        "Binarized trees are then transformed into right-corner trees using transform rules similar to those described by Johnson (1998a).",
        "In this transform, all right branching sequences in each tree are transformed into left branching sequences of symbols of the form A1/A2, denoting an incomplete instance of category A\\ lacking an instance of category A2 to the right.",
        "Rewrite rules for the right-corner transform are shown below, first flattening right-branching structure:",
        "then replacing it with left-branching structure:",
        "Here, the first two rewrite rules are applied iteratively (bottom-up on the tree) to flatten all right branching structure, using incomplete constituents to record the original nonterminal ordering.",
        "The third rule is then applied to generate left branching structure, preserving this ordering.",
        "Because this process turns right expansion into left expansion (leaving center expansion as the only stack consumer), right-corner transformed trees also require less stack memory than ordinary phrase structure trees.",
        "This key property of the right-corner transform is exploited in the mapping of transformed training trees to a time-series model.",
        "This property will be examined further in Section 5."

        "A substantial example of a speech repair from the Switchboard corpus can be seen in Figures 1 and 2, in which the same repair and surrounding context is shown after the preliminary binarization process, and after the right-corner transform.",
        "Figure 1 also shows, in brackets, the augmented annotation described above from Hale et al.",
        "(2006).",
        "This scheme consisted of adding X to an EDITED label which produced a category X (daughter annotation), as well as propagating the -UNF label at the right corner of the tree up through every parent below the EDITED root.",
        "Before applying the right-corner transform, some corpus preprocessing steps are applied â€“ Figure 1 shows an example tree after these changes.",
        "These steps aim to improve on the default annotation of repair in the Switchboard corpus by making the representation more in line with linguistic as well as processing desiderata.",
        "The standard annotation practice of having the EDITED label as the category at the root of a reparandum does not represent any proposed linguistic phenomenon, and it conflates speech repairs of different categories.",
        "As a result, the parser is unable to make use of information about which syntactic category the reparandum was originally intended to be.",
        "This information would be useful in the example discussed here, since an unfinished NP is followed by a completed NP.",
        "The daughter annotation used by Hale et al.",
        "fixes this annotation to allow the parser to have access to this information.",
        "The annotation scheme in this paper also makes use of the daughter annotation.",
        "In addition, trees are modified to reduce the ar-ity of speech repair rules, and to change the model of how repairs occur.",
        "The default Switchboard has, e.g. an NP reparandum (headed by EDITED) and the NP alteration represented as siblings in the syntax tree.",
        "This annotation seems to implicitly model all repairs as stopping the process of producing the current constituent, then starting a new one.",
        "In contrast, the representation here models repairs of this type as a speaker generating a partial noun phrase, realizing an error, and then continuing to generate the same noun phrase.",
        "This representation scheme thus represents the beginning of an effort to distinguish between repairs that are changing the direction of the utterance and those that are just fixing a local mistake.",
        "The right corner transform is then applied to this example in Figure 2.",
        "The resulting tree representation is especially valuable because it models human production of speech repairs well, by not applying any special rule until the moment of interruption.",
        "In the example in Figure 1, there is an unfinished constituent (PP-UNF) at the end of the reparandum.",
        "This standard annotation is deficient because even if an unfinished consituent like PP-UNF is correctly recognized, and the speaker is essentially in an error state, there may be several partially completed constituents above â€“ in Figure 1, the NP, PP, and NP above the PP-UNF.",
        "These constituents need to be completed, but using the standard annotation there is only one chance to make use of the information about the error that has occurred â€“ the 'NP NP PP-UNF' rule.",
        "Thus, by the time the error section is completed, there is no information by which a parsing algorithm could choose to reduce the topmost NP to EDITED (or EDITED-NP) other than independent rule probabilities.",
        "The approach used by Hale et al.",
        "(2006) works because the information about the transition to an \"error state\" is propagated up the tree, in the form of the -UNF tags.",
        "As the parsing chart is filled in from the bottom up, each rule applied is essentially coming out of a special repair rule set, and so at the top of the tree the EDITED hypothesis is much more likely.",
        "However, this requires that several fluent speech rules from the data set be modified for use in a special repair grammar, which not only reduces the amount of available training data,",
        "EDITED-NP",
        "Figure 1: Binarized tree repair structure, with the -UNF propagation as in Hale et al.",
        "(2006) shown in brackets.",
        "NP/PP IN l l",
        "NP/NN DT the",
        "but violates our intuition that reparanda are usually fluent up until the actual edit occurs.",
        "The right corner transform works in a different way, by building up constituent structure from left to right.",
        "In Figure 2, the same repair is shown as it appears in the training data for this system.",
        "With this representation, the problem noticed by Hale and colleagues has been solved in a different way, by incrementally building up left-branching rather than right-branching structure, so that only a single special error rule is required at the end of the constituent.",
        "As seen in the figure, all of the structure beneath the EDITED-NP label is built using rules from the fluent grammar.",
        "It is only at one point, when the PP-UNF is found, that a repair rule is applied and the EDITED-NP section is found.",
        "The next step in the process is that the NP essentially restarts (the NP/NP label), and the subsequent words start to build up what will be the NP alteration in a fluent manner.",
        "To summarize, while the -UNF propagation scheme often requires the entire reparandum to be generated from a speech repair rule set, this scheme only requires one special rule, where the moment of interruption actually occurred.",
        "This reduces the number of special speech repair rules that need to be learned and saves more potential examples of fluent speech rules, and therefore potentially makes better use of limited data."
