        "This paper describes our experimentation with applying data mining methods to transcribed doctor-patient consultations.",
        "It is in essence a discovery project: we apply methods to a field and task that is not ordinarily associated with such approaches in order to ascertain whether this could make for a tractable learning task.",
        "The task involves the extraction of discourse features from doctor-patient consultations performed by international medical graduates (IMGs), and what is known as 'simulated patients' (Vu et al., 1994), respectively.",
        "The IMGs are enrolled in a bridging course in Melbourne as preparation for their Australian Medical Council (AMC) examination, the successful completion of which is one of the prerequisites to becoming a fully accredited practitioner in Australia.",
        "This partially replicates the AMC examination by studying in detail how IMGs perform two objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs).",
        "See Section 2 for full details of the examination environment and participants involved.",
        "The main questions raised when initiating this study were:",
        "• How objective is the testing?",
        "• What is the importance placed on language skills in OSCE environments?",
        "• What makes for a successful OSCE?",
        "In this research, we aim to build classifiers that make reasonable predictions of the data being tested, and possibly point us in the right direction with respect to the questions above.",
        "From the classifiers we build, we also hope to ascertain which of our features best predict a successful examination.",
        "We organise the paper as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we briefly describe the examination environment and process, the marking scheme, and the participants involved in the testing of the IMGs.",
        "We also outline some of the issues that have arisen with regard to the current methods of IMG testing.",
        "In Section 3, we present details of the data used.",
        "Section 4 describes the features we develop for the task and discusses the reasoning behind the selection of features from a discourse analysis perspective.",

      "text": [
        "With Western nations becoming increasingly reliant on medical professionals trained overseas, there is, in turn, a growing need to develop a reliable means of objectively assessing IMGs.",
        "The shortage of medical doctors is a worldwide phenomenon currently affecting many Western societies such as the UK, Canada, US and New Zealand, which compete for the best medical practitioners available around the world.",
        "Australia is not immune to this global phenomenon, and in the last two decades the shortage of local medical practitioners in Australia has worsened (Bir-rell et al., 2004).",
        "Challenges to the healthcare system in the country are particularly evident in the areas of providing medical care for a growing elderly population and of servicing rural areas, where locally trained doctors do not feel particularly attracted to practise medicine (Han et al., 2006).",
        "Currently 35% of the rural medical workforce and 20% of the total national medical workforce consist of IMGs (Flynn, 2006).",
        "These figures may increase even further in some regions (Spike, 2006), as preparation of fully educated and trained local medical graduates takes up to thirteen years to complete.",
        "There is considerable disparity among IMGs in their background training, clinical skills, understanding of the health system and communication skills (McGrath, 2004).",
        "In order to be registered to practice in Australia, IMGs must successfully complete the Australian Medical Council examinations and a period of supervised training.",
        "The medical knowledge of IMGs is assessed in two ways: by multiple choice examinations and by clinical examinations.",
        "This second form of examination consists of a series of simulated medical consultations in which a role-player takes the part of the patient, and the IMG's professional knowledge, lay-cultural knowledge, sociocultural assumptions, institutional norms, and values and personal experiences are all in full display during the unfolding of the medical event (Roberts et al., 2003).",
        "Whenever cultural factors are not shared with their patients, the interpretative schema and therefore the comprehension of speech are affected by this lack of commonality in the participants' inferences and contextual cues (Gumperz, 1999).",
        "Such effects are likely to cause miscommunication in medical visits and have a potential negative effect on patients' satisfaction in the consultation.",
        "Identification of the communication difficulties faced by IMGs can therefore inform modifications to the training provided to IMGs when they prepare for the Australian Medical Council examinations, as well as suggesting more nuanced and targeted procedures for assessing communicative skills within those examinations, all with the goal of working toward a better equipped medical workforce for the future.",
        "The use of automated analytic procedures to try to establish objective criteria for communicative success is an important step in this process.",
        "Assessing language knowledge and competence quantitatively is not a novel concept in second language learning assessment.",
        "However, the application of data mining methods to automatically assess language proficiency in a discourse setting is novel.",
        "Levow et al.",
        "(1999) propose an architecture to automatically assess language proficiency.",
        "In their paper, they propose an architecture that employs data mining methods, but do not build classifiers over their spoken data to test this proposal.",
        "A closely related line of research is on the automatic classification of discourse elements to assess the quality of a written genre (Burstein et al., 2001).",
        "Like this work, it focuses on extracting features from the discourse as a whole.",
        "But unlike this study, the authors extract high level features, such as rhetorical structure, of written discourse.",
        "The study we present in this paper is rather unique in its approach to language assessment.",
        "The data is taken from transcribed recordings of examinations from students enrolled in a bridging course at Box Hill Hospital in Melbourne, Australia.",
        "Each candidate was video-recorded enacting medical consultation scenarios with what is known as a standardised or simulated patient (SP).",
        "This method of testing is known as an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE), which is an emulation of a doctor-patient consultation, much like a role-play setting.",
        "In this study, the role of the patient (SP) is enacted by a qualified doctor who follows a script, and has well-defined ailment(s) and accompanying concerns.",
        "Even though the SP assumes the same ailment and disposition with all the candidates, the interaction between the candidate and the SP is un-cued and free-form.",
        "They simply present the information in a standardised manner across all candidates and perform the role of the patient as felicitously as possible.",
        "For this set of examinations there are 2 types of OSCE stations referred to as STD (sexually transmitted disease - genital herpes) and BC (bowel cancer).",
        "The SP for the STD station is played by a female doctor.",
        "The patient she plays has genital herpes and is concerned about how this will affect her chances of falling pregnant, and how this condition may also affect her baby.",
        "The SP for the BC station is played by an older male.",
        "A tumour is discovered in his bowel lining and he is reluctant to undergo any treatment because one of his good friends suffered a similar condition and his quality of life was severely diminished.",
        "Even though the consultation is free to be negotiated between doctor (candidate) and patient (simulated patient), each of the OSCEs cannot exceed 8 minutes, and is terminated by the examiner if it does so.",
        "The recordings are transcribed in ELAN, a multimedia annotation tool developed at the Max Planck Institute, to help encode low-level linguistic features such as overlapping and timing information.",
        "The information and features extracted from the discourse are largely based on a 'turn'.",
        "Here we consider a turn as being normally dominated by one speaker.",
        "It can be made up of multiple intonation units.",
        "When there is backchannelling, overlapping, or any interruption by the other participant, then the turn is encoded as ending at the end of the interrupted intonation unit.",
        "Otherwise, transition pauses commonly signal turn changes, unless latching occurs.",
        "Given that the OSCE setting aims to emulate as close as possible a real medical consultation, this interaction, like all uncued spoken dialogues, also has evidence of complicated turn-taking negotiations, disfluent and unintelligible speech, interrupted speech, challenges for the floor, and the like, all of which must be encoded and noted in ELAN.",
        "Transcribing such data is not a trivial matter.",
        "In addition, transcribing the data in order to extract these features is also a demanding task in itself, which makes creating data for such tasks an involved process.",
        "Disftuencies and repairs are encoded in a limited way, only by way of marking up truncated or unfinished words.",
        "We also do not take a fine-grained approach in encoding delaying strategies (Clark et al., 2002), that is we do not differentiate whether the uh or ah encoded represents lexical search, a wish to hold the floor, a wish to give up the floor or buying time to construct what to say next.",
        "In an OSCE setting, candidates are given an overall pass or fail rating for each station by an OSCE examiner observing the interaction.",
        "This overall evaluation can be based on a number of performance criteria which tests the candidates medical, clinical and communication skills (Grand'Maison et al., 1992).",
        "The OSCE marking scheme used for this study consists of 5 assessable categories, as follows:",
        "Approach: the ability of the candidate to communicate with the patient;",
        "History: the ability of the candidate to collect medical history;",
        "Interpretation: how well does the candidate interpret his or her investigation in order to formulate an appropriate diagnosis;",
        "Management: how well does the candidate formulate a management plan for the diagnosis;",
        "Counselling: is the candidate able to give appropriate counselling to the patient.",
        "The first category tests language knowledge and competency both at the lexical and discourse level, while the remaining four categories test medical knowledge and clinical competency."

        "We extracted a total of 38 features from the transcribed data.",
        "Some of these features are based on what is marked up according to the transcription scheme, while others are based on timing information or lexical information as encoded in ELAN.",
        "These include features such as signals for delaying speaking or hesitation (Clark et al., 2002), features of conversational dominance (Itakura, 2000), the manner in which turn-taking is negotiated (Sacks et al., 1974), temporal features such as pausing (ten Bosch et al., 2005), as well as our own features, which include 'lexical introduction', and 'lexical repeat'.",
        "In encoding features of conversational dominance, we focus on participatory dominance (Itakura, 2000), which looks at which speaker contributes most to the dialogue in terms of content.",
        "Lexical introduction refers to a non-stop word that is introduced by the doctor (IMG) or the patient (SP), while lexical repeat encodes how many times a word introduced by the other interlocutor is repeated by the speaker.",
        "Almost all of the features developed are continuous, based on timing information or word counts.",
        "The only binary feature used encodes whether the doctor initiates the consultation or not.",
        "As mentioned in the previous section, the features developed were largely based on turns.",
        "This is to capture, along with other features such as overlapping and pauses, the interactional aspect of the communication.",
        "For example, conversational cooperation and speaker reassurance can be captured with these features.",
        "Another aspect to the development of these features, particularly for the lexical-based features, is whether the IMG has a suitable vocabularly and if they employ it appropriately in the interaction.",
        "We arrive at 11 feature sets from which we build our classifiers, as described in Table 1.",
        "Not all features are exclusive to any one feature set, that is, it is possible for a single feature to belong to a number of feature sets.",
        "The sets were designed to isolate possible characteristics of not only the discourse as a whole, but how the participants negotiated their interaction.",
        "These features sets were developed from observing each of the consultations with the expectation that these were salient and determining features of a successful examination."

        "The Mann-Whitney tests suggest that an SP's approach and their apparent satisfaction during the clinical encounter can affect the judgement of the examiner.",
        "Additional inspection of the data revealed that the assessment criteria which focused on language and communication skills correlated highly with an overall pass grade, moreso than the other criteria.",
        "This seems to suggest that more emphasis should be placed on language skills and communication style in the assessment of the candidates.",
        "Assessing language competency is no trivial matter, and capturing the linguistic features of dialogues in an attempt to define competence, as we have done here, is a demanding task in itself.",
        "Although many of our features were focused on turn-taking, speaker response and interaction, we did not develop features that encompass the information structure of the communicative event.",
        "It is assumed that miscommunication between non-native and native speakers of a language is due to a lack of language knowledge pertaining to syntax, morphology or lexical semantics.",
        "However many of these communication difficulties arise not because of this lack of grammatical knowledge, but through a difference in discourse styles or information structure as governed by different cultures (Wiberg, 2003; Li, 1999).",
        "Given that the word-based feature sets were the most successful predictors of an OSCE outcome, future work of this kind could make use of medical-based lexicons to gauge whether technical or non-technical word usage in such environments is judged favourably.",
        "In addition, further work should be done to test the hypothesis that information structure or rhetorical structure does impact on overall perception of a successful communication, such as a variation on the methods employed by Burstein etal.",
        "(2001).",
        "One obvious improvement to this study would be to reduce the expense in producing the annotated data.",
        "Future work could also be done in automatically extracting features from non-transcribed data, such as timing information based on pause length and the turn length of each speaker."
