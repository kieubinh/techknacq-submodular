        "We have presented a new algorithm based on weighted set cover for finding subtopics in a corpus of selected blog postings.",
        "The algorithm performs very well in practice compared to the baseline standard, which outputs the top keyphrases according to the Kullback-Leibler divergence method.",
        "While the baseline standard outputs keyphrases which are redundant, in the sense, they cover the same documents, the graph-based method outputs keyphrases which have very little intersection.",
        "We provide a new method of ranking keyphrases that can help users find different facets of an event.",
        "The identification of facets has many applications to natural language processing.",
        "Once facets have been identified in a collection, documents can be clustered based on these facets.",
        "These clusters can be used to generate document summaries or for visualization of the event space.",
        "The keyphrases themselves provide a succinct summary of the different subtopics.",
        "In future work, we intend to investigate summarization of documents based on subtopic clustering using this method."
