        "Event detection is a core Natural Language Processing (NLP) task that focuses on the automatic identification and classification of various event types in text.",
        "This task has applications in automatic Text Summararisation and Question Answering (QA).",
        "For example, event recognition is a core task in QA since the majority of web user questions have been found to relate to events and situations in the world (Sauri et al., 2005).",
        "For complex questions such as How many people were killed in Baghdad in March?, QA systems often rely on event detection systems to identify all relevant events in a set of documents before formulating an answer.",
        "More recently, much research in summarisation has focused on the use of phrasal concepts such as events to represent sentences in extractive summarisation systems.",
        "Specifically, (Filatova and Hatzivassiloglou, 2004) use event-based features to represent sentences and shows that this approach improves the quality of the final summaries when compared with a baseline bag-of-words approach.",
        "In this paper, we investigate the use of statistical methods for identifying the sentences in a document that describe one or more instances of a specified event type.",
        "We treat this task as a text classification problem where each sentence in a given document is either classified as containing an instance of the target event or not.",
        "We view this task as a filtering step in a larger pipeline NLP architecture (e.g. a QA system) which helps speed up subsequent processing by removing irrelevant, non-event sentences.",
        "Two event detection approaches are explored in this paper.",
        "More specifically, we train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) using a variety of term, lexical and additional event based features to encode each train/test instance.",
        "We also adopt a probabilistic language modeling approach that captures how text within sentences that describe event instances is likely to be generated.",
        "We estimate a series of models using three well-known smoothing approaches, including LaPlace, lelinek-Mercer and Absolute Discounting Smoothing.",
        "Their overall behavior on classification performance is examined.",
        "One advantage of language modeling for text classification is that instead of explicitly pre-computing features and selecting a subset based on arbitrary decisions (as is often the case with standard classification learning approaches such as an SVM), the language modeling approach simply considers all terms occurring in the text as candidate features, and implicitly considers the contribution of every feature in the final model.",
        "Thus, language modeling approaches avoids a potentially error-prone feature selection process.",
        "Event classification at a sentence level is a challenging task.",
        "For example, if the target event is \"Die\", we want our system to extract sentences like \"5 people were killed in the explosion.\"",
        "and \"A young boy and his mother were found dead on Wednesday evening.\".",
        "However, it also needs to detect complex cases like: \"An ambulance rushed the soldier to hospital, but efforts to save him failed.\"",
        "and reject instances like \"Fragmentation mines have a killing range of 100 feet.\".",
        "It seems intuitive that a naive system that selects only sentences that contain terms with senses connected with death like \"kill\", \"die\" or \"execute\" as positive instances would catch many positive cases.",
        "However, there are instances where this approach would fail.",
        "In this work we evaluate the effectiveness of such a shallow NLP approach, by developing a manual rule based system that finds sentences connected to a target event type using a hand crafted list of terms created with senses found in WordNet.",
        "We use two datasets in our experiments.",
        "The first is the ACE 2005 Multilingual Training Corpus (Walker et al., 2006) that was annotated for 33 different event types.",
        "However, within the ACE data the number of instances referring to each event type is somewhat limited.",
        "For this reason, we select the six types with the highest frequency in the data.",
        "These include \"Die\", \"Attack\", \"Transport\", \"Meet\", \"Injure\" and \"Charge-indict\" types.",
        "The second corpus is a collection of articles from the Iraq Body Count (IBC) database annotated for the \"Die\" event.",
        "This dataset arose from a larger humanitarian project that focuses on the collection of fatalities statistics from unstructured news data.",
        "We use this additional corpus to augment the amount of data used for training and testing the \"Die\" event type, and to investigate the use of extra training data on overall classification performance.",
        "!http://www.iraqbodycount.org/",
        "Overall, our results demonstrate that the trained SVM proves to be more effective than the LM based approach for this task across all event types.",
        "We also show that our baseline system, a hand crafted rule-based system, performs surprisingly well.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organised as follows.",
        "Section 2 covers related work.",
        "We continue with details of the datasets used in the experiments in Section 3.",
        "Section 4 describes our event classification approaches while Section 5 presents their results.",
        "We conclude with a discussion of experimental observations and opportunities for future work in Section 6."

        "Event detection, in the context of news stories, has been an active area of research for the best part of ten years.",
        "For example, the NIST sponsored Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) project, which began in 1998 investigated the development of technologies that could detect novel events in segmented or unsegmented news streams, and track the progression of these event over time (Allan et al., 1998).",
        "Although this project ended in 2004, event detection is still investigated by more recently established projects such as the Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) program, and in domains outside of news text such as Biomedical Text Processing (Murff et al., 2003).",
        "The aim of the TDT First Story Detection (FSD) or New Event Detection (NED) task was to flag documents that discuss breaking news stories as they arrive on a news stream.",
        "Dragon Systems adopted a LM approach to this task (Allan et al., 1998; Yamron et al., 2002) building discriminator topic models from the collection and representing documents using unigram term frequencies.",
        "Then they used a single-pass clustering algorithm to determine the documents that describe new events.",
        "The overall goal of the TDT Event Tracking task was to track the development of specific events over time.",
        "However, these TDT tasks were somewhat restrictive in the sense that detection is carried out at document level.",
        "Our work differs from TDT research since event detection is performed at a sentence level where the amount of data to build discriminate models for recognising event instances is far more limited.",
        "The goal of the ACE Event Detection and Recognition task is to identify all event instances (as well as the attributes and participants of each",
        "Table 2: IBC Corpus Statistics instance) of a pre-specified set of event types.",
        "An ACE event is defined as a specific occurence involving zero or more ACE entities, values and time expressions.",
        "Two spans of text are used to identify each event: the event trigger and the event mention.",
        "An event trigger or anchor is the word that most clearly expresses its occurrence.",
        "In many cases, this will be the main verb in the event mention.",
        "It can also appear as a noun (\"The meeting lasted 5 hours.\")",
        "or an adjective (\"the dead men ...\").",
        "The event mention is the sentence that describes the event.",
        "Even though the task of identifying event mentions is not directly evaluated in ACE, systems still need to identify them so that the various attributes and participants within the mention can be extracted.",
        "The algorithms evaluated in this paper can also be applied to the detection of event mentions that contain the ACE events.",
        "Overall five sites participated in this task in 2005.",
        "The most similar work to that describe in this paper is detailed in (Ahn, 2006), who treats the task of finding all event triggers (used to identify each event) as a word classification task where the task is to classify every term in a document with a label defined by 34 classes.",

        "and \"If the Americans have killed them, then why dont they show the tape\".",
        "In fact, it turns out that over 50% of the errors produced by the SVM and manual trigger-based approach when the target event is \"Die\" are classified correctly by the language models.",
        "Although this is encouraging, the overall error rate of the language modeling approach is too high to rely on it alone.",
        "However, this evidence suggests that it may prove useful in the future to somehow combine the predictions of all three approaches in a way that improves overall classification performance.",

        "96%, 95%, 86% and 60% \"off-event\" Fl scores respectively across all event types.",
        "On the other hand, Figure 2 demonstrates that the performance of each approach for the \"on-event\" class varies considerably across the event types.",
        "For instance, the trigger-based classification baseline outperforms all other approaches achieving over 60% Fl score for the \"Meet\", \"Die\" and \"Charge-Indict\" types.",
        "However for events like \"Attack\" and \"Transport\" this baselines Fl score drops to approx.",
        "20% thus achieving scores that are only marginally above the random baseline.",
        "Interestingly, we notice that although it performs better for events like \"Meet\" and \"Charge-Indict\", the number of trigger terms used to detect these types is much smaller than the number used for the \"Attack\" and \"Transport\" types (see Table 3).",
        "This indicates that event types where this simple baseline performs well are those where the vocabulary used to describe them is small.",
        "Event types where it achieves poor results are broader types like \"Transport\" and \"Attack\" that cover a larger spectrum of event instances from heterogeneous contexts and situations.",
        "However, we see from Figure 2 that the SVM performs well on such event types and as a result outperforms the trigger-based selection process by approximately a factor of 4 for the \"Attack\" event and a factor of 2 for the \"Transport\" event.",
        "When we compare both datasets we find that the ACE data is made up of newswire articles, Broadcast news, broadcast conversational texts, weblogs, usenet newsgroup texts and conversational telephone speech that has been transcribed, whereas the IBC corpus consists mainly of newswire articles reporting fatalities during the Iraqi War.",
        "As a result, event instances in the ACE data describing the \"Die\" event type are likely to report fatalities not only from Iraq but also from more diverse contexts and situations.",
        "To investigate how performance differs for the \"Die\" event type across these datasets, we compare the IBC results in Table 4 with the ACE results in Figure 2.",
        "We find that the Fl scores of the \"off-event\" class are not affected much.",
        "However, the Fl scores for the \"on-event\" class for the SVM and trigger-based baseline are reduced by margins of approx.",
        "12% and 5% respectively.",
        "We also notice that the performance of the unigram language models are reduced significantly by a factor of 2 indicating that they struggle to approximate accurate term probabilities when the vocabulary is more diverse and the amount of training data is limited.",

        "Sentence level event classification is an important first step for many NLP applications such as QA and summarisation systems.",
        "For each event type used in our experiments we treated this as a binary classification task and compared a variety of approaches for identifying sentences that described instances of that type.",
        "The results showed that the trained SVM was more effective than the language modeling approaches across all event types.",
        "Another interesting contribution of this paper is that the trigger-based classification baseline performed better than expected.",
        "Specifically, for three of the six event types it outperformed the trained SVM.",
        "This suggests that although there are cases where such terms appear in sentences that do not describe instances of a given type (for instance, \"The boy was nearly killed\"), these cases are in the minority.",
        "However, the success of this baseline is somewhat dependent on the nature of the event in question.",
        "For broader events like \"Transport\" and \"Attack\" where the trigger terms can be harder to predict, it performs quiet poorly.",
        "Therefore, as part of future work, we hope to investigate ways of automating the creation of these term lists for a specified event type as this proved to be an effective approach to this task.",
