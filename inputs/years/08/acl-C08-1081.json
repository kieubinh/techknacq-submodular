        "Dependency-based syntactic parsing has become increasingly popular in computational linguistics in recent years.",
        "One of the reasons for the growing interest is apparently the belief that dependency-based representations should be more suitable for languages that exhibit free or flexible word order and where most of the clues to syntactic structure are found in lexical and morphological features, rather than in syntactic categories and word order configurations.",
        "Some support for this view can be found in the results from the CoNLL shared tasks on dependency parsing in 2006 and 2007, where a variety of data-driven methods for dependency parsing have been applied with encouraging results to languages of great typological diversity (Buch-holz and Marsi, 2006; Nivre et al., 2007a).",
        "However, there are still important differences in parsing accuracy for different language types.",
        "For example, Nivre et al. (2007a) observe that the languages included in the 2007 CoNLL shared task can be divided into three distinct groups with respect to top accuracy scores, with relatively low accuracy for richly inflected languages like Arabic and Basque, medium accuracy for agglutinating languages like Hungarian and Turkish, and high accuracy for more configurational languages like English and Chinese.",
        "A complicating factor in this kind of comparison is the fact that the syntactic annotation in treebanks varies across languages, in such a way that it is very difficult to tease apart the impact on parsing accuracy of linguistic structure, on the one hand, and linguistic annotation, on the other.",
        "It is also worth noting that the majority of the data sets used in the CoNLL shared tasks are not derived from treebanks with genuine dependency annotation, but have been obtained through conversion from other kinds of annotation.",
        "And the data sets that do come with original dependency annotation are generally fairly small, with less than 100,000 words available for training, the notable exception of course being the Prague Dependency Treebank of Czech (Hajic et al., 2001), which is one of the largest and most widely used treebanks in the field.",
        "This paper contributes to the growing literature on dependency parsing for typologically diverse languages by presenting the first results on parsing the Russian treebank SYNTAGRUS (Boguslavsky et al., 2000; Boguslavsky et al., 2002).",
        "There are several factors that make this treebank an interesting resource in this context.",
        "First of all, it contains a genuine dependency annotation, theoretically grounded in the long tradition of dependency grammar for Slavic languages, represented by the work of Tesniere (1959) and Mel'cuk (1988), among others.",
        "Secondly, with close to 500,000 tokens, the treebank is larger than most other available dependency treebanks and provides a good basis for experimental investigations using data-driven methods.",
        "Thirdly, the Russian language, which has not been included in previous experimental evaluations such as the CoNLL shared tasks, is a richly inflected language with free word order and thus representative of the class of languages that tend to pose problems for the currently available parsing models.",
        "Taken together, these factors imply that experiments using the SynTa-gRus treebank may be able to shed further light on the complex interplay between language type, annotation scheme, and training set size, as determinants of parsing accuracy for data-driven dependency parsers.",
        "The experimental parsing results presented in this paper have been obtained using MaltParser, a freely available system for data-driven dependency parsing with state-of-the-art accuracy for most languages in previous evaluations (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006; Nivre et al., 2007a; Nivre et al., 2007b).",
        "Besides establishing a first benchmark for the SynTagRus treebank, we analyze the influence of different kinds of features on parsing accuracy, showing conclusively that both lexical and morphological features are crucial for obtaining good parsing accuracy.",
        "All results are based on input with gold standard annotations, which means that the results can be seen to establish an upper bound on what can be achieved when parsing raw text.",
        "However, this also means that results are comparable to those from the CoNLL shared tasks, which have been obtained under the same conditions.",
        "The rest of the paper is structured as follows.",
        "Section 2 introduces the SynTagRus treebank, section 3 describes the MaltParser system used in the experiments, and section 4 presents experimental results and analysis.",
        "Section 5 contains conclusions and future work."

        "Summing up, the main result of the experimental evaluation is that both morphological and lexical features are crucial for attaining high accuracy when training and evaluating on the representations found in the SynTagRus treebank of Russian.",
        "With regard to morphological features this is in line with a number of recent studies showing the importance of morphology for parsing languages with less rigid word order, including work on Spanish (Cowan and Collins, 2005), Hebrew (Tsarfaty, 2006; Tsarfaty and Sima'an, 2007), Turkish (Eryigit et al., 2006), and Swedish (0vrelid and Nivre, 2007).",
        "With regard to lexical features, the situation is more complex in that there are a number of studies questioning the usefulness of lexical features in statistical parsing and arguing that equivalent or better results can be achieved with unlexical-ized models provided that linguistic categories can be split flexibly into more fine-grained categories, either using hand-crafted splits, as in the seminal work of Klein and Manning (2003), or using hidden variables and unsupervised learning, as in the more recent work by Petrov et al.",
        "(2006), among others.",
        "There are even studies showing that lexi-calization can be harmful when parsing richly inflected languages like German (Dubey and Keller, 2003) and Turkish (Eryigit and Oflazer, 2006).",
        "However, it is worth noting that most of these results have been obtained either for models of constituency-based parsing or for models of dependency parsing suffering from sparse data.",
        "In the experiments presented here, we have used a transition-based model for dependency parsing that has much fewer parameters than state-of-the-art probabilistic models for constituency parsing.",
        "Moreover, we have been able to use a relatively large training set, thereby minimizing the effect of sparseness for lexical features.",
        "We therefore conjecture that the beneficial effect of lexical features on parsing accuracy will generalize to other richly inflected languages when similar conditions hold.",
        "As far as we know, these are the first results for a large-scale data-driven parser for Russian.",
        "There do exist several rule-based parsers for Russian, such as the ETAP-3 parser (Apresian et al., 2003) and a Link Grammar parser, as well as a prototype of a hybrid system based on the ETAP-3 parser enriched with statistics extracted from SynTagRus (Boguslavsky et al., 2003; Chardin, 2004), but differences in both input format and output representations make it difficult to compare the performance directly."
