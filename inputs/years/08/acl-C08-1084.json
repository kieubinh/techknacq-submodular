        "The last years have seen a large body of work on modelling the semantic properties of individual words, both in the form of hand-built resources like WordNet and data-driven methods like semantic space models.",
        "It is still much less clear how the combined meaning of phrases can be described.",
        "Semantic roles describe an important aspect of phrasal meaning by characterising the relationship between predicates and their arguments on a semantic level (e.g., agent, patient).",
        "They generalise over surface categories (such as subject, object) and variations (such as diathesis alternations).",
        "Two frameworks for semantic roles have found wide use in the community, PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) and FrameNet (Fillmore et al., 2003).",
        "Their corpora are used to train supervised models for semantic role labelling (SRL) of new text (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Carreras and Marquez, 2005).",
        "The resulting analysis can benefit a number of applications, such as Information Extraction (Moschitti et al., 2003) or Question Answering (Frank et al., 2007).",
        "A commonly encountered criticism of semantic roles, and arguably a major obstacle to their adoption in NLP, is their limited coverage.",
        "Since manual semantic role tagging is costly, it is hardly conceivable that gold standard annotation will ultimately be available for every predicate of English.",
        "In addition, the lexically specific nature of the mapping between surface syntax and semantic roles makes it difficult to generalise from seen predicates to unseen predicates for which no training data is available.",
        "Techniques for extending the coverage of SRL therefore address an important need.",
        "Unfortunately, pioneering work in unsupervised SRL (Swier and Stevenson, 2004; Grenager and Manning, 2006) currently either relies on a small number of semantic roles, or cannot identify equivalent roles across predicates.",
        "A promising alternative direction is automatic data expansion, i.e., leveraging existing annotations to classify unseen, but similar, predicates.",
        "Lhe feasibility of this approach was demonstrated by Gordon and Swanson (2007) for syntactically similar verbs.",
        "However, their approach requires at least one annotated instance of each new predicate, limiting its practicability.",
        "In this paper, we present a pilot study on the application of automatic data expansion to event nominalisations of verbs, such as agreement for agree or destruction for destroy.",
        "While event nominalisations often afford the same semantic roles as verbs, and often replace them in written language (Gurevich et al., 2006), they have played a largely marginal role in annotation.",
        "PropBank has only annotated verbs.",
        "FrameNet annotates nouns, but covers far fewer nouns than verbs.",
        "The same situation holds in other languages (Erk et al., 2003).",
        "Our fundamental intuition is that it is possible to increase the annotation coverage of event nominal-isations by data expansion from verbal instances, since the verbal and nominal predicates share a large part of the underlying argument structure.",
        "We assume that annotation is available for verbal instances.",
        "Then, for a given instance of a nominal-isation and its arguments, the aim is to assign semantic role labels to these arguments.",

        "Nominalisations (or deverbal nouns) are commonly defined as nouns morphologically derived from verbs, usually by suffixation (Quirk et al., 1985).",
        "They have been classified into at least three categories in the linguistic literature, event, result, and agent/patient nominalisations (Grimshaw, 1990).",
        "Event and result nominalisations account for the bulk of deverbal nouns.",
        "The first class refers to an event/activity/process, with the nominal expressing this action (e.g. killing, destruction).",
        "Nouns in the second class describe the result or goal of an action (e.g. agreement).",
        "Many nominals have both an event and a result reading (e.g., selection can mean the process of selecting or the selected object).",
        "Choosing a single reading for an instance is often difficult; see Nunes (1993); Grimshaw (1990).",
        "A smaller class is agent/patient nominalisations.",
        "Agent nominals are usually identified by suffixes such as -er, -or, ant (e.g. speaker, applicant), while patient nominalisations end with -ee, -ed (e.g. employee).",
        "While these nominalisations can be analysed as events {the baker's bread implies that baking has taken place), they more naturally refer to participants.",
        "In consequence, agent/patient nominals tend to realise fewer arguments - the average in FrameNet is 1.46 arguments, compared to 1.74 for events/results.",
        "As our goal is nominal SRL, we concentrate on the event/results class.",
        "SRL for nominalisations.",
        "Compared to the wealth of studies on verbal SRL (e.g., Gildea and Juraf-sky (2002); Fleischman and Hovy (2003)), there is relatively little work that specifically addresses nominal SRL.",
        "Nouns are generally treated like verbs: the task is split into two classification steps, argument recognition (telling arguments from non-arguments) and argument labelling (labelling recognised arguments with a role).",
        "Nominal SRL also typically draws on feature sets that are similar to those for verbs, i.e., comprising mainly syntactic and lexical-semantic information (Liu and Ng, 2007; Jiang and Ng, 2006).",

        "We modelled the training and test set sizes and the predicates' parts of speech as fixed effects, and frames and CV folds as random factors.",
        "For both argument recognition and labelling, the amount of training data turned out to be a significant factor, i.e., more data leads to higher results.",
        "While the part of speech was not systematically linked to performance for argument recognition, it was a highly significant predictor of accuracy in the labelling step: Even when training set size was taken into account, verbal arguments were still significantly easier to label (z=4.5, p<0.001).",

        "They do not suffer from the coverage problem, since they assign a role to each filler.",
        "Yet, the accuracy over assigned roles is lower than for the syntactic approach (52% for dist-fun).",
        "We conclude that in the limited cases where a pure syntactic mapping is applicable, it is far more reliable than methods which are mainly based on lexical-semantic information.",
        "The major limitation of the latter is that lexical-semantics tend to fail when roles are semantically very similar.",
        "For example, for the noun announcement, the syntactic-level distributional model wrongly builds the mapping (Addressee, PP-by) instead of (Speaker, PP-by), because the two roles are very similar semantically (the computed similarities of the PP-by arguments to addressee and speaker in the semantic space are 0.94 and 0.92, respectively).",
        "The syntactic-level distributional model outperforms the lexical-level, suggesting that generalising the mapping at the argument level offers more stable statistical evidence to find the correct role, i.e. a set of noun arguments better defines the semantics of the mapping than a single argument.",
        "This is mostly the case when the context vector of the argument is not a good representation because the semantic head is ambiguous, infrequent or atypical.",

        "The lexical-level model, however, builds the incorrect mapping (Protagonist, convention).",
        "This happens because convention is ambiguous, and one of its senses (\"a large formal assembly\") is compatible with the Protagonist role, and happens to have a large influence on the position of the vector for convention.",

        "We have presented a data expansion approach to SRL for event nominalisations.",
        "Instead of relying on manually annotated nominal training data, we harness annotated data for verbs to bootstrap a semantic role labeller for nouns.",
        "For argument recognition, we use a simple rule-based approach.",
        "For argument labelling, we profit from the fact that the argument structures of event nominalisations and the corresponding verbs are typically similar.",
        "This allows us to learn a mapping between verbal roles and nominal arguments, using syntactic features, lexical-semantic similarity, or both.",
        "We found that our rule-based approach for argument recognition works fairly well.",
        "For argument labelling, our approach does not yet attain the performance of supervised models, but has the crucial advantage of not requiring any labelled data for nominal predicates.",
        "We achieved the highest accuracy with a hybrid syntactic-semantic model, which indicates that both types of information need to be combined for optimal results.",
        "A purely syntactic approach results in a high precision, but low coverage because frequent grammatical functions in particular cannot be trivially mapped.",
        "Backing off to semantic similarity provides additional coverage.",
        "However, semantic similarity has to be considered on the level of complete functions rather than individual instances to promote \"uniformity\" in the mappings.",
        "In this paper, we have only considered nominal SRL by data expansion, i.e. we only applied our approach to those nominalisations for which we have annotated data for the corresponding verbs.",
        "However, even if no data is available for the corresponding verb, it might still be possible to bootstrap from other verbs in the same frame (assuming that the frame is known for the nominalisation) and we plan to pursue this idea in furture research.",
        "We also intend to investigate whether a joint optimisation of",
        "the mapping constrained by additional syntactic information such as subcategorisation frames leads to better results.",
        "Finally, we will verify that our methods, which we have evaluated on English FrameNet data, carry over to other corpora and languages.",
