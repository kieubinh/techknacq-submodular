        "It is quite common for researchers to have to quickly move into a new area of research.",
        "For instance, someone trained in text generation may want to learn about parsing and someone who knows summarization well, may need to learn about question answering.",
        "In our work, we try to make this transition as painless as possible by automatically generating summaries of an entire research topic.",
        "This enables a researcher to find the chronological order and the progress in that particular field of study.",
        "An ideal such system will receive a topic of research, as the user query, and will return a summary of related work on that topic.",
        "In this paper, we take the first step toward building such a system.",
        "Studies have shown that different citations to the same article often focus on different aspects of that article, while none alone may cover a full description of its entire contributions.",
        "Hence, the set of citation summaries, can be a good resource to understand the main contributions of a paper and how that paper affects others.",
        "The citation summary of an article (A), as defined in (Elkiss et al., 2008), is a the set of citing sentences pointing to that article.",
        "Thus, this source contains information about A from others' point of view.",

        "If the parse has to be projective, Eisner's bottom-up-span algorithm (Eisner, 1996) can be used for the search.",
        "The problem of summarizing a whole scientific topic, in its simpler form, may reduce to summarizing one particular article.",
        "A citation summary can be a good resource to make a summary of a target paper.",
        "Then using each paper's summary and some knowledge of the citation network, we'll be able to generate a summary of an entire topic.",
        "Analyzing citation networks is an important component of this goal, and has been widely studied before (Newman, 2001).",
        "Our main contribution in this paper is to use citation summaries and network analysis techniques to produce a summary of a single scientific article as a framework for future research on topic summarization.",

        "(Lin and Demner-Fushman, 2006) use stemmed unigram similarity of responses with nugget descriptions to produce the evaluation results, whereas (Marton and Radul, 2006) uses both human judgments and human descriptions to evaluate a response.",
        "An ideal summary in our model is one that covers more facts and more important facts.",
        "Our definition for the properties of a \"good\" summary of a paper is one that is relatively short and consists of the main contributions of that paper.",
        "From this viewpoint, there are two criteria for our evaluation metric.",
        "First, summaries that contain more important facts are preferred over summaries that cover fewer relevant facts.",
        "Second, facts should not be equally weighted in this model, as some of them may show more important contributions of a paper, while others may not.",
        "To evaluate our system, we use the pyramid evaluation method (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004) at sentence level.",
        "Each fact in the citation summary of a paper is a summarization content unit (SCU) (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004), and the fact distribution matrix, created by annotation, provides the information about the importance of each fact in the citation summary.",
        "The score given by the pyramid method for a summary is a ratio of the sum of the weights of its facts to the sum of the weights of an optimal summary.",
        "This score ranges from 0 to 1, and high scores show the summary content contain more heavily weighted facts.",
        "We believe that if a fact appears in more sentences of the citation summary than another fact, it is more important, and thus should be assigned a higher weight.",
        "To weight the facts we build a pyramid, and each fact falls in a tier.",
        "Each tier shows the number of sentences a fact appears in.",

        "However, since most previous studies instead use the mean attachment score per word (Eisner, 1996; Collins et al., 1999), we will give this measure as well.",

        "lexicalized phrase-structure parsers, such as those presented by Collins et al. (1999) and Zeman (2004) that use expensive 0(n5) parsing al gorithms.",

        "a standard measure used in studies of dependency parsing (Eisner, 1996; Collins et al., 1999).",
        "In an attempt to extend a constituency-based pars ing model to train on dependency trees,",
        "Collins transforms the PDT dependency trees into con stituency trees (Collins et al., 1999).",
        "More specifi- cally for PDT, Collins et al. (1999) relabel coordi- nated phrases after converting dependency struc- tures to phrase structures, and Zeman (2004) uses a kind of pattern matching, based on frequencies of the parts-of-speech of conjuncts and conjunc- tions.",
        "In par ticular, we used the method of Collins et al. (1999) to simplify part-of-speech tags since the rich tags used by Czech would have led to a large but rarely seen set of POS features.",
        "Based on the described evaluation method we conducted a number of experiments to evaluate different summaries of a given length.",
        "In particular, we use a gold standard and a random summary to determine how good a system summary is.",
        "The gold standard is a summary of a given length that covers as many highly weighted facts as possible.",
        "To make a gold summary we start picking sentences that cover new and highly weighted facts, until the summary length limit is reached.",
        "On the other hand, in the random summary sentences are extracted from the citation summary in a random manner.",
        "We expect a good system summary to be closer to the gold than it is to the random one.",
        "Table 7 shows the value of pyramid score P, for the experiments on the set of 25 papers.",

        "This table suggests that C-lexrank has a higher average score, P, for the set of evaluated articles comparing C-RR and Lexrank.",
        "As mentioned earlier in section 4.1.1, once the citation summary network is clustered in the C-RR method, the sentences from each cluster are chosen in a round robin fashion, which will not guarantee that a fact-bearing sentence is chosen.",
        "This is because all sentences, whether they cover any facts or not, are assigned to some cluster anyway and such sentences might appear as the first sentence in a cluster.",
        "This will sometimes result in a low P score, for which P05 -1012 is a good example."

        "In this work we use the citation summaries to understand the main contributions of articles.",

        "As a method of summarizing a scientific paper, we propose a clustering approach where communities in the citation summary's lexical network are formed and sentences are extracted from separate clusters.",
        "Our experiments show how our clustering method outperforms one of the current state-of-art multi-document summarizing algorithms, Lexrank, on this particular problem.",
        "A future improvement will be to use a reordering approach like Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998) to re-rank clustered documents within each cluster in order to reduce the redundancy in a final summary.",
        "Another possible approach is to assume the set of sentences in the citation summary as sentences talking about the same event, yet generated in different sources.",
        "Then one can apply the method inspired by (Barzilay et al., 1999) to identify common phrases across sentences and use language generation to form a more coherent summary.",
        "The ultimate goal, however, is to produce a topic summarizer system in which the query is a scientific topic and the output is a summary of all previous works in that topic, preferably sorted to preserve chronology and topicality.",
