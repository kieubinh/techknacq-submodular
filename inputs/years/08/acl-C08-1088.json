        "Information extraction is one of the key tasks in natural language processing.",
        "It attempts to identify relevant information from a large amount of natural language text documents.",
        "Of three subtasks defined by the ACE program, this paper focuses exclusively on Relation Detection and Characterization (RDC) task, which detects and classifies semantic relationships between predefined types of entities in the ACE corpus.",
        "For example, the sentence \"Microsoft Corp. is based in Redmond, WA\" conveys the relation \"GPE-AFF.Based\" between \"Microsoft Corp.\" [ORG] and \"Redmond\" [GPE].",
        "Due to limited accuracy in state-of-the-art syntactic and semantic parsing, reliably extracting semantic relationships between named entities in natural language documents is still a difficult, unresolved problem.",
        "In the literature, feature-based methods have dominated the research in semantic relation extraction.",
        "Featured-based methods achieve promising performance and competitive efficiency by transforming a relation example into a set of syntactic and semantic features, such as lexical knowledge, entity-related information, syntactic parse trees and deep semantic information.",
        "However, detailed research (Zhou et al., 2005) shows that it's difficult to extract new effective features to further improve the extraction accuracy.",
        "Therefore, researchers turn to kernel-based methods, which avoids the burden of feature engineering through computing the similarity of two discrete objects (e.g. parse trees) directly.",
        "From prior work (Zelenko et al., 2003; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004; Bunescu and Mooney, 2005) to current research (Zhang et al., 2006; Zhou et al., 2007), kernel methods have been showing more and more potential in relation extraction.",
        "The key problem for kernel methods on relation extraction is how to represent and capture the structured syntactic information inherent in relation instances.",
        "While kernel methods using the dependency tree (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004) and the shortest dependency path (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005) suffer from low recall performance, convolution tree kernels (Zhang et al., 2006; Zhou et al., 2007) over syntactic parse trees achieve comparable or even better performance than feature-based methods.",
        "However, there still exist two problems regarding currently widely used tree spans.",

        "(2006) discover that the Shortest Pathenclosed Tree (SPT) achieves the best performance.",
        "Zhou et al.",
        "(2007) further extend it to Context-Sensitive Shortest Path-enclosed Tree (CS-SPT), which dynamically includes necessary predicate-linked path information.",
        "One problem with both SPT and CS-SPT is that they may still contain unnecessary information.",
        "The other problem is that a considerable number of useful context-sensitive information is also missing from SPT/CS-SPT, although CS-SPT includes some contextual information relating to predicate-linked path.",
        "This paper proposes a new approach to dynamically determine the tree span for relation extraction by exploiting constituent dependencies to remove the noisy information, as well as keep the necessary information in the parse tree.",
        "Our motivation is to integrate dependency information, which has been proven very useful to relation extraction, with the structured syntactic information to construct a concise and effective tree span specifically targeted for relation extraction.",
        "Moreover, we also explore interesting combined entity features for relation extraction via a unified parse and semantic tree.",
        "The other sections in this paper are organized as follows.",

        "Then, Section 3 proposes a dynamic syntactic parse tree while the entity-related semantic tree is described in Section 4.",

        "One problem with SPT is that it loses the contextual information outside SPT, which is usually critical for relation extraction.",

        "Zhou et al.",
        "(2007) further propose Context-Sensitive SPT (CS-SPT), which can dynamically determine the tree span by extending the necessary predicate-linked path information outside SPT.",
        "However, the key problem of how to represent the structured syntactic parse tree is still partially resolved.",
        "As we indicate as follows, current tree spans suffer from two problems:",
        "(1) Both SPT and CS-SPT still contain unnecessary information.",
        "For example, in the sentence \"...bought one of town's two meatpacking plants\", the condensed information \"one of plants\" is sufficient to determine \"DISC\" relationship between the entities \"one\" [FAC] and \"plants\" [FAC], while SPT/CS-SPT include the redundant underlined part.",
        "Therefore more unnecessary information can be safely removed from SPT/CS-SPT.",
        "(2) CS-SPT only captures part of context-sensitive information relating to predicate-linked structure (Zhou et al., 2007) and still loses much context-sensitive information.",
        "Let's take the same example sentence \"...bought one of town's two meatpacking plants\", where indeed there is no relationship between the entities \"one\" [FAC] and \"town\" [GPE].",
        "Nevertheless, the information contained in SPT/CS-SPT (\"one of town\") may easily lead to their relationship being misclassified as \"DISC\", which is beyond our expectation.",
        "Therefore the underlined part outside SPT/CS-SPT should be recovered so as to differentiate it from positive instances.",
        "Since dependency plays a key role in many NLP problems such as syntactic parsing, semantic role labeling as well as semantic relation extraction, our motivation is to exploit dependency knowledge to distinguish the necessary evidence from the unnecessary information in the structured syntactic parse tree.",
        "On one hand, lexical or word-word dependency indicates the relationship among words occurring in the same sentence, e.g. predicate-argument dependency means that arguments are dependent on their target predicates, modifierhead dependency means that modifiers are dependent on their head words.",
        "This dependency relationship offers a very condensed representation of the information needed to assess the relationship in the forms of the dependency tree (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004) or the shortest dependency path (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005) that includes both entities.",
        "On the other hand, when the parse tree corresponding to the sentence is derived using derivation rules from the bottom to the top, the wordword dependencies extend upward, making a unique head child containing the head word for every non-terminal constituent.",
        "As indicated as follows, each CFG rule has the form:",
        "Here, P is the parent node, H is the head child of the rule, Ln.Ll and Rl.Rm are left and right modifiers of H respectively, and both n and m may be zero.",
        "In other words, the parent node P depends on the head child H, this is what we call constituent dependency.",
        "Vice versa, we can also determine the head child of a constituent in terms of constituent dependency.",
        "Our hypothesis stipulates that the contribution of the parse tree to establishing a relationship is almost exclusively concentrated in the path connecting the two entities, as well as the head children of constituent nodes along this path.",
        "Starting from the Minimum Complete Tree (MCT, the complete sub-tree rooted by the nearest common ancestor of the two entities under consideration) as the representation of each relation instance, along the path connecting two entities, the head child of every node is found according to various constituent dependencies.",
        "Then the path nodes and their head children are kept while any other nodes are removed from the tree.",
        "Eventually we arrive at a tree called Dynamic Syntactic Parse Tree (DSPT), which is dynamically determined by constituent dependencies and only contains necessary information as expected.",
        "There exist a considerable number of constituent dependencies in CFG as described by Collins (2003).",
        "However, since our task is to extract the relationship between two named entities, our focus is on how to condense Noun-Phrases (NPs) and other useful constituents for relation extraction.",
        "Therefore constituent dependencies can be classified according to constituent types of the",
        "CFG rules:",
        "(1) Modification within base-NPs: base-NPs mean that they do not directly dominate an NP themselves, unless the dominated NP is a possessive NP.",
        "The noun phrase right above the entity headword, whose mention type is nominal or name, can be categorized into this type.",
        "In this case, the entity headword is also the headword of the noun phrase, thus all the constituents before the headword are dependent on the headword, and may be removed from the parse tree, while the headword and the constituents right after the headword remain unchanged.",
        "For example, in the sentence \"...bought one of town's two meatpacking plants\" as illustrated in Figure 1(a), the constituents before the headword \"plants\" can be removed from the parse tree.",
        "In this way the parse tree \"one of plants\" could capture the \"DISC\" relationship more concisely and precisely.",
        "Another interesting example is shown in Figure 1(b), where the base-NP of the second entity \"town\" is a possessive NP and there is no relationship between the entities \"one\" and \"town\" defined in the ACE corpus.",
        "For both SPT and CS-SPT, this example would be condensed to \"one of town\" and therefore easily misclassified as the \"DISC\" relationship between the two entities.",
        "In the contrast, our DSPT can avoid this problem by keeping the constituent \"'s\" and the headword \"plants\".",
        "(2) Modification to NPs: except base-NPs, other modification to NPs can be classified into this type.",
        "Usually these NPs are recursive, meaning that they contain another NP as their child.",
        "The CFG rules corresponding to these modifications may have the following forms: NP NP SBAR [relative clause] NP NP VP [reduced relative] NP NP PP [PP attachment]",
        "Here, the NPs in bold mean that the path connecting the two entities passes through them.",
        "For every right hand side, the NP in bold is modified by the constituent following them.",
        "That is, the latter is dependent on the former, and may be reduced to a single NP.",

        "\", where there exists a \"DISC\" relationship between the entities \"one\" and \"people\".",
        "Since the reduced relative \"nominated for .\"",
        "modifies and is therefore dependent on the \"people\", they can be removed from the parse tree, that is, the right side (\"NP VP\") can be reduced to the left hand side, which is exactly a single NP.",

        "-",
        "(3) Arguments/adjuncts to verbs: this type includes the CFG rules in which the left side includes S, SBAR or VP.",
        "An argument represents the subject or object of a verb, while an adjunct indicates the location, date/time or way of the action corresponding to the verb.",
        "They depend on the verb and can be removed if they are not included in the path connecting the two entities.",
        "However, when the parent tag is S or SBAR, and its child VP is not included in the path, this VP should be recovered to indicate the predicate verb.",
        "Figure 1(d) shows a sentence \"... maintain rental property he owns in the state\", where the \"ART.User-or-Owner\" relation holds between the entities \"property\" and \"he\".",
        "While PP can be removed from the rule (\"VP^ VBZ PP\"), the VP should be kept in the rule (\"S-» NP VP\").",
        "Consequently, the tree span looks more concise and precise for relation extraction.",
        "(4) Coordination conjunctions: In coordination constructions, several peer conjuncts may be reduced into a single constituent.",
        "Although the first conjunct is always considered as the headword (Collins, 2003), actually all the conjuncts play an equal role in relation extraction.",
        "As illustrated in Figure 1(e), the NP coordination in the sentence (\"governors from connecticut, south dakota, and montana\") can be reduced to a single NP (\"governors from montana\") by keeping the conjunct in the path while removing the other conjuncts.",
        "(5) Modification to other constituents: except for the above four types, other CFG rules fall into this type, such as modification to PP, ADVP and PRN etc.",
        "These cases are similar to arguments/adjuncts to verbs, but less frequent than them, so we will not detail this scenario.",
        "In fact, SPT (Zhang et al., 2006) can be arrived at by carrying out part of the above removal operations using a single rule (i.e. all the constituents outside the linking path should be removed) and CS-CSPT (Zhou et al., 2007) further recovers part of necessary context-sensitive information outside SPT, this justifies that SPT performs well, while CS-SPT outperforms SPT."

        "(1) Both modification within base-NPs and modification to NPs contribute much to performance improvement, acquiring the increase of F-measure by 4.4/2.4 units in mode M1 and 4.4/2.3 units in mode M2 respectively.",
        "This indicates the local characteristic of semantic relations, which can be effectively captured by NPs near the two involved entities in the DSPT.",
        "(2) All the other three dependencies show minor contribution to performance enhancement, they improve the F-measure only by 2.8/0.9/-0.1 units in mode M1 and 0.5/0.9/0.1 units in mode M2.",
        "This may be due to the reason that these dependencies only remove the nodes far from the two entities.",
        "We compare in Table 2 the performance of Unified Parse and Semantic Trees with different kinds of Entity Semantic Tree setups using standard convolution tree kernel, while the SPT and DSPT with only entity-type information are listed for reference.",
        "It shows that:",
        "(1) All the three unified parse and semantic tree kernels significantly outperform the DSPT kernel, obtaining an average increase of ~4 units in F-measure.",
        "This means that they can effectively capture both the structured syntactic information and the entity-related semantic features.",
        "(2) The Unified Parse and Semantic Tree with Feature-Paired Tree achieves the best performance of 80.1/70.7/75.1 in P/R/F respectively, with an increase of F-measure by 0.4/0.3 units over BOF and EPT respectively.",

        "This implies that the entity-related semantic information is very useful and contributes much when they are incorporated into the parse tree for relation extraction.",

        "Furthermore, when the UPST (FPT) kernel is combined with a linear state-of-the-state feature-based kernel (Zhou et al., 2005) into a composite one via polynomial interpolation in a setting similar to Zhou et al. (2007) (i.e. polynomial degree d=2 and coefficient a=0.3), we get the so far best performance of 77.1 in F-measure for 7 relation types on the ACE RDC 2004 data set.",

        "This paper further explores the potential of structured syntactic information for tree kernel-based relation extraction, and proposes a new approach to dynamically determine the tree span (DSPT) for relation instances by exploiting constituent dependencies.",
        "We also investigate different ways of how entity-related semantic features and their combined features can be effectively captured in a Unified Parse and Semantic Tree (UPST).",
        "Evaluation on the ACE RDC 2004 corpus shows that our DSPT is appropriate for structured representation of relation instances.",
        "We also find that, in addition to individual entity features, combined entity features (especially bi-gram) contribute much when they are combined with a DPST into a UPST.",
        "And the composite kernel, combining the UPST kernel and a linear state-of-the-art kernel, yields the so far best performance.",
        "For the future work, we will focus on improving performance of complex structured parse trees, where the path connecting the two entities involved in a relationship is too long for current kernel methods to take effect.",
