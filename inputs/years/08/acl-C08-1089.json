        "This paper proposes a method for automatic POS (part-of-speech) guessing of Chinese unknown words.",
        "It contains two models.",
        "The first model uses a machine-learning method to predict the POS of unknown words based on their internal component features.",
        "The credibility of the results of the first model is then measured.",
        "For low-credibility words, the second model is used to revise the first model's results based on the global context information of those words.",
        "The experiments show that the first model achieves 93.40% precision for all words and 86.60% for disyllabic words, which is a significant improvement over the best results reported in previous studies, which were 89% precision for all words and 74% for disyllabic words.",
        "Further, the second model improves the results by 0.80% precision for all words and 1.30% for disyllabic words."

        "Since written Chinese does not use blank spaces to denote word boundaries, Chinese word segmentation becomes an essential task for natural language processing, as in many other Asian languages (Thai, Japanese, Tibetan, etc.).",
        "It is difficult to build a complete dictionary comprising all words, for new words are constantly being created.",
        "As such, unknown words may greatly influence the effectiveness of text processing.",
        "Studies on unknown words include detection, POS guessing, sense classification, etc.",
        "Current methods for automatic unknown word detection have been relatively successful and widely used in many systems, yet automatic POS guessing for unknown words still remains a challenge for natural language processing research.",
        "The task of POS guessing is quite different from traditional POS tagging.",
        "Traditional POS tagging involves assigning a single POS tag to a word token, provided that it is known what POS tag this word can take on in principle.",
        "This task requires a lexicon that lists possible POS tags for all words.",
        "However, unknown words are not in the lexicon, so the task of POS guessing of unknown words involves the guessing of a correct POS for an unknown word from the whole POS set of the current language.",
        "Obviously, traditional methods of POS tagging cannot effectively solve the problem of POS guessing of unknown words.",
        "In previous work, two types of features have been used for the task of POS guessing of unknown Chinese words.",
        "One type is contextual feature, including local contextual features and global contextual features, and the other is internal component feature.",
        "Previous work has mainly used context information to guess the POS tags of unknown Chinese words, while a few designs looked at internal component features.",
        "Although there have been some attempts to combine the two types of features together, no reasonable explanation of the relationship between the two types of features has been given.",
        "It is well known that the properties of a structure always depend on its internal component structure.",
        "As such, it is natural for us to wonder whether models based on internal component features alone can perform the POS guessing task for unknown Chinese words with both high precision and high recall.",
        "Here we present a model based on internal component features of unknown words using CRFs (conditional random fields).",
        "The results are very good, especially for multisyllabic words (excluding disyllabic words).",
        "While in the previous model the precision of POS guessing of disyllabic words is relatively high, there is still much room for further improvement.",
        "Considering that the usages of a word in real text can show the properties of a word, and that these features may be a useful complement to internal component features, we designed a scheme to effectively utilize the two types of features together.",
        "In this scheme, credibility scores for former guessing results are computed, and only those words with relatively lower credibility scores are revised by the model based on global context information.",
        "The model based on global context information simulates the behavior of linguists in judging the POS of a word.",
        "Though the recall of the latter model is low, it can revise some incorrect guessing results of the initial model.",
        "According to Lu (2005), there are six main types of unknown Chinese words:",
        "(1) Abbreviation (acronym): e.g., zhong-mei (China-U.S).",
        "(2) Proper names (person's name, place name, company name): e.g., Wang Anshi (person's name), Penang (an island in Malaysia; place name), ^% Huawei (company name).",
        "(3) Derived words (words with affixes): e.g., £j irS zong-jingli (general manager), JJiffft xiandai-hua (modernize).",
        "(4) Compounds: e.g., huoyun (obtain permission), 'M¥J> nisha (mud), tubian (sudden change)",
        "(6) Reduplicated words: e.g., M^F Mil; yingbuyinggai (should or should not), LBlB liiS: chuchujinjin (go in and go out)",
        "Proper names and numeric compounds are all nouns, so they don't have the problem of POS guessing.",
        "We will focus on abbreviation, derived words, compounds, and reduplicated words.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we introduce some previous work on POS guessing of unknown Chinese words.",
        "Sections 3, 4, and 5 describe our proposed method, which includes two models and an additional process linking the two models together.",
        "In detail, Section 3 considers POS guessing for unknown Chinese words as a sequence-labeling problem and proposes a model based on internal component features to solve this task.",
        "In Section 4, we compute a credibility score for each guessing result based on the sequence type of the words' internal component structure.",
        "This links the model in Section 3 and that of Section 5 together.",
        "Section 5 describes a model based on global context information to revise the guessing results of the initial model that have relatively lower credibility scores.",
        "Section 6 shows the experiments and results of our methods and a comparison with previous work.",
        "Section 7 presents our conclusions."

        "Considering the features used during POS guessing, we have classified previous studies on POS guessing of unknown words into three types.",
        "The first type use only contextual features, including local context and global context.",
        "For example, Nakagawa and Matsumoto (2006) proposed a probabilistic model to guess the POS tags of unknown words by considering all the occurrences of unknown words with the same lexical form in a document.",
        "The parameters were estimated using Gibbs sampling.",
        "They also attempted to apply the model to semi-supervised learning, and conducted experiments on multiple corpora.",
        "The highest precision in the Chinese corpus of their experiments was 67.85%.",
        "The second type use only internal component features, such as that of Chen and Bai (1997) and",
        "Wu and Jiang (2000).",
        "Chen and Bai (1997) examined all unknown nouns, verbs, and adjectives and reported 69.13% precision using Dice metrics to measure the affix-category association strength and an affix-dependent entropy weighting scheme for determining the weightings between prefix-category and suffix-category associations.",
        "This approach is effective in processing derived words such as JJlfftti xiandai-hua (modernize), but performs poorly when encountering compounds such as iSHjl baozhi (inflation-proof).",
        "Wu and Jiang (2000) calculated P(Cat,Pos,Len) for each character, where Cat is the POS of a word containing the character, Pos is the position of the character in that word, and Len is the length of that word.",
        "They then calculated the POS probabilities for each unknown word as the joint probabilities of P(Cat,Pos,Len) for its component characters.",
        "This approach was applied to unknown nouns, verbs, and adjectives of two to four characters in length.",
        "This approach exhibits lower recall for multisyllabic words even if the training corpus is significantly large.",
        "The third type attempt to combine internal component features and context information, such as that of Lu (2005) and Goh et al.",
        "(2006).",
        "Lu (2005) describes a hybrid model that combines a rule-based model with two statistical models for the task of POS guessing of unknown Chinese words.",
        "The rule-based model includes 35 manual rules concerning the type, length, and internal structure of unknown words, and the two statistical models utilize context information and the likelihood for a character to appear in a particular position of words of a particular length and POS category, one of which is Wu and Jiang's (2000) model.",
        "It achieves a precision of 89.00%, a significant improvement over the best result reported in previous studies, which was guessing the part-of-speech tags of detected unknown words using contextual and internal component features with maximum entropy models.",
        "local context and not global context.",
        "As far as internal component features are concerned, Lu (2005) uses only the word category feature in his rule-based model while Goh et al.",
        "(2006) uses only the first character and last character features.",
        "From the above studies, we may find that methods based on internal component features are very promising, but this kind of features still needs much more attention.",
        "Moreover, none of them has proved that methods based on context information can improve the results of methods based on internal component features.",
        "They only attempted to utilize different types of features together and to give simultaneous results for both types of features.",
        "Our method is among the third type of studies, but is different from the rest in the scheme of combining the two types of features together.",
        "In our method, internal component features play a more important role.",
        "We will prove that a model based on this type of features alone can perform very well.",
        "The other type of features acts as a useful supplement and can improve the results of some words in a certain degree.",
        "The two models are linked together by assigning a credibility score for each POS guessing result generated by the initial model.",
        "The results with a relatively lower credibility score are identified and put through reconsideration by a method based on global context information."

        "In this model, we consider the task of POS guessing of unknown words as a problem of sequence labeling.",
        "The inspiration for this approach came from our observations of how humans understand a word.",
        "Usually an unknown word is regarded by human as a sequence of characters or morphemes that can be partitioned into several segments, where each segment is relatively coherent in meaning.",
        "In contrast with other models for labeling sequences, such as HMM and MEMM, CRFs are good at avoiding the label bias problem.",
        "They condition on the entire observation sequence, thus avoiding the need for independent assumptions between observations and vastly expanding the set of features that can be incorporated into the model without violating its assumptions.",
        "One of the main advantages of a conditional model is its ability to explore a diverse range of features relevant to a specific task.",
        "As many studies have shown, CRFs are the best models for solving the sequence labeling problem (Lafferty et al., 2001; Vail et al., 2007).",
        "So we chose to use CRFs to solve the POS guessing problem.",
        "While training, we use the words of a dictionary as training data.",
        "Those words will be considered as sentences and then segmented and assigned POS-tags by a standard word segmentation and POS tagging tool.",

        "The monosyllabic words were omitted from the training.",
        "Feature Analysis",
        "In our CRFs model, we employed three main types of features: the components of words, the lengths of those components, and the POS tags of those components.",
        "Before the CRFs training, we analyzed the internal component structure of the dictionary words and assigned a proper POS-tag to each component.",
        "There are four analysis schemes that are different from each other in two aspects.",
        "The first aspect is the type of the component, which may be a character or immediate constituent (IC).",
        "Here, \"immediate constituent\" means constituents that directly form a word.",
        "For example, 44 ^feTTRR kexuejishubu (department of science and technology) has the following constituents: 44 ke, ^ xue, fe ji, tT shu, RR bu, 44^ kexue, and fe/T jishu, in which only 44^ kexue, fe/T jishu and RR bu are the immediate constituents of 44f¥:fe7TRR kexuejishubu.",
        "The second aspect is regarding the consideration of the POS-tag of the component.",

        "Table 1.",
        "Analysis Schemes In Scheme 1 and Scheme 2, the tool segments a dictionary word until all components are characters, and in Scheme 1 only, each component is given a POS tag.",
