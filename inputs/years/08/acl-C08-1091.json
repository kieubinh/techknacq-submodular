      "text": [
        "Unsupervised learning of grammar from text ('grammar induction') is of great theoretical and practical importance.",
        "It can shed light on language acquisition by humans and on the general structure of language, and it can potentially assist NLP applications that utilize parser output.",
        "The problem has attracted researchers for decades, and interest has greatly increased recently, in part due to the availability of huge corpora, computation power, and new learning algorithms (see Section 2).",
        "A fundamental issue in this research direction is the representation of the resulting induced grammar.",
        "Most recent work (e.g., (Klein and Manning, 2004; Dennis, 2005; Bod, 2006a; Smith and Eisner, 2006; Seginer, 2007)) annotates text sentences using a hierarchical bracketing (constituents) or a dependency structure, and thus represents the induced grammar through its behavior in a parsing task.",
        "Solan et al.",
        "(2005) uses a graph representation, while (Nakamura, 2006) simply uses a grammar formalism such as PCFG.",
        "When the bracketing approach is taken, some algorithms label the resulting constituents, while most do not.",
        "Each of these approaches can be justified or criticized; a detailed discussion of this issue is beyond the scope of this paper.",
        "The algorithm presented here belongs to the first group, annotating given sentences with labeled bracketing structures.",
        "The main theoretical justification for this approach is that many linguistic and psycholinguistic theories posit some kind of a hierarchical labeled constituent (or constructional) structure, arguing that it has a measurable psychological (cognitive) reality (e.g., (Goldberg, 2006)).",
        "The main practical arguments in favor of this approach are that it enables a detailed and large-scale evaluation using annotated corpora, as is done in this paper, and that the output format is suitable for many applications.",
        "When an algorithm generates labeled structures, the number of labels is an important issue.",
        "From a theoretical point of view, the algorithm should also discover the appropriate number of labels.",
        "However, for evaluation and application purposes it is useful to base the number of labels on a specific target grammar.",
        "In previous work, the number was set to be equal to that in the target grammar.",
        "This is a reasonable approach that we experiment with in this paper.",
        "In addition, to reduce the possible arbitrariness in this approach, we also experiment with the number of prominent labels in the target grammar, determined according to their coverage of corpus constituents.",
        "Another issue relates to the nature of the input.",
        "In most cases (e.g., in the Klein, Smith, Dennis and Bod papers above), the input consists of part-of-speech (POS) sequences, derived from text corpora by manual or automatic POS tagging.",
        "In some cases (e.g., in the Seginer and Solan papers above) it can consist of plain text.",
        "Again, each approach has its pros and cons.",
        "The algorithm we present here requires POS tags for its labeling stages.",
        "Parts-of-speech are widely considered to have a psychological reality (at least in English, including when they are viewed as low-level constructions as in (Croft, 2001)), so this kind of input is reasonable for theoretical research.",
        "Moreover, as POS induction is of medium quality (Clark, 2003), using a manually POS tagged corpus enables us to measure the performance of other induction stages in a controlled manner.",
        "Since supervised POS tagging is of very high quality and very efficient computationally (Brants, 2000), this requirement does not seriously limit the practical applicability of a grammar induction algorithm.",
        "Our labeled bracketings induction algorithm consists of three stages.",
        "We first induce unla-beled bracketing trees using the algorithm given in (Seginer, 2007).",
        "We then induce initial labels using a Bayesian Model Merging (BMM) labeling algorithm (Borensztajn and Zuidema, 2007), which aims at minimizing the description length of the input data and the induced grammar.",
        "Finally, the initial labels are clustered to a desired number of labels using syntactic features extracted from the initially labeled trees.",
        "Previous work on labeled brackets induction (Section 2) did not differentiate the unlabeled structure induction phase from the labeling phase, applying a single phase approach.",
        "To evaluate labeled bracketings, we need a mapping between the label symbols of the induced and target grammars.",
        "Previous work used a 'greedy', many to one, mapping.",
        "We used both the greedy mapping and a label-to-label (LL) mapping, since greedy mapping is highly forgiving to structural problems in the induced labeling.",
        "We report results for two cases: one in which the number of labels in the induced and target grammars is the same, and one in which the former is the number of prominent labels in the target grammar.",
        "We discuss how this number can be defined and determined.",
        "We experimented with English (WSJ10, Brown10), German (NEGRA10) and Chinese (CTB10) corpora.",
        "When comparing to previous work that used manually annotated corpora in its evaluation (Haghighi and Klein, 2006), we obtained 59.5% labeled f-score on the WSJ10 setup vs. their 35.3% (Section 5).",
        "We also show substantial improvement over a random baseline, and that the clustering stage of our algorithm improves the results of the second merging stage.",
        "Section 2 discusses previous work.",
        "In Section 3 we detail our algorithm.",
        "The experimental setup and results are presented in Sections 4 and 5."

        "Unsupervised parsing has attracted researchers for decades (see (Clark, 2001; Klein, 2005) for recent reviews).",
        "Many types of input, syntax formalisms, search procedures, and success criteria were used.",
        "Among the theoretical and practical motivations to this problem are the study of human language acquisition (in particular, an empirical study of the poverty of stimulus hypothesis), preprocessing for constructing large treebanks (Van Zaanen, 2001), and improving language models (Chen, 1995).",
        "In recent years efforts have been made to evaluate the algorithms on manually annotated corpora such as the WSJ PennTreebank.",
        "Recently, works along this line have for the first time outperformed the right branching heuristic baseline for English.",
        "These include the constituent-context extension using a dependency model (Klein and based approach (Dennis, 2005), guiding EM using contrastive estimation (Smith and Eisner, 2006), and the incremental parser of (Seginer, 2007).",
        "All of these use as input POS tag sequences, except of Seginer's algorithm, which uses plain text.",
        "All of these papers induce unlabeled bracketing or dependencies.",
        "There are other algorithmic approaches to the problem (e.g., (Adriaans, 1992; Daelemans, 1995; Van Zaanen, 2001)).",
        "None of these had evaluated labeled bracketing on annotated corpora.",
        "In this paper we focus on the induction of labeled bracketing.",
        "Bayesian Model Merging (BMM) (Stolcke, 1994; Stolcke and Omohundro, 1994) is a framework for inducing PCFG containing both a bracketing and a labeling.",
        "The characteristics of this framework (separating prior probability, data likelihood and heuristic search procedures) can also be found in the grammar induction models of (Wolf, 1982; Langley and Stromsten, 2000; Petasis et al., 2004; Solan et al., 2005).",
        "The BMM model used here (Borensztajn and Zuidema, 2007) combines features of (Petasis et al., 2004) and Stolcke's algorithm, applying the minimum description length (MDL) principle.",
        "We use it here only for initial labeling of existing bracketings.",
        "The MDL principle was also used in (Grunwald, 1994; de Marcken, 1995; Clark, 2001).",
        "There are only two previous papers we are aware of that induce labeled bracketing and evaluate on corpora annotated with a similar representation (Haghighi and Klein, 2006; Borensztajn and Zuidema, 2007).",
        "We utilize and extend the latter's labeling algorithm.",
        "However, the evaluation done by the latter dealt only with labeling, using gold-standard (manually annotated) bracketings.",
        "Thus, we can directly compare our results only to (Haghighi and Klein, 2006), where two models (pcfg x none and pcfg x ccm) are fully unsupervised.",

        "Our model consists of three stages: bracketing, initial labeling, and label clustering.",
        "In this step, we apply the algorithm of (Seginer, 2007) to induce bracketing from plain text.",
        "We have chosen that algorithm because it is very fast (both learning and parsing) and its code is publicly available.",
        "We could have chosen any of the algorithms mentioned above producing a similar output format.",
        "Our label clustering stage uses syntactic features.",
        "To obtain these, we need an initial labeling on the bracketings computed in the previous stage.",
        "To do that we modify the Bayesian Model Merging (BMM) algorithm of (Borensztajn and Zuidema, 2007), which induces context-free grammars (bracketing and labeling) from POS tags, combining features of the models of (Stolcke and Omohundro, 1994) and (Petasis et al., 2004).",
        "The BMM algorithm (Borensztajn and Zuidema, 2007) uses an iterative heuristic greedy search for an optimal PCFG according to the Bayesian criterion of maximum posterior probability.",
        "Two operators define possible transitions between grammars: Merge creates generalizations by replacing two existing non-terminals X\\ and X2 that occur in the same contexts by a single new non-terminal Y; Chunk concatenates repeating patterns by taking a sequence of two non-terminals X\\ and X2 and creating a new non-terminal Y that expands to X1X2.",
        "We have used the algorithm to deal only with labeling.",
        "It reads the initial rules of the grammar from all productions implicit in the bracketed corpus induced in the previous step.",
        "Every constituent (except of the start symbol) is given a unique label.",
        "Since only labeling is required, only merge operations are performed.",
        "The objective function the algorithm tries to optimize at each step is the posterior probability calculated according to Bayes' Law:",
        "where P{X\\M) is the likelihood of the data X given the grammar M and P(M) is the prior probability of the grammar.",
        "This is equivalent to minimizing the function",
        "Using a Minimal Description Length (MDL) principle, BMM interprets this function as total description length (DL): The Grammar Description Length GDL = – logP(M) is the space needed to encode the model, and the Data Description Length DDL = -logP(X\\M) is the space required to describe the data given the model.",
        "The rationale for MDL is to prefer smaller grammars that describe the data well.",
        "DDL and GDL are computed as in (Stolcke, 1994; Stolcke and Omohundro, 1994).",
        "In order to reduce the number of grammars considered at each step, which naively is quadratic in the number of non-terminals, a method based on (Petasis et al., 2004) for efficiently predicting DL gain is applied.",
        "The process is iterated until no additional merge operation improves the objective function.",
        "Full details are given in (Borensztajn and Zuidema, 2007).",
        "Label set size.",
        "BMM produces quite a large number of labels (4944 for WSJ10).",
        "In the third step of our algorithm we reduce that number.",
        "We first discuss the issue of the number of labels in induced grammars, which is an important issue.",
        "In many situations, it is reasonable to use a number T identical to the number of labels in a given target grammar, for example when that grammar is used for applications or evaluation.",
        "This is the approach in (Haghighi and Klein, 2006) for their unsupervised models, and we use it in part of our evaluation.",
        "However, it is also reasonable to argue that the granularity of syntactic categories (labels) in the gold standard annotation of the corpora we experiment with is somewhat arbitrary.",
        "For example, in the WSJ Penn Treebank noun phrases are annotated with the symbol NP, but there is no distinction between subject and object NPs.",
        "Incorporating such a distinction into the WSJ 10 grammar would result in a 27 labels grammar instead of 26.",
        "To examine this issue, consider Figure 1, which shows the amount of constituent coverage obtained by a certain number of labels in the four corpora we use (see Section 4).",
        "In all of them, about 95% of the constituents are covered by 23% - 37% of the labels, and the curve rises very sharply until that 95% value.",
        "Motivated by this observation, given a corpus annotated using a certain hierarchical labeled grammar, we refer to the set of P labels that cover at least 95% of the constituents in the corpus as the grammar's prominent labels.",
        "The prominent labels are not only the most frequent in the corpus; each of them substantially contributes to constituent labeling, while the saliency of other labels is much smaller.",
        "It is thus reasonable to assume that by addressing only prominent labels, we address a level of granularity that is uniform and basic (to the annotation scheme used).",
        "As a result, by asking the induced grammar to produce P labels, we reduce arbitrariness and enable our testing to focus on our success in identifying the basic phenomena in the target grammar.",

        "In all corpora, more than 95% of the constituents are labeled using less than 10 prominent labels.",
        "As a result, we generated two grammars for each corpus we experimented with, one having T labels and the other having P labels.",
        "Clustering, we stop BMM when no improvement to its objective function is possible, and cluster the labels to conform to the size constraint.",
        "Denote the number of labels in the induced grammar with M, the set of D most frequent induced labels with A, and the set consisting of the other induced labels with B (\\B\\ = M – D).",
        "If M D, there is nothing to do since the constraint holds.",
        "Otherwise, we map each label in B to the label in A that exhibits the most similar syntactic behavior, as follows.",
        "We construct a feature vector representation of each of the labels, using 3M + \\K\\ features, where K is the set of POS tags in the corpus.",
        "The first M features correspond to parent-child relationships between each of the induced labels and the represented label.",
        "The i-th feature (i e [1, M}) is the number of times the i-th label is the parent of the represented label.",
        "Similarly, the next M features correspond to child-parent relationships, the next M features correspond to sibling relationships and the last \\ K\\ features correspond to the number of times each POS tag is the leftmost POS tag in a constituent labeled by the represented label.",
        "Note that in order to compute the values of the first 3M features, we needed an initial labeling on the induced bracket-ings; this is the main reason for using the BMM stage.",
        "For each label bi G B, we compute the cosine metric between its vector b'\" and that of every aj e A, mapping bi to the label ctj with which it obtains the highest score:",
        "The cosine metric grows when the same coordinates (features) in both vectors have higher values.",
        "As a result, vectors with high values of the same features (corresponding to similar syntactic behavior) get high scores."

        "In each corpus, we used the sentences of length at most 10, numbering 7422 (WSJ10), 9117 (BrownlO), 7542 (NEGRA 10) and 4626 (CTB10).",
        "For each corpus the following T and P values were used: WSJ10: 26,8; BrownlO: 28, 7; NE-GRA10: 22,6; CTB10: 24,9.",

        "Unsupervised grammar induction is a central research problem, possessing both theoretical and practical significance.",
        "There is great value in producing an output format consistent with and evaluated against formats used in large human annotated corpora.",
        "Most previous work of that kind produces unlabeled bracketing or dependencies.",
        "In this paper we presented an algorithm that induces labeled bracketing.",
        "The labeling stages of the algorithm use the MDL principle to induce an initial, relatively large, set of labels, which are then clustered using syntactic features.",
        "We discussed the issue of the desired number of labels, and introduced the concept of prominent labels, which allows us coverage of the basic and most salient level of a target grammar.",
        "Labels are clearly an important aspect of grammar induction.",
        "Future work will explore their significance for applications.",
        "Evaluating induced labels is a complex issue.",
        "We applied greedy mapping as in previous work, and showed that our algorithm significantly outperforms it.",
        "In addition, we introduced LL mapping, which overcomes some of the shortcomings of greedy mapping.",
        "There are several other possible methods for evaluating labeled induced grammars, and we plan to explore them in future work.",
        "We evaluated on large human annotated corpora of different English domains and three languages, and showed that our labeling stages, and specifically the SC stage, outperform several baselines for all corpora and mapping methods.",
