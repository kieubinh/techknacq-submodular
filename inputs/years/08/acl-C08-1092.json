        "WordNet is a lexical database widely used for NLP tasks.",
        "Any application of WordNet which measures semantic distance employs WordNet relations to do so.",
        "As part of a wider project to build an improved and enriched lexical database using existing resources, in the hope of improving on the performance of WordNet, this study investigates the correctness of the hypernymy/troponymy relations between verbs.",
        "The broader project would ideally model these hierarchical relations as trees but for the phenomenon of multiple inheritance, which is investigated here to see if it is semantically justified.",
        "Moreover it seems intuitively likely that anomalies will be concentrated where the relational structure is more complex.",
        "The only document found to specify the WordNet verbal relations is Fellbaum (1998), who defines troponymy (the verb equivalent of hy-ponymy) as a special case of entailment, where the entailing and entailed verb are temporally coextensive, distinguishing it from causation, temporal inclusion, and backward presupposition, of which the last two are not encoded as distinct relations in WordNet, but are combined under the general heading of entailment.",
        "The expression sister terms is used to designate a pair of synsets which share a hypernym.",
        "This study distinguishes between transitive causation (causing another to do something) and reflexive causation (causing oneself to do something).",
        "The term quale (plural: qualia) is borrowed from Pustejovsky (1991).",
        "As applied to verbs within the context of this study, the formal quale means what is physically done, while the telic quale means the purpose or intended result of the action.",
        "Banerjee & Pedersen (2003) have employed WordNet relations in an extension to the Lesk (1986) algorithm for word sense disambiguation.",
        "In order to establish the relatedness of two words, the glosses of their WordNet relatives are compared.",
        "Their results are noticeably inferior for verbs than for nouns.",
        "Moreover, while the most useful relations for disambiguating nouns were hyponymy and meronymy, in the case of verbs, the example sentences proved more useful than any relations.",
        "Their best results were obtained by using all relations between verbs indiscriminately.",
        "This finding reflects on the distinctions between kinds of verb relations and suggests that at least where verbs are concerned, the limited success achieved by algorithms relying on WordNet relations arises from the probability that when a relation is encoded, some relation exists, even though the kind of relation is not necessarily correct.",
        "This observation suggests that improvements to the WordNet relations may well be useful for improving on the performance of WordNet as a tool for interlingual tasks and word sense disambiguation.",
        "Smrz (2003) proposes a number of tests for validating wordnets.",
        "These involve checking for \"cycles\", \"dangling uplinks\" and \"top-most synset not from the defined set\" and critically examining \"multi-parent relations\".",
        "These tests have been applied in the development of BalkanNet (Various 2004).",
        "The present study looks for any of the listed faults or potential faults within WordNet 3.0.",
        "Without a defined set of unique beginners, it is impossible to distinguish a \"dangling uplink\" from \"top-most synset not from the defined set\".",
        "All verbs synsets without any hypernym will therefore be considered as candidate unique beginners.",
        "Liu et al.",
        "(2004) have found thousands of cases of rings within the hierarchies, which arise when a synset has two hypernyms within the same semantic category, which themselves have a common hypernym, along with isolators, trees isolated within their own category whose only hy-pernym lies in another category.",
        "Such deviations from a tree-structure, if not semantically justifiable, should be considered as faults.",
        "The occurrence of a ring implies multiple inheritance, which is not necessarily a fault but merits investigation to ensure that it is justified.",
        "There are two other kinds of potential fault which should also be considered: another kind of ring is a cycle, which is formed where following the hypernymy relation in one direction leads back to where one started; a special case of an isolator occurs where a synset has no hypernym at all, which makes it a candidate unique beginner.",
        "Liu et al.",
        "(2004) dismiss this possibility as legitimate, without further consideration, on the grounds that this applies to the unique beginners of each semantic category.",
        "In fact, Fellbaum (1998) allows for more than one unique beginner per verb category.",
        "However cases where there is a large number of unique beginners in one category merit investigation.",
        "The present study has been conducted using a model of WordNet where synsets, word senses and relations are implemented as Java objects, constructed from the WordNet 3.0 Prolog files.",
        "Focussing mainly on verbs, three main aspects are investigated, topological anomalies, anomalies relating to categories and the top ontology.",
        "An algorithm was developed to discover occurrences of each of the kinds of potential hy-pernymy fault identified above.",
        "To investigate topological anomalies, the algorithm recursively constructs an upside-down tree from each synset, using that synset as root with its most remote indirect hypernyms as the leaves.",
        "Where a cycle occurs, a stack error will result.",
        "A ring is identified wherever a synset is found more than once in the same upside-down tree.",
        "This approach is an extension of the methodology employed by Liu et al.",
        "(2004), in that it assumes no correlation between semantic categories and hypernymy so as to identify rings which straddle category boundaries.",
        "An examination of rings in the verb hierarchy leads onto a more general examination of dual inheritance among verbs (there are no verbs with more than 2 hypernyms).",
        "An isolator occurs when the only hypernym is in a different semantic category to the synset under investigation.",
        "Examination of isolators reveals more anomalies in the verb hierarchy but also raises questions about the validity of the semantic categories.",
        "A candidate unique beginner is identified whenever a synset has troponyms but no hypernym.",

        "2), the link between the initial synset and the compound hypernym is redundant and can be removed.",
        "In the remaining case, \"eat\" (transitive) has the simple hypernym \"eat\" (intransitive) which simply fails to specify what is eaten.",
        "This can be considered as synonymy and so there is a case for merging these synsets.",
        "The compound hypernym \"consume, ingest\" would also seem to be a synonym, unless one relies on the gloss: \"serve oneself to, or consume regularly\", in which case it as ambiguous between reflexive causation and iteration, neither of which fits the definition of hypernymy.",
        "The instances of symmetric topology (fig.",
        "3) raise different issues.",
        "Liu et al.",
        "(2004) assert that a ring implies a paradox because they assume that two hyponyms of a single hypernym must have opposite properties in some dimension and therefore cannot have a common hyponym, as a hyponym must inherit all the properties of its hypernym.",
        "In fact there need not be any paradox as two hyponyms can modify two different properties of their hypernym (see Amaro et al., 2006, for a discussion with particular reference to qualia properties).",
        "The symmetric ring starting from the word \"turn\" in the sense \"the leaves turn in Autumn\" involves different properties: \"turn, grow\" is distinguished from \"change\" by specifying that the timescale is gradual, while \"discolour\" specifies which attribute is to change; \"turn\" in the above sense inherits both properties of gradual timescale and colour attribute.",
        "In the remaining three cases of symmetric rings, the gloss for the initial synset contains the word \"or\", conveying an ambiguity.",
        "The two hy-pernyms in each case are in fact hypernyms or synonyms of the respective two meanings, and the grandparent is indeed a common ancestor.",
        "Splitting the ambiguous synsets to remove the ring would improve consistency.",
        "We conclude that in 7 out of 8 instances, rings among verbs can be corrected and in the remaining case (\"turn\", above) the ring and the dual inheritance are justified.",
        "The question then arises as to why there should only be one case of a semantically justifiable ring.",

        "There are fewer, but a significant number of examples of reflexive causation, e.g. \"look\" (cause self to see) and more complex cases concerning possession: \"give\" (cause to have + cause self to not have), \"take\" (cause to not have + cause self to have).",
        "There are a number of unique beginners which express starting or stopping e.g. \"learn\" (start to know), \"get\" (start to have), \"become\" (start to be) and \"lose\" (stop having).",
        "Finally there are verbs which can be defined as the negation of other verbs: \"displease\" (not please), \"reject\" (not accept), \"fail\" (not suc- ceed), \"lack\" (not have), \"refrain\" (not do).",
        "Although \"NOT\" is not a verb, \"doesn't/don't\" is a verb which is generally substituted for \"NOT\", except in the infinitive.",

        "In the course of this study, one cycle has been found in WordNet and a number of \"multi-parent relations\" have been found to be unjustified.",
        "Over 500 instances have been found of \"top-most synset not from the defined set\" or \"dangling uplinks\" (Smrz, 2003).",
        "Many shortcomings have been found in the encoding of hypernymy between verbs, where the implementation frequently does not conform to the theory.",
        "In their present state, the encoded relations can only reliably serve to indicate that a relation exists between two verbs and not to elucidate what that relation is.",
        "One is left with the impression that many hypernyms have been encoded arbitrarily, whether manually or automatically, with little respect for distinctions between kinds of relation.",
        "The hierarchy could be improved by merging synonymous synsets and removing redundant relations and by adopting a consistent approach to causative/inchoative alternations.",
        "The only valid cases of dual inheritance are where different but compatible properties are inherited.",
        "Many more such relations could be encoded.",
        "The semantic categories are, for the most part, not mutually exclusive and lack a consistent theoretical basis.",
        "If semantic categories are required, then a verb needs to be allowed to belong to more than one.",
        "A new top ontology has been proposed which reduces the number of unique beginners from 254 to 18 with the aid of auxiliaries including modal verbs.",
