      "heading": "2. Background",
      "text": [
        "There are several well-established, large-scale repositories of semantic frames for general language, e.g., VerbNet (Kipper-Schuler, 2005), PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) and FrameNet (Rupenhoffer et al., 2006).",
        "These all aim to characterise verb behaviour in terms of the semantic arguments with which verbs occur but differ in how they represent semantic arguments and groupings of verbs.",
        "In VerbNet, the semantic roles of arguments come from frame-independent roles, e.g.",
        "Agent, Patient, Location and Instrument.",
        "In contrast, PropBank and FrameNet use a mixture of role types: some are common amongst a number of frames; others are specific to particular frames.",
        "Whilst FrameNet and VerbNet differ in their treatment of semantic roles, they both specify",
        "Table l. Semantic Roles semantic frames that correspond to groups of verbs with similar behaviour.",
        "However, frames in PropBank correspond to individual verbs.",
        "Biology-specific extensions have been attempted both for PropBank (Wattarujeekrit et al., 2004) and FrameNet (Dolbey et al., 2006).",
        "However, to our knowledge, there has been no such attempt at extending VerbNet into the biological domain.",
        "In common with VerbNet, our work is focussed on producing event frames that use a set of frame-independent semantic roles.",
        "However, we adopt a smaller set of roles tailored to the domain.",
        "This use of frame-independent roles allows linguistic generalisations to be captured more easily (Cohen and Hunter, 2006).",
        "Also, the use of such roles is more suitable for direct exploitation by NLP systems (Zaphirain et al., 2008).",
        "Unlike VerbNet, we aim to produce a set of frames that are verb-specific (rather than frames that apply to groups of verbs).",
        "Verb-specific frames are able to provide more detailed argument specifications â€“ particularly important in the biomedical field, where phrases that identify information such as location, manner, timing and condition are essential for correct interpretation of events (Tsai et al., 2007).",
        "Annotated corpus",
        "To aid semantic event frame extraction, we need a corpus annotated with event-level information.",
        "Several already exist for biology.",
        "Some target extraction of PropBank-style frames (e.g. Chou et al.",
        "(2006), Kulick et al.",
        "(2004)).",
        "The corpus produced by Kim et al.",
        "(2008) uses frame-independent roles.",
        "However, only a few semantic argument types are annotated.",
        "The target of our event frame extraction is a set of semantic frames which specify all potential arguments of gene regulation events.",
        "For this purpose, we had to produce our own annotated corpus, using a larger set of event-independent semantic roles than Kim et al.",
        "(2008).",
        "Our roles had to cover sufficiently wide scope to allow annotation and characterization of all instantiated arguments of relevant events within texts.",
        "To our knowledge, this makes our scheme unique within the biomedical field.",
        "In contrast to many other comparable resources, annotated events are centred on both verbs and nominalised verbs, such as transcription and control.",
        "Nominalised verbs play an important and possibly dominant role in biological texts (Cohen and Hunter, 2006).",
        "Our own corpus confirms this, in that the nominalised verb expression is the most commonly annotated word on which gene regulation events are centred.",
        "By annotating events centred on nominalised verbs in a similar way to verbs, it becomes possible to extract separate event frames for nominalised verbs.",

        "Table 4 shows that, in terms of identifying events (i.e. determining which verbs denote gene regulation events), agreement between annotators is reached about half the time.",
        "The main reason for this relatively low figure is that reaching a consensus on the specific types of events to be annotated under the heading of \"gene regulation\" required a large amount of discussion.",
        "Thus, particularly towards the start of the annotation phase, annotators tended to either under-or over-annotate the events.",
        "Greater amounts of consistency seem to be achievable for other subtasks of the annotation, with agreement rates for the identification and subsequent labelling of semantic arguments being achieved in around three quarters of cases.",
        "Comparable, but slightly lower rates of agreement were achieved in the identification of NEs.",
        "In terms of assigning categories to them, the agreement rate for exact category matches is a little lower (62%).",
        "However, if we relax the matching conditions by exploiting the hierarchical structure of the NE categories (i.e. if we count as a match the cases where the category assigned by one annotator was the ancestor of the category assigned by the other annotator), then the agreement increases by around 11%.",
        "The large number of NE categories (61), makes the decision of the most appropriate category rather complex; this was verified by the annotators themselves.",
        "Based on this, we will consider the use of a more coarse-grained scheme when carrying out further annotation of this type.",
        "However, in the current corpus, the hierarchical structuring of the NE categories means that it would be possible to use a smaller set of categories by mapping the specific categories to more general ones."

        "This is because, if a particular event frame occurs multiple times in a corpus, it is sufficient to extract only a single occurrence of the event description.",
        "So, whilst the NE and semantic role labelling may not be successful for all occurrences of the event frame, there is a good chance that at least one occurrence of the event will be realized in the text in such a way as to allow the labelling to be carried out successfully, thus allowing the extraction of an appropriate event frame."

        "Linguistic-level event annotation of biological events is an inherently difficult task.",
        "This is supported by the fact that the inter-annotator agreement level for the identification of events was 0.49 (see Table 4).",
        "Therefore, in terms of event extraction performance, a precision of 49.0% on 10-fold cross validation is almost comparable to human experts.",
        "The low recall of 18.6% may not be an issue, as the recall is likely to improve with the size of the target corpus.",
        "The precision may additionally be underestimated in the evaluation due to inconsistencies in the annotation.",
        "We found that the average precision of our event frame extraction over 10 folds is around 30%, despite the fact that the precision of all event frames extracted from 10 folds is almost 50% compared with the annotated event frames in the whole corpus.",
        "This happens because some events not annotated in a particular fold are annotated in the rest of corpus.",
        "From this insight, our conjecture is that the true precision against the whole corpus would be somewhat higher (potentially 70-80%) if we were using an annotated corpus 10 times larger for the evaluation.",
        "The automatic NER performance was also comparable to human annotators.",
        "There are several approaches to the generation of information extraction patterns (e.g. Soderland et al., 1995; Califf et al., 1997; Kim and Moldo-van, 1995).",
        "Our event patterns are similar to information extraction rules used in conventional IE systems.",
        "However, the goal of this paper is not event instance extraction but event (or semantic) frame extraction.",
        "We also combined CRF-based NER and semantic role labelling tuned for gene regulation with event extraction from sentences so that the clues of gene regulation event frames could be assigned automatically to un-annotated text."
