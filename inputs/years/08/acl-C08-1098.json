        "Our tagger combines two ideas, the decomposition of the probability of complex POS tags into a product of feature probabilities, and the estimation of the conditional probabilities with decision trees.",
        "A similar idea was previously presented in Kempe (1994), but apparently never applied again.",
        "The tagging accuracy reported by Kempe was below that of a traditional trigram tagger.",
        "Unlike him, we found that our tagging method outperformed state-of-the-art POS taggers on fine-grained POS tagging even if only a trigram context was used.",
        "Schmid (1994) and Marquez (1999) used decision trees for the estimation of contextual tag probabilities, but without a decomposition of the fag probability.",
        "Magerman (1994) applied probabilistic decision trees to parsing, but not with a generative model.",
        "Provost & Domingos (2003) noted that well-known decision tree induction algorithms such as C4.5 (Quinlan, 1993) or CART (Breiman et al., 1984) fail to produce accurate probability estimates.",
        "They proposed to grow the decision trees to their maximal size without pruning, and to smooth the probability estimates with add-1 smoothing (also known as the Laplace correction).",
        "Ferri et al.",
        "(2003) describe a more complex backoff smoothing method.",
        "Contrary to them, we applied pruning and found that some pruning (fhresh-old=6) gives better results than no pruning (threshold^).",
        "Another difference is that we used N two-class trees with normalization to predict the probabilities of N classes.",
        "These two-class trees can be pruned with a fixed pruning threshold.",
        "Hence there is no need to put aside training data for parameter tuning.",
        "An open question is whether the SVMTool (or other discriminatively trained taggers) could outperform the presented tagger if the same decomposition of POS tags and the same context size was used.",
        "We think that this might be the case if the SVM features are restricted to the set of relevant attribute combinations discovered by the decision tree, but we doubt that it is possible to train the SVMTool (or other discriminatively trained taggers) without such a restriction given the difficulties to train it with the standard context size.",
        "Czech POS tagging has been extensively studied in the past (Hajic and Vidova-Hladka, 1998; Hajic et al., 2001; Votrubec, 2006).",
        "Spoustov et al.",
        "(2007) compared several POS taggers including an n-gram tagger and a discriminatively trained tagger (Morce), and evaluated them on the Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT 2.0).",
        "Morce's tagging accuracy was 95.12%, 0.3% better than the n-gram tagger.",
        "A hybrid system based on four different tagging methods reached an accuracy of 95.68%.",
        "Because of the different corpora used and the different amounts of lexical information available, a direct comparison to our results is difficult.",
        "Furthermore, our tagger uses no corpus-specific heuristics, whereas Morce e.g. is optimized for Czech POS tagging.",
        "The German tagging results are, to the best of our knowledge, the first published results for finegrained POS tagging with the Tiger tagset."
