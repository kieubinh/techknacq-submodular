        "Accurately estimating the semantic distance between words in context has applications for machine translation, information retrieval (IR), speech recognition, and text categorization (Bu-danitsky and Hirst, 2006), and it is becoming clear that a combination of corpus statistics can be used with a dictionary, thesaurus, or other knowledge source such as WordNet or Wikipedia, to increase the accuracy of semantic distance estimation (Mohammad and Hirst, 2006).",
        "Although compiling such resources is labor intensive and achieving wide coverage is difficult, these resources to some extent explicitly capture semantic structures of concepts and words.",
        "In contrast, corpus statistics achieve wide coverage, but the semantic structure of a concept is only implicitly represented in the context.",
        "Assuming that two words are semantically closer if they occur in similar contexts, statistics on the contexts of words can be gathered and compared for similarity, by using a metric such as the Jaccard coefficient.",
        "Our proposal is to extend and fine-tune the latter approach with the training data obtained from the former.",
        "We apply metric learning to this task.",
        "Although still in their infancy, distance metric learning methods have undergone rapid development in the field of machine learning.",
        "In a setting similar to semi-supervised clustering, where known instances of similar or dissimilar objects are given, a metric such as the Mahalanobis distance can be learned from a few data points and tailored to fit a particular purpose.",
        "Although classification methods such as logistic regression now play important roles in natural language processing, the use of metric learning has yet to be explored.",
        "Since popular current methods for synonym acquisition require no statistical learning, it seems that supervised machine learning should easily outperform them.",
        "Unfortunately, there are obstacles to overcome.",
        "Since metric learning algorithms usually learn the parameters of a Mahalanobis distance, the number of parameters is quadratic to the number of features.",
        "They learn how two features should interact to produce the final metric.",
        "While traditional metrics forgo examining of the interactions entirely, in applying metrics such as Jaccard coefficient, it is not uncommon nowadays to use more than 10,000 features, a number that a typical metric learner is incapable of processing.",
        "Thus we have two options: one is to find the most important features and model the interactions between them, and the other is simply to use a large number of features.",
        "We experimentally examined the two options and found that metric learning is useful in synonym acquisition, despite it utilizing fewer features than traditional methods.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: in section 2, we review prior work on synonym acquisition and metric learning.",
        "In section 3, we introduce the Mahalanobis distance metric and a learning algorithm based on this metric.",
        "In section 4 and 5, we explain the experimental settings and propose the use of normalization to make the Mahalanobis distances work in practice, and then in section 6, we discuss issues we encountered when applying this metric to synonym acquisition.",

        "Various methods (Hin-dle, 1990; Lin, 1998) of automatically acquiring synonyms have been proposed.",
        "They are usually based on the distributional hypothesis (Harris, 1985), which states that semantically similar words share similar contexts, and they can be roughly viewed as the combinations of two steps: context extraction and similarity calculation.",
        "The former extracts useful features from the contexts of words, such as surrounding words or dependency structure.",
        "The latter calculates how semantically similar two given words are based on similarity or distance metrics.",
        "Many studies (Lee, 1999; Curran and Moens, 2002; Weeds et al., 2004) have investigated similarity calculation, and a variety of distance/similarity measures have already been compared and discussed.",
        "Weeds et al.",
        "'s work is especially useful because it investigated the characteristics of metrics based on a few criteria such as the relative frequency of acquired synonyms and clarified the correlation between word frequency, distributional generality, and semantic generality.",
        "However, all of the existing research conducted only a posteriori comparison, and as Weeds et al.",
        "pointed out, there is no one best measure for all applications.",
        "Therefore, the metrics must be tailored to applications, even to corpora and other settings.",
        "We next review the prior work in generic metric learning.",
        "Most previous metric learning methods learn the parameters of the Mahalanobis distance.",
        "Although the algorithms proposed in earlier work (Xing et al., 2002; Weinberger et al., 2005; Glober-son and Roweis, 2005) were shown to yield excellent classification performance, these algorithms all have worse than cubic computational complexity in the dimensionality of the data.",
        "Because of the high dimensionality of our objects, we opted for information-theoretic metric learning proposed by (Davis et al., 2007).",
        "This algorithm only uses an operation quadratic in the dimensionality of the data.",
        "Other work on learning Mahalanobis metrics includes online metric learning (Shalev-Shwartz et al., 2004), locally-adaptive discriminative methods (Hastie and Tibshirani, 1996), and learning from relative comparisons (Schutz and Joahims, 2003).",
        "Non-Mahalanobis-based metric learning methods have also been proposed, though they seem to suffer from suboptimal performance, non-convexity, or computational complexity.",

        "Given points Xi,Xj G Rd, the (squared) Mahalanobis distance between them is parameterized by a positive definite matrix A as follows d,A(xi,Xj) = (xi – Xj)TA(xi – Xj).",
        "The Mahalanobis distance is a straightforward extension of the standard Euclidean distance.",
        "If we let A be the identity matrix, the Mahalanobis distance reduces to the Euclidean distance.",
        "Our objective is to obtain the positive definite matrix A that parameterizes the Mahalanobis distance, so that the distance between the vectors of two synonymous words is small, and the distance between the vectors of two dissimilar words is large.",
        "Stated more formally, the Mahalanobis distance between two similar points must be smaller than a given upper bound, i.e., d,A(xi,Xj) < u for a relatively small value of u.",
        "Similarly, two points are dissimilar if d,A(xi,Xj) > I for sufficiently large I.",
        "As we discuss below, we were able to use the Euclidean distance to acquire synonyms quite well.",
        "Therefore, we would like the positive definite matrix A of the Mahalanobis distance to be close to the identity matrix I.",
        "This keeps the Mahalanobis distance similar to the Euclidean distance, which would help to prevent overfitting the data.",
        "To optimize the matrix, we follow the information theoretic metric learning approach described in (Davis et al., 2007).",
        "We summarize the problem formulation advocated by this approach in this section and the learning algorithm in the next section.",
        "To define the closeness between A and I, we use a simple bijection (up to a scaling function) from the set of Mahalanobis distances to the set of equal mean multivariate Gaussian distributions.",
        "Without loss of generalization, let the equal mean be [i.",
        "Then given a Mahalanobis distance parameterized by A, the corresponding Gaussian is p(x;A) = ^ exP( – \\<Ia{x, h)) where Z is the normalizing factor.",

        "The tradeoff between satisfying the constraints and minimizing Did(A, I) is controlled by the parameter 7.",
        "To solve this optimization problem, the algorithm shown in Algorithm 3.1 repeatedly projects the current solution onto a single constraint.",
