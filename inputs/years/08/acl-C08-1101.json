        "Several individual opinions are expressed in this passage.",
        "The first is a negative opinion about the design being too edgy and box-like, the next is a positive opinion toward a hand-held design, followed by a negative opinion toward a computery shape, and so on.",
        "While recognizing individual expressions of opinions and their properties is important, discourse interpretation is needed as well.",
        "This research was supported in part by the Department of Homeland Security under grant N000140710152.",
        "It is by understanding the passage as a discourse that we see edgy, like a box, computery, and many buttons as descriptions of the type of design D does not prefer, and hand-held, organic shape, and simple designs as descriptions of the type he does.",
        "These descriptions are not in general synonyms/antonyms of one another; for example, there are hand-held \"computery\" devices and simple designs that are edgy.",
        "The unison/opposition among the descriptions is due to how they are used in the discourse.",
        "This paper focuses on such relations between the targets of opinions in discourse.",
        "Specifically, in this work, we propose a scheme of opinion frames, which consist of two opinions that are related by virtue of having united or opposed targets.",
        "We argue that recognizing opinion frames will provide more opinion information for NLP applications than recognizing individual opinions alone.",
        "Further, if there is uncertainty about any one of the components, we believe opinion frames are an effective representation incorporating discourse information to make an overall coherent interpretation (Hobbs et al., 1993).",
        "Finally, we also report the first results of experiments in recognizing the presence of these opinion frames.",
        "We introduce our data in Section 2, present opinion frames in Section 3 and illustrate their utility in Section 4.",

        "In this section, we lay out definitions relating to opinion frames, illustrate with examples how these are manifested in our data, and consider them in the context of discourse relations.",
        "The components of opinion frames are individual opinions and the relationships between their targets.",
        "Following (Wilson and Wiebe, 2005; So-masundaran et al., 2007), we address two types of opinions, sentiment and arguing.",
        "Sentiment includes positive and negative evaluations, emotions, and judgments.",
        "Arguing includes arguing for or against something, and arguing that something should or should not be done.",
        "Opinions have a polarity that can be positive or negative.",
        "The target of an opinion is the entity or proposition that the opinion is about.",
        "We establish relations between targets, in the process relating their respective opinions.",
        "We address two types of relations, same and alternative.",
        "The same relation holds between targets that refer to the same entity, property, or proposition.",
        "Observing the relations marked by annotators, we found that same covers not only identity, but also part-whole, synonymy, generalization, specialization, entity-attribute, instantiation, cause-effect, epithets and implicit background topic, i.e., relations that have been studied by many researchers in the context ofanaphora and co-reference (e.g. (Clark, 1975; Vieira and Poesame relations holding between entities often involve co-reference (where co-reference is broadly conceived to include relations such as part-whole listed above).",
        "However, there are no morpho-syntactic constraints on what targets may be.",
        "Thus, same relations may also hold between adjective phrases, verb phrases, and clauses.",
        "An instance of this is Example 1, where the same target relation holds between the adjectives edgy and computery.",

        "The alternative relation holds between targets that are related by virtue of being opposing (mutually exclusive) options in the context of the discourse.",
        "For example, in the domain of TV remote controls, the set of all shapes are alternatives to one another, since a remote control may have only one shape at a time.",
        "In such scenarios, a positive opinion regarding one choice may imply a negative opinion toward competing choices, and vice versa.",
        "Objects appear as alternatives via world and domain knowledge (for example, shapes of a remote); the context of the discourse (for example, Hillary Clinton and Barak Obama are alternatives in discussions of the primaries, but not in discussions of the general election); and the way the objects are juxtaposed while expressing opinions (for instance hand-held and computery in Example 1).",
        "While same and alternative are not the only possible relations between targets, they commonly occur in task-oriented dialogs such as those in the data we use.",
        "Now that we have all the ingredients, we can define opinion frames.",
        "An opinion frame is defined as a structure composed of two opinions and their respective targets connected via their target relations.",

        "Frame relations provide a mechanism to relate opinions expressed in non-local contexts - the opinion may occur elsewhere in the discourse, but will become relevant to a given target due to a relation between its target and the given target.",

        "The baseline that always guesses true (True) has 100% recall and the best f-measure among the baselines, but poor accuracy.",
        "We also constructed a baseline that guesses true/false over the test set based on the distribution in the training data (Distribution).",

        "Comparing it to the baseline which has comparable accuracy, namely Distribution, we see that our system improves in f-measure by 24 percentage points.",
        "Our results are encouraging - even using simple features to capture target relations achieves considerable improvement over the baselines.",
