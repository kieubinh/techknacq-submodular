        "The resolution of lexical ambiguities has long been considered an important part of the process of understanding natural language.",
        "Supervised approaches to Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) have been shown to perform better than unsupervised ones (Agirre and Edmonds, 2007) but require examples of ambiguous words used in context annotated with the appropriate sense (labeled examples).",
        "However these often prove difficult to obtain since manual sense annotation of text is a complex and time consuming process.",
        "In fact, Ng (1997) estimated that 16 person years of manual effort would be required to create enough labeled examples to train a wide-coverage WSD system.",
        "This limitation is commonly referred to as the data acquisition bottleneck.",
        "It is particularly acute in specific domains, such as biomedicine, where terms may have technical usages which only domain experts are likely to be aware of.",
        "For example, possible meanings of the term \"ganglion\" in UMLS (Humphreys etal., 1998) include 'neural structure' or 'benign mucinous tumour', although only the first meaning is listed in WordNet.",
        "These domain-specific semantic distinctions make manual sense annotation all the more difficult.",
        "One approach to the data acquisition bottleneck is to generate labeled training examples automatically.",
        "Others, such as Leacock et al.",

        "A variety of approaches to the data acquisition bottleneck have been proposed.",
        "One is to use unsupervised algorithms, which do not require labeled training data.",
        "Examples include Lesk (1986) who disambiguated ambiguous words by examining their dictionary definitions and selecting the sense whose definition overlapped most with definitions of words in the ambiguous word's context.",
        "Leroy and Rindfiesch (2005) presented an unsupervised approach to WSD in the biomedical domain using information derived from UMLS (Humphreys et al., 1998).",
        "However, results from SemEval (Agirre et al., 2007) and its predecessors have shown that supervised approaches to WSD generally outperform unsupervised ones.",
        "It has also been shown that results obtained from supervised methods improve with access to additional labeled data for training (Ng, 1997).",
        "Consequently various techniques for automatically generating training data have been developed.",
        "One approach makes use of the fact that different senses of ambiguous words often have different translations (e.g. Ng et al.",
        "(2003)).",
        "Parallel text is used as training data with the alternative translations serving as sense labels.",
        "However, disadvantages of this approach are that the alternative translations do not always correspond to the sense distinctions in the original language and parallel text is not always available.",
        "Another approach, developed by Leacock et al.",
        "(1998) and extended by Agirre and Martinez (2004b), is to examine a lexical resource, Word-Net in both cases, to identify unambiguous terms which are closely related to each of the senses of an ambiguous term.",
        "These \"monosemous relatives\" are used to as query terms for a search engine and the examples returned used as additional training data.",
        "In the biomedical domain, Humphrey et al.",
        "(2006) use journal descriptors to train models based on the terms which are likely to co-occur with each sense.",
        "Liu et al.",
        "(2002) used information in UMLS to disambiguate automatically retrieved examples which were then used as labeled training data.",
        "The meanings of 35 ambiguous abbreviations were identified by examining the closeness of concepts in the same abstract in UMLS.",
        "Widdows et al.",
        "(2003) employ a similar approach, although their method also makes use of parallel corpora when available.",
        "All of these approaches rely on the existence of an external resource (e.g. parallel text or a domain ontology).",

        "The aim of relevance feedback is to generate improved search queries based on manual analysis of a set of retrieved documents which has been shown to improve search precision (Salton, 1971; Robertson and Spark Jones, 1976).",
        "Variations of relevance feedback have been developed for a range of IR models including Vector Space and probabilistic models.",
        "The formulation of relevance feedback for the Vector Space Model is most pertinent to our approach.",
        "Given a collection of documents, C, containing a set of terms, Cterms, a basic premise of the Vector Space Model is that documents and queries can be represented by vectors whose dimensions represent the Cterms- Relevance feedback assumes that a retrieval system returns a set of documents, D, for some query, q.",
        "It is also assumed that a user has examined D and identified some of the documents as relevant to q and others as not relevant.",
        "Relevant documents are denoted by D+q and the irrelevant as D-q, where D+q C D, D-q C D and D+q n D_q = 0.",
        "This information is used to create a modified query, qm, which should be more accurate than q.",
        "A standard approach to constructing qm was described by Rocchio (1971):",
        "where the parameters a, [3 and 7 are set for particular applications.",
        "Rocchio (1971) set a to 1.",
        "Our scenario is similar to the relevance feedback problem since the sense tagged examples provide information about the documents in which a particular meaning of an ambiguous term is likely to be found.",
        "By identifying the features which distinguish the documents containing one sense from the others we can create queries which can then be used to retrieve further examples of the ambiguous words used in the same sense.",
        "However, unlike the relevance feedback scenario there is no original query to modify.",
        "Consequently we start with a query containing just the ambiguous term and use relevance feedback to generate queries which aim to retrieve documents where that term is being used in a particular sense.",
        "The remainder of this section describes how this approach is applied in more detail.",
        "The first stage of our process is to analyse the labeled examples and identify good search terms.",
        "For each sense of an ambiguous term, s, the labeled examples are divided into two sets: those annotated with the sense in question and the remainder (annotated with another sense).",
        "In relevance feedback terminology the documents annotated with the sense in question are considered to be relevant and the remainder irrelevant.",
        "These examples are denoted by D+s and D_s respectively.",
        "At its core relevance feedback, as outlined above, aims to discover how accurately each term in the collection discriminates between relevant and irrelevant documents.",
        "This approach was used to inspire a technique for identifying terms which are likely to indicate the sense in which an ambiguous word is being used.",
        "We compute a single score for each term, reflecting its indicativeness of that sense, using the formula in equation 2, where count(t, d) is the number of times term t occurs in document d and idf(t) is the inverse document frequency term weighting function commonly used in IR.",
        "We compute idf as follows:",
        "where D is the set of all annotated examples (i.e. D = D+s n D-s) and df(t) the number of documents in C which contain t.",
        "In our experiments the a and [3 parameters in equation 2 are set to 1.",
        "Documents are lemma-tised and stopwords removed before computing relevance scores.",
        "!Our computation of idf(t) is based on only information from the labeled examples, i.e. we assume C = D+s n D-s. Alternatively idf could be computed over a larger corpus of labeled and unlabeled examples.",
        "Table 1 shows the ten terms with the highest relevance score for two senses of the term \"culture\" in UMLS: 'laboratory culture' (\"In peripheral blood mononuclear cell culture streptococcal erythrogenic toxins are able to stimulate tryptophan degradation in humans\") and 'anthropological culture' (\"The aim of this paper is to describe the origins, initial steps and strategy, current progress and main accomplishments of introducing a quality management culture within the healthcare system in Poland.",
        "\").",
        "Unlike the traditional formulation of relevance feedback there is no initial query.",
        "To create a query designed to retrieve examples of each sense we simply combine the ambiguous term and the n terms with the highest relevance scores.",
        "We found that using the three highest ranked terms provided good results.",
        "So, for example, the queries generated for the two senses of culture shown in Table 1 would be \"culture cultural recommendation force\" and \"culture suggest protein presence\".",
        "The next stage is to collect a set of examples using the generated queries.",
        "We use the Entrez retrieval system (http: / /www.",
        "ncbi .",
        "nlm.",
        "nih.",
        "gov/ sites/gquery) which provides an online interface for carrying out boolean queries over the PubMed database of biomedical journal abstracts.",
        "Agirre and Martinez (2004b) showed that it is important to preserve the bias of the original corpus when automatically retrieving examples and consequently the number retrieved for each sense is kept in proportion to the original corpus.",
        "For example, if our existing labeled examples contain 75 usages of 'culture' in the 'laboratoy culture' sense and 25 meaning 'anthropological culture' we would ensure that 75% of the examples returned would refer to the first sense and 25% to the second.",

        "However, if too many terms are included Entrez may not return any abstracts.",
        "To ensure that a sufficient number of abstracts are returned we implemented a process of query relaxation which begins by querying Entrez with the most specific query for set of terms.",
        "If that query matches enough abstracts these are retrieved and the search for labeled examples for the relevant sense considered complete.",
        "However, if that query does not match enough abstracts it is relaxed and Entrez queried again.",
        "This process is repeated until enough examples can be retrieved for a particular sense.",
        "The process of relaxing queries is carried out as follows.",
        "Assume we have an ambiguous term, a, and a set of terms T identified using the process in Section 3.1.",
        "The first, most specific query, is formed from the conjunction of all terms in a U T, i.e. \"a and h AND t2 AND ... t\\T\".",
        "This is referred to as the level |T| query.",
        "If this query does not return enough abstracts the more relaxed level |T| – 1 query is formed.",
        "This query returns documents which include the ambiguous word and all but one of the terms in T: \"a AND ((ti AND t2 AND ... AND tn-i) OR (ti AND t2 AND ... tn-2 AND tn) OR ... OR \\t2 AND U ••• AND tn ))\".",
        "Similarly, level \\T\\ – 2 queries return documents containing the ambiguous term and all but two of the terms in T. Level 1 queries, the most relaxed, return documents containing the ambiguous term and one of the terms in T. We do not use just the ambiguous term as the query since this does not contain any information which could discriminate between the possible meanings.",
        "Figure 1 shows the queries which are formed for the ambiguous term \"culture\" and the three most salient terms identified for the 'anthropological culture' sense.",
        "The \"matches\" column lists the number of PubMed abstracts the query matches.",
        "It can be seen that there are no matches for the level 3 query and 83 for the more relaxed level 2 query.",
        "For this sense, abstracts returned by the level 2 query would be used if 83 or fewer examples were required, otherwise abstracts returned by the level 1 query would be used.",
        "Note that the queries submitted to Entrez are restricted so the terms only match against the title and abstract of the PubMed articles.",
