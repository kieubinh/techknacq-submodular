        "(2002), Turney (2002)), we are interested in fine-grained subjectivity analysis, which is concerned with subjectivity at the phrase or clause level.",
        "We expect fine-grained subjectivity analysis to be useful for question-answering, summarization, information extraction and search engine support for queries of the form \"How/what does entity X feel/think about topic Y?",
        "\", for which document-level opinion analysis methods can be problematic.",
        "Fine-grained subjectivity analyses typically identify subjective expressions in context, characterize their polarity (e.g. positive, neutral or negative) and intensity (e.g. weak, medium, strong, extreme), and identify the associated source, or opinion holder, as well as the topic, or target, of the opinion.",
        "While substantial progress has been made in automating some of these tasks, opinion topic identification has received by far the least attention due to both the difficulty of the task and the lack of appropriately annotated resources.",
        "This paper addresses the problem of topic identification for fine-grained opinion analysis of general text.",
        "We begin by providing a new, operational definition of opinion topic in which the topic of an opinion depends on the context in which its associated opinion expression occurs.",
        "We also present a novel method for general-purpose opinion topic identification that, following our new definition, treats the problem as an exercise in topic coreference resolution.",
        "We evaluate the approach using the existing MPQA corpus (Wiebe et al., 2005), which we extend with manual annotations that encode topic information (and refer to hereafter as the mpqatopic corpus).",
        "Inter-annotator agreement results for the manual annotations are reasonably strong across a number of metrics and the results of experiments that evaluate our topic identification method in the context of fine-grained opinion analysis are promising:",
        "using either automatically or manually identified topic spans, we achieve topic coreference scores that statistically significantly outperform two topic segmentation baselines across three coreference resolution evaluation measures (B, a and CEAF).",
        "For the B metric, for example, the best baseline achieves a topic coreference score on the mpqatopic corpus of 0.55 while our topic coreference algorithm scores 0.57 and 0.71 using automatically, and manually, identified topic spans, respectively.",
        "In the remainder of the paper, we define opinion topics (Section 2), present related work (Section 3), and motivate and describe the key idea of topic coreference that underlies our methodology for both the manual and automatic annotation of opinion topics (Section 4).",

        "(2004), Breck et al.",
        "(2007)), the assignment of polarity to these expressions (e.g. Wilson et al.",

        "(2004), Choi et al.",
        "(2005)), and identification of the source-expresses-opinion relation (e.g. Choi et al.",
        "(2006)), i.e. linking sources to the opinions that they express.",
        "Not surprisingly, progress has been driven by the creation of language resources.",
        "In this regard, Wiebe et al.",
        "'s (2005) opinion annotation scheme for subjective expressions was used to create the MPQA corpus, which consists of 535 documents manually annotated for phrase-level expressions of opinions, their sources, polarities, and intensities.",
        "Although other opinion corpora exist (e.g. Bethard et al.",
        "(2004), Voorhees and Buckland (2003), the product review corpora of Liu), we are not aware of any corpus that rivals the scale and depth of the MPQA corpus.",
        "In the related area of opinion extraction from product reviews, several research efforts have focused on the extraction of the topic of the opinion (e.g. Kobayashi et al.",
        "(2004), Yi et al.",
        "(2003),",
        "Popescu and Etzioni (2005), Hu and Liu (2004)).",
        "For this specialized text genre, it has been sufficient to limit the notion of topic to mentions of product names and components and their attributes.",
        "Thus, topic extraction has been effectively substituted with a lexicon lookup and techniques have focused on how to learn or acquire an appropriate lexicon for the task.",
        "While the techniques have been very successful for this genre of text, they have not been applied outside the product reviews domain.",
        "Further, there are analyses (Wiebe et al., 2005) and experiments (Wilson et al., 2005) that indicate that lexicon-lookup approaches to subjectivity analysis will have limited success on general texts.",
        "Outside the product review domain, there has been little effort devoted to opinion topic annotation.",
        "The MPQA corpus, for example, was originally intended to include topic annotations, but the task was abandoned after confirming that it was very difficult (Wiebe, 2005; Wilson, 2005), although target span annotation is currently underway.",
        "While useful, target spans alone will be insufficient for many applications: they neither contain information indicating which opinions are about the same topic, nor provide a concise textual representation of the topics.",
        "Due to the lack of appropriately annotated corpora, the problem of opinion topic extraction has been largely unexplored in NLP A notable exception is the work of Kim and Hovy (2006).",
        "They propose a model that extracts opinion topics for subjective expressions signaled by verbs and adjectives.",
        "Their model relies on semantic frames and extracts as the topic the syntactic constituent at a specific argument position for the given verb or adjective.",
        "In other words, Kim and Hovy extract what we refer to as the target spans, and do so for a subset of the opinion-bearing words in the text.",
        "Although on many occasions target spans coincide with opinion topics (as in Example 1), we have observed that on many other occasions this is not the case (as in Example 2).",
        "Furthermore, hampered by the lack of resources with manually annotated targets, Kim and Hovy could provide only a limited evaluation.",
        "As we have defined it, opinion topic identification bears some resemblance to topic segmentation, the goal of which is to partition a text into a linear sequence of topically coherent segments.",
        "Existing methods for topic segmentation typically assume that fragments of text (e.g. sentences or sequences of words of a fixed length) with similar lexical distribution are about the same topic; the goal of these methods is to find the boundaries where the lexical distribution changes (e.g. Choi (2000), Malioutov and Barzilay (2006)).",
        "Opinion topic identification differs from topic segmentation in that opinion topics are not necessarily spatially coherent â€“ there may be two opinions in the same sentence on different topics, as well as opinions that are on the same topic separated by opinions that do not share that topic.",
        "Nevertheless, we will compare our topic identification approach to a state-of-the-art topic segmentation algorithm (Choi, 2000) in the evaluation.",
        "Other work has successfully adopted the use of clustering to discover entity relations by identifying entities that appear in the same sentence and clustering the intervening context (e.g. Hasegawa et al.",
        "(2004), Rosenfeld and Feldman (2007)).",
        "This work, however, considers named entities and heads of proper noun phrases rather than topic spans, and the relations learned are those commonly held between NPs (e.g. senator-of-state, city-of-state, chairman-of-organization) rather than a more general coreference relation."

        "The score that we observed for the overall agreement was an a of .547, which is below the generally accepted level, while a for the two subsets of sentiment-bearing opinions is above .72.",
        "However, as discussed above, due to the way that it is adapted to the problem of coreference resolution, the a score loses its probabilistic interpretation.",
        "For example, the a score requires that a pairwise distance function between clusters is specified.",
        "We used one sensible choice for such a function (we measured the distance between clusters A and B as dist{A, B) = (2*\\AnB\\)/(\\A\\ + \\B\\)), but other sensible choices for the distance lead to much higher scores.",
        "Furthermore, we observed that the behavior of the a score can be rather erratic â€“ small changes in one of the clusterings can lead to big differences in the score.",
        "Perhaps a better indicator of the reliability of the coreference annotation is a comparison with the baselines, shown in the top half of Table 2.",
        "All baselines score significantly lower than the inter-annotator agreement scores.",
        "With one exception, the inter-annotator agreement scores are also higher than those for the learning-based approach (results shown in the lower half of Table 2), as would typically be expected.",
        "The exception is the classifier that uses the manual topic spans, but as we argued earlier these spans carry significant information about the decision of the annotator.",
        "Results for the four baselines are shown in the first four rows of Table 2.",
        "As expected, the two baselines performing topic segmentation show substantially better scores than the two \"default\" baselines.",
        "Results for the learning-based approaches are shown in the bottom half of Table 2.",
        "First, we see that each of the learning-based methods outperforms the baselines.",
        "This is the case even when sentences are employed as a coarse substitute for the true topic span.",
        "A Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test shows that differences from the baselines for the learning-based runs are statistically significant for the B and a measures (p < 0.01); for CEAF, using sentences as topic spans for the learning algorithm outperforms the same paragraph baseline (p < 0.05), but the results are inconclusive when compared with the system of choi.",
