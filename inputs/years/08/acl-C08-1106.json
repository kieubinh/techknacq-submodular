        "As the representative problem in shallow parsing, noun phrase chunking has received much attention, with the development of standard evaluation datasets and with",
        "extensive comparisons among methods (McDonald 2005; Sha & Pereira 2003; Kudo & Matsumoto 2001).",
        "Syntactic contexts often have a complex underlying structure.",
        "Chunk labels are usually far too general to fully encapsulate the syntactic behavior of word sequences.",
        "In practice, and given the limited data, the relationship between specific words and their syntactic contexts may be best modeled at a level finer than chunk tags but coarser than lexical identities.",
        "For example, in the noun phrase (NP) chunking task, suppose that there are two lexical sequences, \"He is her -\" and \"He gave her - \".",
        "The observed sequences, \"He is her\" and \"He gave her\", would both be conventionally labeled by 'BOB', where B signifies the 'beginning NP', and 0 the 'outside NP'.",
        "However, this labeling may be too general to encapsulate their respective syntactic dynamics.",
        "In actuality, they have different latent-structures, crucial in labeling the next word.",
        "For \"He is her -\", the NP started by 'her' is still incomplete, so the label for - is likely to be I, which conveys the continuation of the phrase, e.g., \"[He] is [her brother]\".",
        "In contrast, for \"He gave her-\", the phrase started by 'her' is normally self-complete, and makes the next label more likely to be B, e.g., \"[He] gave [her] [flowers]\".",
        "In other words, latent-dynamics is an intermediate representation between input features and labels, and explicitly modeling this can simplify the problem.",
        "In particular, in many real-world cases, when the part-of-speech tags are not available, the modeling on latent-dynamics would be particularly important.",

        "As shown in Table 4, the accuracy rate for individual labeling decisions is overoptimistic as a measure for shallow parsing.",
        "Nevertheless, since testing the significance of shallow parsers' F-measures is tricky, individual labeling accuracy provides a more convenient basis for statistical significance tests (Sha & Pereira 2003).",
        "One such test is the McNemar test on paired observations (Gillick & Cox 1989).",
        "As shown in Table 5, for the LDCRF model, the BLP inference schema is statistically more accurate than the BHP inference schema.",
        "Also, Evaluations show that the McNe-mar's value on labeling disagreement between the LDCRF-BLP and CRF models is 5e-13, suggesting that LDCRF-BLP is significantly more accurate than CRFs.",
        "On the other hand, the accuracy rate of BMP inference is a special case.",
        "Since the BMP inference is essentially an accuracy-first inference schema, the accuracy rate and the F-measure have a different relation in BMP.",
        "As we can see, the individual labeling accuracy achieved by the LDCRF-BMP model is as high as 97.26%, but its F-measure is still lower than LDCRF-BLP.",
        "It would be interesting to compare the convergence speed between the objective loss function of LDCRFs and CRFs.",
        "We apply the L-BFGS optimization algorithm to optimize the loss function of LDCRF and CRF models, making a comparison between them.",
        "We find that the iterations required for the convergence of LDCRFs is less than for CRFs (see Figure 2).",
        "Normally, the LDCRF model arrives at the plateau of convergence in 120-150 iterations, while CRFs require 210-240 iterations.",
