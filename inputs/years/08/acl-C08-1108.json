        "In recent years, there has been a growing interest in temporal information extraction, as more and more operational natural language processing (NLP) systems demand dealing with time-related issues in natural language texts.",

        "(2006), Chambers et al.",
        "(2007), and the TempEval 2007 participants (Verhagen et al., 2007).",
        "For a given ordered pair of elements (xi,x2), where x\\ and x2 are events or times, temporal relation resolution is the task of automatic identification of the relation r% G TempRel that temporally links x\\ and x2- For example, given the statement Mr. Antar was chargedei37 last montht23T in a civil suitei3S filedei40 in federal court in Newark by the Securities and Exchange Commission (wsj.0778) and the pairs (ei.37, Â£137), (ei37, ei38), and (e\\ss, euo), the task is to automatically label the given pairs with the isJncluded, isJncluded, and simultaneous relations, respectively.",
        "We note that the granularity of the temporal relations {TempRel) varies from TimeML's 14 relations to TempEval's three coarse-grain relations.",
        "While machine learning approaches attempt to improve classification accuracy through feature engineering, Mani et al. (2006) introduced a temporal reasoning component to greatly expand the training data.",
        "By computing the temporal closure of the training data relations, they increased the training set by a factor of 10.",
        "They reported encouraging accuracy of classification on event-event and event-time relations.",
        "According to their experiments, the event-event relation accuracy goes from 62.5% to 94.95% and the event-time relation accuracy ranges from 73.68% to 90.16%.",
        "Recently, extensions of Mani et al. (2006)'s research is briefly described in (Mani et al., 2007).",
        "This technical report addresses two problems found in (Mani et al., 2006): (1) feature vector duplication caused by the data normalization process (once fixed, the accuracy drops to 76.56% and 83.23%) and (2) a somewhat unrealistic evaluation scheme (we describe Mani et al. (2007)'s results in Section 4.1).",
        "TempEval 2007 is the first standard evaluation arena that consists of three temporal relation classification tasks (Verhagen et al., 2007).",
        "The participants reported F-measure scores ranging from 42% to 55% for event-event relations, and 73% to 80% for event-time relations.",

        "the results reported in (Mani et al., 2007) cannot be directly compared with those of TempEval 2007 participants.",
        "Among others, the three major differences are:",
        "1. significantly different training and testing data.",
        "Although the datasets used TimeBank 1.2 (Pustejovsky et al., 2003), Mani et al. (2007) added the AQUAINT Corpus (www.timeml.org) to their experimental data;",
        "2. different sets of temporal relations.",
        "Mani et al. (2006; 2007) target six normalized relations (before, immediately before (ibefore), includes, ends, begins and simultaneous).",
        "In TempEval 2007, a set of three coarse-grain temporal relations was used (before, after, and overlap).",
        "3. different relation scope.",
        "In (Mani et al., 2006; Mani et al., 2007), event-event temporal relations are discourse-wide, i.e. any pair of events can be temporally linked.",
        "For TempEval 2007, the event-event relations are restricted to events within two consecutive sentences.",
        "These two modeling frameworks for solving the problem of temporal relation classification produce highly dissimilar results.",
        "With this in mind, we are interested in two issues in this paper: (1) How might temporal reasoning assist in temporal relation identification?",
        "(2) What other features might be used to improve the performance ofclas-sification?",
        "As a byproduct of our exploration to these two questions, we hope to find some insights on why the same problem explored under different environment produces highly divergent results.",
        "In this paper, we investigate several interactions between temporal reasoning and a machine learning approach for temporal ordering of events in natural language texts.",
        "We continue by describing the data used for our experiments.",
        "In Section 3, we briefly describe the set of features we currently use to build Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Chang and Lin, 2001) and Maximum Entropy (ME) models for temporal relation resolution.",
        "The three interactions we envision between temporal reasoning and the learned models are presented in Section 4.",

        "For example, if before(e\\, DocDate) and a/ier(e2, DocDate) are true, then before{e\\^2).",
        "There may be two reasons for the low impact of this feature: (1) an accurate computation of the temporal relation between an event and the Document Date is not easy, as demonstrated in TempEval 2007 and (2) if two events have the same relation with the Document Date, there is no way to determine the event-event relation.",

        "Therefore, for the following tasks, the text T is a TimeBank 1.2 document and the set of axioms Bk used by the prover contains 94 temporal axioms which link each temporal relation with its inverse (R~(x,y) <-> R(y,x), for example before(x, y) â > after(y, x)) and define the temporal relation resulting from the combination of two relations (Ri(x,y) A R2(y,z) â > Rs(x,z), for example, before(x, y) A before(y, z) â > before(x, z)).",

        "In this paper, we briefly described our feature engineering efforts for temporal relation resolution and we analyzed three methods that exploit temporal reasoning and, more specifically, the closure of temporal relations, for the purpose of improving the performance of machine learned classifiers of temporal relations between events in text.",
        "Based on our experiments, we find that feature engineering helps improve the classification problem, when compared with several baseline performances.",
        "However, given our current NLP capabilities, it is clear that we are faced with the performance bottleneck problem (accuracy below 60%).",
        "Any attempt to derive more advanced features demands more sophisticated methodologies of modeling temporal expressions, events and their relationships as well as advanced discourse understanding capabilities.",
        "For instance, the temporal duration or the start/end time points of events are highly useful for learning temporal relations.",
        "But, this introduces an even more challenging problem.",
        "In terms of the utility of temporal reasoning in classifying temporal relation, the idea of using temporal reasoning to boost training data is certainly sound.",
        "But in order for the boosted training data to really take effect, more advanced features need to be investigated.",
        "Certainly, the process of dividing the data into training and testing has its impact on the system's performance and we are faced with the data sparseness problem.",
        "Temporal inconsistencies in our automatically labeled test dataset occurred in just a few test documents and the resolution process did not impact the system's performance.",
        "Improvements are needed in the process of selection of the to-be-replaced relations.",
        "Temporal data alignment largely depends on the function used to score the temporal closures and we plan to analyze the temporal closure of the training data and to explore other scoring functions.",
