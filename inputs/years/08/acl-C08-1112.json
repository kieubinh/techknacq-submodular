        "Many broad-coverage statistical parsers to date are constituency-based with a Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (PCFG) or a Stochastic Tree Substitution Grammar (STSG) at their backbone.",
        "The majority of such models belong to a Head-Driven paradigm, in which a head constituent is generated first, providing a positional anchor for subsequent (e.g., Markovian) sisters' generation.",
        "Constituency-based models, lexicalized and un-lexicalized alike, demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for parsing English (Charniak, 1997; Collins, 2003; Klein and Manning, 2003; Bod, 2003), yet a direct application of such models to parsing less configurational languages often fails to yield comparable results.",
        "The parameters of such parsers capture generalizations that are easily stated in structural terms (e.g., subjects linearly precede predicates, VPs dominate objects, etc.)",
        "which may not be adequate for parsing languages with less configurational character.",
        "A different vein of research explores data-driven dependency-based parsing methods (e.g., (McDonald et al., 2005)) which seem to be intuitively more adequate for the task.",
        "It turns out, however, that even such models fail to provide the desired remedy.",
        "Recent reports by (Nivre, 2007) delineated a class of richly-inflected languages with relatively free word-order (including Greek, Basque, and Modern Standard Arabic) for which the parsers performed poorly, regardless of the parsing method used.",
        "The need for parsing methods that can effectively cope with such phenomena doesn't seem to have been eliminated by dependency parsing â€“ perhaps quite the contrary.",
        "The essential argument we promote here is that in order to deal with the kind of variation that is empirically observed cross-linguistically an alternative view of the generation process is required.",
        "Our Relational-Realizational parsing proposal, strongly inspired by Relational Grammar (Perlmutter, 1982), takes grammatical relations such as 'Subject' and 'Predicate' as central, primitive notions of the syntactic representation, and retains a distinction between the projection of such relations and the means by which they are realized.",
        "The grammar we develop here, formally represented as a PCFG, articulates two alternating generation phases: a Relational phase, in which a clause-level category projects a monostratal Relational Network (RN) representation for the clause, and a Realizational phase, in which the projected relations are realized in a certain surface configuration.",
        "Paradigmatic morphosyntactic representations are constructed for all non-terminal nodes, allowing for morphosyntactic interaction at various levels of the syntactic parse tree.",
        "We illustrate the application of our theoretical reconstruction to the representation of clause-level categories in Modern Hebrew (MH) and their interaction with a handful of morphological features.",
        "The treebank grammar resulting from our application yields 13% error reduction relative to a treebank PCFG which uses the same information in the form of state-splits, and our best result shows a 7% error reduction over the best parsing results for MH so far.",

      "text": [
        "Recent decades have seen a surge of interest in statistical models using a body of annotated text for learning the distributions of grammatically meaningful structures, in order to assign the most likely ones to unseen sentences.",
        "Probabilistic Context Free Grammars (PCFGs) have become popular in the articulation of such models, and unlexicalized treebank grammars (or representational variations thereof) were shown to perform reasonably well on English benchmark corpora (Johnson, 1998; Klein and Manning, 2003).",
        "A major leap in the performance of PCFG-based statistical parsers has been introduced by the move towards a Head-Driven paradigm (Collins, 2003; Charniak, 1997), in which syntactic categories are enriched with head information percolated up the tree.",
        "The head-driven generation process allows one to model the relation between the information content of a constituent and the information content of its head-marked sister.",
        "At the same time, such models introduce a bias with respect to the positioning of a non-head constituent relative to its head-marked sister.",
        "The vast improvement in parsing results came about not without modeling costs, e.g., additional ad-hoc modifications for capturing complex structures such as conjunction.",
        "An inherent difficulty with the application of constituency-based parsing models is the implicit assumption that the relation between the position of a constituent and its grammatical function is fully predictable.",
        "For languages with relatively free word-order, this assumption often breaks down.",
        "Distinguishing, e.g., \"left\" and \"right\" distributions for constituents of the same 'sort' implicitly takes the position of a constituent to be a primitive syntactic notion, and their grammatical function to be a secondary, derived one.",
        "Theoretical accounts show that this may be insufficient (Perlmutter, 1982).",
        "A subsequent difficulty with the head-driven paradigm, also shared by dependency-based parsing methods, is the stipulation that all grammatically relevant properties of a phrase are recovered from a single head.",
        "In fact, it is typologically established that grammatically meaningful properties of a constituent may jointly emerge from different surface forms dominated by it (co-heads or multiple exponence (Zwicky, 1993; Blevins, 2008)).",
        "The task we undertake here is to suggest a statistical generative parsing method which is linguistically plausible as well as technologically viable for parsing languages with relatively free wordorder and variable means of realization.",
        "In what follows we remain within the computationally efficient framework of PCFGs, and propose a variation that draws on insights from syntactic and morphological theories that have been explored cross-linguistically."

        "Relational Grammars (RGs) were introduced in the early 80's when attempts to ind a universal definition for notions such as a 'Subject' in terms of various \"behavioral properties\" seemed to have failed (Perlmutter, 1982).",
        "The unsuccessful attempts to recover an adequate deinition of grammatical functions in structural terms led to a revival of a view in which grammatical relations such as 'Subject' and 'Object' are primitive notions by which syntactic structures are defined (Postal and Perlmutter, 1977).",
        "This view proved useful for descriptive purposes, influencing the design of formalisms such as Arc-Pair grammars (Postal, 1982) and LFG (Bresnan, 1979).",
        "The two main primitive elements used in RGs are (a) a set of nodes representing linguistic elements (which we refer to using upper case letters), and (b) a set of names of grammatical relations (which we refer to as gr\\...grn).",
        "RGs represent the fact that a linguistic element bears a certain relation to another element using a structure called an Arc', represented as [gri(A, B)\\.",
        "Arcs are represented as arrows, with A the head of the Arc and B its tail, and a Relational Network (RN) is defined to be a set of Arcs that share a single head.",
        "Now, a few theoretical observations are due.",
        "Firstly, the essential difference between RGs and dependency-based grammars is that RNs take the linguistic element at the head of a network to be a clause-level category, not a particular surface form.",
        "The corresponding tails are then the various nominals bearing the different grammatical relations to the clause (including a 'Predicate', a 'Subject', an 'Object', etc.).",
        "In addition, RNs abstract away from elements such as auxiliary verbs and particles which do not have their own arc representation.",
        "RGs also differ from phrase-structure grammars in that their RNs are unordered.",
        "Therefore, linear precedence need not play a role in stating generalizations.",
        "RGs differ from both constituency-and dependency-based formalisms in that they do not weigh heavily the 'single-head' assumption - RNs may delineate a whole chunk as bearing a certain grammatical relation to the clause.",
        "The set-theoretic notion of RNs in RGs abstracts away from surface phenomena crucial for generating phrase-structure trees.",
        "Thus, we next turn to modeling how grammatical relations are realized.",
        "Morphological phenomena such as suprasegmen-tation, interdigitation, reduplication, subtractive morphology, templatic morphology, and methathe-sis demonstrate that it is sometimes impossible to find a direct correspondence between a certain part of a word (a 'morpheme') and the function it has in altering the word's meaning (Anderson, 1992).",
        "Attempts to model such morphological phenomena brought forward the hypothesis that 'form' and 'function' need not stand in one-to-one correspondence, and that one is not necessarily immediately predicted by the other.",
        "This hypothesis is known as the \"Separation Hypothesis\" (Beard, 1988).",
        "The problem of modeling certain surface phenomena then boils down to modeling form and function correlations, bearing in mind that these may be quite complex.",
        "Bringing this general notion of separation into the syntactic derivation, we propose to view the position of a constituent in a phrase as its form and the articulated grammatical relation as its function.",
        "The task of learning the position of different constituents realizing the grammatical relations in an RN is now delegated to a statistical component.",
        "A set of parameters which we refer to as \"configuration\" determines the syntactic position in which each of the grammatical relations is to be realized.",
        "In order to connect the abstract RN representation with the constituents that syntactic parse trees are \"made of we propose to view the internal nodes of a tree as Morphosyntactic Paradigms.",
        "Our morphosyntactic representation for constituents, loosely inspired by (Anderson, 1992), is a structured representation of morphological and syntactic properties for an internal node in the parse tree.",
        "In our model, the morphological features associated with a syntactic constituent are percolated from its dominated surface forms, and we allow the specification of head (PoS tag) information and structural features such as vertical markovization.",
        "Given the grammatical relation an element bears to a clause, it is statistically feasible to learn the morphosyntactic paradigm by which it is realized."

        "This three-step process does not generate functional elements (such as auxiliary verbs and special-purpose particles) that are outside of constituents' RNs.",
        "We thus let the configuration stage place obligatory or optional \"realizational slots\" between the ordered elements (marked gri : grj), signalling periphrastic adpositions and/or modification.",

        "In figure (2), the configuration stage reserves a slot for an obligatory punctuation mark at the end of an affirmative sentence.",
        "It further reserves a slot for an optional adverbial modifier at a position commonly employed in MH for interjections.",
        "In the current framework, grammatical relations may be realized in a certain surface position via configuration, or using explicit morphological marking per grammatical relation independently of linear context.",

        "(Tsarfaty and Sima'an, 2007) examined the contribution of horizontal and vertical conditioning to an unlexicalized MH parser and concluded that head-driven Markovization performs below the level of vertical conditioning enriched with percolated features.",
        "We do not know of existing dependency-parsers applied to parsing MH or mildly-context-sensitive broad-coverage parsers applied to parsing a Semitic language.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fully generative probabilistic framework that models explicitly morpho-syntactic interaction to enhance parsing for non-configrational languages.",

        "We suggest that the Relational-Realizational (RR) approach is adequate for parsing languages characteristically different from English, and we illustrate it with an application to parsing MH.",
        "We show that our approach to modeling the interaction between syntactic categories and a handful of percolated features already yields a notable improvement in parsing accuracy and substantially improves the quality of suggested parses.",
