        "However it is quite common that the available annotations are partial or ambiguous in practical applications.",
        "For example, in domain adaptation situations, it is time-consuming to annotate all of the elements in a sentence.",
        "Rather, it is efficient to annotate certain parts of sentences which include domain-specific expressions.",
        "In Section 2.1, as an example of such efficient annotation, we will describe the effectiveness of partial annotations in the domain adaptation task for Japanese word segmentation (JWS).",
        "In addition, if the annotators are domain experts rather than linguists, they are unlikely to be confident about the annotation policies and may prefer to be allowed to defer some linguistically complex decisions.",
        "For many NLP tasks, it is sometimes difficult to decide which label is appropriate in a particular context.",
        "In Section 2.2, we show that such ambiguous annotations exist even in a widely used corpus, the Penn treebank (PTB) corpus.",
        "This motivated us to seek to incorporate such incomplete annotations into a state of the art machine learning technique.",
        "One of the recent advances in statistical NLP is Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001) that evaluate the global consistency of the complete structures for both parameter estimation and structure inference, instead of optimizing the local configurations independently.",
        "This feature is suited to many NLP tasks that include correlations between elements in the output structure, such as the interrelation of part-of-speech (POS) tags in a sentence.",
        "However, conventional CRF algorithms require fully annotated sentences.",
        "To incorporate incomplete annotations into CRFs, we extend the structured output problem in Section 3.",
        "We focus on partial annotations or ambiguous annotations in this paper.",
        "We also propose a parameter estimation method for CRFs using incompletely annotated corpora in Section 4.",
        "The proposed method marginalizes out the unknown labels so as to optimize the likelihood of a set of possible label structures which are consistent with given incomplete annotations.",
        "We conducted two types of experiments and observed promising results in both of them.",

        "In this section, we describe an example of an efficient annotation which assigns partial word boundaries for the JWS task.",
        "It is not trivial to detect word boundaries for non-segmented languages such as Japanese or Chinese.",
        "For example, the correct segmentation of the Japanese phrase \"ty V {$sJ¥i~ V fl\" (incised wound or abrasion) is shown by the lowest boxes segmented by the solid lines in Figure 1.",
        "However, there are several overlapping segmentation candidates, which are shown by the other boxes, and possible segmentation by the dashed lines.",
        "Thus, the decisions on the word segmentation require considering the context, so simple dictionary lookup approach is not appropriate.",
        "Therefore statistical methods have been successfully used for JWS tasks.",
        "Previous work (Kudo et al., 2004) showed CRFs outperform generative Markov models and discriminative history-based methods in JWS.",
        "In practice, a statistical word segment analyzer tends to perform worse for text from different domains, so that additional annotations for each target domain are required.",
        "A major cause of errors is the occurrence of unknown words.",
        "For example, if Y) fj§\" (abrasion) is an unknown word, the system may accept the word sequence of \"ty Y) (i^-f 9 fS\" as \"ty <9 ii\" (incised wound), \"^\"f *9 \" (file), and \"fH\" (injury) by mistake.",
        "On one hand, lists of new terms in the target domain are often available in the forms of technical term dictionaries, product name lists, or other sources.",
        "To utilize those domain word lists, Mori (2006) proposed a KWIC (KeyWord In Context) style annotation user interface (UI) with which a user can delimit a word in a context with a single user action.",
        "In Figure 2, an annotator marks the occurrences of Y) fj§\", a word in the domain word",
        "Figure 2: An example of KWIC style annotation: marked lines are identified as a correct segmentation.",
        "list, if they are used as a real word in their context.",
        "The Y) fj§\" in the first row is a part of another word \"ZL'ir'Q fj§\" (scratch), and the annotator marks the last two rows as correctly segmented examples.",
        "This UI simplifies annotation operations for segmentation to yes/no decisions, and this simplification can also be effective for the reduction of the annotation effort for other NLP tasks.",
        "For example, the annotation operations for unlabeled dependency parsing can be simplified into a series of yes/no decisions as to whether or not given two words have syntactic dependency.",
        "Compared with sentence-wise annotation, the partial annotation is not only effective in terms of control operations, but also reduces annotation errors because it does not require annotating the word boundaries that an annotator is unsure of.",
        "This feature is crucial for annotations made by domain experts who are not linguists.",
        "We believe partial annotation is effective in creating corpora for many other structured annotations in the context of the domain adaptations.",
        "Ambiguous annotations in this paper refer to a set of candidate labels annotated for a part of a structured instance.",
        "For example, the following sentence from the PTB corpus includes an ambiguous annotation for the POS tag of \"pending\":",
        "That/DT suit/NN is/VBZ pending/VBG|JJ ./.",
        ", where words are paired with their part-of-speech tag by a forward slash (\"/\").",
        "Uncertainty concerning the proper POS tag of \"pending\" is represented by the disjunctive POS tag (\"VBG and JJ\") as indicated by a vertical bar.",
        "The existence of the ambiguous annotations is due to the task definition itself, the procedure manual for the annotators, or the inadequate knowledge of the annotators.",
        "Ideally, the annotations should be disambiguated by a skilled annotator for the training data.",
        "However, even the PTB corpus, whose annotation procedure is relatively well-defined, includes more than 100 sentences containing POS ambiguities such as those listed in Table 1.",
        "Although the number of ambiguous annotations is not considerably large in PTB corpus, corpora could include more ambiguous annotations when we try to build wider coverage corpora.",
        "Also, ambiguous annotations are more common in the tasks that deal with semantics, such as information extraction tasks so that learning algorithms must deal with ambiguous annotations.",

        "Under the first-order Markov assumption, two types of features are usually used: one is pairs of an observed variable and a label variable (denoted as f(xt,yt) '■ A x Y), the other is pairs of two label variables (denoted as g(yt-i,yt) '■ Y x Y) at time t. Then the feature vector can be decomposed as ${x,y) = Yn=i <t>(%t,yt-i,yt) where <f>(xt,yt-i,yt) = f(xt,yt) + g(vt-i,yt).",
        "In addition, let S and E be special label variables to encode the beginning and ending of a sequence, respectively.",
        "We define 4>(%t,yt-i,yt) to be 4>{xt, S, yt) at the head t = 1 and g(yt-i,E) at the tail where t = T + 1.",
