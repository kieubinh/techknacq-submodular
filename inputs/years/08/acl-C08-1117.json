        "Automatically acquiring semantics from text is a subject that has gathered a lot of attention for quite some time now.",
        "As Manning and Schütze (Manning and Schütze, 2000) point out, most work on acquiring semantic properties of words has focused on semantic similarity.",
        "Automatically acquiring a relative measure of how similar a word is to known words [...] is much easier than determining what the actual meaning is.'",
        "(Manning and Schütze, 2000, §8.5)",
        "Most work on semantic similarity relies on the distributional hypothesis (Harris, 1985).",
        "This hypothesis states that words that occur in similar contexts tend to be similar.",
        "With regard to the context used, two basic approaches exist.",
        "One approach makes use of'bag of words' co-occurrence data; in this approach, a certain window around a word is used for gathering co-occurrence information.",
        "The window may either be a fixed number of words, or the paragraph or document that a word appears in.",
        "Thus, words are considered similar if they appear in similar windows (documents).",
        "One of the dominant methods using this method is LATENT SEMANTIC ANALYSIS (LSA).",
        "The second approach uses a more fine grained distributional model, focusing on the syntactic relations that words appear with.",
        "Typically, a large text corpus is parsed, and dependency triples are extracted.",
        "Words are considered similar if they appear with similar syntactic relations.",
        "Note that the former approach does not need any kind of linguistic annotation, whereas for the latter, some form of syntactic annotation is needed.",
        "The results yielded by both approaches are typically quite different in nature: the former approach typically puts its finger on a broad, thematic kind of similarity, while the latter approach typically grasps a tighter, synonym-like similarity.",
        "Example (1) shows the difference between both approaches; for each approach, the top ten most similar nouns to the Dutch noun muziek 'music' are given.",
        "In (a), the window-based approach is used, while (b) uses the syntax-based approach, (a) shows indeed more thematic similarity, whereas (b) shows tighter similarity.",
        "'e.g.",
        "dependency relations that qualify apple might be 'object of eaf and 'adjective red'.",
        "This gives us dependency triples like < apple, obj, eat >.",
        "(1) a. muziek 'music': gitaar 'guitar', jazz 'jazz', cd 'cd', rock 'rock', has 'bass', song 'song', muzikant 'musician', musicus 'musician', drum 'drum', slagwerker 'drummer' b. muziek 'music': dans 'dance', kunst 'art', klank 'sound', liedje 'song', geluid 'sound', poezie 'poetry', literatuur 'literature', pop-muziek 'pop music', lied 'song', melodie 'melody'",
        "Especially the syntax-based method has been adopted by many researchers, in order to find semantically similar words.",
        "There is, however, one important problem with this kind of approach: the method is not able to cope with ambiguous words.",
        "Take the examples:",
        "(2) een oneven nummer a odd number an odd number",
        "(3) een steengoed nummer a great number 'a great song'",
        "The word nummer does not have the same meaning in these examples.",
        "In example (2), nummer is used in the sense of'designator of quantity'.",
        "In example (3), it is used in the sense of 'musical performance'.",
        "Accordingly, we would like the word nummer to be disambiguated into two senses, the first sense being similar to words like getal 'number', cijfer 'digit' and the second to words like liedje 'song', song 'song'.",
        "While it is relatively easy for a human language user to distinguish between the two senses, this is a difficult task for a computer.",
        "Even worse: the results get blurred because the attributes of both senses (in this example oneven and steengoed) are grouped together into one sense.",
        "This is the main drawback of the syntax-based method.",
        "On the other hand, methods that capture semantic dimensions are known to be useful in disambiguating different senses of a word.",
        "Particularly, probabilistic latent semantic analysis (plsa) is known to simultaneously encode various senses of words according to latent semantic dimensions (Hofmann, 1999).",
        "In this paper, we want to explore an approach that tries to remedy the shortcomings of the former, syntax-based approach with the benefits of the latter.",
        "The intuition in this is that the syntactic features of the syntax-based approach can be disambiguated by the 'latent semantic dimensions' found by the window-based approach."

        "There have been numerous approaches for computing the similarity between words from distributional data.",
        "We mention some of the most important ones.",
        "With regard to the first approach - using a context window - we already mentioned lsa (Lan-dauer and Dumais, 1997).",
        "In lsa, a term-document matrix is created, containing the frequency of each word in a specific document.",
        "This matrix is then decomposed into three other matrices with a mathematical technique called singular value decomposition.",
        "The most important dimensions that come out of the s vd allegedly represent 'latent semantic dimensions', according to which nouns and documents can be presented more efficiently.",
        "lsa has been criticized for not being the most appropriate data reduction method for textual applications.",
        "The svd underlying the method assumes normally-distributed data, whereas textual count data (such as the term-document matrix) can be more appropriately modeled by other distributional models such as Poisson (Manning and Schiitze, 2000, §15.4.3).",
        "Successive methods such as probabilistic latent semantic analysis (plsa) (Hofmann, 1999), try to remedy this shortcoming by imposing a proper latent variable model, according to which the values can be estimated.",
        "The method we adopt in our research - non-negative matrix factorization - is similar to plsa, and adequately remedies this problem as well.",
        "The second approach - using syntactic relations - has been adopted by many researchers, in order to acquire semantically similar words.",
        "One of the most important is Lin's (1998).",
        "For Dutch, the approach has been applied by Van der Plas & Bouma (2005).",
        "Schiitze (1998) uses a disambiguation algorithm called context-group discrimination - based on the clustering of the context of ambiguous words.",
        "The clustering is based on second-order co-occurrence: the contexts of the ambiguous word are similar if the words they in turn co-occur with are similar.",
        "Pantel and Lin (2002) present a clustering algorithm - coined clustering by committee (cbc) - that automatically discovers word senses from text.",
        "The key idea is to first discover a set of tight, unambiguous clusters, to which possibly ambiguous words can be assigned.",
        "Once a word has been assigned to a cluster, the features associated with that particular cluster are stripped off the word's vector.",
        "This way, less frequent senses of the word can be discovered.",
        "The former approach uses a window-based method; the latter uses syntactic data.",
        "But none of the algorithms developed so far have combined both sources in order to discriminate among different senses of a word."

        "Non-negative matrix factorization (nmf) (Lee and Seung, 2000) is a group of algorithms in which a matrix V is factorized into two other matrices, W and if.",
        "Typically r is much smaller than n, m so that both instances and features are expressed in terms of a few components.",
        "Non-negative matrix factorization enforces the constraint that all three matrices must be non-negative, so all elements must be greater than or equal to zero.",
        "The factorization turns out to be particularly useful when one wants to find additive properties.",
        "Formally, the non-negative matrix factorization is carried out by minimizing an objective function.",
        "Two kinds of objective function exist: one that minimizes the Euclidean distance, and one that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence.",
        "In this framework, we will adopt the latter, as - from our experience - entropy-based measures tend to work well for natural language.",
        "Thus, we want to find the matrices W and H for which the Kullback-Leibler divergence between V and WH (the multiplication of W and H) is the smallest.",
        "Practically, the factorization is carried out through the iterative application of update rules.",
        "Matrices W and H are randomly initialized, and the rules in 2 and 3 are iteratively applied - alternating between them.",
        "In each iteration, each vector is adequately normalized, so that all dimension values sum to 1.",
        "We can now straightforwardly apply nmf to create semantic word models, nmf is applied to a frequency matrix, containing bag of words cooccurrence data.",
        "The additive property of nmf ensures that semantic dimensions emerge, according to which the various words can be classified.",
        "Two sample dimensions are shown in example (4).",
        "For each dimension, the words with the largest value on that dimension are given.",
        "Dimension (a) can be qualified as a 'transport' dimension, and dimension (b) as a 'cooking' dimension.",
        "(4) a. bus 'bus', taxi 'taxi', trein 'train', halte 'stop', reiziger 'traveler', perron 'platform', tram 'tram', station 'station', chauffeur 'driver', passagier 'passenger' b. bouillon 'broth', slagroom 'cream', ui 'onion', eierdooier 'egg yolk', laurierblad 'bay leaf, zout 'salt', deciliter 'decilitre', boter 'butter', bleekselderij 'celery', saus 'sauce'",
        "We now propose an extension of nmf that combines both the bag of words approach and the syntactic approach.",
        "The algorithm finds again latent semantic dimensions, according to which nouns, contexts and syntactic relations are classified.",
        "Since we are interested in the classification of nouns according to both 'bag-of-words' context and syntactic context, we first construct three matrices that capture the co-occurrence frequency information for each mode.",
        "The first matrix contains co-occurrence frequencies of nouns cross-classified by dependency relations, the second matrix contains co-occurrence frequencies of nouns cross-classified by words that appear in the noun's context window, and the third matrix contains cooccurrence frequencies of dependency relations cross-classified by co-occurring context words.",
        "We then apply nmf to the three matrices, but we interleave the separate factorizations: the results of the former factorization are used to initialize the factorization of the next matrix.",
        "This implies that we need to initialize only three matrices at random; the other three are initialized by calculations of the previous step.",
        "The process is represented graphically in figure 1.",
        "In the example in figure 1, matrix H is initialized at random, and the update of matrix W is calculated.",
        "The result of update W is then used to initialize matrix V, and the update of matrix G is calculated.",
        "This matrix is used again to initialize matrix U, and the update of matrix F is calculated.",
        "This matrix can be used to initialize matrix H, and the process is repeated until convergence.",
        "In (5), an example is given of the kind of semantic dimensions found.",
        "This dimension may be coined the 'transport' dimension, as is shown by the top 10 nouns (a), context words (b) and syntactic relations (c).",

        "Next, we want to use the factorization that has been created in the former step for word sense discrimination.",
        "The intuition is that we 'switch off one dimension of an ambiguous word, to reveal possible other senses of the word.",

        "1 is a vector of ones, the size of h dim-",
        "The last step is to determine which dimension(s) are responsible for a certain sense of the word.",

        "First, a specific word is assigned to its predominant sense (i.e. the most similar cluster).",
        "Next, the dominant semantic dimension(s) for this cluster are subtracted from the word vector (equation 4), and the resulting vector is fed to the clustering algorithm again, to see if other word senses emerge.",
        "The dominant semantic dimension^) can be identified by 'folding in' the cluster centroid into our factorization (so we get a vector tv of dimension size r), and applying a threshold to the result (in our experiments a threshold of 5 = .05 – so dimensions responsible for > 5% of the centroid are subtracted).",
        "We used two kinds of clustering algorithms to determine our initial centroids.",

        "We did 200 iterations of the algorithm, factorizing the matrices into 50 dimensions.",
        "The NMF algorithm has been implemented in Matlab.",
        "For the evaluation, we use all the words that appear in our original clustering input as well as in EuroWordNet.",
        "This yields a test set of 3683 words.",
        "Table 1 shows precision and recall figures for four different algorithms, according to two similarity thresholds 6 (equation 8).",
        "kmeansram/ describes the results of our algorithm with k-means clusters, as described in section 3.4.1. cbc describes the results of our algorithm with the cbc committees, as described in section 3.4.2.",
        "For comparison, we have also included the results of a standard k-means clustering (kmeansorjfl, k = 600), and the original cbc algorithm (cbcorjfl) as described by Pantel and Lin (2002).",
        "The results show the same tendency across all similarity thresholds: kmeansram/ has a high precision, but lower recall compared to cbcorjfl.",
        "Still the recall is higher compared to standard k-means, which indicates that the algorithm is able to find multiple senses of nouns, with high precision.",
        "The results of cbcram/ are similar to the results of kmeansorifl, indicating that few words are reassigned to multiple clusters when using cbc committees with our method.",
        "Obviously, kmeansorjfl scores best with regard to precision, but worse with regard to recall.",
        "cbcorjfl finds most senses (highest recall), but precision is considerably worse.",
        "The fact that recall is already quite high with standard k-means clustering indicates that the evaluation is skewed towards nouns with only one sense, possibly due to a lack of coverage in EuroWordNet.",
        "In future work, we specifically want to evaluate the discrimination of ambiguous words.",
        "Also, we want to make use of the new Cornetto Database, a successor of EuroWordNet for Dutch which is currently under development.",
        "Still, the evaluation shows that our method provides a genuine way of finding multiple senses of words, while retaining high precision.",
        "Especially the method using a simple k-means clustering performs particularly well.",

        "In this paper, an extension of nmf has been presented that combines both bag of words data and syntactic data in order to find latent semantic dimensions according to which both words and syntactic relations can be classified.",
        "The use of three way data allows one to determine which dimen-sion(s) are responsible for a certain sense of a word, and adapt the corresponding feature vector accordingly, 'subtracting' one sense to discover another one.",
        "When embedded in a clustering framework, the method provides a fully automatic way to discriminate the various senses of words.",
        "The evaluation against EuroWordNet shows that the algorithm is genuinely able to disambiguate the features of a given word, and accordingly its word senses.",
        "We conclude with some issues for future work.",
        "First of all, we would like to test the method that has been explored in this paper with other evaluation frameworks.",
        "We already mentioned the focus on ambiguous nouns, and the use of the new Cor-netto database for Dutch.",
        "Next, we would like to work out a proper probabilistic framework for the 'subtraction' of dimensions.",
        "At this moment, the subtraction (using a cut-off) is somewhat ad hoc.",
        "A probabilistic modeling of this intuition might lead to an improvement.",
        "And finally, we would like to use the results of our method to learn selectional preferences.",
        "Our method is able to discriminate the syntactic features that are linked to a particular word sense.",
        "If we can use the results to improve a parser's performance, this will also provide an external evaluation of the algorithm."
