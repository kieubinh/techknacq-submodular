        "The EUROPARL Corpus (Koehn, 2005) is one of the most important resources for translation research.",
        "It is used extensively, mostly but certainly not exclusively in statistical machine translation.",
        "In much of that research, the relation between a source language SL and target language TL is investigated on the basis of aligned sentences of SL and TL without considering whether SL is indeed the actual source language.",
        "In this paper we question the lack of attention for the true SL, because we expect significant differences between texts written originally in TL, texts translated from SL to TL and texts translated from another language into TL, even if all three types have been produced by native speakers of TL.",
        "At least with respect to the differences between original and translated texts, our expectations are supported by the literature (for an overview, see e.g. Baroni and Bernardini, 2006).",
        "We embarked on a data-driven investigation, using several text classification techniques to determine if the differences are salient enough to distinguish between different source languages for various texts and target languages.",
        "In this paper, we first describe the data and methods we used (Sections 2 and 3).",
        "Then we present the classification results (Section 4), after which we give a description of some types of markers we were able to identify (Section 5).",
        "Finally, in Section 6, we present our conclusions and plans for future research."

      "text": [
        "The experimental data was taken from the EU-ROPARL Corpus, but had to be preprocessed to some degree to be suitable for our experiments.",
        "First of all, the annotation of the corpus includes a LANGUAGE attribute, indicating the original language of the text.",
        "However, it is often absent in one or more versions of the text.",
        "If we examine the speeches of at least 100 words in the whole corpus, we find that 11% of them lack the attribute in all available versions and for 5% the attribute has different values in different versions.",
        "We linked the attribute across the various versions and excluded all speeches showing inconsistent values.",
        "We decided to focus on the six most common languages in the corpus: English (EN), German (DE), French (FR), Dutch (NL), Spanish (ES) and Italian (IT).",
        "For each of these languages as a source language, we aimed for 1000 speeches (henceforth: texts) which were present as original and as translations into each of the other five languages.",
        "Furthermore, we decided to focus on the medium range as for length, avoiding very short and very long texts, as these were likely to be different in nature.",
        "Our aim of 1000 texts from each source language led us to settle on texts between 380 and 2500 words.",
        "Finally, as we wanted the classification systems to focus on language use rather than contents, we transformed the tokens in the texts, separately for each target language.",
        "Only tokens that occurred in at least 10% of the texts remained intact.",
        "Other tokens were mapped to a marker <X>."
      ]
    },
    {
      "heading": "3. Methods",
      "text": [
        "We classified all texts in our experimental set with several text classification methods (see Sections 3.1 to 3.3), using 10-fold cross-validation, each time with 80% of the texts used to train models for each source language, 10% of the texts used to tune parameters and to base thresholds on and 10% of the texts to test classification accuracy.",
        "For all methods, the same train/ tune/test splits were used and some dozens of promising parameter settings were tried, after which the best one for each specific run was selected on the basis of tune set results.",
        "Each method was provided with the same text features, viz. n-gram counts.",
        "From each selected text (in its mapped version), we extracted counts for all uni-, bi-and trigrams of tokens occurring in at least 10% of the texts (i.e. those not transformed to <X>) and allowing <X> markers to intervene between any two tokens in the n-gram.",
        "For example, the sequence \"I join with Roy Perry in \" would give rise to the n-gram <3>_I_<X>_with_<X>_<X>_in, with the <3> indicating that there are three real tokens in the n-gram, and possibly any number of intervening <X> markers.",
        "Our first classification method attempts to classify texts on the basis of individual markers which are by themselves a strong indication that the text originated in a certain source language.",
        "All n-grams which occurred more often in the training data with a specific source language SL than with all other source languages taken together were deemed to be markers for SL.",
        "When classifying test data, each marker for an SL observed in the test text leads to an increase of the score for that SL for that text.",
        "The exact calculation of the increase depends on some parameter settings.",
        "It always involves both the marker's precision (how often its presence indeed coincides with the specific SL) and its recall (how many of the specific SL texts contain the marker), but with a weighting favouring precision over recall by a factor of 10 to 100.",
        "Precision and recall can be based on either raw or smoothed counts.",
        "The calculation may also involve the frequency of the marker in the test text.",
        "In this way, the frequency of a marker is not taken into account for determining whether it is a marker and what value it is given, but may be taken into account when classifying test texts.",
        "The second classification system was Linguistic Profiling, which was previously shown to be useful for language verification (van Halteren and Oostdijk, 2004), a task which is similar to the current task.",
        "Roughly speaking, it classifies on the basis of noticeable over-and underuse of specific n-grams.",
        "As the marker-based classification only used overuse and the necessary degree of overuse is lower for Linguistic Profiling, the latter pays attention to many more features and should be able to attain a better classification rate.",
        "However, if we want to determine which features are most powerful, interpreting the workings of Linguistic Profiling will be more difficult than for the marker-based approach.",
        "All n-gram counts were normalized to counts per 1000 words.",
        "Furthermore, in order to reduce the number of counts, so that the system could cope with the resulting vectors, we included only n-grams which occurred in at least 10 texts.",
        "This led to vectors with about 90,000 counts for each target language.",
        "Finally, we employed Support Vector Machines, viz. LIBSVM (Chang and Lin, 2001).",
        "We offered the same vectors we used for Linguistic Profiling to both standard Support Vector Classification (SVC; RBF kernel, various settings for C and y) and Support Vector Regression (v-SVR; RBF kernel, various settings for C, y and v).",
        "The Support Vector methods use all available information rather than focusing on over-and underuse.",
        "They should therefore attain the best classification results.",
        "However, extracting information about salient features from the results will be virtually impossible.",
        "Table 1: Average accuracies for two-way SL vs SL choices for various classification methods.",
        "The top part represents cases where one of the",
        "SL is the TL, the bottom where neither SL is TL.",
        "For all methods except SVC, the ranges of test text scores vary greatly as train sets and parameter settings are changed.",
        "As we wanted to combine scores from classifications based on models for various SL, however, we needed the scores to be comparable.",
        "In order to make them so, we compared the score for each test text with the scores for all tune texts.",
        "All lower scoring positive examples provided a increase of the final (comparable) score and all higher scoring negative examples a decrease.",
        "For fine tuning, the relative position of the test text's score between the next higher and next lower scoring tune texts was also taken into consideration."

        "We first used our classification techniques to choose between every possible pair of source languages for each text (Section 4.1).",
        "Then we combined the various two-way decisions into a single six-way decision (Section 4.2).",
        "For each choice between two possible source languages, there are two classification models (one for each of the SL) that can make the choice individually, but we can also combine the two opinions by choosing the SL whose classification model claims the text with a higher score.",
        "The quality of these decisions, for those cases where the actual SL is present in the pair, is choices for various classification methods.",
        "The rows with a TL indication represent the results when the text is only available in that TL.",
        "The bottom row shows the combined result, using all six versions of the text.",
        "shown in Table 1.",
        "We distinguish two types of choices.",
        "The top of the table shows the results for the cases in which one of the two SL is the target language, with SL equal to TL indicating that the text is an original TL text rather than a translation.",
        "For the cases represented in the table, i.e. cases where one of the two SL is the actual one, the task measured here is in fact translation recognition.",
        "As the table shows, the accuracy for this task is higher when modeling original TL text than when modeling translations, meaning that it is easier to spot (violations against) regularities in the target language than it is to spot regularities in the translations from a specific source language.",
        "Combining the two models yields even better classification, except for SVC, where combination cannot be used properly because SVC only produces scores of 1 and -1.",
        "The bottom of the table shows the results for the cases in which both SL are different from the target language.",
        "Here the choices appear to be more difficult on average, but the classification quality is still impressive.",
        "Once we had classification scores for the choice between all fifteen possible pairs of source languages (actually the combination scores), we could use these to choose a single SL from among the set of six possible SL.",
        "For the current paper, we did this by simply adding all classification scores in favour of each specific SL and then choosing the SL with the highest total.",
        "The addition can either be done over all two-way choices referring to a specific target language, or over all choices for all six possible target languages.",

        "To optimize understandability for all readers, we focus on English as the target language in this examination.",
        "We distinguish between two kinds of marker strength.",
        "Obviously, there is the strength in the SL classification described above.",
        "For a marker to be strong in this sense, it has to occur more often with the source language in question than with all other source languages taken together (Section 5.1).",
        "If, however, we envision an application where we know that a specific SL is being translated to a specific TL and we want to give feedback to the translator that the translation contains strong influences from the SL, then strength can also be taken to be the degree to which the marker occurs more in texts translated from SL than in original TL texts (Section 5.2).",
        "For both kinds of marker strength, we can identify specific types of markers, related either to linguistic or culture-and domain-related aspects of texts and their translations (Section 5.3)",
        "We took all n-grams from the English versions of the texts in our experimental data and counted the number of texts they were contained in for each of the six source languages.",
        "We then calculated their strength for each source language SL by dividing the observed number of SL texts, plus one, by the number of non-SL texts, again plus one.",

        "It is possible that the overuse of shall , especially for French, is linked to verbs which are morphologically marked for future tense.",

        "They did not attempt to identify the source language.",
        "Their task corresponds to the translation recognition task presented in the top half of Table 1 and their method is comparable to the combination of the two models for original texts and translations.",
        "They report an accuracy of 86.7%.",
        "If we examine the texts with TL equal to Italian, we find combination scores of 85.4% (MB), 86.0% (SVC), 93.2% (LP) and 96.3% (SVR).",
        "Although their work is different in the choice of domain (geopolitical journal articles) and they do not distinguish translated texts as to source language, the results for SVM classifiers are comparable.",
        "They also mention that in earlier research (Baroni and Bernardini, 2003), they found that \"bigrams most characteristic of translated text are sequences of function words\", for both the Italian corpus already mentioned and a corpus of EU reports written in and translated into English.",
        "The 2003 paper itself, however, reports that \"a more thorough investigation of the EU data ... failed to reveal systematic differences between translated and original documents\".",
        "We must therefore conclude that their observation must refer to the Italian texts.",
        "Still, our tables do show quite a few function word bigrams, but of course we have contributed to any such predominance by blanking out most content words.",
        "Borin and Prutz (2001) examined translations from Swedish into English, using news articles.",
        "They examine over-and underuse of POS n-grams.",
        "They manage to explain some of their observations, but not the overuse in the translations of adverbs, infinitives, pronouns and sentence-initial prepositions.",
        "We have not examined POS classes, but only specific words.",
        "However, we do see various adverbs in prominent positions, especially in Table 7, which indeed shows overuse.",
        "The sentence-initial prepositions might also be partly explained by (often lexicalized) adverbial prepositional phrases."

        "We have shown that classification on the basis of word n-grams markers is able to identify the source language of medium-length European Parliament speeches.",
        "Depending on the classification method used, the actual source language can be identified for 87.2% to 96.7% of the texts when all six target language versions of the text can be accessed.",
        "If only a single version is available, classification is considerably worse and only Support Vector Regression consistently shows relatively high scores, with accuracies of 81.5% for the Italian rendering to 87.4% for the Spanish one.",
        "We also examined the strongest markers.",
        "We found that they are rather varied in nature and represent a wide range of information sources.",
        "Vocabulary, discourse structure and probably syntax of the source language all contribute.",
        "Contrasts between source and target languages can be seen to have an influence too, both purely linguistically and through the behaviour of the translators.",
        "But also the behaviour patterns of the parliamentarians of the various countries have a clear influence.",
        "Some of these influences are harmless or even attractive.",
        "Others should be followed up on, e.g. it would be good to attempt a harmonization of terminology throughout the various translation services, so that information retrieval on the parliamentary proceedings can be improved.",
        "As for further research, it is vital to first investigate how exactly the European Parliament proceedings have been translated in the past, are being translated in the present and will be translated in the future.",
        "It may well be that some of the effects we are finding are limited to individual translators, or caused by their use of (machine) translation tools.",
        "Once it is clear that we are measuring what we think we are measuring, namely general trends in speaker and translator behaviour, we need to automate the retrieval of target language and source language phrases (maybe using statistical machine translation methodology), and possibly also to address semantically related clusters.",
        "Only then can we really investigate if observations like \"Dutch speakers exaggerate more often\" are valid or are just false impressions from looking at the data through too small a window.",
        "Once all this is in place, we will have the means for a whole range of activities, e.g. to study parliamentary behaviour, to study the translation process, to determine if source language should be taken more into account in EU-ROPARL translation models and potentially even to give useful advise to the EU translation services."
