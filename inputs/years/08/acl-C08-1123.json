        "A number of researchers (Hirschberg and Litman, 1993; Grosz and Sidner, 1986) speak of cue or key phrases in utterances that can serve as useful indicators of discourse structure.",
        "We have previously investigated the use of such cue phrases to predict dialogue acts or DAs (functional tags which represent the communicative intentions behind each user utterance) (Webb et al., 2005a).",
        "We developed an approach, in common with the work of Samuel et al. (1999), where word n-grams that might serve as cue phrases are automatically detected in a corpus and we have previously reported the results of experiments evaluating this approach on the SWITCHBOARD corpus, where our results rival the best reported over that data (Stolcke et al., 2000), although our method adopts a significantly less complex algorithm.",
        "An interesting by-product of our approach is the ranked list of cue phrases derived from the source corpus.",
        "Visual inspection of these cues reveals that, as one might expect, there is a high degree of correlation between phrases such as \"can you \" and the DA <yes/no question>, \"where is\" and \"who is\" with the DA <wh-question> and \"right\" or \"ok\" with DA <agree/accept>.",
        "These cues appear to be of a general nature, unrelated to the source domain or application.",
        "Therefore, despite being automatically acquired from one domain specific corpus, these cues should be equally applicable to new corpora, from a different domain and it is this hypothesis we test.",
        "This paper presents our work on dialogue act classification using cues automatically extracted from a corpus from one domain, and applying these cues directly as a classifier over a new corpus from a different domain.",
        "The material is presented as follows: Previous work with dialogue act modelling is outlined in Section 2.",
        "An overview of the corpora used for the experiments we report can be seen in Section 3.",
        "A brief overview of our classification method is given in Section 4.",
        "Our experiments evaluating the cue-based dialogue act classifier tagging new, out-of-domain data are given in Section 5.",

        "We have shown that the cues extracted from the switchboard corpus can be used to successfully classify utterances in the amitiés ge corpus.",
        "We achieve almost 80% of the upper baseline performance over the amitiés ge corpus, when judged using our lenient scoring mechanism - scoring 55.7% using the cross-domain cues, compared to the 70.8% when using in-domain cues.",
        "When using the strict measure we still achieve around 60% of the upper bound performance, both results being a substantial improvement over the baseline measure of 20%, corresponding to the most frequent tag in the amitiés ge corpus.",
        "This is a significant result, which confirms the idea that cues can be sufficiently general across domains to be used in classification.",
        "However, whilst the experiment using switchboard corpus derived cues to classify amitiés ge data works well, the same is not true in reverse.",
        "There are two possible explanations for this result.",
        "It could be related to the size of data available for training, although our experiments in this area seem to suggest otherwise and so we believe that the composition of the training data is a more crucial element.",
        "Although the da distribution in the switchboard corpus is uneven, there is sufficient data for the major classes to be effective on new data that also contains these classes.",
        "Although the amitiés ge contains a lot of questions and statements, there is very little of the other significant categories, such as <backchannels>, a key da in the switchboard corpus and conversational speech in general.",
        "Correspondingly, the cues derived from the amitiés ge data perform well on a selection of utterances in the switchboard corpus, but very poorly on others.",
        "We want to perform an in-depth error analysis to see if the errors we obtain in classification accuracy are consistent.",
        "We can also compare our list of automatically derived cues phrases, particularly those that overlap between the two corpora, to those reported in prior literature.",
        "It might be interesting to see if more complex models, derived using state-of-the art machine learning approaches, could demonstrate similar portability - i.e is it the simplicity of our model that allows for the observed robust portability?",
