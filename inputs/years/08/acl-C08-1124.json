        "It can be seen that these summaries achieve lower ROUGE scores when the length of summary is reduced.",
        "The reason is that when people try to write a more concise summary, condensed contents are included in the summaries, which may not use the original contents directly.",

        "The highest ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2 scores are 0.396 and 0.116 respectively.",
        "The Rouge-1 score of manually generated summaries is 0.422.",
        "This shows the ROUGE performance of our supervised learning approach is comparable to that of manually generated summaries.",

        "It can be seen that our summarization approach based on combination of features improves the performance obviously.",
        "Although the results of supervised learning approach are encouraging, it required much labeled data.",
        "To reduce labeling cost, we apply co-training to combine labeled and unlabeled data.",
        "Experiments show that compare with supervised learning, semi-supervised learning approach saves half of the labeling cost and maintains comparable performance (0.366 vs 0.396).",
        "We also find that our extractive summarization is sensitive to length of the summary.",
        "When the length is extended, the ROUGE scores of same summarization method are improved.",
        "In the future, we plan to investigate sentence compression to improve performance of our summarization approaches on short summaries.",
