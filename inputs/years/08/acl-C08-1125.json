        "The trained SMT systems are suitable for translating texts in the same domain as the training corpus.",
        "However, for some specific domains, it is difficult to obtain a bilingual corpus.",
        "In this case, the performance of SMT systems will be degraded.",
        "Generally, it is easier to obtain in-domain monolingual corpora in either source or target language.",
        "Moreover, in some specific domains, although in-domain bilingual corpora do not exist, in-domain translation dictionaries, which usually contain domain-specific terms and their translations, are available.",
        "And even if such dictionaries are not available, it is easier to compile one than to build a bilingual corpus.",
        "Thus, in this paper, we address the problem of domain-specific SMT, where only domain-specific dictionaries and/or monolingual corpora exist.",
        "In a specific domain, there are two kinds of words: common words, which also frequently occur in out-of-domain corpora, and domain-specific words, which only occur in the specific domain.",
        "Thus, we can combine the out-of-domain bilingual corpus, the in-domain translation dictionary, and monolingual corpora for in-domain translation.",
        "If an in-domain translation dictionary is available, we combine it with the out-of-domain translation model to improve translation quality.",
        "If an in-domain target language corpus (TLC) is available, we use it to build an in-domain language model, which can be combined with the out-of-domain language model to further improve translation quality.",
        "Moreover, if an indomain source language corpus (SLC) is available, we automatically translate it and obtain a synthetic in-domain bilingual corpus.",
        "By adding this synthetic bilingual corpus to the training data, we rebuild the translation model to improve translation quality.",
        "We can repeatedly translate the in-domain source language corpus with the improved model until no more improvement can be made.",
        "This is similar to transductive learning described in (Ueffing et al., 2007).",

        "Results on English to French translation also show that using indomain translation dictionaries and in-domain monolingual corpora is effective for domain adaptation, achieving an absolute improvement of 3.36 BLEU score.",
