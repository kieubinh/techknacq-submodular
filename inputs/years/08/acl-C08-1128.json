        "For example, (Gao et al., 2005) described an adaptive CWS system, and (Andrew, 2006) employed a conditional random field model for sequence segmentation.",
        "However, these methods are not specifically developed for the MT application, and significant improvements in translation performance need to be shown.",
        "In (Xu et al., 2004) and (Xu et al., 2005), word segmentations are integrated into MT systems during model training and translation.",
        "We refine the method in training using a Bayesian semi-supervised CWS approach motivated by (Goldwa-ter et al., 2006).",
        "We describe a generative model which consists of a word model and two alignment models, representing the monolingual and bilingual information, respectively.",

        "As shown in Table 4, on the development data MT-eval 05, the BLEU score was improved by 0.4% absolute or more than 1% relative using GS.",
        "Similarly, the absolute BLEU scores are also improved on all other test sets, in the range of 0.04% to 0.4%.",
        "We can see that even a monolingual semi-supervised word segmentation method can outperform a supervised one in MT, probably because the training/test corpora contain many unknown words and words have different frequencies in our MT data from they do in the manually labeled CWS data.",
        "We evaluate our full model, using both monolingual and bilingual information, on the IWSLT data.",
        "As shown in Table 5, the Chinese training corpus was segmented using the unigram seg-menter (Base) described in Section 2.1 and our GS method.",
        "Since the unigram segmenter performs better in our experiments, we took it as the baseline and the method for initialization in later experiments.",
        "We see that the vocabulary size of the Chinese training corpus was reduced more significantly by GS than by the baseline method, even",
        "Table 5 : Statistics of corpora in task IWSLT.",
        "though they resulted in a similar number of running words.",
        "This shows that the distribution of Chinese words is more concentrated when using GS.",
        "The parameter optimizations were performed on the Dev2 data with 500 sentences, and evaluations were done both on Dev3 and on Eval data, i.e. the evaluation corpus of (IWSLT, 2007).",
        "The model weights A of GS from Section 5.1.2 were optimized using the Powell (Press et al., 2002) algorithm with respect to the BLEU score.",
        "We obtained Ai = 1.4, A2 = 1 and A3 = 0.8 as optimal values and T = 4 as the optimal number of iterations of realignment with GIZA++.",
        "For a fair comparison, we evaluated on various CWS methods including translation on characters , LDC (LDC, 2003), ICT (Zhang et al., 2003), unigram, 9-gram and GS.",
        "Improvements using GS can be seen in Table 6.",
        "Under all test sets and evaluation criteria, GS outperforms the baseline method.",
        "The absolute WER decreases with 1.2% on Dev3 and with 1.1% on Eval data over baseline.",
        "We compared the translation outputs using GS with the baseline method.",
        "On the Eval data, 196 sentences are different out of 489 lines, where 64 sentences from GS are better, 33 sentences are worse, and the rests have similar translation qualities.",
        "Table 7 shows two examples from the Eval corpus.",
        "We list segmentations produced by the baseline and GS methods, as well as the translations corresponding to these segmentations.",
