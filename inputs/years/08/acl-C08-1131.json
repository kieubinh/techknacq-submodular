        "Electronic dictionary interfaces have evolved from mere digitised forms of their paper ancestors.",
        "They now enhance accessibility by addressing the separate needs of language consumers and language producers, of learners from non-speakers to native speakers, and by targeting the specific difficulties presented by individual languages.",
        "For languages with logographic orthographies, such as Japanese and Chinese, accessibility remains poor due to the difficulties in looking up an unknown character in the dictionary.",
        "The traditional method of character lookup in these languages involves identifying the primary component (or \"radical\"), counting its strokes, looking it up in the index, counting the remainder of strokes in the original character, then finding the character in a sub-index.",
        "This presents several opportunities for error, but fortunately improvements have been made, as we discuss in Section 2.",
        "We are interested in the perceptual process of identifying characters, in particular the behaviour of perception within dense visual neighbourhoods.",
        "Within the dictionary accessibility space, we are motivated by the potential to correct confusion errors, but also to leverage the mental associations provided by visual proximity to allow advanced learners to find unknown characters faster.",
        "As proof-of-concept, we propose a method for looking up unknown words with unfamiliar characters, based on similarity with known characters.",
        "In essence, our method is based on the user plausibly \"mistyping\" the word based on closely-matching kanji they are familiar with (and hence can readily access via a standard input method editor), from which we predict the correct kanji combination based on kanji similarity and word frequency.",
        "For example, given the input $f4i, the system could suggest the word ffift [hosa] \"help\" based on similarity between the high-frequency 4i and the graphically-similar but low-frequency .",
        "The proposed method is combined with the FOKS lookup strategy proposed by Bilac (2002) for looking up unknown words via plausibly incorrect readings.",
        "The contributions of this paper are the proposal of a range of character similarity models for logo-graphic scripts, a novel evaluation method for logographic character confusability, and the incorporation of kanji similarity into a word-level lookup model.",
        "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.",
        "Firstly, we review related lookup systems (Section 2), and go on to discuss how we measure and model kanji similarity, including an evaluation of the methods (Section 3).",
        "We then focus on the conversion of similarity models into confusion models, and their integration into a search interface (Section 4).",
        "Examining both our models and the interface itself, we discuss our findings (Section 5) before finally concluding (Section 6)."

        "Associative lookup systems are based on the premise that characters and words form a highly connected lexical network.",
        "They focus on finding and making accessible the mental links provided by proximity within this network.",
        "In contrast, systems which correct for confusion model plausible errors in order to recover from them.",
        "Examples of associative systems are as follows:",
        "Ferret and Zock (2006) introduce the distinction between language producers as encoders of semantic information, and language consumers as decoders of orthographic (or phonetic) information.",
        "We first consider systems to aid production of language.",
        "Systems for production give form and sound to known semantics.",
        "The most common such systems are bilingual dictionaries which associate words in one language with their near-synonyms in a second language.",
        "Even within a monolingual context, the problem of selecting the right word can be difficult, whether the difficulty is one of limited knowledge or simply one of access, as in the case of the tip-of-the-tongue problem.",
        "Work in this area (Zock, 2002; Zock and Bilac, 2004) has more recently focused on extending WordNet with syntagmatic relationships (Ferret and Zock, 2006).",
        "Access could take the form of the Visual WordNet Project.",
        "For language consumers, the challenge is to find the meaning or sound of a word with known form.",
        "For logographic languages, where characters are entered phonetically using an input method editor, computer input of an unknown word with known form remains difficult, since the reading is unknown.",
        "In a bilingual context, the Pinyomi Chinese-Japanese dictionary interface overcomes this obstacle by allowing Japanese speakers to look up a Chinese word via the Japanese-equivalent characters based on orthographic associations between similar characters (Yencken et al., 2007).",
        "Our proposed extension to the FOKS dictionary is functionally similar to Pinyomi, but in a monolingual Japanese context.",
        "In our case, a Japanese word containing unknown characters is found by",
        "^http://kylescholz.com/projects/wordnet/",
        "querying with known characters that are visually similar.",
        "Unlike Pinyomi, which uses an ideogram transliteration table to determine associations, we use direct models of character similarity to determine associations.",
        "We next provide a brief review of five kanji lookup systems in order to situate our proposed interface appropriately.",
        "The SKIP (System of Kanji Indexing by Patterns) system of lookup provides an indexing scheme based on a kanji's overall shape rather than its primary radical (Halpern, 1999).",
        "For example, [aka] \"bright\" has skip code 1-4-4, with the first number indicating it is horizontally split into two parts, and the second and third numbers representing the respective stroke counts of the two parts.",
        "The Kansuke dictionary simplifies the method of counting strokes, to form a three-number code representing the horizontal, vertical and other strokes that make up a character (Tanaka-Ishii and Godon, 2006).",
        "Characters can also be looked up from their components.",
        "For our earlier example consists of 0 with code 3-2-0 and ^ with code 3-1-1.",
        "The Kanjiru dictionary (Winstead, 2006) attempts to interactively assemble a character by shape and stroke via mouse movements, providing the user with structural ways of building up components until the desired character is found.",
        "Finally, handwriting interfaces attempt to circumvent the computer input problem altogether, but still suffer from several issues: the awkwardness of mouse input for drawing characters; sensitivity to both stroke order and connectivity of components; and the difference in handwriting styles between learners and native speakers.",
        "These lookup methods contrast with our proposed similarity-based search in several ways.",
        "Firstly, our method combines word-and character-level information directly, yet provides the means to lookup words with unknown characters without the use of wildcards.",
        "The downside to this is that the user needs to use kanji in the search query, limiting potential users to intermediate and advanced learners with some knowledge of kanji.",
        "Secondly, we are able to cater to both intentional similarity-based searches, and unintentional input errors, increasing the accessibility of the base dictionary.",
        "This approach shares much with the FOKS dictionary interface (Bilac, 2002), which provides error-correcting lookup for reading-based dictionary queries.",
        "Suppose, for example, a user wishes to look up the word \"festival float\", but is unsure of its pronunciation.",
        "FOKS allows them to guess the pronunciation based on readings they know for each character in other contexts.",
        "In this case, they might combine lL| [yama] \"mountain\" and j|l [kuruma] \"car\" and guess the word reading as [yamakuruma].",
        "The correct reading [dashi] cannot be guessed from the word's parts, but our educated guess would lead the user to the word and provide access to both the correct reading and meaning.",

        "There has been little work on methods for measuring or predicting the similarity between two kanji.",
        "While there have been many psycholinguistic studies on various specific aspects of perception of Chinese and Japanese logographic characters, few touch directly on orthographic confusion.",
        "For a brief discussion, see Yencken and Baldwin (2006).",
        "Broadly, current literature suggests that kanji recognition may be hierarchical, building radicals from strokes, and whole characters from radicals.",
        "Each point of recognition and combination suggests a potential site for misrecognition or confusion with an orthographic or semantic neighbour.",
        "The most directly relevant study involved two experiments by Yeh and Li (2002).",
        "In a sorting task, subjects tended to categorise characters by their structure, rather than their shared components.",
        "In a subsequent search task, presence of shared structure between target and distractors was the dominant factor in subjects' response times.",
        "We previously proposed two naive kanji similarity measures: a cosine similarity metric operating on boolean radical vectors, and the l\\ norm (Manhattan distance) between rendered images of kanji (Yencken and Baldwin, 2006).",
        "Evaluating on a set of human similarity judgements, we determined that the cosine similarity method outperformed the",
        "11 norm, although it had lower precision for high-similarity pairs.",
        "When learners of Japanese study a new character, they do not study its strokes in isolation, but instead build on prior knowledge of its component radicals.",
        "For example, [aka] \"bright\" could be analysed as being made up of the 0 [sun] \"hi\" and ^ [moon] \"tsuki\" radicals.",
        "Radicals are useful in several ways.",
        "The number of radicals in any kanji is much smaller than the number of strokes for any kanji, making such kanji easier to chunk and recall in memory.",
        "Furthermore, radicals can provide cues to the meaning and pronunciation of characters which contain them.",
        "The original metric used in Yencken and Baldwin (2006) simply calculates the cosine similarity between radical vectors.",
        "This ignores the position of radicals, which is known to be important in similarity judgements, and also the number of times each radical occurs within a kanji.",
        "Hence, yfc, # and ^ are all considered identical (radical = 7^), as are 0 and da (radical = 0).",
        "The metric is calculated by:",
        "To address radical multiplicity and the findings of Yeh and Li's study we set the above metric to unit distance whenever the two characters differ in their basic shape.",
        "To approximate shape, we use the first part of each kanji's 3-part SKIP code, which can take values horizontal, vertical, containment or other.",
        "SKIP codes for each kanji are provided in Kanjidic, and radical membership in the Radkfile.",
        "This change allows the metric to distinguish between examples with repeated components.",
        "The altered metric aims to capture the visual and semantic salience of radicals in kanji perception, and to also take into account some basic shape similarity.",
        "In contrast to the previous approach, we can consider kanji as arbitrary symbols rendered in print or on screen, and then attempt to measure their similarity.",
        "The simplest way to do this is to simply render each kanji to an image of fixed size, and to then use some distance metric over images.",
        "A common and simple distance metric is the l\\ norm, which simply sums the difference in luminance between pixels of the two images for some alignment.",
        "Fortunately, all kanji are intended to occupy an identically sized block, so alignment is via a grid, constant across all kanji.",
        "Considering px (i, j) to be the luminance of the pixel at position of rendered kanji x, we evaluate the l\\ norm as follows:",
        "This calculation depends on the image representation chosen, and could differ slightly across fonts, image sizes and rasterisation methods.",
        "We used the MS Gothic font, rendering to 80x80 images, with anti-aliasing.",
        "This metric is aimed at capturing the general overlap of strokes between the two characters, along with the overlap of whitespace, which gives useful structure information.",
        "This metric is known to be noisy for low-to-medium similarity pairs, but is very useful in distinguishing near neighbours.",
        "http://www.esse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/kanjidic.html http://www.esse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/kradinf.html",
        "A third possibility is to reduce kanji to the very strokes used to write them.",
        "Two features of the orthography make this possible: (1) kanji are not arbitrary symbols, but configurations of strokes chosen from within a finite and limited set; and (2) each kanji has a precise stroke order which is consistent for reused kanji components, such that if two or more arbitrary components were combined to form a new pseudo-character, native speakers would largely agree on the stroke order.",
        "To define a metric based on strokes, we need both a source of stroke data and a comparison method.",
        "For stroke data, we look to a hierarchical data set for Japanese kanji created by Apel and Quint (2004).",
        "Each kanji is specified by its strokes, grouped into common stroke groups (components), and broken down in a hierarchical manner into relative positions within the kanji (for example: left and right, top and bottom).",
        "The strokes themselves are based on a taxonomy of some 26 stroke types (46 including sub-variants).",
        "For any given kanji, we can flatten its hierarchy to generate an ordered sequence of strokes: a signature for that character.",
        "The natural distance metric across such sequences is the string edit distance.",
        "This forms our dstroke metric.",
        "Much useful information is preserved within stroke signatures.",
        "Since radicals are written in sequence, they form contiguous blocks in the signature.",
        "The edit distance will thus align shared radicals when their position is similar enough.",
        "Since components are usually drawn in a left-to-right, top-to-bottom order, the order of components in a signature also reflects their position as part of the larger character.",
        "Finally, it provides a smooth blending from stroke similarity to radical similarity, and can recognise the similarity between pairs like 0 [hi] \"sun\" and g [me] \"eye\".",
        "In our previous approach, we discarded much of the hierarchical information available, relying on stroke order to approximate it.",
        "We can instead use the full data, and calculate the ordered tree edit distance between kanji XML representations.",
        "Tree edit distance is defined as the length of the shortest sequence of inserts, deletions and relabellings required to convert one tree into another (Bille, 2005).",
        "Though a cost function between labels can be specified, we gave inserts/deletions and relabellings unit cost.",
        "Figure 1 provides an overview of the structure of each kanji's representation.",
        "Actual trees also contain phonetic elements, radicals, and stroke groups whose strokes are spread across several non-contiguous blocks.",
        "Another motivation for including tree edit distance is to determine if this additional information is useful in determining kanji similarity.",
        "We evaluate our distance metrics over three data sets.",
        "The first data set is the human similarity judgements from Yencken and Baldwin (2006).",
        "This data set is overly broad in that it weights the ability to distinguish low and medium similarity pairs equally with distinguishing medium and high similarity pairs.",
        "It is clear that for most applications, determining the high similarity pairs with high precision is most important.",
        "Nevertheless, this data set is useful for comparing our metrics with those proposed in previous research.",
        "In order to better measure performance on high-similarity pairs, which we expect to form the basis of incorrect kanji inputs, we need a set of human-selected confusion data.",
        "The second data set is drawn from the White Rabbit JLPT Level 3 kanji flashcards.",
        "Each flashcard contains either one or two highly-similar neighbours which might be confused with a given kanji.",
        "We use this set to determine our likely performance in a search task.",
        "Our third data set is based on human confusabil-ity judgements for kanji pairings.",
        "The first data consists of human similarity judgements to pairs of kanji, scored on a 5 point scale (Yencken and Baldwin, 2006).",
        "The experiment had 179 participants, covering a broad range of Japanese proficiency.",
        "The key participant groupings are: (1) non-speakers of Chinese, Japanese or Korean (Non-CJK); (2) Japanese second-language learners (JSL); and (3) Japanese first-language speakers (JFL).",
        "Figure 2 gives the rank correlation p between each metric and a rater, averaged over all raters in each proficiency group.",
        "For each metric, the mean rank correlation increased with the participants' knowledge of Metric agreement within rater groups",
        "-SHAPE +SHAPE",
        "Figure 2: Mean value of Spearman's rank correlation p over rater groups for each metric (dradical(~SHAPE) is the original metric, and rfradical(+sHAPE) is our augmented version)",
        "Japanese (from Non-CJK to JSL to JFL), indicating that the raters made more motivated and consistent similarity judgements.",
        "The dradicai (+shape) metric dominates the other metrics, including the original dradicai ( – shape), at all levels of knowledge.",
        "This confirms the salience of radicals and the tendency for individuals to classify kanji by their broad shape, as suggested by Yeh and Li (2002).",
        "h, ^stroke and dtree perform poorly in comparison.",
        "Interestingly, these three metrics have large performance differences for non-speakers, but not for native-speakers.",
        "Despite overall poor performance from our new metrics, we were able to improve on the original ^radical ( – shape).",
        "We now evaluate over the flashcard data set for comparison.",
        "The flashcard data differs greatly from the previous experimental data, as it consists of only human-selected high-similarity pairs.",
        "Accordingly, we took two approaches to evaluation.",
        "Firstly, for each high-similarity pair (a pivot kanji and its distractor), we randomly select a third kanji from the joyo character set and combine it with the pivot to form a second pair which is highly likely to be low similarity.",
        "We then compare how well each metric can classify the two pairs by imposing the correct ordering on them, in the form of classification accuracy.",
        "The results of this evaluation are shown in Table 1.",
        "We include a theoretical random baseline of 0.500, since any decision has a Metric Accuracy 50% a priori chance of being successful.",
        "The performance of dradicai - close to our random baseline, despite performing best in the previous task - is suggestive of the different characteristics of this task.",
        "In particular, a metric which orders well across the broad spectrum of similarity pairs may not be well suited to identifying high-similarity pairs, and vice-versa.",
        "The other three metrics have accuracy above 0.95 on this task, indicating the ease with which they can identify high-similarity pairs.",
        "However, this does not guarantee that the neighbourhoods they generate will be free from noise, since the real-world prevalence of highly similar characters is likely to be very low.",
        "To better determine what dictionary search results might be like, we consider each flashcard kanji as a query, and its high-similarity distractors as relevant documents (and implicitly all remaining kanji as irrelevant documents, i.e. dissimilar characters).",
        "We can then calculate the Mean Average Precision (MAP, i.e. the mean area under the precision-recall curve for a query set) and the precision at N neighbours, for varied TV.",
        "The results of this approach are presented in Table 2.",
        "The precision statistics confirm the ranking of metrics found in the earlier classification task.",
        "The ^stroke metric outperforms l\\ by a greater margin in the MAP statistic and precision at TV = 1, but narrows again for greater TV.",
        "This suggests that it is more reliable in the upper similarity ranking.",
        "The flashcard data provides good examples of high-similarity pairs, but suffers from several problems.",
        "Firstly, the constraints of the flashcard format limit the number of high-similarity neighbours that can be presented on each flashcard to at most two; in some cases we might expect more.",
        "Secondly, the methodology behind the selection of these high-similarity neighbours is unclear.",
        "For these reasons, we conducted an experiment to attempt to replicate the flashcard data.",
        "100 kanji were randomly chosen from the JLPT 3 set (hereafter pivots).",
        "For each pivot kanji, we generated a pool of possible high-similarity neighbours in the following way.",
        "Firstly, we seeded the pool with the neighbours from the flashcard data set.",
        "We then added the highest similarity neighbour as given by each of our similarity metrics.",
        "Since these could overlap, we iteratively continued adding an additional neighbour from all of our metrics until our pool contained at least four neighbours.",
        "Native or native-like speakers of Japanese were solicited as participants.",
        "After a dry run, each participant was presented with a series of pivot kanji.",
        "For each pivot kanji, they were asked to select from its pool of neighbours which (if any) might be confused for that kanji based on their graphical similarity.",
        "The order of pivots was randomised for each rater, as was the order of neighbours for each pivot.",
        "Kanji were provided as images using MS Gothic font for visual consistency across browsers.",
        "Three participants completed the experiment, selecting 1.32 neighbours per pivot on average, less than 1.86 per pivot provided by the flashcard data.",
        "Inter-rater agreement was quite low, with a mean k of 0.34 across rater pairings, suggesting that participants found the task difficult.",
        "This is unsurprising, since as native speakers the participants are experts at discriminating between characters, and are unlikely to make the same mistakes as learners.",
        "Comparing their judgements to the flashcard data set yields a mean n of 0.37.",
        "Ideally, this data generates a frequency distribution over potential neighbours based on the number of times they were rated as similar.",
        "However, since the number of participants was small, we simply combined the neighbours with high-similarity judgements for each pivot, yielding an average of 2.45 neighbours per pivot.",
