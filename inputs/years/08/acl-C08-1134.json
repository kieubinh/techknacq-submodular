        "Reliably extracting relations between entities in natural-language documents is still a difficult, unsolved problem.",
        "A large number of engineered systems were developed for identifying relations of interest.",
        "Recent approaches to this problem include statistical parsing (Miller et al., 2000), logistic regression (Kambhatla, 2004), feature-based methods (Zhou et al., 2005; Toru et al., 2007), and kernel methods (Zelenko et al., 2003; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004; Bunescu and Mooney, 2005, 2006).",

        "This work is also affiliated with the Microsoft-CUHK Joint Laboratory for Human-centric Computing and Interface Technologies.",
        "In text, this usually amounts to examining pairs of entities in a document and determining whether a relation exists between them.",
        "In general, the above approaches to relation extraction suffer from the following three difficulties: (1) enumerating all pairs of entities, even when restricted to pairs within a sentence, results in a low density of positive relation examples, (2) these approaches assume that relations only exist within document, and classify them independently without considering dependencies between entities.",
        "However, this assumption does not hold in practice, and ignoring dependencies between entities may lead to reduced performance, and (3) implicit relations can hardly be discovered in these models since they generally exist in cross document and they are only implied by the text.",
        "And these are the sorts of relations on which current extraction models perform most poorly.",
        "In this paper we propose a new integrated approach based on Markov logic networks (MLNs) to extracting relations between entities in English encyclopedic articles from Wikipedia.",
        "We predict only relations between the principal entity and each mentioned secondary entity in Wikipedia articles.",
        "By anchoring one argument of relations to be the principal entity, we alleviate the difficulty of enumerating all pairs of entities in a document.",
        "This approach can incorporate rich dependencies between entities by modeling entity relations in a coherent undirected graph in a collective manner, and make simultaneous statistical judgments about the relations for a set of related entities.",
        "It can also exploit relational autocorrelation, a widely observed characteristic of relational data in which the value of a variable for one instance is highly correlated with the value of the same variable on another instance.",
        "We show how a variety of well-engineered features can be easily and concisely formulated as first-order logic and incorporated into MLNs, and we show how implicit relations can be easily discovered in this modeling.",
        "We apply Gibbs sampling, a widely used Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, to perform collective inference in MLNs.",

        "Motivated by this observation, we therefore apply Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001), a probabilistic graphical model that has been successfully employed on sequence labeling tasks with state-of-the-art performance.",

        "Sequence models are specifically designed to handle these kinds of dependencies.",
        "The modeling flexibility of CRFs permits the feature functions to be complex, arbitrary, non-independent, and overlapping features of the input without requiring additional assumptions, allowing the multiple features described in Section 5 to be directly exploited.",
        "To avoid overfitting, we penalized the log-likelihood by the commonly used zero-mean Gaussian prior over the parameters.",
