        "Creating a large labeled training corpus is very expensive and time-consuming in some real-world applications.",
        "For example, it is a crucial issue for automated word sense disambiguation task, because validations of sense definitions and sense-tagged data annotation have to be done by human experts, e.g. OntoNotes project (Hovy et al., 2006).",
        "Active learning aims to minimize the amount of human labeling effort by automatically selecting the most informative unlabeled example for human annotation.",
        "In recent years active learning has been widely studied in natural language processing (NLP) applications, such as word sense disambiguation (WSD) (Chen et al., 2006; Zhu and Hovy, 2007), text classification (TC) (Lewis and Gale, 1994; McCallum and Nigam, 1998a), named entity recognition (Shen et al., and statistical parsing (Tang et al., 2002).",
        "However, deciding when to stop active learning is still an unsolved problem and seldom mentioned issue in previous studies.",
        "Actually it is a very important practical issue in real-world applications, because it obviously makes no sense to continue the active learning procedure until the whole unlabeled corpus has been labeled.",
        "The active learning process can be ended when the current classifier reaches the maximum effectiveness.",
        "In principle, how to learn a stopping criterion is a problem of estimation of classifier (i.e. learner) effectiveness during active learning (Lewis and Gale, 1994).",
        "In this paper, we address the issue of a stopping criterion for pool-based active learning with uncertainty sampling (Lewis and Gale, 1994), and propose a multi-criteria-based approach to determining when to stop active learning process.",
        "Firstly, this paper makes a comprehensive analysis on some confidence-based stopping criteria (Zhu and Hovy, 2007), including max-confidence, min-error and overall-uncertainty, then proposes a new stopping criterion, classification-change, which considers the potential ability of each unlabeled example on changing decision boundaries.",
        "Secondly, a combination strategy is proposed to solve the problem of predefining an appropriate threshold for each confidence-based stopping criterion in a specific task.",
        "In uncertainty sampling scheme, the most uncertain unlabeled example is considered as the most informative case selected by active learner at each learning cycle.",
        "However, an uncertain example for one classifier may be not an uncertain example for other classifiers.",
        "When using active learning for real-world applications such as WSD, it is possible that a classifier of one type selects samples for training a classifier of another type, called the heterogeneous approach (Lewis and Catlett, 1994).",
        "For example, the final trained classifier for WSD is often different from the classifier used in active learning for constructing the training corpus.",
        "To date, no one has studied the stopping criterion issue for the heterogeneous approach.",

        "In this section, we mainly address the problem of general stopping criteria for active leanring, and study how to define a reasonable and appropriate stopping criterion SC shown in Fig. 1.",
        "To examine whether the classifier has reached the maximum effectiveness during active learning procedure, it seems an appealing solution when repeated learning cycles show no significant performance improvement.",
        "However, this is often not feasible.",
        "To investigate the impact of performance change on defining a stopping criterion for active learning, we first give an example of active learning for WSD shown in Fig. 2.",
        "Fig.",
        "2 shows that the accuracy performance generally increases, but apparently degrades at iterations 30, 90 and 190, and does not change anymore during iterations 220-260 in the active learning process.",
        "Actually the first time of the highest performance of 91.5% is achieved at 900 which is not shown in Fig. 2.",
        "Although the accuracy performance curve shows an increasing trend, it is not monotonically increasing.",
        "It is not easy to automatically determine the point of no significant performance improvement on the validation set, because points such as 30 or 90 would mislead a final judgment.",
        "Besides, there is a problem of performance estimation of the current classifier during active learning process, because a separate validation set should be prepared in advance, a procedure that causes additional (high) cost since it is often done manually.",
        "Besides, how many samples are required for the pregiven separate validation set is an open question.",
        "Too few samples may not be adequate for a reasonable estimate and may result in an incorrect result.",
        "Too many samples would increase the building cost.",
        "To define a stopping criterion for active learning, Zhu and hovy (2007) considered the estimation of the classifier's effectiveness as the second task of confidence estimation of the classifier on its classification of all remaining unlabeled data.",
        "In the following section, we first introduce two confidence-based criteria, max-confidence and min-error, proposed by Zhu and Hovy (2007).",
        "In uncertainty sampling scheme, if the uncertainty value of the most informative unlabeled example is sufficiently small, we can assume that the current classifier has sufficient confidence on its classification of the remaining unlabeled data.",
        "So the active learning process can be ended.",
        "Based on such assumption, Zhu and Hovy (2007) proposed max-confidence criterion based on the uncertainty estimation of the most informative unlabeled example.",
        "Its strategy is to consider whether the uncertainty value of the most informative unlabeled example is less than a very small predefined threshold.",
        "As shown in Fig. 1, in uncertainty sampling scheme, the current classifier has the least confidence on its classification of these top-m selected unlabeled examples.",
        "If the current classifier can correctly classify these most informative examples, we can assume that the current classifier have sufficient confidence on its classification of the remaining unlabeled data.",
        "Based on such assumption, Zhu and Hovy (2007) proposed min-error criterion based on feedback from the oracle.",
        "Its strategy is to consider whether the current classifier can correctly predict the labels on these selected unlabeled examples, or the accuracy performance of the current classifier on these most informative examples is larger than a predefined threshold.",
        "The motivation behind the overall-uncertainty method is similar to that of the max-confidence method.",
        "However, the max-confidence method only considers the most informative example at each learning cycle.",
        "The overall-uncertainty method considers the overall uncertainty on all unlabeled examples.",
        "If the overall uncertainty of all unlabeled examples becomes very small, we can assume that the current classifier has sufficient confidence on its classification of the remaining unlabeled data.",
        "Based on such assumption, we propose overall-uncertainty method which is to consider whether the average uncertainty value of all remaining unlabeled examples is less than a very small predefined threshold.",
        "There is another problem of estimating classifier performance during active learning process.",
        "Cross-validation on the training set is almost impractical during the active learning procedure, because the alternative of requiring a held-out validation set for active learning is counterproductive.",
        "Hence we should look for a self-contained method.",
        "Actually the motivation behind uncertainty sampling is to find some unlabeled examples near decision boundaries, and use them to clarify the position of decision boundaries.",
        "The current classifier considers such unlabeled examples near decision boundaries as the most informative examples in uncertainty sampling scheme for active learning.",
        "In other words, we assume that an unlabeled example with maximum uncertainty has the highest chance to change the decision boundaries.",
        "Based on the above analysis, we think the active learning process can stop if there is no unla-beled example that can potentially change the decision boundaries.",
        "However, in practice, it is almost impossible to exactly recognize which unlabeled example can truly change the decision boundaries in the next learning cycle, because the true label of each unlabeled example is unknown.",
        "To solve this problem, we make an assumption that labeling an unlabeled example may shift the decision boundaries if this example was previously \"outside\" and is now \"inside\".",
        "In other words, if an unlabeled example is automatically assigned to two different labels during two recent learning cycles , we think that the labeling of this unlabeled example has a good chance to change the decision boundaries.",
        "Based on such assumption, we propose a new approach based on classification change of each unlabeled example during two recent consecutive learning cycles (\"previous\" and \"current\"), called the classification-change method.",
        "Its strategy is to stop the active learning process by considering whether no classification change happens to the remaining unlabeled examples during two recent consecutive learning cycles.",
        "If true, we assume that the current classifier has sufficient confidence on its classification of the remaining unlabeled data, because all unlabeled examples near decision boundaries have been exhausted, and no further labeling will affect active learner."
