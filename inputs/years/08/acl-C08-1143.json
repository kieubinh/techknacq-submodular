        "Among the techniques to solve the knowledge bottleneck problem, active learning is a widely used framework in which the learner has the ability to automatically select the most informative unlabeled examples for human annotation.",
        "The ability of the active learner can be referred to as selective sampling.",
        "Uncertainty sampling (Lewis and Gale, 1994) is a popular selective sampling technique, and has been widely studied in natural language processing (NLP) applications such as word sense disambiguation (WSD) (Chen et al., 2006; Chan and Ng, 2007), text classification (TC) (Lewis and Gale, 1994; Zhu et al., 2008), statistical syntactic parsing (Tang et al., 2002), and named entity recognition (Shen et al., 2004).",
        "Actually the motivation behind uncertainty sampling is to find some unlabeled examples near decision boundaries, and use them to clarify the position of decision boundaries.",
        "However, uncertainly sampling often fails by selecting outliers (Roy and McCallum, 2001; Tang et al., 2002).",
        "These selected outliers (i.e. unlabeled examples) have high uncertainty, but can not provide much help to the learner.",
        "To solve the outlier problem, we proposed in this paper a new method, sampling by uncertainty and density (SUD), in which a K-Nearest-Neighbor-based density (KNN-density) measure is used to determine whether an unlabeled example is an outlier, and a combination strategy based on KNN-density measure and uncertainty measure is designed to select the most informative unlabeled examples for human annotation at each learning iteration.",
        "The second effort we made is to study how to build a representative initial training data set for active learning.",
        "We think building a more representative initial training data set is very helpful for active learning.",
        "In previous studies on active learning, the initial training data set is generally generated at random, based on an assumption that random sampling will be likely to build the initial training set with same prior data distribution as that of whole corpus.",
        "However, this situation seldom occurs in real-world applications due to the small size of initial training set used.",
        "In this paper, we utilize an approach, sampling by clustering (SBC), to selecting the most representative examples to form initial training data set for active learning.",
        "To do it, the whole unlabeled corpus should be first clustered into predefined number of clusters (i.e. the predefined size of the initial training data set).",
        "The example closest to the centroid of each cluster will be selected to augment initial training data set, which is considered as the most representative case.",
        "Finally, we describe an implementation of active learning with SUD and SBC techniques.",
        "Experimental results of active learning for WSD and TC tasks show that our proposed method outperforms competing methods, particularly at the early stages of active learning process.",

        "Such situation would reduce the representativeness of selected examples.",
        "To solve this problem, we tried the sampling scheme of \"most uncertain per cluster\" (Tang et al., 2002) to select the most informative examples.",
        "We think selecting examples from each cluster can alleviate the redundancy problem.",
        "However, this sampling scheme works poorly for WSD and TC on the three data sets, compared to traditional uncertainty sampling.",
        "From the clustering results, we found these resulting clusters are very unbalanced.",
        "It makes sense that more informative examples are contained in a bigger cluster.",
        "In this work, we only use SUD technique to select the most informative examples for active learning.",
        "We plan to study how combining SBC and SUD techniques can enhance the selection of the most informative examples in the future work.",
        "Furthermore, we think that a misclassified unlabeled example may convey more information than a correctly classified unlabeled example which is closer to the decision boundary.",
        "But there is a difficulty that the true label of each unlabeled example is unknown.",
        "To use misclassification information to select the most informative examples, we should study how to automatically determine whether an unlabeled example has been misclassified.",
        "For example, we can make an assumption that an unlabeled example may be misclassified if this example was previously \"outside\" and is now \"inside\".",
        "We will study this issue in the future work.",
        "Actually these proposed techniques can be easily applied for committee-based sampling for active learning.",
        "However, to do so, we should adopt a new uncertainty measurement such as vote entropy to measure the uncertaity of each unlabled example in committee-based sampling scheme."

        "In this paper, we have addressed two issues of active learning, involving the outlier problem of traditional uncertainty sampling, and initial training data set generation.",
        "To solve the outlier problem of traditional uncertainly sampling, we proposed a new method of sampling by uncertainty and density (SUD) in which KNN-density measure and uncertainty measure are combined together to select the most informative unlabeled example for human annotation at each learning cycle.",
        "We employ a method of sampling by clustering (SBC) to generate a representative initial training data set.",
        "Experimental results on three evaluation data sets show that our combined SUD with SBC method achieved the best performance compared to other competing methods, particularly at the early stages of active learning process.",
        "In future work, we will focus on the redundancy problem faced by batch mode active learning, and how to make use of misclassified information to select the most useful examples for human annotation."
