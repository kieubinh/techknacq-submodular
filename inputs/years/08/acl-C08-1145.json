        "One style of Multi-Engine Machine Translation architecture involves choosing the best of a set of outputs from different systems.",
        "Choosing the best translation from an arbitrary set, even in the presence of human references, is a difficult problem; it may prove better to look at mechanisms for making such choices in more restricted contexts.",
        "In this paper we take a classification-based approach to choosing between candidates from syntactically informed translations.",
        "The idea is that using multiple parsers as part of a classifier could help detect syntactic problems in this context that lead to bad translations; these problems could be detected on either the source side – perhaps sentences with difficult or incorrect parses could lead to bad translations – or on the target side – perhaps the output quality could be measured in a more syntactically informed way, looking for syntactic abnormalities.",
        "We show that there is no evidence that the source side information is useful.",
        "However, a target-side classifier, when used to identify particularly bad translation candidates, can lead to significant improvements in Bleu score.",

        "It is fairly safe to say that whenever there are multiple approaches to solving a problem in Artificial Intelligence, the idea of trying to find a better solution by combining those approaches has been proposed: blackboard architectures, ensemble methods for machine learning, and so on.",
        "In Machine Translation (MT), there is a long tradition of combining multiple machine translations, as through a Multi-Engine MT (MEMT) architecture; the origins of this are generally credited to Frederking and Nirenburg (1994).",
        "One way of dividing up such systems is into those that take the whole output from multiple systems and judge between them to select the best candidate, and those that combine elements of the outputs to construct a best candidate.",
        "Deciding between whole sentence level outputs looks like a classical classification problem.",
        "Of course, deciding between MT outputs in the general case is a problem that currently has no good solution, and is unlikely to in the near future: Bleu (and similar metrics) require one or more reference texts to distinguish between candidate outputs with the level of accuracy that they achieve, and even then they are open to substantial criticism (Callison-Burch et al., 2006).",
        "However, there are reasons to think that there is some promise in considering this classification problem.",
        "Corston-Oliver et al.",
        "(2001) build a classifier to distinguish between human and machine translations with an 80% accuracy.",
        "Several other later systems have some success in distinguishing between MT outputs using language models, alignment models, and voting schemes.",
        "In addition, while the problem of deciding between arbitrary MT outputs is difficult, it may be feasible in specific cases.",
        "The classifier constructed by Corston-Oliver et al.",
        "(2001) takes advantage of characteristic mistakes found in the output of the particular MT system used.",
        "In general, we are interested in MT where syntax is involved.",
        "The first part of the main idea of this paper is that there are two ways in which problematic translations might be detected.",
        "One is on the source side: perhaps sentences with difficult or incorrect parses could lead to bad use of syntax and hence bad translations, and this could be detected by a classifier.",
        "The other is that on the target side, perhaps the output quality could be measured in a more syntactically informed way, looking for syntactic abnormalities.",
        "As to the particular system, in this paper we look at a specific type of MT, the output of systems that use syntactic reordering as preprocessing (Collins et al., 2005; Wang et al.. 2007; Zwarts and Dras, 2007).",
        "In these systems, the source language is reordered to mirror the syntax of the target language in certain respects, leading to an improvement in the aggregate quality of the output over the baseline, although it is not always the case that each individual sentence in the reordered version is better.",
        "This could then be framed as an MEMT, where the reordered candidate is considered the default one, backing off to the baseline where the reordered one is worse, based on the decision of a classifier.",
        "Given the 'unnatural' order of the preprocessed source side, there is reason to expect that bad or unsuccessful reordered translations might be detectable.",
        "The second part of the main idea of the paper is that a classifier could use a combination of multiple parsers, as in Mutton et al.",
        "(2007), to indicate problems.",
        "In that work, designed to assess fluency of output of generation systems, metrics were developed from various parsers – log probability of most likely parse, number of tree fragments, and so on – that correlated with human judgements, and that could be combined in a classifier to produce a better evaluation metric.",
        "We take such an approach as a starting point for developing classifiers to indicate problematic source and target sides within a reordering MT system.",
        "In Section 2 we review some related work.",
        "In Section 3 we investigate the potential gain in correctly choosing the better translation candidate in our context.",
        "In Section 4 we build a classifier using an approximation to fairly standard language and alignment model features, mostly for use as a comparator, while Sections 5 and 6 present our models based on source and target language sides respectively.",
        "Section 7 concludes."

        "Callison-Burch and Flournoy (2001) use a trigram language model (LM) on MT outputs to decide the best candidate, looking at nine systems across four language directions and domains, and treating them as black boxes; evaluation is by human judges and on a fairly small data set.",
        "Akiba et al.",
        "(2002) score MT outputs by a combination of a standard LM and an alignment model (here IBM 4), and then use statistical tests to determine rankings of MT system outputs.",
        "Eisele (2005) uses a heuristic voting scheme based on n-gram overlap of the different outputs, and adds an LM to make decisions; the LM reportedly achieves further improvement.",
        "Rosti et al.",

        "Huang and Papineni (2007) propose a hierarchical model for word, phrase and sentence level combination; they use LMs and interestingly find that incorporating rudimentary linguistic information like Part-of-Speech is helpful.",
        "Riezler and Maxwell (2006) combine transfer-based and statistical MT; they back off to the SMT translation when the grammar is inadequate, analysing the grammar to determine this.",
        "Other work, like ours, uses a classifier.",
        "The goal of Corston-Oliver et al.",
        "(2001) is slightly different, in that it aims to distinguish human translations from MT output.",
        "The classifier uses syntactic features derived from a manual error analysis, taking advantage of characteristics specific to their MT system and parser.",
        "Nomoto (2003) uses a LM and an IBM-based alignment model, and then constructs separate SVMs for regression based on these, each with a single feature (i.e. the LM value or the alignment model value); the SVM is thus not strictly used classifier, but as a regression tool.",
        "Nomoto (2004) extends this by deciding on the best LM through a voting scheme.",
        "Other related work not in an MEMT context that uses parsers to distinguish better from worse translations are on syntax-based language models (Charniak et al., 2003) and on syntactically informed reranking (Och et al.. 2003).",

        "The type of system we focus on in this paper operates in two stages.",
        "First, syntactically based reordering takes place to make the source sentence more similar in structure to the syntax of the target language.",
        "This is then passed to a Phrase-based SMT (PSMT) component (Pharaoh (Koehn, 2004) in the cited work).",
        "For German to English (Collins et al., 2005) and Dutch to English (Zwarts and Dras, 2007) this reordering involves moving some long-distance dependencies closer together, such as clause-final participles and verb-second auxiliaries.",
        "This improves translation quality by compensating for the weakness in PSMT of long-distance word reordering: Collins et al.",
        "(2005) report a 1.6 Bleu percentage point improvement, Zwarts and Dras (2007) a 1.0 Bleu percentage point improvement.",
        "However, individual sentences translated from the original non-reordered source sentences are sometimes better than their reordered equivalent; examples are given in both Collins et al.",
        "(2005) and Zwarts and Dras (2007).",
        "(We refer to these in the rest of the paper as non-reordered translations and reordered translations respectively.)",
        "For there to be a point to constructing an MEMT-style system where the reordered translation is the default translation and the non-reordered translation the fallback, it is necessary for the nonreordered version to be better a reasonable proportion of the time, allowing scope for a Bleu improvement across the system.",
        "To determine if this is the case, we construct an approximate oracle to choose the better of each pair of reordered and non-reordered translation sentences.",
        "While Bleu is a reasonable choice for evaluating the quality of the overall composite set of translation sentences, it is not suitable for sentence-level decisions.",
        "However, in line with Nomoto (2003)'s motivation for developing m-precision as an alternative to Bleu, we make the following observation.",
        "The Bleu score (ignoring brevity) is an harmonic mean between the different n-gram components: N ea:p(En=ilogPn)",
        "Here pn is the precision for the different n-gram overlap counts of a candidate sentence with a gold standard sentence.",
        "If we want to globally optimise this score for an optimal Bleu document score, we need to pick for each sentence the n-gram counts that contribute most to the overall score.",
        "For example, if we have to pick between sentence A and sentence B. where A has 2 unigram counts and 1 bigram count, and B has 2 unigram counts only, A is clearly preferred; however, for sentences C and D, where C has 4 unigram counts and D has 2 unigram counts and 1 bigram count, we do not know which eventually will lead to the global maximum Bleu.",
        "However we observe that because it is an harmonic mean, small values are weighted exponentially heavier, due to the log operator.",
        "Our heuristic to achieve the highest score is to have the most extreme possible small values.",
        "Since we know that an n-gram is always less frequent than an (n – l)-gram we concentrate on the higher n-grams first.",
        "The decision process between sentences is therefore to choose the candidate with higher n-gram counts for the maximum value of n, then n – 1-gram counts, and so on down to unigrams.",
        "Here we will work with the Dutch-English data used by Zwarts and Dras (2007).",
        "We use the portions of the Europarl corpus (Koehn, 2003) that were used for training in that work; and Bleu with 1 reference with n-grams up to length 4.",
        "We then use our heuristic to select between the reordered and non-reordered translation candidates of Zwarts and Dras (2007) for the language direction Dutch to English.",
        "Selecting the reordered translation as default and backing off leads to a 1.1 Bleu percentage point improvement over the 1.0 already mentioned.",
        "Results for English to Dutch are similar.",
        "In Table 1 we see the breakdown of the entire corpus we work with.",
        "Some sentences are identical, and some are different but with no indication by our heuristic as to which of the two is better.",

        "Because our two candidate solutions are both ultimately produced by Pharaoh (Koehn, 2004), our quick-and-dirty solution can use Pharaoh's own final translation probabilities, which capture language and alignment model information.",

        "Predictions with an extreme score on the other side of the scale hardly show an improvement.",
        "Because this subset of sentences shows a higher accuracy, it is worthwhile to calculate Bleu scores over the sentences in the test set belonging to the top 500 SVM-predictions positive (reordered translation is better) and the 500 SVM predictions negative (non-reordered is better).",
        "Table 8 shows the improvement of Bleu scores.",
        "The first interesting thing which can be seen in the table is that this subset of sentences already has higher improvement than is seen in the whole data set simply by choosing the reordered only, because the SVM is already used to pick the most discriminating sentences.",
        "We note that on this subset of sentences our technique of picking the right sentence actually scores an improvement equal to the use of reordering by itself.",
        "In Table 9 we show the effects of individual parsers, taking as the starting point the SVM of Table 5.",
        "Clearly, combining parsers leads to a much better decider.",
        "As the results of classifying translation outputs using features derived from multiple parsers are promising, we next look at whether it is useful to combine this information with the language and alignment model information from Section 4.",
        "Remarkably, as can be seen in Table 10, the combination of these two features has a much greater effect that the two features sets individually.",
        "Comparing these scores against 80% accuracy achieved in distinguish MT output from human output in the work of Corston-Oliver et al.",
        "(2001), this 60% on a dataset with much more subtle differences is quite promising.",
        "Furthermore Table 11 shows the accuracy ranking of the SVM for the combining model for the extreme SVM-predictions, similar to Tables 4 and 7.",
        "The last column of Table 11 matches previous tables, but now we also show an improvement in correct prediction for the reordered cases."

        "In this paper we have looked at a restricted MEMT scenario, where we choose between a syntactic-reordering-as-preprocessing translation candidate, in the style of (Collins et al., 2005), and a baseline PSMT candidate.",
        "We have shown that using a classifier built around outputs of multiple parsers, to decide whether to back off to the baseline candidate, can be successful in selecting the right candidate.",
        "There is no indication that classifying information on the source side – looking to see whether sentences with difficult or incorrect parses could lead to bad reorderings and hence bad translations – is useful; however, applying such a classifier to the target side – looking to see whether the output quality could be measured in a syntactically informed way, looking for syntactic abnormalities – is successful in detecting particularly bad translation candidates, and leads to an improvement in Bleu score over the reordered translations equal to the improvement gained by the reordering approach over the baseline.",
        "Multiple parsers clearly improve the results over single parsers.",
        "The target-side classifier can also be usefully combined with language and alignment model features, improving its accuracy substantially; continuing with such an approach looks like a promising direction.",
        "As a further step, the results are sufficiently positive to extend to other sorts of syntactically informed SMT.",
