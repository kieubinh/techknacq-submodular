        "In phrase-based statistical machine translation (Koehn et al., 2003) phrases extracted from word-aligned parallel data are the fundamental unit of translation.",
        "Each phrase is a sequence of contiguous translatable words and there is no explicit model of syntax or structure.",
        "Our focus is the process by which a string of words is segmented as a sequence of such phrases.",
        "Ideally, the segmentation process captures two aspects of natural language.",
        "Firstly, segmentations should reflect the underlying grammatical sentence structure.",
        "Secondly, common sequences of words should be grouped as phrases in order to preserve context and respect collocations.",
        "Although these aspects of translation are not evaluated explicitly, phrases have been found very useful in translation.",
        "Lhey have the advantage that, within phrases, words appear as they were found in fluent text.",
        "However, reordering of phrases in translation can lead to disfluencies.",
        "By defining a distribution over possible segmentations, we hope to address such disfluencies.",
        "A strength of our approach is that it exploits abundantly available monolingual corpora that are usually only used for training word language models.",
        "Most prior work on phrase-based statistical language models concerns the problem of identifying useful phrasal units.",
        "In (Ries et al., 1996) an iterative algorithm selectively merges pairs of words as phrases with the goal of minimising perplexity.",
        "Several criteria including word pair frequencies, unigram and bigram log likelihoods, and a correlation coefficient related to mutual information are compared in (Kuo and Reichl, 1999).",
        "Lhe main difference between these approaches and the work described here is that we already have a definition of the phrases of interest (i.e. the phrases of the phrase table extracted from parallel text) and we focus instead on estimating a distribution over the set of possible alternative segmentations of the sentence."

        "Under the generative model of phrase-based statistical machine translation, a source sentence s[ generates sequences uf = u\\,..., uk of source language phrases that are to be translated.",
        "Sentences cannot be segmented into phrases arbitrarily: the space of possible segmentations is constrained by the contents of the phrase table which consists of phrases found with translations in the parallel text.",
        "We start initially with a distribution in which segmentations assume the following dependencies:",
        "Lhe distribution over the number of phrases K is chosen to be uniform, i.e. P(K\\I) = 1/1, K e {1,2,...,/}, and all segmentations are considered equally likely.",
        "Lhe probability of a particular segmentation is therefore ifuf = s[ otherwise where C(K, s{) is chosen to ensure normalisation and the phrases u\\,..., uk are found in the phrase table.",
        "This simple model of segmentation has been found useful in practice (Kumar et al., 2006).",
        "Our goal is to improve upon the uniform segmentation of equation (2) by estimating the phrasal segmentation model parameters from naturally oc-curing phrase sequences in a large monolingual training corpus.",
        "An order-n phrasal segmentation model assigns a probability to a phrase sequence Ui according to where the approximation is due to the Markov assumption that only the most recent n – 1 phrases are useful when predicting the next phrase.",
        "Again, each uk must be a phrase with a known translation.",
        "For a fixed sentence s[, the normalisation term C(K,s{) can be calculated.",
        "In translation, however, calculating this quantity becomes harder since the s[ are not fixed.",
        "We therefore ignore the normalisation and use the unnormalised likelihoods as scores.",
        "We focus on first-order phrasal segmentation models.",
        "Although we have experimented with higher-order models we have not yet found them to yield improved translation.",
        "Let f(uk-i,Uk) be the frequency of occurrence of a string of words w\\ in a very large training corpus that can be split at position x such that i < x < j and the substrings and wJx match precisely the words of two phrases uk-\\ and uk in the phrase table.",
        "The maximum likelihood probability estimate for phrase bigrams is then their relative frequency:",
        "These maximum likelihood estimates are discounted and smoothed with context-dependent backoff such that where 5{uk-\\,uk) discounts the maximum likelihood estimates and the context-specific backoff weights a{uk-\\) are chosen to ensure normalisation."

        "We note that the raw counts of equation (4) are collected prior to translation and the first-order probabilities are estimated only for phrases found in the lattice.",
        "The phrasal segmentation model is composed with the phrase lattice and projected on the input to obtain the rescored word lattice V = (L o W) o The most likely translation after applying the phrasal segmentation model is found as the path in L with least cost.",
