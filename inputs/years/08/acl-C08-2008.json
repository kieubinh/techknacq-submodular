        "So, the system must deal with problems ranging from tokenization and ambiguity to syntactic agreement and examination of local contexts.",

        "Basque postpositions play a role similar to English prepositions, with the difference that they appear at the end of noun phrases or postpositional phrases.",
        "They are defined as \"forms that represent grammatical relations among phrases appearing in a sentence\" (Euskaltzaindia, 1994).",
        "There are two main types of postpositions in Basque: (1) a suffix appended to a lemma and, (2) a suffix followed by a lemma (main element) that can also be inflected.",
        "(1) etxe-tik house-(from the) from the house (2) etxe-aren gain-etik house-(of the) top-(from the) from the top of the house",
        "The last type of elements has been termed as complex postposition.",
        "We will use this term to name the whole sequence of two words involved, and not just to refer to the second element.",
        "Complex postpositions can be described as:",
        "In these constructions, the second lemma is fixed for each postposition, while the first lemma allows for much more variation, ranging from every noun to some specific semantic classes.",
        "The above description (3) is intended to stress (with parentheses) the fact that the combination of both suffixes with the second lemma acts as a complex case-suffix that is \"appended\" to the first lemma.",
        "Both suffixes present different combinations of number and case, which can agree in several ways, depending on the lemma, case or contextual factors.",
        "Table 1 shows the different variants of two complex postpositions, derived from the lemmas bitarte and aurre.",
        "For example, the lemma bitarte is polysemous (\"means, by means of, instrument, while (temporal), between\").",
        "Multiple factors affect the correctness of a postposition, including morphological and syntactic constraints.",
        "We also discovered a number of relevant contextual factors, which are not explicitly accounted for in standard grammars."

        "The detection of erroneous uses of complex postpositions needs first a corpus that can serve for both development and evaluation of the system.",
        "To obtain such a corpus is a labor-intensive task, to which it must be added the examination and markup of incorrect examples.",
        "The use of a big \"correct\" corpus will allow us to test our system negatively, thoroughly testing the system's behavior in respect to false alarms.",
        "We used an automatic system for detecting complex postpositions in order to get development and test data.",
        "There are two text types: Newspaper corpora (henceforth NC, 8,207,919 word-forms) that is subject to an edition process and style guides, and Learner corpora (LC, 994,658 word-forms), which come from texts written by learners of Basque and University students.",
        "These texts are more \"susceptible\" of containing errors.",
        "We decided to study those types of postpositions that appear most frequently in texts, those containing the following lemmas as their second element: arte, aurre, bitarte, buruz, and zehar.",
        "We selected these postpositions given that they are well documented in grammar books, with detailed descriptions of their correct and incorrect uses (e.g. see Table 1 for bitarte), and also that they are very frequent in both types of texts.",
        "Each kind of syntactic error occurs with very low frequency and, therefore, big corpora are needed for evaluation and testing.",
        "Even if such corpora are available, to obtain naturally occurring test data, hundreds of texts should be manually examined and marked.",
        "As a result, we decided to only manually mark errors in Learners' Corpora (LC), because NC, an order of magnitude bigger than LC, is presumed to contain less errors.",
        "This implies that we will be able to measure precision in both corpora, while recall will only be evaluated in LC.",
        "Table 2 shows the number of sentences used for development (60% of each corpus) and test (40%).",

        "Although at first glance it could seem that postpositions imply the examination of two consecutive words, a posterior analysis showed that they offer rich and varied contexts of application, requiring the inspection of several context words, albeit not enough to need a full syntactic or semantic analysis of sentences.",
        "The system uses a varied set of linguistic resources, ranging from morphological analysis to specialized lexical resources.",
        "As the detection of these errors implies a detailed and expert linguistic knowledge, the system uses a purely knowledge-based approach.",
        "A considerable effort has been invested in the compilation of a corpus that provides a testbed for the system, which should be representative enough as to predict the behaviour of the system in an environment of a grammar checker.",
        "For that reason, we have tried to put a real emphasis on avoiding false alarms, that is, treating also lots of correct instances.",
        "The results show that good precision can be obtained.",
        "Regarding recall, our experiments do not allow to make an estimation, as the NC test corpora is too big to perform a detailed examination.",
        "However, the LC corpora can give us an upper bound of 65% (see Table 3).",
        "This work also shows that the use of purely morphosyntactic information is not enough for the detection of errors in postpositions.",
        "For that reason we were forced to also include several types of semantic features into the system.",
        "On the other hand, the process of automatic error detection has also helped us to explore new sets of semantic distinctions.",
        "So, the process of error detection has helped us to organize concepts into sets of semantically related elements, and can serve to make explicit types of knowledge that can be used to enrich other linguistic resources.",
        "We can conclude saying that descriptive linguistics could benefit from error diagnosis and detection, as this could help to deeply understand the linguistic descriptions of postpositions, which are done at the moment mainly by means of morphosyntactic information, insufficient to give an account of the involved phenomena."
