        "Nominal phrases have long been a concern in linguistic research and language processing (e.g., Copestake and Briscoe, 2005; Giegerich, 2004).",
        "Generally, nominal phrases can be classified into two categories according to whether they contain attributive clauses or not.",
        "We focus on nominal phrases without attributive clauses.",
        "Closely related with nominal phrases, nominal compounds or base NPs have also attracted a great attention in language processing.",
        "Generally, nominal compounds refer to nominal phrases consisting of a series of nouns, while base NPs refer to non-recursive nominal phrases.",
        "However, such compounds or base NPs usually co-occur with other non-nominal words in running texts, and it is impossible to separate them during analysis.",
        "Furthermore, there exist syntactic makers for attributive clauses, e.g., 'which' or 'who' in English and ' (of)' in Chinese, nominal phrases without attributive clauses tend to be a better linguistic category for theoretical and practical investigation.",
        "To analyze NPs, we need first to determine what kinds of information are to be recognized.",
        "In this work, we focus on conceptual relatedness between words.",
        "For example, in linguistics and law books, linguistic and law are both conceptually related with books, although linguistics doesn't have a superficial syntactic relation with books.",
        "Then, we need to fulfill two sub-tasks.",
        "One is about representation, i.e., what schemes are to be used.",
        "The other is about analysis, i.e., how to derive the formal representation.",
        "Regarding representation scheme, one possible strategy would be using syntactic structures, as are usually used in analysis for sentences.",
        "However, syntactic components for NPs, unlike those for sentences (e.g., V, VP, A, AP, and S, etc.",
        "), are difficult to differentiate, and rules governing nominal phrases are especially difficult to determine.",
        "As an example, consider (bank loan interest), which is a nominal compound consisting of three serial nouns.",
        "For such a NP, if a rule with binary combination is used, it would produce two structures for the unambiguous NP.",
        "If a rule with triple combination is used, as in Chinese Treebank (Xue et al., 2005), it would be difficult to disclose the lexical relation between (bank) and (loan).",
        "Another possible representation strategy would be using dependency structures (Mel'cuk, 1988).",
        "Under this strategy, a NP could be represented as a dependency tree, which captures various lexical control or dependency in the phrase.",
        "However, traditional framework only focuses on syntactic dependency, while conceptual relatedness may exist without syntactic relations.",
        "For example, for (economic development and law construction in Shanghai), in traditional dependency analysis, (Shanghai) would depend on the conjunction word (and), since conjunction words are usually regarded as heads in coordinate structures.",
        "Although the relatedness may go downward from the head, it would be difficult to derive the relatedness between (Shanghai) and (economic) or (law), since the two words are even not heads of the conjuncts (economic development) and (law development).",
        "As to analysis of NPs, there have been a lot of work on statistical techniques for lexical dependency parsing of sentences (Collins and Roark, 2004; McDonald et al., 2005), and these techniques potentially can be used for analysis of NPs if appropriate resources for NPs are available.",
        "However, these techniques are all meant to building a dependency tree, while the conceptual relatedness in NPs may form a graph, with multi-dependency allowed.",
        "Additionally, these methods generally suffer from the difficulty of local estimation from limited contexts and the structural information is difficult to be exploited (Califf and Mooney, 2003).",
        "Recently, relational learning methods in general and inductive logic programming (ILP) in particular have attracted a great of attention due to their capability of going beyond finite feature vectors and exploiting unbounded structural information from data (Califf and Mooney, 2003; Page et al., 2003; Srinivasan et al., 2003).",
        "In this work, we try to extend syntactic dependency to conceptual dependency to capture the embedded lexical relatedness, and use ILP to analyze nominal phrases, making use of the structural information provided by the resources based on conceptual dependency."

      "heading": "2. Conceptual dependency",
      "text": [
        "In comparison with syntactic dependency, conceptual dependency may allow a word to be dependent on multiple words at the same time.",
        "For example, in (Economic development and law construction in Shanghai), (Shanghai) conceptually relates with both (economic) and (law), while in",
        "(activity of blood donation for university student volunteers), (university student) relates on both (volunteer) and (blood donation).",
        "In addition, syntactic dependency doesn't exactly specify what kind of relatedness held between words, although the words denoting the relatedness may occur within NPs.",
        "For example, 1) is an ambiguous compound with two possible interpretations listed in 2).",
        "1) (student discussion)",
        "2) i) discussion by students ii) discussion about students",
        "However, the dependency trees corresponding with the two interpretations remain the same: (student) depends on (discussion) in both cases.",
        "In fact, their difference lies in the exact semantic relations held between the words:",
        "(student) is agent and patient of (discussion) in 2i) and 2ii) respectively.",
        "This suggests that only syntactic dependency is not enough to reflect conceptual difference.",
        "Notice that in (2), the relations between the two words (student) and (discussion) are denoted by two proper nouns, agent and patient, which may never co-occur with them in running texts.",
        "However, in some cases, some word co-occurring with two conceptually related words do denote the relatedness exactly.",
        "Consider",
        "(car in read color), where (color) relates with both (car) and (red).",
        "In the conceptual view, (color) can be seen as a feature of (car), and (red) can be seen as a kind of value for the feature, as was also adopted in dealing with adjectives in WordNet (Fellbaum, 1988).",
        "In this setting, (red) directly depends on (car), and (color) represents the relation between them.",
        "In building the resource for Chinese NPs, the conceptual relatedness is based on semantic reference, while the dependency is based on syntactic or potential syntactic relations.",
        "The feature words we adopt are mostly listed in a medium class, coded as Z)n, in a Chinese thesaurus, Tongyici Cilin (henceafter Cilin, Mei et al., 1982).",
        "Function words (e.g., (from)), Part words (e.g., (leg)) and Number words (e.g., (count)) are also regarded as feature words."

        "For each training sample, we have a nominal phrase and its corresponding conceptual dependency graph.",
        "To learn the rules mapping from dependency graphs to word strings, we need to tag the words with their sense labels, which denote the synsets in the thesaurus (Mei et al., 1982).",
        "For the sense tagging, we used the same method as in (Yarowsky, 1992) and used the minor categories in the thesaurus as the synsets.",
        "Generally, a rule consists of two parts, Gr and Sr. Gr is a dependency sub-graph and Sr is a sense label string.",
        "Intuitively, conceptual configuration in Gr is represented by the label string of Sr.",
        "To capture more structural information, we need to find the maximal sub-graph in the training data, whose corresponding labels form a continuous substring in the training data.",
        "But the problem is NP hard, and we thus use heuristics to find am optimally maximal sub-graphs.",
        "However, the search has a bias to larger sub-graphs, and to avoid the bias, we set the coverage of a sub-graph as the penalty.",
        "Here, the coverage of the sub-graph refers to the percentage of the nodes in the sub-graphs among all the nodes in the training data.",
        "The overall algorithm is:",
        "i) to find the most common edge in the training data, whose corresponding label strings are continuous;",
        "ii) to add another edge to the sub-graph, if the label strings corresponding with the new sub-graph are still continuous until the coverage of the sub-graph doesn't increase.",
        "After finding such a sub-graph, we merge all the nodes into one, and merge the sense label strings into one, and repeat the process until all the nodes in the training data are covered The result of the learning is a set of rules, and each rule specifies a sub-graph and a label string.",
        "For example, w got a rule which includes the sub-graph in Fig. 2 and sense label string in 3).",
        "For rule generalization, we don't try to compress the rule set, and simply use the sense hierarchy in the thesaurus, including the minor, medium and major classes.",
        "After training phase, we get a set of learned rules.",
        "During parsing, the task is to find a conceptual dependency graph for a new input data, which would generate the NP using the learned rules.",
        "The optimal parsing can be implemented in a greedy manner.",
        "First, one dependency with two words is selected.",
        "Then, another word is added if the resulted conceptual dependency graph generates a word string which best matches the input nominal phrase.",
        "This process can be repeated until the graph includes all the words in the data.",
        "To compare the generated word string with the original input, we use edit distance between them, which is based on the times of operations (including adjacent move, deletion, insertion) needed to convert one word string to another."
