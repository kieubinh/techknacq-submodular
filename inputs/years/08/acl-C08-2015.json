        "In the past years, a great number of spoken dialogue systems have been developed.",
        "Their typical task domains include airline information (ATIS & DARPA Communicator) and bus location tasks.",
        "Although the above systems can handle simple database retrieval or transactions with constrained dialogue flows, they are expected to handle more complex tasks.",
        "Meanwhile, more and more electronic text resources are recently being accumulated.",
        "Since most documents are indexed (e.g., via Web search engines), we are potentially capable of accessing these documents.",
        "Reflecting such a situation, in recent years, the target of spoken dialogue systems has been extended to retrieval of general documents (Chang et al., 2002).",
        "There are quite a few choices for handling user utterances and generating responses in the spoken dialogue systems that require parameter tuning.",
        "Since a subtle change in these choices may affect the behavior the entire system, they are usually tuned by hand by an expert.",
        "It is also the case in speech-baed document retrieval systems.",
        "We can make use of N-best hypotheses to realize robust retrieval against errors in automatic speech recognition (ASR).",
        "Input queries are often vague or fragmented in speech interfaces, thus concatenation of contextual information is important to make meaningful retrieval.",
        "Such decisions tend to be optimized module by module, but they should be done in an integrated way.",
        "For example, we could make more appropriate retrieval by rescoring the N-best ASR hypotheses by the information retrieval scores.",
        "Even if the target document is identified, the system has several choices for generating responses.",
        "Confirmation is needed to eliminate any misunderstandings caused by ASR errors, but users easily become irritated with so many redundant confirmations.",
        "Although there are several works dealing with dialogue management in call routing systems (Levin and Pieraccini, 2006), they cannot handle the complex decision making processes in information guidance tasks.",
        "Therefore, we address the extension of conventional optimization methods of dialogue management to be applicable to general document retrieval tasks.",
        "In particular, we propose a dialogue management that optimizes the choices in response generation by minimizing Bayes risk.",
        "The Bayes risk is defined based on reward for correct information presentation and penalty for redundant turns as well as the score of document retrieval and answer extraction."
