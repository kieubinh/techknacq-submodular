        "A critical difficulty encountered in the model with label correlation features is the computational cost for training and decoding.",
        "When features on every pair of labels are included in the model, its graphical model becomes a complete graph, which indicates that the exact inference for this model is NP-hard.",
        "However, not all edges are necessary in actual inference, because of the sparsity of features.",
        "That is, we can remove edges between I and V when no corresponding features are active; i.e., fi,i',w(x, y) = 0 for all w. In text categorization, when feature selection is performed, many edges can be removed because of this characteristic.",
        "Therefore, our idea is to enjoy this sparsity of features.",
        "We construct a graphical model for each document, and put edges only when one or more features are active on the corresponding label pair.",
        "When a graph is sparse, we can apply a method for exact inference, such as the junction tree algorithm (Cowell et al., 1999).",
        "The junction tree algorithm is a generic algorithm for exact inference on any graphical model, and it allows for efficient inference on sparse graphs.",
        "The method converts a graph into a junction tree, which is a tree of cliques in the original graph.",
        "When we have a junction tree for each document, we can efficiently perform belief propagation in order to compute argmax in Equation (1), or the marginal probabilities of cliques and labels, necessary for the parameter estimation of machine learning classifiers, including perceptrons (Collins, 2002), and maximum entropy models (Berger et al., 1996).",
        "The computational complexity of the inference on junction trees is proportional to the exponential of the tree width, which is the maximum number of labels in a clique, minus one.",
        "An essential idea of this method is that a graphical model is constructed for each document.",
