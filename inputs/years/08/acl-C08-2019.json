        "One important information need shared by many people is to find out about opinions and perspectives on a particular topic (Mishne and de Rijke, 2006; Pang and Lee, 2008).",
        "In fact, locating relevant subjective texts was a core task in the 2006 and 2007 TREC Blog tracks (Ounis et al., 2006; Ounis et al., 2008).",
        "Most participants considered a two-phase re-ranking approach, where first topic-based relevancy search was employed, and then some sort of filtering for subjectivity was applied; these filters were based on trained classifiers or subjectivity lexicons.",
        "We propose an alternative approach to review search, one that is unsupervised and that does not rely on pre-existing dictionaries.",
        "Rather, it in essence simply re-ranks the top k topic-based search results by placing those that have the least idiosyncratic term distributions, with respect to the statistics of the top k results, at the head of the list.",
        "The fact that it is the least, not the most, rare terms with respect to the search results that are most indicative of subjectivity may at first seem rather counterintuitive; indeed, previous work has found rare terms to be important subjectivity cues (Wiebe et al., 2004).",
        "However, reviews within a given set of search results may tend to resemble each other because they tend to all discuss salient attributes of the topic in question."

        "Define a search set as the top n webpages returned in response to a review-or opinion-oriented query by a high-quality initial search engine, in our case, the top 20 returned by Yahoo!.",
        "As a question of both pragmatic and scientific value, we consider how much information can be gleaned simply from the items in the search set itself; in particular, we ask whether the subjective texts in the search set can be ranked above the objective ones solely from examination of the patterns of term occurrences across the search-set documents.",
        "The idea we pursue is based in part on the assumption that the initial search engine is of relatively high quality, so that many of the search-set documents probably are, in fact, subjective.",
        "Therefore, reordering the top-ranked documents by how much they resemble the other search-set documents in aggregate may be a good way to identify the reviews.",
        "Indeed, perhaps the reviews will be similar to one another because they all tend to discuss salient features of the topic in question.",
        "Suppose we have defined a search-set rarity function Rarityss(i) (see Section 2.1 below) that varies inversely with the number of documents in the search set that contain the term t. Then, we define the idiosyncrasy score of a document d as the average search-set rarity of the most common terms it contains:",
        "tGfc-commonest-terms((i)",
        "where fc-commonest-terms(d) is the k commonest terms in the search set that also occur in d. For example, when we set k to be the size of the vocabulary of d, the idiosyncrasy score is the average search-set rarity of all the terms d contains.",
        "Then, to instantiate the similarity intuition outlined above, we simply rank by decreasing idiosyncrasy.",
        "The reason we look at just the top most common terms is that the rarer terms might be noise.",
        "For example, terms that occur in just a few of the search-set documents might represent page-or site-specific information that is irrelevant to the query; but the presence of such terms does not necessarily indicate that the document in question is objective.",
        "One potential problem with the approach outlined above is the presence of stopwords, since all documents, subjective or objective, can be expected to contain many of them.",
        "Therefore, stop-word removal is indicated as an important preprocessing step.",
        "As it turns out, the commonly-used InQuery stopword list (Allan et al., 2000) contains terms like \"less\" that, while uninformative for topic-based information retrieval, may be important for subjectivity detection.",
        "Therefore, we used a 102-item list based solely on frequencies in the British National Corpus.",
        "There are various ways to define a search-set rarity function on terms.",
        "Inspired by the efficacy of the inverse document frequency (IDF) in information retrieval, we consider several definitions for Rarityss(i).",
        "Let nss(t) be the number of documents in the search set (not the entire corpus) that contain the term t. Due to space constraints, we only report results for:",
        "which is linearly increasing in l/nss(t), (as befits a measure of \"idiosyncrasy\").",
        "The other definitions we considered were logarithmic or polynomial in l/nss{t), and performed similarly to the linear function.",
        "OpinionFinder is a state-of-the-art publicly available software package for sentiment analysis that can be applied to determining sentence-level subjectivity (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003; Wiebe and Riloff, 2005).",
        "It employs a number of preprocessing steps, including sentence splitting, part-of-speech tagging, stemming, and shallow parsing.",
        "Shallow parsing is needed to identify the extraction patterns that the sentence classifiers incorporate.",
        "We used OpinionFinder's sentence-level outputto perform document-level subjectivity re-ranking as follows.",
        "The result of running OpinionFinder's sentence classifier is that each valid sentence is annotated with one of three labels: \"subj\", \"obj\", or \"unknown\".",
        "First, discard the sentences labeled \"unknown\".",
        "Then, rank the documents by decreasing percentage of subjective sentences among those sentences that are left.",
        "In the case of ties, we use the ranking produced by the initial search engine.",
        "We also considered a more lightweight way to incorporate linguistic knowledge: score each document according the percentage of adjectives within the set of tokens it contains.",
        "The motivation is previous work suggesting that the presence of adjectives is a strong indicator of the subjectivity of the enclosing sentence (Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000; Wiebe et al., 2004).",

The overall performance is also on par with Opin-ionFinder; for instance, according to the paired t-test, the only statistically significant performance difference (.05 level) between the accuracy-emphasizing version of OpinionFinder and the idiosyncrasy-based algorithm for k = 100 is for precision at 10.",

        "We considered the task of document-level subjectivity re-ranking of search sets, a task modeling a scenario in which a search engine is queried to find reviews.",
        "We found that our proposed term-distributional, idiosyncrasy-based algorithm yielded the best precision for the very top ranks, whereas the more linguistically-oriented, knowledge-rich approach exemplified by Opinion-Finder gave the best results for precision at lower ranks.",
        "It therefore seems that both types of information can be very valuable for the subjectivity re-ranking task, since they have somewhat complementary performance behaviors and both outperform the initial search engine and an adjectivebased approach.",
        "Our motivation that within a search set, reviews tend to resemble one another rather than differ is reminiscent of intuitions underlying the use of pseudo relevance feedback (PF) in IR (Ruthven and Lalmas, 2003, Section 3.5).",
