        "Discourse relations between textual units are considered key for the ability to properly interpret or produce discourse.",
        "Various theories of discourse have been developed (Moore and Wiemer-Hastings, 2003) and different relation taxonomies have been proposed (Hobbs, 1979; McKeown, 1985; Mann and Thompson, 1988; Knott and Sanders, 1998).",
        "Among the most cognitively salient relations are causal (contingency), contrast (comparison), and temporal.",
        "Very often, the discourse relations are explicit, signaled directly by the use of appropriate discourse connectives:",
        "(El) He is very tired because he played tennis all morning.",
        "(E2) He is not very strong, but he can run amazingly fast.",
        "(E3) We had some tea in the afternoon and later went to a restaurant for a big dinner.",
        "Discourse relations can also be implicit, inferred by the context of the utterance and general world knowledge.",
        "(11) I took my umbrella this morning, [because] The forecast was rain in the afternoon.",
        "(12) She is never late for meetings, [but] He always arrives 10 minutes late.",
        "(13) She woke up early, [afterward] She had breakfast and went for a walk in the park.",
        "An additional complication for automatic classification of discourse relations is that even in the presence of an explicit discourse connective, the connective might be ambiguous between several senses.",
        "For example, since can be used to signal either a temporal or a contingency relation.",
        "They have not spoken to each other since they argued last",
        "fall.",
        "(Temporal) I assumed you were not coming since you never replied to the invitation.",
        "(Causal)",
        "Several questions directly related to efforts in automatic recognition of discourse relations arise:",
        "In a general text, what is the proportion of explicit versus implicit relations?",
        "Since implicit relations are presumably harder to recognize automatically, the larger their proportion, the more difficult the overall prediction of discourse relation will be.",
        "How ambiguous are discourse connectives?",
        "The degree of ambiguity would give an upper bound on the accuracy with which explicit relations can be identified.",
        "The more ambiguous discourse connectives are, the more difficult it would be to automatically decide which discourse relation is expressed in a given sentence, even in the presence of a connective.",
        "In a text, are adjacent discourse relations independent of each other or are certain sequences of relations more likely?",
        "In the latter case, a \"discourse grammar\" of text can be used and easy to identify relations such as unambiguous explicit relations can help determine the class of implicit relations that immediately follow or precede them.",
        "In this study, we address the above questions using the largest existing corpus manually annotated with discourse relations – the Penn Discourse Tree Bank (Prasad et al., 2008)."

        "There are a total of 16,584 implicit relations annotated in the corpus.",
