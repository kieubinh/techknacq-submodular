        "Computational stylistics investigates texts from the standpoint of individual style (author identification) or functional style (genres, registers).",
        "Because in all computational stylistic studies / approaches, a process of comparison of two or more texts is involved, in a way or another, there was always a need for a distance function to measure similarity (more precisely dissimilarity) of texts from the stylistic point of view.",
        "Such distance measures were proposed and used for example in authorship identification (Labbe and Labbe, 2001; Burrows, 2002) or clustering texts by genre (Luy-ckx et al., 2006).",
        "In this paper we propose a new distance measure designed to reflect stylistic similarity between texts.",
        "As style markers we used the function word frequencies.",
        "Function words are generally considered good indicators of style because their use is very unlikely to be under the conscious control of the author and because of their psychological and cognitive role (Chung and Pennebaker, 2007).",
        "Also function words prove to be very effective in many author attribution studies.",
        "The novelty of our approach resides in the way we use information given by the function word frequencies.",
        "Given a fixed set of function words (usually the most frequent ones), a ranking of these function words according to their frequencies is built for each text; the obtained ranked lists are subsequently used to compute the distance between two texts.",
        "To calculate the distance between two rankings we used Rank distance (Dinu, 2003), an ordinal distance tightly related to the so-called Spearman's footrule (Diaconis and Graham, 1977).",
        "Usage of the ranking of function words in the calculation of the distance instead of the actual values of the frequencies may seem as a loss of information, but we consider that the process of ranking makes the distance measure more robust acting as a filter, eliminating the noise contained in the values of the frequencies.",
        "The fact that a specific function word has the rank 2 (is the second most frequent word) in one text and has the rank 4 (is the fourth most frequent word) in another text can be more relevant than the fact that the respective word appears 349 times in the first text and only 299 times in the second.",
        "To assess the ability of this distance function to capture stylistic similarity between texts, we tested it in two different machine learning settings: clustering and binary classification.",
        "Compared with other machine learning and statistical approaches, clustering was relatively rarely used in stylistic investigations.",
        "However, few researchers (Labbe and Labbe, 2001; Luyckx et al., 2006) have recently proved that clustering can be a useful tool in computational stylistic studies.",
        "Apart of this, clustering is a very good test bed for a distance measure behavior.",
        "We plugged our distance function into a standard hierarchical clustering algorithm and test it on a collection of 21 nineteenth century English books (Koppel et al., 2007).",
        "The results are very encouraging.",
        "The family trees produced grouped together texts according to their author, genre, even gender.",
        "Also a distance measure can be used to solve classification problems if it is coupled with proper learning algorithm.",
        "One of the simplest such algorithms is nearest neighbor classification algorithm.",
        "We chose nearest neighbor algorithm because its performance is entirely based on the appropriateness to the data of the distance function on which it relies.",
        "In this way the accuracy of the classification will reflect the adequacy of the distance measure to data and domain on which the method was applied.",
        "We used the new distance function in conjunction with nearest neighbor classification algorithm and tested it on the well known case of authorship of disputed Federalist papers.",
        "The method attributed all disputed papers to Madison, the result being consistent with that of Mosteller and Wallace.",
        "To check if the usage of ranks of function words is better suited for capturing stylistic differences than the usage of actual frequencies of the function words, we repeated the above experiments on clustering and binary classification with the standard euclidean distance between the vectors of frequencies of the same function words that were used in computing the rank distance.",
        "The comparison is in favor of rank distance.",
        "2 Rank Distance and Its Use as a Stylistic Distance Between Texts",
        "Rank distance (Dinu, 2003) is an ordinal metric able to compare different rankings of a set of objects.",
        "It is tightly related to the Spearman's footrule (Diaconis and Graham, 1977), and it had already been successfully used in computational linguistics, in such problems as the similarity of Romance languages (Dinu and Dinu, 2005).",
        "A ranking of a set of n objects can be represented as a permutation of the integers 1,2,... ,n, a G Sn.",
        "a(i) will represent the place (rank) of the object i in the ranking.",
        "The Rank distance in this case is simply the distance induced by L\\ norm:",
        "This is a distance between what is called full rankings.",
        "However, in real situations, the problem of tying arises, when two or more objects claim the same rank (are ranked equally).",
        "For example, two or more function words can have the same frequency in a text and any ordering of them would be arbitrary.",
        "The Rank distance allocates to tied objects a number which is the average of the ranks the tied objects share.",
        "For instance, if two objects claim the rank 2, then they will share the ranks 2 and 3 and both will receive the rank number (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5.",
        "In general, if k objects will claim the same rank and the first x ranks are already used by other objects, then they will share the ranks x + l,x + 2,..., x + k and all of them will receive as rank the number: (*+D+(*+2)+-+(*+fc) = x + k±kAn this case, a ranking will be no longer a permutation (a(i) can be a non integer value), but the formula (1) will remain a distance (Dinu, 2003).",
        "Rank distance can be used as a stylistic distance between texts in the following way:",
        "First a set of function word must be fixed.",
        "The most frequent function words may be selected or other criteria may be used for selection.",
        "In all our experiments we used the set of 70 function words identified by Mosteller and Wallace (Mosteller and Wallace, 1964) as good candidates for author-attribution studies.",
        "The set is given in Table 1.",
        "Once the set of function words is established, for each text a ranking of these function words is computed.",
        "The ranking is done according to the function word frequencies in the text.",
        "Rank 1 will be assigned to the most frequent function word, rank 2 will be assigned to the second most frequent function word, and so on.",
        "The ties are resolved as we discussed above.",
        "If some function words from the set don't appear in the text, they will share the last places (ranks) of the ranking.",
        "The distance between two texts will be the Rank distance between the two rankings of the function words corresponding to the respective texts."
