        "The recognition of spatial entities in natural language is an important component of understanding a text (Mani et al., 2008).",
        "However, simply identifying fixed geospatial regions and specific \"facilities\" is not enough to achieve a complete representation of all the spatial phenomena present.",
        "In fact, this leaves out one of the most crucial aspects of spatial information, motion.",
        "To capture motion, we must integrate temporal and spatial information with the lexical semantics of motion predicates and prepositions.",
        "The goal of this research is to further the representational support for spatio-temporal reasoning from natural language text in the service of practical applications.",
        "To create such support, we propose to use lexical resources for motion predicates to integrate two existing annotation schemes, SpatialML and TimeML, creating a representation that captures, in a fine-grained manner, the movement of individuals through spatial and temporal indexes.",
        "This work is part of a larger effort to automate such annotation and reasoning over natural language documents using symbolic and machine learning methods.",
        "In this paper, we investigate different resources and annotations for spatio-temporal information.",
        "In section 2, we describe some of the resources we employed for our investigation.",
        "Section 3 elaborates on the classes we focus on as we work towards developing a classification for the purpose of annotating motion predicates, which we discuss in section 4."

        "There has been considerable research on the linguistic behavior of spatial predicates and prepositions in language (e.g., (Jackendoff, 1983), (Her-skovits, 1986), (Boas, 2001), (Cappelle and De-clerck, 2005)).",
        "Within qualitative spatial reasoning (QSR), work has recently started to focus on incorporating mereo-topological concepts into the calculus of relations between regions.",
        "The most successful of these is the Regional Connection Calculus, or RCC (Randell et al., 1992).",
        "RCC8 and other systems like it do an adequate job of representing static information about space, but they cannot help us deal with motion, since that task requires a temporal component.",
        "Galton ((Galton, 1993; Gal-ton, 1997)) began work on a commonsense theory of motion, but this work did not focus on merging temporal and spatial phenomena.",
        "Muller (Muller, 1998), however, proposes just such a system with his qualitative theory of motion based on spatio-temporal primitives.",
        "The result of Muller's system is a set of six motion classes: leave, hit, reach, external, internal, and cross.",
        "Asher and Sablayrolles offer their own account of motion verbs and spatial prepositional phrases in French (Asher and Sablayrolles, 1995).",
        "They propose ten groups of motion verbs as follows: s'approcher (to approach), arriver (to arrive), entrer (to enter), se poser (to alight), s'éloigner (to distance oneself from), partir (to leave), sortir (to go out), décoller (to take off), passer (par) (to go through), dévier (to deviate).",
        "This verb classification is more fine-grained than Muller's.",
        "While Muller, Asher, Sablayrolles, and Vieu among others have focused on the formal semantics of motion, other work has been done to represent motion in the FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) and VerbNet (Kipper et al., 2006) projects.",
        "The Motion frame is a high level frame in the FrameNet hierarchy.",
        "It is defined as \"Some entity (Theme) starts out in one place (Source) and ends up in some other place (Goal), having covered some space between the two (Path).\"",
        "To explore VerbNet's take on motion predicates, we mapped Asher and Sablayrolles' verbs to Verb-Net classes.",
        "The mapping revealed that, while many of the motion predicates we care about have specific classes in VerbNet, it is not always clear what these classes have in common unless we look to FrameNet to find a higher level representation."

        "Following (Muller, 1998), (Vieu, 1991), and (Asher and Sablayrolles, 1995), we assume spatial variables are incorporated into the representation of motion predicates in language.",
        "For this paper, we generally follow (Muller, 2002) by representing the individuals participating in spatial relations as spatio-temporal regions (s-i).",
        "For modeling motion, however, we restrict our discussion to spatio-temporal regions occupied by physical matter denoted by the type s ■ i ■ p.",
        "For this work, we performed several mappings between Muller, Asher and Sablayrolles, and FrameNet.",
        "The result of this mapping was a group of classes based largely on Muller's classifications with some very slight modifications detailed in the table below.",
        "The spatial event structures for each of these classes will describe their formal semantics (as in Figure 1 below).",
        "In addition to these classes, we model the spatial semantics of prepositions, following (Asher and Sablayrolles, 1995), generally.",
        "Because of space limitations, we will not discuss the contritbution of prepositional semantics in this paper.",
        "There is a complex interaction between a motion verb class and the interpretation of its arguments.",
        "For example, not all regions are occupied by the extent of physical matter (see above), but there are some objects which are properly both physical and spatial, such as the concept building.",
        "Notice the ambiguity inherent in the statement below, where both MoveJnternal and Move_External are possible interpretations.",
        "(1) The man walked around the building.",
        "This is due to the semantic nature of building as both a physical object with extent, and also as a volume/aperture.",
        "To model the mapping of objects to specific argument and event structures, we adopt the framework of Generative Lexicon Theory (GL).",
        "The notion of \"polarity\" in the (Muller, 1998) sense is quite similar to the semantic effect brought about by event headedness in (Pustejovsky, 1995).",
        "GL provides an explicitly typed argument structure, a typed subeventual structure, and a predicative body, which we will use to express RCC8 relations.",
        "For example, a representation of the Spatial Event Structure (SES) for the motion predicate leave is illustrated below in Figure 1.",
        "Note that the statement Polarity=initial is equivalent to saying Head=left.",
        "The relation BT is shorthand for boundary transition, which is composed of the following RCC8 relations: TPP, O, and EC.",
        "Each motion class in Table 1 maps to a unique predicative body (qualia structure) in the spatial event structure for a verb.",
        "We demonstrate below how these representations are then embedded in the annotation of a text as RCC8 relations in a modified SpatialML/TimeML format, called Spatio-temporal Markup (STM).",

        "Throughout the development of the classification described here, we have tried to focus on how the classification will impact the task of annotating spatio-temporal information in text.",
        "There are currently two distinct annotation schemes for spatial and temporal information.",
        "If we are to successfully capture motion phenomena in text, these annotations must be merged just as a topological base and a temporal calculus need to be combined to model motion predicates.",
        "TimeML (Pustejovsky et al., 2003) is an annotation scheme for representing temporal information in text.",
        "The basic elements of a TimeML annotation are temporal expressions such as dates, times, and durations, and events that can be anchored or ordered to those expressions or with respect to each other.",
        "For the annotation of spatial information, Spa-tialML (MITRE, 2007) is being developed.",
        "The focus of SpatialML is the markup of spatial locations that can be integrated with additional resources such as databases that provide information about a given domain (e.g. physical feature databases, gazetteers).",
        "While SpatialML does a reasonable job of capturing locations in space, it cannot model moving objects such as people and cars, and in fact lacks a mechanism for capturing motion since predicates are not annotated.",
        "As we saw above, the motion event must be captured in addition to the locations involved in the motion.",
        "The development of our motion classification also reveals that the participants of the event are also needed, even if they are not spatial locations.",
        "For example, in John flew to Boston, John must be included in the motion annotation because he is a moving object.",
        "We can enhance the spatio-temporal information from SpatialML and TimeML with lexical semantic information from a lexicon of motion predicates, resulting in annotation that is rich enough to be able to (1) infer motion of individuals in-vovled in specific events; and (2) to compose motions to create motion sequences (cf. (Pustejovsky and Verhagen, 2007)).",
        "To create a spatio-temporal markup, TimeML and SpatialML must be enriched so that they can adequately capture the motion predicates we are discussing.",
        "TimeML will already annotate motion predicates as events, but to truly reveal the motion involved, additional attributes must be added to account for the beginning, middle, and end points of the event.",
        "The spatio-temporal annotation will require a new kind of spatial link to capture motion paths.",
        "Essentially, the motion path will combine the event information from TimeML with the spatial information from SpatialML.",
        "This motion path is at the core of a spatio-temporal markup or STM.",
        "The spatial event structure described in the previous section motivates the construction of the STM.",
        "The concept of polarity or headedness will also motivate some aspects of the annotation.",
