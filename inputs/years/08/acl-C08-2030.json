        "The construction of LRs such as corpora, dictionaries, thesauruses, etc., has boomed for years throughout the world in its aim of encouraging research and development in the main media of spoken and written languages, and its importance has also been widely recognized.",
        "Of the organizations willing to store and distribute LRs, there exist some consortia fulfilling their function such as LDC, ELRA, CLARIN, and OLAC, in Western countries, and GSK which does so mainly in Japan.",
        "However, those released LRs are scarcely connected with each other because of the difference between written and spoken language as well as the difference between languages such as Japanese, English, and Chinese (OLAC User Guide, 2008).",
        "This situation makes it difficult for researchers and users to find LRs which are useful for their researches.",
        "In the meantime, by connecting systematically existing various LRs with Wrapper Program, the attempt to realize multilingual translation services has already begun (Ishida et al., 2008, Hayashi et al., 2008).",
        "Moreover, since language information tags given to those LRs and their data formats are multifarious, each LR is operated individually.",
        "As LR development generally entails enormous cost, it is highly desirable that the research efficiency be enhanced by systematically combining those existing LRs altogether and extending them, which will encourage an efficient development of unprecedented LRs.",
        "Our research organization has been constructing a large scale metadata database named SHACHIby collecting detailed meta information on LRs in Western and Asian countries.",
        "This research project aims to extensively collect metadata such as tag sets, formats, and usage information about researches on those LRs.",
        "and recorded contents of LRs existing at home and abroad and store them systematically.",
        "Meanwhile, we have already developed a search system of LRs by the use of meta information and are attempting the experiment of widely providing meta information on our stored",
