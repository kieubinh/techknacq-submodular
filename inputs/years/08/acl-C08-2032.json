        "The bilingual lexicon is a crucial resource for multilingual applications in natural language processing including machine translation (Brown et al., 1990) and cross-lingual information retrieval (Nie et al., 1999).",
        "A number of bilingual lexicons have been constructed manually, despite their expensive compilation costs.",
        "However, it is unrealistic to build a bilingual lexicon for every language pair; thus, comprehensible bilingual lexicons are available only for a limited number of language pairs.",
        "One of the solutions is to build a bilingual lexicon of the source language L f and the target Lethrough a pivot language Lp, when large bilingual lexicons Lf-Lp and Lp-Le are available.",
        "Numerous researchers have explored the use of pivot languages (Tanaka and Umemura, 1994; Schafer and Yarowsky, 2002; Zhang et al., 2005).",
        "This approach is advantageous because we can obtain a bilingual lexicon between Le and Lf, even if no bilingual lexicon exists between these languages.",
        "Pivot-based methods for dictionary construction may produce incorrect translations when the word we is translated from a word Wf by a polysemous pivot word wpl.",
        "Previous work addressed the polysemy problem in pivot-based methods (Tanaka and Umemura, 1994; Schafer and Yarowsky, 2002).",
        "Pivot-based methods also suffer from a mismatch problem, in which a pivot word wp from a source word wf does not exist in the bilingual lexicon Lp-Le.",
        "Moreover, a bilingual lexicon for technical terms is prone to include a number of pivot terms that are not included in another lexicon.",
        "This paper proposes a method for building a bilingual lexicon through a pivot language by using phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) (Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "We build a translation model between L/ and Le by assuming two lexicons Lf-Lp and Lp-Le as parallel corpora, in order to increase the obtained lexicon size by handling multi-word expressions appropriately.",
        "The main advantage of this method is its ability to incorporate various translation models that associate languages Lf-Le; for example, we can further improve the translation model by integrating a small bilingual lexicon Lf-Le.",
