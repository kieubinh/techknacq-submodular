        "Computing similarity is at the core of many computer science tasks.",
        "Many have developed algorithms for computing the semantic similarity of words (Lee, 1999), of expressions to generate paraphrases (Lin and Pantel, 2001) and of documents (Salton and McGill, 1983).",
        "However, little investigation has been spent on automatically explaining why a particular set of elements are similar to one another.",
        "Explaining similarity is an important part of various natural language applications such as question answering and building lexical ontologies such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "Several questions must be addressed before one can begin to explore this topic.",
        "First, what constitutes a good explanation and what are the sources of these explanations?",
        "Second, how can we automatically generate these different types of explanations?",
        "Third, how do we empirically evaluate the quality of an explanation?",
        "In this paper, we propose a first analysis of these questions."

        "Within Question Answering, explanations have mostly been viewed from a deductive framework and have focused on proof trees and inference traces as sources of explanations (Moldovan and Rus, 2001).",
        "Summarization and text generation from proof trees have also been explored as explanations in QA systems (Barker et al., 2004).",
        "Lester (1997) proposed explanation design packages, a hybrid representation for discourse knowledge that generates multi-sentential explanations.",
        "Detailed psycholinguistic studies into how people explain things suggests that people explain similarity using \"feature complexes\" (Fillenbaum, 1969), a bundle of features semantically related with a term.",
        "This suggests considering explanations of similarity as the shared features among a set of terms.",
        "Another competing idea from linguistic philosophy is the Prototype theory by Rosch (1975).",
        "It is argued that objects within a semantic category are represented by another, more commonly used or much simpler member of the same semantic category, called a prototype.",
        "And, within this view, explanations for similarity are prototypes from the same semantic category as the given terms.",
        "Deese (1966) investigated similarity in terms of stimulus-response word association experiments providing empirical evidence to consider other semantically similar words as explanations.",
        "3 An Information Theoretic Framework for Explaining Similarity",
        "In this section, we present an information-theoretic framework that defines a good explanation using the intuition that they are highly informative and reduce the uncertainty in the set of query terms.",
        "For example, consider the set of query terms {Maybach, Maserati, Renault}.",
        "One possible explanation of their similarity which is very informative is they are all like a Ford (i.e., a prototype explanation).",
        "Other possible explanations include they can be driven using a steering wheel and they have wheels (i.e., descriptive properties as explanations).",
        "Each of these explanations reduces the uncertainty regarding the semantics of the original set of terms.",
        "In information theory, the concept of reduction in uncertainty is related to information gain, and good explanation sets can be quantified in terms of information gain.",
        "Formally, given a set of query terms Q, and a set of explanations E, we define the best explanation set as one which provides maximum information to the set Q, or in other words, where S is the set of all explanations (discussed in detail in Section 4) and <fi(X) represents the power set of X.",
        "The problem of choosing the best explanation set for a given query set is now reduced to a problem of optimization under I.",
        "The information function / in Eq. (1) is a set function which defines the amount of information contributed by the set of explanations E to the set of query words Q.",
        "There are many possible information functions, but we would like all of them to have some common properties.",
        "Consistency",
        "The information function should be consistent.",
        "For two sets, E and E', if E C E' then I(Q;E') > I(Q;E).",
        "In other words, given two explanation sets E and E, with E containing extra explanations, not in E, the information function should assign larger values to E' with respect to Q than it assigns to E.",
        "Explanation Set Cardinality",
        "Another important requirement regarding I, is the size of the explanation sets.",
        "Any consistent information function would assign larger values to larger sets of explanations.",
        "This leads to a problem where the optimal solution is always the set of all explanations.",
        "We overcome this by fixing an upper bound for the size of explanation sets that are generated by the function I.",
        "Redundancy and Joint Information",
        "Many explanations in an explanation set might overlap semantically and the information function has to account for such overlaps.",
        "However, information functions which take such semantic overlap into account are computationally hard to optimize.",
        "One approach to this problem is to find approximate solutions using heuristic search techniques, however, relaxing this constraint lets us use common association measures such as mutual information (Cover and Thomas, 1991) as information functions.",
        "Another equivalent formulation of Eq. (1) is to use marginal information gains.",
        "This formulation also gives a simple greedy algorithm to the optimization problem when the size of explanation set is fixed.",
        "Let us define the marginal gain in information to the set Q, when the explanation e is added to the set of explanations E as:",
        "Then, the best set of explanations of size k can be recursively defined as such that e = argmaXe^sIGQ-E^ie') and",
        "If our marginal information gain is independent of the set of explanations to which it is added, we can rank explanations by their marginal information gains as added to the empty set.",
        "Then, choosing the top k explanations gives us the fc-best explanation set for the query."

        "We use syntactic dependencies between words to model their semantic properties.",
        "The assumption here is that some grammatical relations, such as subject and object can yield semantic properties of terms.",

        "In this paper, we use a combination of corpus statistics and manual filters for grammatical relations to uncover candidate semantic properties.",
        "Intuitively, one would prefer adjectival modifiers and verbal propositions as good descriptive properties for explanations, and from the examples, we can see our algorithm generates such descriptive properties because of the high information contribution of such properties to the query set.",
