        "The Direct MT system is based upon exploitation of syntactic similarities between more or less related natural languages.",
        "Although its deficiencies soon became apparent, it remains popular in certain situations due to its usefulness, robustness and relative simplicity.",
        "One of such situation is machine translation of closely related languages.",
        "The general opinion is that it is easier to create an MT system for a pair of related languages (Hajic et al. 2000).",
        "In the last decade, some of the systems utilizing this approach for translating between similar languages have confirmed this concept.",
        "In this paper, our attempt to use the same concept for language pair of Punjabi-Hindi is described.",
        "Punjabi and Hindi both are classified as Indo-Iranian languages.",
        "Although they are in the same family, but still they have lot of differences in order to make them not mutually intelligible.",
        "Punjabi and Hindi are not mutually intelligible in written form.",
        "As far as spoken form is concerned, Punjabi and Hindi are mutually intelligible to certain degree.",
        "This relation is further asymmetric with the speakers of Punjabi more able to understand Hindi but reverse is not true.",
        "Punjabi is the official language of the Indian state of Punjab and also one of the official languages of Delhi.",
        "It is used in government, education, commerce, art, mass media and in every day communication.",
        "A good deal of Sikh religious literature is written in Punjabi language.",
        "According to SIL Ethnologue, Punjabi is the language of about 57 million people and ranked 20th among the total languages of the world.",
        "It is written in Gurmukhy, Shahmukhy and roman scripts.",
        "Hindi on the other hand has been one of the two official languages of all of India.",
        "Hindi is a language of about 577 million peoples all over the world and is ranked as 5th most widely spoken language by SIL Ethnologue."

        "India being a large and multilingual society, and in the interest of the regional languages, the government of India has allowed to use regional languages as the official language of respective region and adopt bilingual form (Hindi/English) as the official language of Union Government.",
        "Most of the state governments work in their respective regional languages whereas the union government's official documents and reports are in bilingual form (Hindi/English).",
        "In order to have a proper communication there is a need to translate these reports and documents in the respective regional languages and vice versa.",
        "Some other applications of Punjabi to Hindi MT system are Text Translation, Website Translation, Message Translation (Email), Cross Language Information Retrieval and Web Service.",
        "Punjabi and Hindi are two closely related languages as both originated from the same origin and having lot of syntactic and semantic similarities.",
        "These similarities make direct translation methodology an obvious choice for Punjabi-Hindi language pair.",
        "The purposed system for Punjabi to Hindi translation has been implemented with various research techniques based on Direct MT architecture and language corpus.",
        "The output is evaluated by already prescribed methods in order to get the suitability of the system for the Punjabi Hindi language pair.",
        "Existing system: Keeping in view the importance of MT system among Indian languages, an MT system called \"Anusaarka\" has been developed at IIIT Hyderabad covering all the major Indian languages.",
        "It is a language accessor and produces an image of source language in target language.",
        "Output will have to be post-edited by a person, to make it grammatically correct, stylistically proper, etc.",
        "Moreover, some amount of training will be needed on the part of the reader to read and understand the output.",
        "Our system is more practical in nature than Anusaarka and it produce more grammatical and stylistic output.",
        "No training is needed on the part of reader."

        "In this research work, we have developed and used various resources as follow: Root word Lexicon: It is a bilingual dictionary that contains Punjabi language word, its lexical category like whether it is noun, verb or adjective etc and corresponding Hindi word.",
        "It also contains the gender information in case of nouns and type information (i.e. transitive or intransitive) in case of verb.",
        "This dictionary contains about 33000 entries covering almost all the root words of Punjabi language.",

        "Text normalization",
        "There are number of ASCII based fonts to represent Punjabi text and each font has variations in assigning ASCII code to Punjabi Alphabets.",
        "This cause a problem while scanning a text.",
        "Therefore, the first step is to normalize the source text by converting it into Unicode format.",
        "It gives us three fold advantages; first it will reduce the text scanning complexity.",
        "Secondly it also helps in internationalizing the system as if the output is in Unicode format then it can be used in various applications in various ways.",
        "Thirdly, it eases the transliteration task.",
        "Tokenization",
        "The system is designed to do sentence level translation in order to have a track about the context of a word.",

        "Individual words or tokens are extracted out from the sentence and processed to find out its equivalent in the target language.",
