        "Spoken language translation technologies attempt to bridge the language barriers between people with different native languages who each want to engage in conversation by using their mother-tongue.",
        "The importance of these technologies is increasing due to increases in the number of opportunities for cross-language communication in face-to-face conversation, especially in the domain of tourism.",
        "We demonstrate two multilingual translation services for mobile phones that are built on corpus-based speech recognition and translation technologies.",
        "These services enable smooth and location-free communication in real environments covering the major languages of most nations (see Figure 1).",
        "The first multilingual translation service described in this paper is a text-to-text translation service that enables users to translate Japanese and English conversational spoken language sentences in the travel domain into 17 other languages.",
        "The system's core components consist of a multilingual, sentence-aligned spoken language corpus covering 18 of the major world languages and state-of-the-art statistical machine translation (SMT) engines that are trained automatically from this corpus covering 306 (=18x17) translation directions.",
        "A graphical user-interface (GUI) allows 24x7 worldwide access to the translation service (see Section 2).",
        "The second multilingual translation service is an extension of the text-based translation service that additionally provides speech recognition capabilities.",
        "This is the first commercial speech translation service in the world.",
        "The system is based on distributed speech recognition and operates as follows: (1) front-end processing (noise suppression, feature extraction, and feature parameter compression) is carried out on the mobile phone, (2) back-end processing (recognition, translation) is done on a server and (3) translation results are sent back and displayed on the mobile phone (see Section 3)."

        "The bilingual mode also features back-translation functionality i.e., a reverse translation of the generated translation output into the source language, that enables immediate feedback on the quality of the translation output.",
        "In order to solve font problems of mobile phones, the translated sentences are rendered on the server side and an image is sent and displayed in the mobile phone.",
        "The translation engines used for the translation service are trained on the Basic Travel Expressions Corpus (ATR-BTEC) which is a collection of sentences that travel experts consider useful for people going abroad and cover a large variety of topics in travel situations like shopping or stay (Kikui et al., 2006).",
