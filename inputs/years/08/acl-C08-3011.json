        "Meaning construction - how words take meaning in a sentence or in a text i s an important issue for computational linguistics.",
        "The major problem we have to deal with is that each word can have a lot of different meanings, depending on context.",
        "This phenomenon - called polysemy - is constitutive of language, and is the basis of its richness.",
        "However it is quite difficult to formalize.",
        "In most models of language, polysemy is considered as a kind of artefact.",
        "In these models, polysemy amounts to very little: a choice in a list of pre-existing meanings.",
        "However the omnipresence of polysemy always leads this kind of computation to combinatorial explosions.",
        "To avoid this problem, we want to give a central place in meaning construction to polysemy: that is why we define our model within the framework of continuous mathematics.",
        "This model was first proposed by Victorri and Fuchs (1996).",
        "It is deeply rooted in Gestalttheorie (Guillaume, 1979).",
        "Each linguistic unit is associated with a semantic space, where its different meanings are organized according to semantic proximity.",
        "The other units of the utterance define a potential function, which allows us to determinate the region of the semantic space corresponding to the meaning of the unit studied within the utterance.",
        "We present here Visusyn, the software we developed in order to implement this model.",
        "visusyn is still a work in progress.",
        "The working version was developed in Matlab.",
        "A Java version will be developed as soon as possible."

        "visusyn makes two kinds of operations, corresponding to the two componants of the model: it constructs semantics spaces and then computes meaning functions defined on these semantic spaces.",
        "The algorithm for building semantic spaces relies on the analysis of a graph of synonyms.",
        "The aim of the exploration is to reveal the structure of the lexicon modelled by the graph so an automatic system can reach the information it contains.",
        "visusyn can construct local spaces, representing the semantic of a given unit, as well as global spaces, representing a lexical paradigm in its whole (for French adjectives, or adverbs for instance).",
        "Local spaces are used to compute meaning of the unit under study when accompanied by a given word in a sentence.",

      "text": [
        "It has been discovered recently that most lexical graphs belong to the class of small-world graphs.",
        "This term denotes graphs where most nodes are neighbors of one another, but every node can be reached from other by a small number of hops or steps.",
        "Small-world networks were defined by Watts and Strogatz (1998).",
        "They noted that graphs could be classified according to their clustering coefficient (C) and their characteristic path length (L).",
        "Additionally, a third property can be associated with small-world networks even though it is not required for that classification.",
        "Specifically, if a small-world network has a degree-distribution which can be fitted with a power law distribution, it is taken as a sign that the network is small-world.",
        "These networks are known as scale-free networks.",
        "Ravasz and Barabasi (2003) showed that a high clustering coefficient with scale free topology determines an original combination of modularity and hierarchical organization.",
        "It is not a simply pyramidal organization.",
        "The structure is made of groups of nodes, with small clusters at the bottom and very large groups at the top.",
        "Moreover, groups of nodes may overlap at any level.",
        "This self-similar nesting of different groups or module into each other forces a strict fine structure on real networks (Ravasz and Barabasi, 2003)."

        "The algorithm will be here illustraded on the French adjective lexicon.",
        "The graph under study, called Synadj, is a graph of synonymy with 3,699 vertices and 22,568 links.",
        "We verified the small-word structure of this graph (C, L and degree distribution).",
        "This small-world structure led us to use the cliques of the graph as a tool for building the semantic space.",
        "A clique in a graph is a maximal set of pairwise adjacent vertices, or - in other words - an induced subgraph which is a maximal complete graph.",
        "In the present case, a clique is made of adjectives which are all synonyms in a one to one relationship.",
        "By virtue of the definition, small-world networks will inevitably have high representation of cliques, and subgraphs that are a few edges shy of being cliques, i.e. small-world networks will have sub-networks that are characterized by the presence of connections between almost any two nodes within them.",
        "This follows from the requirement of a high cluster coefficient.",
        "We can consider as a first approximation that the cliques define very precise meanings that can be considered as the intersection of the meanings of all the units belonging to the clique.",
        "We thus define the semantic space as the euclidian space generated by the vertices of the graph (the adjectives, here).",
        "Each clique of the graph is associated with a point of this space, which coordinates depend on wich vertices belong to the clique.",
