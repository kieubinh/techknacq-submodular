        "A keyword-based search is not sufficient to answer temporally loaded questions like \"did Brazil win the soccer world championship in 1970?\"",
        "since a boolean keyword search cannot distinguish between those documents where the event win is actually anchored to the year 1970 versus those that are not.",
        "The TARSQI Project (Temporal Awareness and Reasoning Systems for Question Interpretation) focused on enhancing natural language question answering systems so that temporally-based questions about the events and entities in news articles can be addressed.",
        "To explicitly mark the needed temporal relations the project delivered a series of tools for extracting time expressions, events, subordination relations and temporal relations (Verhagen et al., 2005; Mani et al., 2006; Sauri et al., 2005; Sauri et al., 2006a).",
        "But although those tools performed reasonably well, they were not integrated in a principled way.",
        "This paper describes the TARSQI Toolkit (TTK), which takes the TARSQI components and integrates them into a temporal parsing framework.",
        "The toolkit is different from the system described in (Verhagen et al., 2005) in several major aspects:",
        "1. the components were integrated in a toolkit which, amongst others, split the parsing of properties typical for a particular document type from the temporal parsing of the text",
        "2. a component was added that takes the results from the various components that generate temporal relations and merges them into a consistent temporal graph"
      ]
    },
    {
      "heading": "3.. a new way of visualizing the results was used",
      "text": [
        "In addition, some components were updated and test suites with unit tests and regression tests were added.",
        "In this paper, we focus on the merging of temporal links and the visualization of temporal relations.",
        "There has been a fair amount of recent research on extraction of temporal relations, including (Chambers et al., 2007; Lapata and Lascarides, 2006; Bramsen et al., 2006; Bethard and Martin, 2007; Min et al., 2007; Pusca§u, 2007).",
        "However, we are not aware of approaches that integrate temporal relations from various sources in one consistent whole.",
        "All TTK components use the TimeML annotation language (Pustejovsky et al., 2003; Pustejovsky et al., 2005).",
        "TimeML is an annotation scheme for markup of events, times, and their temporal relations in news articles.",
        "The TimeML scheme flags tensed verbs, adjectives, and nominals with EVENT tags with various attributes, including the class of event, tense, grammatical aspect, polarity (negative or positive), and any modal operators which govern the event being tagged.",
        "Time expressions are flagged with TIMEX3 tags, an extension of the ACE 2004 TIMEX2 annotation scheme (tern.mitre.org).",
        "Subordination relations between events, as for example between reporting events and the embedded event reported on, are annotated with the slink tag.",
        "For temporal relations, TimeML defines a tlink tag that links tagged events to other events and/or times.",
        "In section 2, we will give a short overview of the toolkit.",
        "In section 3, we focus on the component that merges tlinks, and in section 4 we will dwell on the visualization of temporal relations."

        "The overall architecture of TTK is illustrated in figure 1 below.",
        "Input text is first processed by the DocumentModel, which takes care of document-level properties like encoding and meta tags.",

        "The preprocessor uses standard approaches to tokenization, part-of-speech tagging and chunking.",

        "Evita is a domain-independent event recognition tool that performs two main tasks: robust event identification and analysis of grammatical features such as tense and aspect.",
        "Slinket is an application developed to automatically introduce SLINKs, which in TimeML specify subordinating relations between pairs of events, and classify them into factive, counterfactive, evidential, negative evidential, and modal, based on the modal force of the subordinating event (Sauri et al., 2006b).",
        "slinks are introduced by a well-delimited subgroup of verbal and nominal predicates (such as regret, say, promise and attempt), and in most cases clearly signaled by a subordination context.",
        "Slinket thus relies on a combination of lexical and syntactic knowledge.",
        "The temporal processing stage includes three modules that generate tlinks: Blinker, S2T and the TLink Classifier.",
        "Blinker is a rule-based component that applies to certain configurations of events and timexes.",
        "It contains rule sets for the following cases: (i) event and timex in the same noun phrase, (ii) events and the document creation time, (iii) events with their syntactically subordinated events, (iv) events in conjunctions, (v) two main events in consecutive sentences, and (vi) timexes with other timexes.",
        "Each of these rule sets has a different flavor.",
        "For example, the rules in (vi) simply calculate differences in the normalized ISO value of the timex tag while the rules in (v) refer to the tense and aspect values of the two events.",
        "Blinker is a reimplementation and extension of GutenLink (Ver-hagen etal.,2005).",
        "S2T takes the output of Slinket and uses about a dozen syntactic rules to map slinks onto tlinks.",
        "For example, one S2T rule encodes that in slinks with reporting verbs where both events are in past tense, the reporting event occurred after the event reported on.",
        "The TLink Classifier is a MaxEnt classifier that identifies temporal relations between identified events in text.",
        "The classifier accepts its input for each pair of events under consideration as a set of features.",
        "It is trained on the TimeBank corpus (see www.timeml.org).",
        "Of the three tlink generating components, S2T derives a relatively small number of tlinks, but Blinker and the classifier are quite prolific.",
        "In many cases the TLINKs derived by Blinker and the classifier are inconsistent with each other.",
        "The system in (Verhagen et al., 2005) used a simple voting mechanism that favors TLINKs from components that exhibit higher precision.",
        "In addition, if confidence measures are available then these can be used by the voting mechanism.",
        "However, this approach does not factor in consistency of temporal relations: choosing the TLINKs with the highest probability may result in TLINKs that are inconsistent.",
        "For example, say we have two tlinks: before(x,y) and before(y,z).",
        "And say we have two competing TLINKs, derived by Blinker and the classifier respectively: before(x,z) and be-fore(z,x).",
        "If the second of these two has a higher confidence, then we will end up with an inconsistent annotation.",

        "Link Merging",
        "The link merging component uses a greedy algorithm to merge TLinks into a consistent whole.",
        "First all links are ordered on their confidence score.",
        "Currently these scores are either global or local.",
        "Global confidence scores are derived from the observed precision of the component that generated the links.",
        "For example, links generated by S2T are considered high precision and are always deemed more reliable than links generated by the classifier.",
        "Links generated by the classifier come with a confidence score assigned by the classifier and these scores are used to order all classifier links.",
        "Merging proceeds by first creating a graph that contains all events and time expressions as nodes, but that has no constraints expressed on the edges.",
        "Those constraints are added by the temporal links.",
        "Links are ordered on confidence score and are added one by one.",
        "Each time a link is added a constraint propagation component named Sputlink, based on Allen's interval algebra (Allen, 1983; Verhagen, 2005), is applied.",
        "If a link cannot be added because it is inconsistent with the constraint already on the edge, then the link is skipped.",
        "The result is a consistent annotation where high precision links are prefered over lower precision links."

        "Timelines can be misleading because so many events in a document cannot be ordered with respect to a time stamp.",
        "TTK uses a visualization scheme named TBox (Verhagen, 2007).",
