        "When inspecting reports in CCOR, a human reader can easily identify the various elements a report consists of, such as headings - written in bold on a separate line - introducing sections, subheadings - written in bold followed by a colon - introducing subsections, and enumerations starting with indented numbers followed by a period.",
        "Going down further, there are paragraphs divided into sentences.",
        "using these structuring elements, a hierarchic data structure comprising all report elements can be induced.",

        "We loosely follow the general notation of Sutton and McCallum (2007) in our presentation.",
        "Assuming an undirected graphical model G over an observed entity x and a set of discrete, interdependent random variables y, a conditional random field describes the conditional distribution:",
        "The normalization termZ(x) sums overall possible joint outcomes of y, i.e., and ensures the probabilistic interpretation of p(y|x).",
        "The graphical model G describes interdependencies between the variables y; we can then model p(y |x) via factors 4>c(-) that are defined over cliques c G G. The factors 4>c(-) are computed from sufficient statistics {/ck(•)} of the distribution (corresponding to the features mentioned in the previous section) and depend on possibly overlapping sets of parameters 0c ç 0 which together form the parameters 0 of the conditional distribution:",
        "In practice, for efficiency reasons, independence assumptions have to be made about variables y G y, so G is restricted to small cliques (say, (|c| < 3).",
        "Thus, the sufficient statistics only depend on a limited number of variables yc ç y; they can, however, access the whole observed entity x.",
        "This is in contrast to generative approaches which model a joint distribution p(x, y) and therefore have to extend the independence assumptions to elements x G x.",
        "The factor-specific parameters 0c of a CRF are typically tied for certain cliques, according to the problem structure (i.e., 0ci = 0c2 for two cliques c1,c2 with tied parameters).",
        "E.g., parameters are usually tied across time if G is a sequence.",
        "The factors can then be partitioned into a set of clique templates C = {C1,C2,... Cp}, where each clique template Cp is a set of factors with tied parameters 0p and corresponding sufficient statistics {/pk (•)}.",
        "The CRF can thus be rewritten as:",
        "Furthermore, in practice, the sufficient statistics { /pk( • ) } are computed from a subset xc ç x that is relevant to a factor 0c( ).",
        "In a sequence labelling task, tokens x G x that are in temporal proximity to an output variable y G y are typically most useful.",
        "Nevertheless, in our notation, we will let factors depend on the whole observed entity x to denote that all of x can be accessed if necessary.",
        "For our structure recognition task, the graphical model G exhibits the structure shown in figure 3, i.e., there are multiple connected chains of variables with factors defined over single-node cliques and two-node cliques within and between chains; the parameters of factors are tied across time.",
        "This corresponds to the factorial CRF structure described in Sutton and McCallum (2005).",
        "Structure recognition using conditional random fields then involves two separate steps: parameter estimation, or training, is concerned with selecting the parameters of a CRF such that they fit the given training data.",

        "Inference on the graphical model G (see sec 5.2) is needed to compute these.",
        "Depending on the structure of G, inference can be very expensive.",
        "In order to speed up parameter estimation, which requires inference to be performed for every training example and for every iteration of the gradient-based method, alternatives to MLE have been proposed that do not require inference.",
