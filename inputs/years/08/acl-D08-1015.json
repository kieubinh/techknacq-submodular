        "From the psychological perspective, the relatively low accuracy of the awesome-surprising pair is expected, because awesome is surprising in a positive sense.",
        "So, readers should have a hard time distinguishing between these two emotions.",
        "And the SVM classifier, which models reader responses, should also find it difficult to discern these two emotions.",
