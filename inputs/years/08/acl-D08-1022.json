        "Typically, these models extract rules using parse trees from both or either side(s) of the bitext.",
        "The former case, with trees on both sides, is often called tree-to-tree models; while the latter case, with trees on either source or target side, include both tree-to-string and string-to-tree models (see Table 1).",

        "By contrast, formally syntax-based models (Chiang, 2005) do not rely on parse trees, yet usually perform better than these linguistically sophisticated counterparts.",
        "To alleviate this problem, an obvious idea is to extract rules from k-best parses instead.",
        "However, a k-best list, with its limited scope, has too few variations and too many redundancies (Huang, 2008).",
        "This situation worsens with longer sentences as the number of possible parses grows exponentially with the sentence length and a k-best list will only capture a tiny fraction of the whole space.",

        "In other words, it becomes non-deterministic how to \"cut\" a forest into tree fragments, which is analogous to the non-deterministic pattern-match in forest-based decoding (Mi et al., 2008).",

        "With pruning threshold pe = 8, forest-based extraction achieves a (case insensitive) BLEU score of 0.2533, which is an absolute improvement of 1.0% points over the 1-best baseline, and is statistically significant using the sign-test of Collins et al.",
        "(2005) (p < 0.01).",
        "This is also 0.5 points better than (and twice as fast as) extracting on 30-best parses.",
        "These BLEU score results are summarized in Table 2, which also shows that decoding with forest-extracted rules is less than twice as slow as with 1-best rules, and only fractionally slower than with 30-best rules.",
        "We also investigate the question of how often rules extracted from non 1-best parses are used by the decoder.",
        "Table 3 shows the numbers of rules extracted from 1-best, 30-best and forest-based extractions, and the numbers that survive after filtering on the dev set.",
        "Basically in the forest-based case we can use about twice as many rules as in the 1-best case, or about 1.5 times of 30-best extraction.",
        "But the real question is, are these extra rules really useful in generating the final (1-best) translation?",
        "The last row shows that 16.3% of the rules used in 1-best derivations are indeed only extracted from non 1-best parses in the forests.",
        "Note that this is a stronger condition than changing the distribution of rules by considering more parses; here we introduce new rules never seen on any 1-best parses.",
        "We also conduct experiments on a larger training dataset, FBIS, which contains 239K sentence pairs with about 6.9M/8.9M words in Chinese/English, respectively.",
        "We also use a bigger trigram model trained on the first 1/3 of the Xinhua portion of Gi-gaword corpus.",
        "To integrate with forest-based decoding, we use both 1-best trees and packed forests during both rule extraction and decoding phases.",
        "Since the data scale is larger than the small data, we are forced to use harsher pruning thresholds, with pe = 5 for extraction and pd = 10 for decoding.",
        "The final BLEU score results are shown in Table 4.",
        "With both tree-based and forest-based decoding, rules extracted from forests significantly outperform those extracted from 1-best trees (p < 0.01).",
        "The final result with both forest-based extraction and forest-based decoding reaches a BLEU score of 0.2816, outperforming that of Hiero (Chiang, 2005), one of the best performing systems to date.",
        "These results confirm that our novel forest-based rule extraction approach is a promising direction for syntax-based machine translation."
