        "Motivated by the psycholinguistic findings, we investigate the use of eye gaze for automatic word acquisition in multimodal conversational systems.",
        "Particularly, we investigate the use of speech-gaze temporal information and word-entity semantic relatedness to facilitate word acquisition.",
        "Our experiments show that word acquisition is significantly improved when temporal information is considered, which is consistent with the previous psycholinguistic findings about speech and eye gaze.",
        "Moreover, using temporal information together with semantic relatedness rescoring further improves word acquisition.",
        "Eye tracking systems are no longer bulky systems that prevent natural human machine communication.",
        "Display mounted gaze tracking systems (e.g., Tobii) are completely non-intrusive, can tolerate head motion, and provide high tracking quality.",
        "Integrating eye tracking with conversational interfaces is no longer beyond reach.",
        "Recent works have shown that eye gaze can facilitate spoken language processing in conversational systems (Qu and Chai, 2007; Prasov and Chai, 2008).",
        "Incorporating eye gaze with automatic word acquisition provides another potential approach to improve the robustness of human machine conversation."
