        "Algorithms for solving the cross-document co-reference problem are necessary for systems that build knowledge bases from text, question answering systems, and watch list applications.",
        "There are several challenges in evaluating and developing systems for the cross-document co-reference task.",
        "(1) The annotation process required for evaluation and for training is expensive; an annotator must cluster a large number of entities across a large number of documents.",
        "The annotator must read the context around each instance of an entity to make reliable judgments.",
        "(2) On randomly selected text, a baseline of exact string match will do quite well, making it difficult to evaluate progress.",
        "(3) For a machine, there can easily be a scalability challenge since the system must cluster a large number of entities.",
        "Because of the annotation challenges, many previous studies in cross-document co-reference have focused on only the entity disambiguation problem (where one can use string retrieval to collect many documents that contain same name); or have used artificially ambiguated data.",
        "Section 2 describes related work; section 3 introduces ACE, where the work was evaluated; section 4 describes the underlying information extraction engine; sections 5 and 6 address the challenges of coping with name variation and disambiguating entities; sections 7, 8, and 9 present empirical results, improvement of entity extraction",
