        "How can we identify and study the exploration of ideas in a scientific field over time, noting periods of gradual development, major ruptures, and the waxing and waning of both topic areas and connections with applied topics and nearby fields?",
        "One important method is to make use of citation graphs (Garfield, 1955).",
        "This enables the use of graph-based algorithms like PageRank for determining researcher or paper centrality, and examining whether their influence grows or diminishes over time.",
        "However, because we are particularly interested in the change of ideas in a field over time, we have chosen a different method, following Kuhn (1962).",
        "In Kuhn's model of scientific change, science proceeds by shifting from one paradigm to another.",
        "Because researchers' ideas and vocabulary are constrained by their paradigm, successive incommensurate paradigms will naturally have different vocabulary and framing.",
        "Kuhn's model is intended to apply only to very large shifts in scientific thought rather than at the micro level of trends in research foci.",
        "Nonetheless, we propose to apply Kuhn's insight that vocabulary and vocabulary shift is a crucial indicator of ideas and shifts in ideas.",
        "Our operationalization of this insight is based on the unsupervised topic model Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA; Blei et al.",
        "(2003)).",
        "For many fields, doing this kind of historical study would be very difficult.",
        "Computational linguistics has an advantage, however: the ACL Anthology, a public repository of all papers in the Computational Linguistics journal and the conferences and workshops associated with the ACL, COLING, EMNLP, comprises over 14,000 documents from conferences and the journal, beginning as early as 1965 through 2008, indexed by conference and year.",
        "This resource has already been the basis of citation analysis work, for example, in the ACL Anthology Network of Joseph and Radev (2007).",
        "We apply LDA to the text of the papers in the ACL Anthology to induce topics, and use the trends in these topics over time and over conference venues to address questions about the development of the field.",
        "Proceedings of the 2008 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 363-371, Honolulu, October 2008.",
        "Â©2008 Association for Computational Linguistics",
        "Despite the relative youth of our field, computational linguistics has witnessed a number of research trends and shifts in focus.",
        "While some trends are obvious (such as the rise in machine learning methods), others may be more subtle.",
        "Has the field gotten more theoretical over the years or has there been an increase in applications?",
        "What topics have declined over the years, and which ones have remained roughly constant?",
        "How have fields like Dialogue or Machine Translation changed over the years?",
        "Are there differences among the conferences, for example between COLING and ACL, in their interests and breadth of focus?",
        "As our field matures, it is important to go beyond anecdotal description to give grounded answers to these questions.",
        "Such answers could also help give formal metrics to model the differences between the many conferences and venues in our field, which could influence how we think about reviewing, about choosing conference topics, and about long range planning in our field."

        "We propose to measure the breadth of a conference by using what we call topic entropy: the conditional entropy of this conference topic distribution.",
        "Entropy measures the average amount of information expressed by each assignment to a random variable.",
        "If a conference has higher topic entropy, then it more evenly divides its probability mass across the generated topics.",
        "If it has lower, it has a far more narrow focus on just a couple of topics.",
        "We therefore measured topic entropy:",
        "Figure 10 shows the conditional topic entropy of each conference over time.",
        "We removed from the ACL and COLING lines the years when ACL and marked those colocated years as points separate from either plot.",
        "As expected, COLING has been historically the broadest of the three conferences, though perhaps slightly less so in recent years.",
        "ACL started with a fairly narrow focus, but became nearly as broad as COLING during the 1990's.",
        "However, in the past 8 years it has become more narrow again, with a steeper decline in breadth than COLING.",
        "EMNLP, true to its status as a \"Special Interest\" conference, began as a very narrowly focused conference, but now it seems to be catching up to at least ACL in terms of the breadth of its focus.",
        "Since the three major conferences seem to be converging in terms of breadth, we investigated whether or not the topic distributions of the conferences were also converging.",
        "To do this, we plotted the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence between each pair of conferences.",
        "The Jensen-Shannon divergence is a symmetric measure of the similarity of two pairs of distributions.",
        "The measure is 0 only for identical distributions and approaches infinity as the two differ more and more.",
        "Formally, it is defined as the average of the KL divergence of each distribution to the average of the two distributions:",
