        "For example, the verb \" f?f?%>\"(gugu-ru, to google) is erroneously segmented into \" ^ ^\"(gugu)and (ru).",
        "One solution to this problem is to augment the lexicon of the morphological analyzer by extracting unknown morphemes from texts (Mori and Nagao, 1996).",
        "In the previous method, a morpheme extraction module worked independently of the morphological analyzer and ran in off-line (batch) mode.",
        "It is inefficient because almost all high-frequency morphemes have already been registered to the predefined dictionary.",

        "We explain Japanese morphemes in Section 2.1, morphological constraints in Section 2.2, and unknown morpheme processing in Section 2.3.",
        "In JUMAN, the POS tagset consists of four elements: class, subclass, conjugation type and conjugation form.",
        "The classes are noun, verb, adjective and others.",
        "Noun has subclasses such as common noun, sa-group noun, proper noun, organization, place, personal name.",
        "Verb and adjective have no subclasses.",
        "Verbs and adjectives among others change their form according to the morphemes that occur after them, which is called conjugation.",
        "Conjugable morphemes are grouped by conjugation types such as vowel verb, ra-row verb, i-type adjective and na-type adjective.",
        "Each conjugable morpheme takes one of conjugation forms in texts.",
        "It has an invariant stem and an ending which changes according to conjugation type and conjugation form.",
        "In this paper, the tuple of class, subclass and conjugation type is referred to as a POS tag.",
        "For simplicity, POS tags for nouns are called by their subclasses and those for verbs and adjectives by their conjugation types.",
        "There are two types of morphemes: abstract dictionary entries, and examples or actual occurrences in texts.",
        "An entry consists of a stem and a POS tag while an example consists of a stem, a POS tag and a conjugation form.",
        "For example, the entry of the ra-row verb \"tÊS \"(hashi-ru, to run) can be represented as and their examples \"tÊÇ> \"(hashi-ra)and \"tÊD \" (hashi-ri)as",

        "Unknown morphemes are given the special POS tag \"undefined,\" which is treated as noun.",
        "Character type-based heuristics are based on the fact that Japanese is written with several different character types such as kanji, hiragana and katakana, and that the choice of character types gives some clues on morpheme boundaries.",

        "If the candidate is a noun, it is substituted with the number of the unique base forms of their immediate ancillary morphemes.",
        "The second condition is that the front boundaries of some examples are decided by clear boundary markers such as punctuations and the beginning of sentence.",
