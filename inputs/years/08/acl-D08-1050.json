        "Most state-of-the-art wide-coverage parsers are based on the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), making such parsers highly tuned to newspaper text.",
        "A pressing question facing the parsing community is how to adapt these parsers to other domains, such as biomedical research papers and web pages.",
        "A related question is how to improve the performance of these parsers on constructions that are rare in the Penn Treebank, such as questions.",
        "Questions are particularly important since a question parser is a component in most Question Answering (QA) systems (Harabagiu et al., 2001).",
        "In this paper we investigate parser adaptation in the context of lexicalized grammars, by using a parser based on Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) (Steedman, 2000).",
        "A key property of CCG is that it is lexicalized, meaning that each word in a sentence is associated with an elementary syntactic structure.",
        "In the case of CCG this is a lexical category expressing subcategorization information.",
        "We exploit this property of CCG by performing manual annotation in the new domain, but only up to this level of representation, where the annotation can be carried out relatively quickly.",
        "Since CC G lexical categories are so expressive, many of the syntactic characteristics of a domain are captured at this level.",
        "The two domains we consider are the biomedical domain and questions for a QA system.",
        "We use the term \"domain\" somewhat loosely here, since questions are best described as a particular set of syntactic constructions, rather than a set of documents about a particular topic.",
        "However, we consider question data to be interesting in the context of domain adaptation for the following reasons: 1) there are few examples in the Penn Treebank (PTB) and so PTB parsers typically perform poorly on them; 2) questions form a fairly homogeneous set with respect to the syntactic constructions employed, and it is an interesting question how easy it is to adapt a parser to such data; and 3) QA is becoming an important example of nlp technology, and question parsing is an important task for QA systems.",
        "The ccg parser we use (Clark and Curran, 2007b) makes use of three levels of representation: one, a pos tag level based on the fairly coarse-grained POS tags in the Penn Treebank; two, a lexical category level based on the more fine-grained ccg lexical categories, which are assigned to words by a ccg su-",

        "A key idea in this paper, following a pilot study in Clark et al.",
        "(2004), is to perform manual annotation only at the first two levels.",
        "Since the lexical category level consists of sequences of tags, rather than hierarchical derivations, the annotation can be performed relatively quickly.",
        "For the biomedical and question domains we manually annotated approximately 1,000 and 2,000 sentences, respectively, with ccg lexical categories.",
        "We also created a gold standard set of grammatical relations (gr) in the Stanford format (de Marn-effe et al., 2006), using 500 of the questions.",
        "For the biomedical domain we used the Biolnfer corpus (Pyysalo et al., 2007a), an existing gold-standard gr resource also in the Stanford format.",
        "We evaluated the parser on both lexical category assignment and recovery of grs.",
        "The results show that the domain adaptation approach used here is successful in two very different domains, achieving parsing accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art accuracy for newspaper text.",
        "The results also show, however, that the two domains have different profiles with regard to the levels of representation used by the parser.",
        "We find that simply retraining the pos tagger used by the parser leads to a large improvement in performance for the biomedical domain, and that retraining the ccg supertagger on the annotated biomedical data improves the performance further.",
        "For the question data, retraining just the pos tagger also improves parser performance, but retraining the supertagger has a much greater effect.",
        "We perform some analysis of the two datasets in order to explain the different behaviours with regard to porting the ccg parser."

        "The ccg parser is described in detail in Clark and Curran (2007b) and so we provide only a brief description.",
        "The stages in the ccg parsing pipeline are as follows.",
        "First, a maximum entropy pos tagger assigns a single pos tag to each word in a sentence.",
        "pos tags are fairly coarse-grained grammatical labels indicating part-of-speech; the Penn Treebank set, used here, contains approximately 50 labels.",
        "Second, a maximum entropy supertagger assigns ccg lexical categories to the words in the sentence.",
        "Lexical categories can be thought of as fine-grained pos tags expressing subcategorization information, i.e. information about the argument frame of the word.",
        "There are 425 categories in the set used by the ccg parser.",
        "Supertagging was originally developed for Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar (Bangalore and Joshi, 1999), but has been particularly successful for wide-coverage ccg parsing (Clark and Curran, 2007b).",
        "Rather than assign a single category to each word, the supertagger operates as a multi-tagger, sometimes assigning more than one category if the context is not sufficiently discriminating to suggest a single tag (Curran et al., 2006).",
        "Since the taggers have linear time complexity, the first two stages can be performed extremely quickly.",
        "Finally, the parsing stage combines the lexical categories, using a small set of combinatory rules that are part of the grammar of ccg, and builds a packed chart representation containing all the derivations which can be built from the lexical categories.",
        "The Viterbi algorithm efficiently finds the highest scoring derivation from the packed chart, using a loglinear model to score the derivations.",
        "The grammar and training data for the newspaper version of the ccg parser are obtained from CCGbank (Hocken-maier and Steedman, 2007), a ccg version of the Penn Treebank.",
        "The aspect of the pipeline which is most relevant to this paper is the supertagging phase.",
        "Figure 1 gives an example sentence from each target domain, with the ccg lexical category assigned to each word shown below the word, and the pos tag to the right.",
        "Note that the categories contain a significant amount of grammatical information, in particular subcategorization information.",
        "The verb acts in the biomedical sentence, for example, looks for a prepositional phrase (PP, as a linkage protein) to its right and a noun phrase (NP, Talin) to its left, with the resulting category a declarative sentence (S[dcl]).",
        "Bangalore and Joshi (1999) refer to supertagging as almost parsing, because once the correct lexical categories have been assigned, the parser is left with much less work to do.",
        "The ccg supertagger is not able to assign a single category to each word with extremely high accuracy – hence the need for it to operate as a multi-tagger – but even in multi-tagger mode it dramatically reduces the ambiguity passed through to the parser (Clark and Curran, 2007b).",
        "Talin|NN perhaps|RB acts|VBZ as|IN a|DT linkage|NN protein|NN .|.",
        "What|WDT king|NN signed|VBD the|DT Magna|NNP Carta|NNP ?|.",
        "The parser has been evaluated on DepBank (King et al., 2003), using the gr scheme of Briscoe et al.",
        "(2006), and it scores 82.4% labelled precision and 81.2% labelled recall overall (Clark and Curran, 2007a).",
        "Section 4.4 describes how the ccg dependencies can be mapped into the Stanford gr scheme (de Marneffe et al., 2006) and gives the results of evaluating the parser on biomedical and question gr resources.",
        "The ccg parser is particularly well suited to the biomedical and question domains.",
        "First, use of ccg allows recovery of long-distance dependencies.",
        "In the sentence What does target heart rate mean?, the word What is an underlying object of the verb mean.",
        "The parser recovers this information despite the distance between the two words.",
        "This capability is crucial for question parsing, and also useful in the biomedical field for extraction of relationships between biological entities.",
        "Additionally, the speed of the parser (tens of sentences per second) is useful for the large volumes of biomedical data that require processing for biomedical text mining."

      "heading": "3. Approach",
      "text": [
        "Our approach to domain adaptation is to target the coarser-grained, less syntactically complex, levels of representation used by the parser, and to train new models with manually annotated data at these levels.",
        "The motivation for this approach is twofold.",
        "First, accuracy at each stage of the pipeline depends on accuracy at the earlier stages.",
        "If the pos tagger assigns incorrect tags, it is unlikely that the supertagger will be able to recover and produce the correct lexical categories, since it relies heavily on pos tags as features.",
        "Without the correct categories, the parser in turn will be unable to find a correct parse.",
        "In the sentence What year did the Vietnam War end?, the newspaper-trained pos tagger incorrectly assigns the pos tag NN (common noun) to the verb end, since verb-final sentences are atypical for the ptb.",
        "As a result, the supertagger is virtually certain (greater than 99% probability) that the correct ccg lexical category for end is N (noun).",
        "The parser then assigns the Vietnam War end the structure of a noun phrase, and chooses an unusual subcategorization frame for did in which it takes three arguments: What, year, and the Vietnam War end.",
        "In the sentence How many siblings does she have?",
        ", on the other hand, the supertagger assigns an incorrect category to the word How despite it having the correct pos tag (WRB for wh-adverb).",
        "The correct category is many (category NP/N) and siblings (category N) as arguments.",
        "Instead it is tagged as S[wq]/S[q], the category for a sentential adverb (i.e. the manner reading of how), which prevents a correct parse.",
        "Our intention was that creating new training data at the lower levels of representation would improve the accuracy of the pos tagger and supertagger in the target domains, thereby improving the accuracy of later stages in the pipeline as well.",
        "The second motivation for our approach is to reduce annotation overhead.",
        "Full syntactic derivations are costly to produce by hand.",
        "pos tags, however, are relatively easy to annotate; even an out-of-domain tagger will provide a good starting point, and manual correction is quick, especially in a domain without much unfamiliar vocabulary.",
        "ccg lexical categories require more expertise, but our experience shows that an out-of-domain supertagger can again provide a starting point for correction, and since the annotation is flat rather than hierarchical, we hypothesize that it is not as difficult or time-consuming as annotation of full derivations.",
        "Our adaptation approach has been partially explored in previous work which targets one or another of the different levels of representation.",
        "Lease and Charniak (2005) obtained an improvement in the accuracy of the Charniak (2000) parser, as well as pos tagging accuracy, when applied to the biomedical domain, by training a new pos tagger model with a combination of newspaper and biomedical data.",
        "The parser improvement was due solely to the new pos tagger, without retraining the parser model.",
        "Since the Charniak parser does not use a lexicalized grammar with an intermediate level of representation, any further improvements would have to come from the parser model itself.",
        "Clark et al.",
        "(2004) obtained an improvement in ccg supertagging accuracy for What-questions by training a new supertagger model with a combination of newspaper and question data annotated with ccg lexical categories.",
        "Because a question resource annotated with grs was not available, they did not perform a parser evaluation, and the effects of the pos tagging level were not compared to the lexical category level.",
        "In this paper, we extend the pilot experiments performed by Clark et al.",
        "(2004) in four ways.",
        "First, we use a larger corpus of trec questions covering additional question types, thus extending the experiments to the question domain more broadly, as well as to the biomedical domain.",
        "Second, we create a gold standard gr resource enabling a full parser evaluation on question data.",
        "Third, we show that the pos level is important for adaptation, reinforcing the work of Lease and Char-niak (2005).",
        "A key finding of the present paper is that the combination of retraining at the pos tag and lexical category levels provides additional improvements beyond those gained by retraining at a single level.",

        "We have targeted lower levels of representation in order to adapt a lexicalized-grammar parser to two new domains, biomedical text and questions.",
        "Although each of the lower levels has been targeted independently in previous work, this is the first study that examines both levels together to determine how they affect parsing accuracy.",
        "We achieved an accuracy on grammatical relations in the same range as that of the original parser for newspaper text, without requiring costly annotation of full parse trees.",
        "Both biomedical and question data are domains in which there is an immediate need for accurate parsing.",
        "The question dataset is in some ways an extreme example for domain adaptation, since the sentences are syntactically uniform; on the other hand, it is of interest as a set of constructions where the parser initially performed poorly, and is a realistic parsing challenge in the context of qa systems.",
        "Interestingly, although an increase in accuracy at each stage of the pipeline did yield an increase at the following stage, these increases were not uniform across the two domains.",
        "The new pos tagger model was responsible for most of the improvement in parsing for the biomedical domain, while the new supertagger model was necessary to see a large improvement in the question domain.",
        "We attribute this to the fact that question syntax is significantly different from newspaper syntax.",
        "We expect these considerations to apply to any lexicalized-grammar parser.",
        "Of course, it would be useful to have a way of predicting which level of annotation would be most effective for adapting to a new domain before the annotation begins.",
        "The utility of measures such as unknown word rate (which can be performed with unlabelled data) and unknown pos n-gram rate (which can be performed with only pos tags) is not yet sufficiently clear to rely on them as predictive measures, but it seems a fruitful avenue for future work to investigate the importance of such measures for parser domain adaptation."
