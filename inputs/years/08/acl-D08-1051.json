        "It is important to remark that current MT systems are not able to produce ready-to-use texts (Kay, 1997; Hutchins, 1999; Arnold, 2003).",
        "Indeed, MT systems are usually limited to specific semantic domains and the translations provided require human post-editing in order to achieve a correct high-quality translation.",
        "A way of taking advantage of MT systems is to combine them with the knowledge of a human translator, constituting the so-called Computer-Assisted Translation (CAT) paradigm.",
        "CAT offers different approaches in order to benefit from the synergy between humans and MT systems.",
        "An important contribution to interactive CAT technology was carried out around the TransType (TT) project (Langlais et al., 2002; Foster et al., 2002; Foster, 2002; Och et al., 2003).",
        "This project entailed an interesting focus shift in which interaction directly aimed at the production of the target text, rather than at the disambiguation of the source text, as in former interactive systems.",
        "The idea proposed was to embed data driven MT techniques within the interactive translation environment.",
        "Following these TT ideas, (Barrachina and others, 2008) propose the usage of fully-fledged statistical MT (SMT) systems to produce full target sentence hypotheses, or portions thereof, which can be partially or completely accepted and amended by a human translator.",
        "Each partial correct text segment is then used by the SMT system as additional information to achieve further, hopefully improved suggestions.",
        "In this paper, we also focus on the interactive and predictive, statistical MT (IMT) approach to CAT.",
        "The IMT paradigm fits well within the Interactive Pattern Recognition framework introduced in (Vidal and others, 2007).",

        "Therefore, the IMT system has to provide an initial complete translation sh, as it were a conventional SMT system.",

        "The process continues until the whole sentence is correct that is validated introducing the special word \"#\".",
        "As the reader could devise from the IMT session described above, IMT aims at reducing the effort and increasing the productivity of translators, while preserving high-quality translation.",

        "It is important to point out that, by doing so, the user is already providing some very useful information to the system: he is validating a prefix up to the position where he positioned the cursor, and, in addition, he is signalling that whatever word is located after the cursor is to be considered incorrect.",

        "Hence, we are now considering two different situations: the first one, the traditional IMT framework, in which the system needs to find a suffix according to Eq.",

        "This being done, word graphs were generated for the IMT system.",
        "For this purpose, we used a multi-stack phrase-based decoder which will be distributed in the near future together with the Thot toolkit (Ortiz-Martinez et al., 2005).",
        "We discarded the use of the Moses decoder because preliminary experiments performed with it revealed that the decoder by (Ortiz-Martinez et al., 2005) performs clearly better when used to generate word graphs for use in IMT.",
        "In addition, we performed an experimental comparison in regular SMT with the Eu-roparl corpus, and found that the performance difference was negligible.",
        "The decoder was set to only consider monotonic translation, since in real IMT scenarios considering non-monotonic translation leads to excessive waiting time for the user.",
        "Finally, the word graphs obtained were used within the IMT procedure to produce the reference translation contained in the test set, measuring WSR and MAR.",

        "These intervals were computed following the bootstrap technique described in (Koehn, 2004).",
