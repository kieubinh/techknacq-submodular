        "There has been much work on topic modeling.",
        "Many models have been proposed including PLSI (Hofmann, 1999), LDA (Blei et al., 2003), and their extensions (Griffiths et al., 2005; Blei and Lafferty, 2006; Chemudugunta et al., 2007).",
        "Inference and learning methods have been developed, such as variational inference (Jordan et al., 1999; Wainwright and Jordan, 2003), expectation propagation (Minka and Lafferty, 2002), and Gibbs sampling (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004).",
        "Topic models have been utilized in topic discovery (Blei et al., 2003), document retrieval (Xing Wei and Bruce Croft, 2006), document classification (Blei et al., 2003), citation analysis (Dietz et al., 2007), social network analysis (Mei et al., 2008), and so on.",
        "Most of the existing models are for processing plain texts.",
        "There are also models for processing hypertexts, for example, (Cohn and Hofmann, 2001; Nallapati and Cohen, 2008; Gruber et al., 2008; Dietz et al., 2007), which are most relevant to our work.",
        "Cohn and Hofmann (2001) introduced a topic model for hypertexts within the framework of PLSI.",
        "The model, which is a combination of PLSI and the words and hyperlinks (outlinks) of the document in the generative process.",
        "The model is useful when the goal is to understand the distribution of links as well as the distribution of words.",
        "Erosheva et al. (2004) modified the model by replacing PLSI with LDA.",
        "We refer to the modified mode as Link-LDA and take it as a baseline in this paper.",
        "Note that the above two models do not directly associate the topics of the citing document with the topics of the cited documents.",
        "Nallapati and Cohn (2008) proposed an extension of Link-LDA called Link-PLSA-LDA, which is another baseline in this paper.",
        "Assuming that the citing and cited documents share similar topics, they explicitly model the information flow from the citing documents to the cited documents.",
        "In Link-PLSA-LDA, the link graph is converted into a bipartite graph in which links are connected from citing documents to cited documents.",
        "If a document has both inlinks and outlinks, it will be duplicated on both sides of the bipartite graph.",
        "The generative process for the citing documents is similar to that of Link-LDA, while the cited documents have a different generative process.",
        "Dietz et al. (2007) proposed a topic model for citation analysis.",
        "Their goal is to find topical influence of publications in research communities.",
        "They convert the citation graph (created from the publications) into a bipartite graph as in Link-PLSA-LDA.",
        "The content of a citing document is assumed to be generated by a mixture over the topic distribution of the citing document and the topic distributions of the cited documents.",
        "The differences between the topic distributions of citing and cited documents are measured, and the cited documents which have the strongest influence on the citing document are identified.",
        "Note that in most existing models described above the hyperlinks are assumed to be generated and link prediction is an important task, while in the HTM model in this paper, the hyperlinks are assumed to be given in advance, and the key task is topic identification.",
        "In the existing models for hypertexts, the content of a document (the word distribution of the document) are not decided by the other documents.",
        "In contrast, in HTM, the content of a document is determined by itself as well as its cited documents.",
        "Furthermore, HTM is a generative model which can generate the contents of all the hypertexts in a collection, given the link structure of the collection.",
        "Therefore, if the goal is to accurately learn and predict contents of documents, the use of HTM seems more reasonable."

        "It might be hard for the other baseline models to identify topics accurately.",
        "In contrast, HTM can accurately learn topics by the help of the cited documents.",
        "Specifically, if the content of a document is diverse, then words in the document are likely to be assigned into wrong topics by the existing approaches.",
        "In contrast, in HTM with propagation of topic distributions from cited documents, the words of a document can be more accurately assigned into topics.",
        "Table 5 shows the first 15 words and the last 10 words for the homepage given by HTM, in ascending order of bdn, which measures the degree of influence from the cited documents on the words (the smaller the stronger).",

        "We can see that there is a large agreement between the most salient topics in the cited documents and the topics which are affected the most in the citing document.",
        "Parameter A is the only parameter in HTM which needs to be tuned.",
        "We found that the performance of HTM is not very sensitive to the values of A, which reflects the degree of influence from the cited documents to the citing document.",
        "HTM can perform well with different A values.",
        "Figure 4 shows the classification accuracies of HTM with respect to different A values for the three datasets.",

        "In this paper, we have proposed a novel topic model for hypertexts called HTM.",
        "Existing models for processing hypertexts were developed based on the assumption that both words and hyperlinks are stochastically generated by the model.",
        "The generation of latter type of data is actually unnecessary for representing contents of hypertexts.",
        "In the HTM model, it is assumed that the hyperlinks of hypertexts are given and only the words of the hypertexts are stochastically generated.",
        "Furthermore, the word distribution of a document is determined not only by the topics of the document in question but also from the topics of the documents which the document cites.",
        "It can be regarded as 'propagation' of topics reversely along hyperlinks in hypertexts, which can lead to more accurate representations than the existing models.",
        "HTM can naturally mimic human's process of creating a document (i.e., by considering using the topics of the document and at the same time the topics of the documents it cites).",
        "We also developed methods for learning and inferring an HTM model within the same framework as LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation).",
        "Experimental results show that the proposed HTM model outperforms the existing models of LDA, Link-LDA, and Link-PLSA-LDA on three datasets for topic discovery and document classification.",
