        "The method learns relevant features to assign case roles to the argument of the target predicate using the features of the words located closest to the target predicate under various constraints such as dependency types, words, semantic categories, parts of speech, functional words and predicate voices.",
        "We constructed decision lists in which these features were sorted by their learned weights.",
        "Using our method, we integrated the tasks of semantic role labeling and zero-pronoun identification, and achieved a 17% improvement compared with a baseline method in a sentence level performance analysis."

        "Recently, predicate argument structure analysis has attracted the attention of researchers because this information can increase the precision of text processing tasks, such as machine translation, information extraction (Hirschman et al., 1999), question answering (Narayanan and Harabagiu, 2004) (Shen and Lapata, 2007), and summarization (Melli et al., 2005).",
        "In English predicate argument structure analysis, large corpora such as FrameNet (Fillmore et al., 2001), PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) and NomBank (Meyers et al., 2004) have been created and utilized.",
        "Recently, the GDA Corpus (Hashida, 2005), Kyoto Text Corpus Ver.4.0 (Kawahara et al., were constructed in Japanese, and these corpora have become the target of an automatic Japanese predicate argument structure analysis system.",
        "We conducted Japanese predicate argument structure (PAS) analysis for the NAIST Text Corpus, which is the largest of these three corpora, and, as far as we know, this is the first time PAS analysis has been conducted for whole articles of the corpus.",
        "The NAIST Text Corpus has the following characteristics, i) semantic roles for both predicates and event nouns are annotated in the corpus, ii) three major case roles, namely the ga, wo and ni-cases in Japanese are annotated for the base form of predicates and event nouns, iii) both the case roles in sentences containing the target predicates and those outside the sentences (zero-pronouns) are annotated, and iv) coreference relations are also annotated.",
        "As regards i), recently there has been an increase in the number of papers dealing with nominalized predicates (Pradhan et al., 2004) (Jiang and Ng, 2006) (Xue, 2006) (Liu and Ng, 2007).",
        "For example, 'trip' in the sentence \"During my trip to Italy, I met him.\"",
        "refers not only to the event \"I met him\" but also to the event \"I traveled to Italy.\"",
        "As in this example, nouns sometimes have argument structures referring to an event.",
        "Such nouns are called event nouns (Komachi et al., 2007) in the NAIST Text Corpus.",
        "At the same time, the problems related to compound nouns are also important.",
        "In Japanese, a compound noun sometimes simultaneously contains both an event noun and its arguments.",
        "For example, the compound noun, 'kkHMR (corporate buyout)' contains an event noun 'MR (buyout)' and its accusative, 'kkM (corporate).'",
        "However, compound",
        "Proceedings of the 2008 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 523-532, Honolulu, October 2008.",

        "nouns provide no information about syntactic dependency or about case markers, so it is difficult to specify the predicate-argument structure.",
        "Komachi et al.",
        "investigated the argument structure of event nouns using the co-occurrence of target nouns and their case roles in the same sentence (Komachi et al., 2007).",
        "In these approaches, predicates and event nouns are dealt with separately.",
        "Here, we try to unify these different argument structures using decision lists.",
        "As regards ii), for example, in the causative sentence, '^7V-ttfAfc^t5#^*5 (Mary makes Tom fix dinner),' the basic form of the causative verb, (make fix)' is (fix),' and its nominative is ' (Tom)' and the accusative case role (wo-case) is '^:f% (dinner),' although the surface case particle is ni (dative).",
        "We must deal with syntactic transformations in passive, causative, and benefactive constructions when analyzing the corpus.",
        "As regards iii) and iv), in Japanese, zero pronouns often occur, especially when the argument has already been mentioned in previous sentences.",
        "There have been many studies of zero-pronoun identification (Walker et al., 1994) (Nakaiwa, 1997) (Iida et al., 2006).",
        "In this paper, we present a general procedure for handling both the case role assignment of predicates and event nouns, and zero-pronoun identification.",
        "We use the decision list learning of rules to find the closest words with various constraints, because with decision lists the readability of learned lists is high and the learning is fast.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "We describe the NAIST Text Corpus, which is our target corpus in Section 2.",
        "We describe our proposed method in Section 3.",
        "The result of experiments using the NAIST Text Corpus and our method are reported in Section 4 and our conclusions are provided in Section 5."

        "To evaluate our algorithm, we conducted experiments using a baseline method.",
        "With the method, we used only nouns that depended on predicates or event nouns as case role candidates.",
        "If the functional word (post-positional case) in the phrase is 'ga','wo' and 'ni , we determined the ga-case, wo-case, or ni-case for the candidates.",
        "Next, as regards event nouns in compound nouns, if there was another word in a compound noun containing an event noun and it co-occurred with the event noun as a case role with a higher probability in the training samples, then the word was selected for the case role.",
        "The conventional approach for making decision lists utilizes the entropy of samples selected by the rules (Yarowsky, 1994) (Goodman, 2002).",
        "We performed comparative experiments using Yarowsky's entropy algorithm (Yarowsky, 1994).",
        "The overall results are shown in Table 7.",
        "Here, 'entropy indicates Yarowsky s algorithm, which uses entropy (Yarowsky, 1994).",
        "Throughout the test data, the F-measure (%) of our method exceeded that of the baseline system and the 'entropy system.",
        "With the ga-case (nominative) in particular, the F-measure increased 9 points.",
        "Table 3 shows some examples of the existing probabilities of case roles for predicates or event nouns.",
        "When the probabilities are extreme values such as the ni-case (dative) of (negotiation), the wo-case (accusative) of #JD (participation), and the wo-case and ni-base of (based on), we can decide to fill the targeted case role or not with high precision.",
        "However, it is difficult to decide to fill the targeted case role or not when the probability is close to 50 percent as in the ga-case of (use).",
        "We show the learned decision list of the ic type (the case role depends on the predicate or event noun), sc type (in the same phrase) and the other types for event noun (negotiation) in Tables 4,5 and 6, respectively.",
        "Here, 'word in the 'level column means 'base form of predicate and 'sem means semantic category of predicate.",
        "In the ic and sc type decision lists, features with semantic categories, such as 'REGION', 'LOCATION' and 'EVENT , occupy a higher order.",
        "In contrast, in the list of the other types, the features that occupy the higher order are the features of the word base form.",
        "This means local knowledge of relations between case roles and predicates or event nouns in the word level is more important than semantic level knowledge.",
