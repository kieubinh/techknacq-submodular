        "One of the main difficulties in natural language processing is the lack of labeled data.",
        "Typically, obtaining labeled data requires hiring human annotators.",
        "Recently, building online games has been suggested an alternative to hiring annotators.",
        "For example, von Ahn and Dabbish (2004) built the ESP Game, an online game in which players tag images with words that describe them.",
        "It is well known that there are large numbers of web users who will play online games.",
        "If a game is fun, there is a good chance that sufficiently many online users will play.",
        "We have several objectives in this paper.",
        "The first is to discuss design decisions in building word games for collecting data, and the effects of these decisions.",
        "The second is to describe the word games that we implemented and the kinds of data they are designed to collect.",
        "As of June 2008, our games have been online for nearly a year, and have collected nearly 800,000 data instances.",
        "The third goal is to analyze the resulting data and demonstrate that the data collected from our games is potentially useful in linguistic applications.",
        "As an example application, we show that the data we have collected can be used to augment WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) with a significant number of new hypernyms."

        "Our primary goal is to produce a large amount of clean, useful data.",
        "Each of these three objectives (\"large\", \"clean\", and \"useful\") has important implications for the design of our games.",
        "First, in order to collect large amounts of data, the game must be attractive to users.",
        "If the game is not fun, people will not play it.",
        "This requirement is perhaps the most significant factor to take into account when designing a game.",
        "For one thing, it tends to discourage extremely complicated labeling tasks, since these are more likely to be viewed as work.",
        "It would certainly be a challenge (although not necessarily impossible) to design a game that yields labeled parse data, for example.",
        "In this paper, we assume that if people play a game in real life, there is a good chance they will play it online as well.",
        "To this end, we built online versions of two popular \"real-world\" games: ScattergoriesTM and TabooTM.",
        "Not only are these games fun, but there is also a preexisting demand for online versions of these games, driving search traffic to our site.",
        "We will go into more detail about these games in the next section.",
        "An important characteristic of these games is that they involve more than one player.",
        "Interacting with another player increases the sense of fun.",
        "Another important feature these games share is that they are",

        "timed.",
        "Timing has several advantages.",
        "First, timing helps make the games feel more \"game-like\", by adding a sense of urgency.",
        "Without timing, it risks feeling more like a labeling task than a game.",
        "The next requirement is that the data be clean.",
        "First, the players must be capable of producing high-quality annotations.",
        "Second, the game should encourage users to enter relevant data.",
        "We award points as a motivating factor, but this can lead players to enter irrelevant data, or collude with other players, in order to get a higher score.",
        "In particular, collusion is more likely when players can freely communicate.",
        "An excellent technique for producing good data, used effectively in the ESP game, is to require the players to match on their inputs.",
        "Requiring players to match their partner's hidden answers discourages off-topic answers and makes it quite difficult to collude (requiring outside communication).",
        "We use this technique in all of our games.",
        "Finally, the data must be useful.",
        "Ideally, it would be directly applicable to an NLP task.",
        "This requirement can come into conflict with the other goals.",
        "There are certainly many kinds of data that would be useful for NLP tasks (such as labeled parses), but designing a game to collect this data that people will play and that produces clean data is difficult.",
        "In this paper, we focus on a particular kind of linguistic data: semantic relationships between pairs of words and/or phrases.",
        "We do this for several reasons.",
        "First, this kind of data is relatively simple, leading to fun games which produce relatively clean data.",
        "Second, the real-world games we chose to emulate naturally produce this kind of data.",
        "Third, there are a number of recent works which focus on extracting these kinds of relationships, e.g. (Snow et al., 2006; Nakov & Hearst, 2008).",
        "Our work presents an interesting new way of extracting this type of data.",
        "Finally, at least one of these kinds of relationships, the hypernym, or \"X is a Y\" relation, has proven to be useful for a variety of NLP tasks."

        "We now describe our three games in detail.",
        "3.1 Categorilla",
        "Categorilla, inspired by ScattergoriesTM, asks players to supply words or phrases which fit specific categories, such as \"Things that fly\" or \"Types of fish\".",
        "In addition, each game has a specific letter which all answers must begin with.",
        "Thus, if the current game has letter \"b\", reasonable answers would be \"bird\" and \"barracuda\", respectively.",
        "In each game, a randomly matched pair of players are given the same 10 categories; they receive points when they match with the other player for a particular category.",
        "Players are allowed to type as may answers for a given category as they wish (until a match is made for that category).",
        "After a match is made, the players get to see what word they matched on for that category.",
        "Each answer is supposed to fit into a specific category, so the data is automatically structured.",
        "Our system contains 8 types of categories, many of which were designed to correspond to linguistic resources used in NLP applications.",
        "Table 1 describes the category types.",
        "The purpose of the first three types of categories is to extract hypernym/hyponym pairs like those found in WordNet (e.g., \"food\" is a hypernym of \"pizza\").",
        "In fact, the categories were automatically generated from WordNet, as follows.",
        "First, we assigned counts Cs to each synset s in WordNet using the Sem-Cor labeled data set of word senses.",
        "Let desc(s) be the set of descendants of s in the hypernym hierarchy.",
        "Then for each pair of synsets s, d, where d G desc(s), we computed a conditional distribution P(d|s) = ^- – – , the probability that we choose node d from among the descendants of s. Finally, we computed the entropy of each node s in WordNet^dedesc(s) P(d|s)logP(d|s).",
        "Synsets with many different descendants occurring in Sem-Cor will have higher entropies.",
        "Each node with a sufficiently high entropy was chosen as a category.",
        "We then turned each synset into a category by taking the first word in that synset and plugging it into one of several set phrases.",
        "For nouns, we tried two variants (\"Types of food\" and \"Foods\").",
        "Depending on the noun, either of these may be more natural (consider \"Cities\" vs. \"Types of city\").",
        "\"Types of food\" tends to produce more adjectival answers than \"Foods\".",
        "We tried only one variation for verbs (\"Methods of paying\").",
        "This phrasing is not perfect; in particular, it encourages non-verb answers like \"credit card\".",
        "The second group of categories tries to capture selectional preferences of verbs - for example, \"banana\" makes sense as the object of \"eat\" but not as the subject.",
        "Our goal with these categories was to produce data useful for automatically labeling semantic roles (Gildea & Jurafsky, 2002), where selectional preferences play an important role.",
        "We tried three different types of categories, corresponding to subjects, objects, and prepositional objects.",
        "Examples are \"Things that eat\", \"Things that are eaten\", and \"Things that are eaten with\", to which good answers would be \"animals\", \"food\", and \"forks\".",
        "These categories were automatically generated using the labeled parses in Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) and the labeled semantic roles of Prop-Bank (Kingsbury et al., 2002).",
        "To generate the object categories, for example, for each verb we then counted the number of times a core argument (ARG0-ARG5) appeared as the direct object of that verb (according to the gold-standard parses), and used all verbs with count at least 5.",
        "This guaranteed that all generated categories were grammatically correct and captured information about core arguments for that verb.",
        "Most of the prepositional object categories proved to be quite confusing (e.g., \"Things that are acted as\"), so we manually removed all but the most clear.",
        "Not surprisingly, the use of the Wall Street Journal had a noticeable effect on the types of categories extracted; they have a definite financial bias.",
        "The third group of categories only has one type, which consists of adjective categories such as \"Things that are large\".",
        "While we did not have any specific task in mind for this category type, having a database of attributes/noun pairs seems potentially useful for various NLP tasks.",
        "To generate these categories, we simply took the most common adjectives in the SemCor data set.",
        "Again, the resulting set of adjectives reflect the corpus; for example, \"Things that are green\" was not generated as a category, while \"Things that are corporate\" was.",
        "The final group of categories were hand-written.",
        "This group was added to make sure that a sufficient number of \"fun\" categories were included, since some of the category types, particularly the verb categories, are somewhat confusing and difficult.",
        "Most of the handwritten categories are of the form \"Things found at/in X\", where X is a location, such as \"Japan\" or \"the ocean\".",
        "The starting letter requirement also has important consequences for data collection.",
        "It was designed to increase the variety of obtained data; without this restriction, players might produce a smaller set of \"obvious\" answers.",
        "As we will see in the results, this restriction did indeed lead to a great diversity of answers, but at a severe cost to data quality.",
        "Categodzilla is a slightly modified version of Cat-egorilla, with the starting letter constraint relaxed.",
        "The combination of difficult categories and rare letters often leads to bad answers in Categorilla.",
        "To increase data quality, in Categodzilla for each category there are three boxes.",
        "In the first box you can type any word you want.",
        "Answers in the second box must start with a given \"easy\" letter such as \"c\".",
        "Answers in the third box must start with a given \"hard\" letter, such as \"k\".",
        "The boxes much be matched in order; guesses typed in the first box which match either of the other two boxes are automatically propagated.",

        "If there are no past guesses, the bot instead makes \"imaginary\" guesses.",
        "For example, in Categorilla, we make the (obviously false) assumption that for every category and every starting letter there are exactly 20 possible answers, and that both the player's guesses and the bot's imaginary guesses are drawn from those 20 answers.",
        "Then, given the number of guesses made by the player and the number of imaginary guesses made by the bot, the probability of a match can be computed (assuming that all",

        "An additional complication for Categorilla and Categodzilla is that the bot has to decide which categories to make guesses for, and in what order.",
