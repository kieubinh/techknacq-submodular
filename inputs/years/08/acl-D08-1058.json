        "(2007); the other is to translate the texts in a new language into English texts, and then perform sentiment analysis in the English language, which has not yet been investigated.",
        "In this study, we first translate Chinese reviews into English reviews by using machine translation services, and then identify the sentiment polarity of English reviews by directly leveraging English resources.",
        "Furthermore, ensemble methods are employed to combine the individual analysis results in each language (i.e. Chinese and English) in order to obtain improved results.",
