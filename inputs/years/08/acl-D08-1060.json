        "One of the main issues that a translator (human or machine) must address during the translation process is how to match the different word orders between the source language and the target language.",
        "Different language-pairs require different levels of word reordering.",
        "For example, when we translate between English and Spanish (or other Romance languages), most of the word reordering needed is local because of the shared syntactical features (e.g., Spanish noun modifier constructs are written in English as modifier noun).",
        "However, for syntactically distant language-pairs such as Chinese-English, long-range reordering is required where whole phrases are moved across the sentence.",
        "The idea of \"syntactic cohesion\" (Fox, 2002) is characterized by its simplicity, which has attracted researchers for years.",
        "Previous works include several approaches of incorporating syntactic information to preprocess the source sentences to make them more like the target language in structure.",
        "Xia and McCord (2004) (Niessen and Ney, 2004; Collins et al., 2005) described approaches applied to language-pairs such as French-English and German-English.",
        "Later, Wang et al.",
        "(2007) presented specific rules to pre-order long-range movements of words, and improved the translations for Chinese-to-English.",
        "Overall, these works are similar, in that they design a few language-specific and linguistically motivated reordering rules, which are generally simple.",
        "The eleven rules described in Wang et al.",
        "(2007) are appealing, as they have rather simple structure, modeling only NP, VP and LCP via one-level sub-tree structure with two children, in the source parse-tree (a special case of ITG (Wu, 1997)).",
        "It effectively enhances the quality of the phrase-based translation of Chinese-to-English.",
        "One major weakness is that the reordering decisions were done in the preprocessing step, therefore rendering the decoding process unable to recover the reordering errors from the rules if incorrectly applied to.",
        "Also the reordering decisions are made without the benefits of additional models (e.g., the language models) that are typically used during decoding.",
        "Another method to address the reordering problem in translation is the Hiero model proposed by Chiang (2005), in which a probabilistic synchronous context free grammar (PSCFG) was applied to guide the decoding.",

        "by introducing a single generic nonterminal (i.e., a variable) [X].",
        "The combination of variables and lex-icalized words in a Hiero rule nicely captures local word and phrase reordering (modeling an implicit reordering window of max-phrase length).",
        "These rules are then applied in a CYK-style decoder.",
        "In Hiero rules, any nested phrase-pair can be generalized as variables [X].",
        "This usually leads to too many redundant translations, which worsens the spurious ambiguities (Chiang, 2005) problems for both decoding and optimization (i.e., parameter tuning).",
        "We found thatvariables (nonterminal [X]) in Hiero rules offer a generalization too coarse to improve the effectiveness of hierarchical models' performance.",
        "We propose to enrich the variables in Hiero rules with additional source syntactic reordering information, in the form of shallow Tree-to-String syntactic structures.",
        "The syntactic information is represented by flat one-level sub-tree structures, with Hiero-like nonterminal variables at the leaf nodes.",
        "The syntactic rules, proposed in this paper, are composed of (possibly lexicalized) source treelets and target surface strings, with one or more variables that help capture local-reordering similar to the Hiero rules.",
        "Variables in a given rule are derived not only from the embedded aligned blocks (phrase-pairs), but also from the aligned source syntactic constituents.",
        "The aligned constituents, as in our empirical observations for Chinese-English, tend to move together in translations.",
        "The decoder is guided by these rules to reduce spurious derivations; the rules also constrain the exploration of the search space toward better translation quality and sometime improved speed by breaking long sentences into pieces.",
        "Overall, what we want is to enable the long-range reordering decisions to be local in a chart-based decoder.",
        "To be more specific, we think the simple shallow syntactic structure is powerful enough for capturing the major structure-reordering patterns, such as NP, VP and LCP structures.",
        "We also use simple frequency-based feature functions, similar to the blocks used in phrase-based decoder, to further improve the rules' representation power.",
        "Overall, this enables us to avoid either a complex decoding process to generate the source parse tree, or difficult combinatorial optimizations for the feature functions associated with rules.",
        "In Marton and Resnik (2008), hiero variables were disambiguated with additional binary feature functions, with their weights optimized in standard MER training.",
        "The combinatorial effects of the added feature functions can make the feature selection and optimization of the weights rather difficult.",
        "Since the grammar is essentially the same as the Hiero ones, a standard CYK decoder can be simply applied in their work.",
        "Word reordering can also be addressed via distortion models.",
        "Work in (Al-Onaizan and Kishore, 2006; Xiong et al., 2006; Zens et al., 2004; Kumar and Byrne, 2005; Tillmann and Zhang, 2005) modeled the limited information available at phrase-boundaries.",
        "Syntax-based approaches such as (Yamada and Knight, 2001; Graehl and Knight, 2004; Liu et al., 2006) heavily rely on the parse-tree to constrain the search space by assuming a strong mapping of structures across distant language-pairs.",
        "Their algorithms are also subject to parsers' performances to a larger extent, and have high complexity and less scalability in reality.",
        "In Liu et al.",
        "(2007), multilevel tree-structured rules were designed, which made the decoding process very complex, and auxiliary rules have to be designed and incorporated to shrink multiple source nonterminals into one target nonterminal.",
        "From our empirical observations, most of the time, however, the multilevel tree-structure is broken in the translation process, and POS tags are frequently distorted.",
        "Indeed, strictly following the source parse tree is usually not necessary, and maybe too expensive for the translation process.",
        "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: in section § 2, we define the notations in our synchronous context free grammar, in section § 3, the rule extractions are illustrated in details, in section § 4, the decoding process ofapplying these rules is described.",
        "Experiments in § 5 were carried out using GALE Dev07 datasets.",

        "In fact, due to parser's performance and word alignment accuracies, the statistics we collected from the GALE dataset, containing 10 million sentence-pairs, show that the children in the subtree VP(PP,VP) is translated monotonically 126310 times, while reordered of only 22144 times.",
        "However, the hand-aligned data support the swap for 1245 times, and monotonically for only 168 times.",
        "Part of this disagreement is due to the word segmentation errors, incorrect word alignments and unreliable parsing results.",

        "Instead of hypothesizing spontaneous words based only on the language model or only on observing in phrase-pairs, we make use of the Tree-to-String rules to get suggestion on the insertion of spontaneous words.",

        "The advantage of this method is shown in Table 4.",

        "The gain came mostly from the richer extracted rule set, which not only presents robust statistics for reordering patterns, but also offers more target spontaneous words generated from the syntactic structures.",
        "Since the top-frequent rules extracted are NP, VP, and IP as shown in Table 3, our proposed rules will be able to win the correct word order with reliable statistics, as long as the parser shows acceptable performances on these structures.",
