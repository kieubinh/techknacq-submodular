        "Users of large document collections can readily acquire information about the instances, classes, and relationships described in the documents.",
        "Such relations play an important role in both natural language understanding and Web search, as illustrated by their prominence in both Web documents and among the search queries submitted most frequently by Web users (Jansen et al., 2000).",
        "These observations motivate our work on algorithms to extract instance-class information from Web documents.",
        "While work on named-entity recognition traditionally focuses on the acquisition and identification of instances within a small set of coarse-grained classes, the distribution of instances within query logs indicates that Web search users are interested in a wider range of more fine-grained classes.",
        "Depending on prior knowledge, personal interests and immediate needs, users submit for example medical queries about the symptoms of leptospirosis or the treatment of monkeypox, both of which are instances of zoonotic diseases, or the risks and benefits of surgical procedures such as PRK and angioplasty.",
        "Other users may be more interested in African countries such as Uganda and Angola, or active volcanoes like Etna and Kilauea.",
        "Note that zoonotic diseases, surgical procedures, African countries and active volcanoes serve as useful class labels that capture the semantics of the associated sets of class instances.",
        "Such interest in a wide variety of specific domains highlights the utility of constructing large collections of fine-grained classes.",
        "Comprehensive and accurate class-instance information is useful not only in search but also in a variety of other text processing tasks including co-reference resolution (McCarthy and Lehn-ert, 1995), named entity recognition (Stevenson and Gaizauskas, 2000) and seed-based information extraction (Riloff and Jones, 1999).",
        "We study the acquisition of open-domain, labeled classes and their instances from both structured and unstructured textual data sources by combining and ranking individual extractions in a principled way with the Adsorption label-propagation algorithm (Baluja et al., 2008), reviewed in Section 3 below.",

        "To show Adsorption's ability to uniformly combine extractions from multiple sources and methods, we apply it to: 1) high-precision open-domain extractions from free Web text (Van Durme and Pasxa, 2008), and 2) high-recall extractions from WebTa-bles, a large database of HTML tables mined from the Web (Cafarella et al., 2008).",
        "These two methods were chosen to be representative of two broad classes of extraction sources: free text and structured Web documents.",
        "Van Durme and Pa§ca (2008) produce an open-domain set of instance clusters C G C that partitions a given set of instances I using distributional similarity (Lin and Pantel, 2002), and labels using is-a patterns (Hearst, 1992).",
        "By filtering the class labels using distributional similarity, a large number of high-precision labeled clusters are extracted.",
        "The algorithm proceeds iteratively: at each step, all clusters are tested for label coherence and all coherent labels are tested for high cluster specificity.",
        "Label L is coherent if it is shared by at least J % of the instances in cluster C, and it is specific if the total number of other clusters C' G C, C' = C containing instances with label L is less than K. When a cluster is found to match these criteria, it is removed from C and added to an output set.",
        "The procedure terminates when no new clusters can be removed from C. Table 1 shows a few randomly chosen classes and representative instances obtained by this procedure.",
        "To expand the instance sets extracted from free text, we use a table-based extraction method that mines structured Web data in the form of HTML tables.",
        "A significant fraction of the HTML tables in Web pages is assumed to contain coherent lists of instances suitable for extraction.",
        "Identifying such tables from scratch is hard, but seed instance lists can be used to identify potentially coherent table columns.",
        "In this paper we use the WebTables database of around 154 million tables as our structured data source (Cafarella et al., 2008).",
        "We employ a simple ranking scheme for candidate instances in the WebTables corpus T. Each table T G T consists of one or more columns.",
        "Each column g G T consists of a set of candidate instances i G g corresponding to row elements.",
        "We define the set of unique seed matches in g relative to semantic class C G C as where I(C) denotes the set of instances in seed class C. For each column g, we define its a-unique class coverage, that is, the set of classes that have at least a unique seeds in g,",
        "Q(g; a) = {C GC : |Mc(g)| > a}.",
        "Using M and Q we define a method for scoring columns relative to each class.",
        "Intuitively, such a score should take into account not only the number of matches from class C, but also the total number of classes that contribute to Q and their relative overlap.",
        "Towards this end, we introduce the scoring function",
        "class coherence seed matches",
        "which is the simplest scoring function combining the number of seed matches with the coherence of the table column.",
        "Coherence is a critical notion in WebTables extraction, as some tables contain instances across many diverse seed classes, contributing to extraction noise.",

        "is, a column containing many semantically similar classes is penalized less than one containing diverse classes.",
        "Finally, an extracted instance i is assigned a score relative to class C equal to the sum of all its column scores, e g€T,Ter where - c is a normalizing constant set to the maximum score of any instance in class C. This scoring function assigns high rank to instances that occur frequently in columns with many seed matches and high class specificity.",

        "For example, an ambiguous instance such as Michael Jordan could belong to the class of both Professors and NBA players.",
        "Similarly, an instance may belong to multiple nodes in the hierarchy of classes.",

        "• Graphs make explicit the potential paths of information propagation that are implicit in the more common local heuristics used for weakly-supervised information extraction.",
        "For example, if we know that the instance Bill Clinton belongs to both classes President and Politician then this should be treated as evidence that the class of President and Politician are related.",

        "In particular, for each (i, C, w) triple from the set of base extractions, i and C are added to V and (i, C ) is added to E, with W (i, C ) = w. The weight w represents the total score of all extractions with that instance and class.",

        "This simple graph representation could be refined with additional types of nodes and edges, as we discuss in Section 7.",

        "The field of open-domain information extraction has been driven by the growth of Web-accessible data.",
        "We have staggering amounts of data from various structured and unstructured sources such as general Web text, online encyclopedias, query logs, web tables, or link anchor texts.",
        "Any proposed algorithm to extract information needs to harness several data sources and do it in a robust and scalable manner.",
        "Our work in this paper represents a first step towards that goal.",
        "In doing so, we achieved the following:",
        "1.",
        "Improved coverage relative to a high accuracy instance-class extraction system while maintaining adequate precision.",
        "2.",
        "Combined information from two different sources: free text and web tables.",
        "3.",
        "Demonstrated a graph-based label propagation algorithm that given as little as five seeds per class achieved good results on a graph with more than a million nodes and 70 million edges.",
        "In this paper, we started off with a simple graph.",
        "For future work, we plan to proceed along the following lines:",
        "1.",
        "Encode richer relationships between nodes, for example instance-instance associations and other types of nodes.",
        "2.",
        "Combine information from more data sources to answer the question of whether more data or diverse sources are more effective in increasing precision and coverage.",
        "3.",
        "Apply similar ideas to other information extraction tasks such as relation extraction."
