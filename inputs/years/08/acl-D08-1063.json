        "Experiments run on three language pairs (Arabic-English, Chinese-English, and Spanish-English) show that one can achieve relatively decent performance by propagating information from a language with richer resources such as English into a foreign language alone (no resources or models in the foreign language).",
        "Furthermore, while examining the performance using various degrees of linguistic information in a statistical framework, results show that propagated features from English help improve the source-language system performance even when used in conjunction with all feature types built from the source language.",
        "The experiments also show that using propagated features in conjunction with lexically-derived features only (as can be obtained directly from a mention annotated corpus) yields similar performance to using feature types derived from many linguistic resources."

        "Information extraction is a crucial step toward understanding a text, as it identifies the important conceptual objects and relations between them in a discourse.",
        "It includes classification, filtering, and selection based on the language content of the source data, i.e., based on the meaning conveyed by the data.",
        "It is a crucial step for several applications, such as summarization, information retrieval, data mining, question answering, language understanding, etc.",
        "This paper addresses an important and basic task of information extraction: mention detection: the identification and classification of textual references to objects/abstractions mentions, which can be either named (e.g. John Smith), nominal (the president) or pronominal (e.g. he, she).",
        "For instance, in the sentence",
        "President John Smith said he_ has no comments.",
        "there are three mentions: President, John Smith and he.",
        "This is similar to the named entity recognition (NER) task with the additional twist of also identifying nominal and pronominal mentions.",
        "A few languages have received a lot of attention in terms of natural language resources that were created - for instance, in English one has access to labeled part-of-speech data, word sense information, parse tree structure, discourse, semantic role labeles, named entity data, to name just a few (our apologies if we missed your favorite resource).",
        "There are a few other languages that also have annotated resources (such as Arabic, Chinese, German, French, Spanish, etc), but also a very large number of languages with few resources.",
        "It would be very useful if one could make use of the resources in the former languages to help bootstrapping (or just the projection) of resource in any resource-challenged language.",
        "Information transfer from a language to another can be very useful when the \"donor\" language has more resources than the receiving one.",
        "As resources grow in quantity and quality in the receiving language, it becomes less and less likely that there will be a gain in performance by transfering information, as there are several sources of noise involved in the process - such as the translation (machine generated or not) and the inherent imperfection of the mention detection in the donor language.",
        "To test this hypothesis, we conducted experiments on systems build with a varied amount of resources in the receiving language, starting with the case where there are none (all information is transferred through translation alignment), and ending with the case where we used all the resources we could gather for that language.",
        "The experiments will show that the gain in performance decreases with the amount of resources used in the source language, but, still, even when all resources were used, a statistically significant gain was still observed.",
        "Similarly to classical NLP tasks such as text chunking (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) and named entity recognition (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002), we formulate mention detection as a sequence classification problem, by assigning a label to each token in the text, indicating whether it starts a specific mention, is inside a specific mention, or is outside any mentions.",
        "The classification is performed with a statistical approach, built around the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) principle (Berger et al., 1996), that has the advantage of combining arbitrary types of information in making a classification decision."

        "The earliest investigations of the subject have been performed, on word sense disambiguation (Dagan et al., 1991; P.F.Brown et al., 1991; Gale et al., 1992) (perhaps unsurprisingly given its close connection to machine translation) - all propose and (lightly) evaluate methods to use word sense information extracted from the target language to help the sense resolution in the source language and machine translation.",
        "(Dagan and Itai, 1994) explicitly suggests performing word sense disambiguation in the target language (English in the article) with the goal of resolving ambiguity in the source language (Hebrew), and show moderate improvement on a small data set.",
        "More recently, (Diab and Resnik, 2001) presents a method for performing word sense tagging in both the source and target texts of parallel bilingual corpora with the English WordNet sense inventory, by using translation correspondences.",
        "On more general cross-language information transfer, (Yarowsky et al., 2001) proposed and evaluated a method of propagating POS tagging, named mention, base noun phrase, and morphological information from English into a foreign language, which is very similar to the one presented in this article (experiments were run on French, Chinese, Czech, and Spanish - on human-generated translations).",
        "Their results show a significant improvement in performance while building an automatic classifier on the projected annotations over the same automatic classifier trained on a small amount of annotated data in the source language.",
        "(Riloff et al., 2002) extends the ideas in (Yarowsky et al., 2001), by showing how it can be used, in conjunction with an automatically trained information extraction system on the source language, to bootstrap the annotation of resources in the target language.",
        "They show that they can obtain 48 F-measure on a information extraction task identifying locations, vehicles and victims in plane crashes.",
        "(Hwa et al., 2002) proposes a framework that enables the acquisition of syntactic dependency trees for low-resource languages by importing linguistic annotation from rich-resource languages (English).",
        "The authors run a large-scale experiment in which Chinese dependency parses were induced from English, and show that a parser trained on the resulting trees outperformed simple baselines.",
        "(Cabezas et al., 2001) investigates a similar method of propagating syntactic treebank-like annotations from English to Spanish.",
        "Finally, a large body of research has been done on cross-language information retrieval, where the goal is to find information in one language (e.g. Chinese newswire) corresponding to a query in a different language (e.g. English) - although the list of relevant papers is too long to be mentioned here (see, for instance, (Grefenstette, 1998)).",

        "As mentioned in the introduction, the mention detection problem is formulated as a classification problem, by assigning to each token in the text a label, indicating whether it starts a specific mention, is inside a specific mention, or is outside any mentions.",
        "Good performance in many natural language processing tasks has been shown to depend heavily on integrating many sources of information (Florian et al., 2004).",
        "Given this observation, we are interested in algorithms that can easily integrate and make effective use of diverse input types.",
        "We select a exponential classifier, the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt henceforth) classifier that integrates arbitrary types of information and makes a classification decision by aggregating all information available for a given classification.",
        "But the reader can replace it with her favorite feature-based classifier throughout the paper.",
        "To help with the presentation, we introduce some notations: let Y = [vi,..., yn} be the set of predicted classes, X be the example space and F = [0,1}m be a feature space.",
        "Each example x G X has associated a vector of m binary features f (x) = (f1 (x)fm (x)).",
        "The goal of the training process is to associate examples x G X with either a probability distribution over the labels from Y, P ( |x)(if we are interested in soft classification) or associate one label y G Y (if we are interested in hard classification).",
        "The MaxEnt algorithm associates a set of weights [aij}j=i'\"m with the features (fj)i, and computes the probability distribution as where Z (x) is a normalization factor.",
        "The [aij}j=i m weights are estimated during the training phase to maximize the likelihood of the data (Berger et al., 1996).",
        "In this paper, the MaxEnt model is trained using the sequential conditional generalized iterative scaling (SCGIS) technique (Goodman, 2002), and it uses a Gaussian prior for regularization (Chen and Rosenfeld, 2000).",
        "Now take = (x1, x2,... xN), a sequence of contiguous tokens (i.e., a sentence or a document) in the source language.",
        "The goal of mention detection system is to find the most likely sequence of labels VN = (y1,y2 ...Vn) that best matches the input .",
        "In the mention detection case, each token xi in xNis tagged with a label yi as follows:",
        "• if it's not part of any entity, yi = O (O for \"outside any mentions\")",
        "• if it is part of an entity, it is composed of a sub-tag specifying whether it starts a mention (B-) or is inside a mention (I-), and a subtype corresponding to mention type (e.g. B-PERSON).",
        "In ACE, there are seven possible types: person, organization, location, facility, geopolitical entity (GPE), weapon, and vehicle.",
        "To compute the best sequence yN, we use",
        "arg max y where P (jjj |xN, yjl^ has an exponential form of the type (2).",
        "We also used the standard Markov assumption that the probability P |xN, yj- j only depends on the previous k classifications.",
        "This model is similar to the MEMM model (McCallum et al., 2000), but it does not separate the probability into generation probabilities and transition probabilities, and, crucially, has access to \"future\" observed features (i.e. it can examine the entire xN sequence, though in practice it will only examine some small part of it) - which is one way of eliminating label",
        "The experiments are run on four languages, part of the ACE-2007 evaluation (NIST, 2007): Arabic, Chinese, English and Spanish.",
        "Systems across the languages use a large range of features, including lexical (words and morphs in a 3-word window, prefixes and suffixes of length up to 4 characters, WordNet (Miller, 1995) for English), syntactic (POS tags, text chunks), and the output of other information extraction models.",
        "These features were described in (Florian et al., 2004), and are not discussed here.",
        "In this paper we focus on the examining the benefit of cross-language mention propagation information in improving mention detection systems.",
        "Besides generic types of features, we also have implemented language-specific features:",
        "• In Arabic, blank-delimited words are composed of zero or more prefixes, followed by a stem and zero or more suffixes.",
        "Each prefix, stem or suffix is a token; any contiguous sequence of tokens can represent a mention.",
        "Similar to the approaches described in (Florian et al., 2004) and (Zitouni et al., 2005), we decided to \"condition\" the output of the system on the segmented data: the text is segmented first into tokens and classification is then performed on tokens.",
        "The segmentation model is similar to the one presented by (Lee et al., 2003) and obtains an accuracy of 98%.",
        "• In Chinese text, unlike in Indo-European languages, words neither are white-space delimited nor do they have capitalization markers.",
        "Instead of a word-based model, we build a character-based one, since word segmentation errors can lead to irrecoverable mention detection errors; Jing et al.",
        "(2003) also observes that character-based models are better performing than word-based ones.",
        "Word segmentation information is still useful and is integrated as an additional feature stream.",

        "The approach proposed in this article requires a mention detection system build in a resource-rich language, and a translation from the source language to the resource-rich language, together with word alignment.",
        "This assumption is realistic: while truly parallel data (humanly created) might be in short supply or harder to acquire, adapting statistical machine translation (SMT) systems from one language-pair to another is not as challenging as it used to be (Al-Onaizan and Papineni, 2006).",
        "We also find that there is a large number of parallel corpora available these days which cover many language pairs.",
        "For example, for the European Union's 23 official languages we find 253 language pairs; each document in one language might have to be translated in all other 22 languages.",

        "On the other hand, even though mention detection system is important for many natural language processing applications, we still find lack of mention-annotated corpora in many languages.",
        "In the approach we propose below, the annotated corpus used to train the mention detection classifier does not have to be part of a parallel corpus.",

        "As an example, if a sequence of tokens in the resource-rich language {iCi+1{i+2 is aligned to xjxj+1 in the source language and if {iCi+1{i+2 is tagged as a location mention, then the sequence xjxj+1 can be labeled as a location mention: BLOC, I-LOC.",

        "For each source language (Arabic, Chinese, or Arabic), we show the performance of propagating mentions from the English text.",
        "Even though no training data to build a source language mention classifier is available, we still can detect mentions with reasonably high accuracy.",
        "We consider the obtained accuracy as reasonably good because, as an example, the performance of a system that attaches to every word its most frequent label (unigram) is around 25% F-measure on Arabic.",
        "Results in Table 4 also show that even though the Chinese-to-English SMT system is lower in term of BLEU than the Arbic-to-English SMT system (0.32 vs. 0.55), performance of the cross-language propagation from English mention detection system onto Chinese is better than the performance of the propagation from English mention detection system onto Arabic.",
        "One reason for this is that we notice that Chinese-to-English SMT system translates and aligns ACE categories better than Arabic-to-English SMT system.",
        "In this section, we consider the case when we have available training data in the source language to be able to train a statistical classifier.",
        "We also consider that the classifier has access to lexical information only.",

        "Table 5 shows the performance ofthe 3 languages with and without cross-language mention propagation information from English, with the 3 propagation methods described in Section 4.",

        "We show that even when no training data is available in one source language, we can still build a decently performing baseline mention detection system by only using resources from English.",
        "This approach requires a mention detection system on a resource-rich language and an SMT system that translate text from the source to the resource-rich language, both of which can be attained.",
        "In cases when large resources are available in the source language, our cross language mention propagation technique is still able to further improve mention detection system performance.",
        "Experiments performed on the four languages of ACE 2007, with English chosen as the resource-rich language, show consistent and significant improvements across conditions and levels of linguistic sophistication.",
        "The experiments are conducted on clearly specified partitions of the ACE 2007 data set, so future comparisons against the presented work can be correctly and accurately made.",
        "We also note that systems that have access to lexical and cross language mention propagation information are as accurate as those that have access to lexical, syntactic and output of other information extraction models in the source language (but no cross-language resources).",
        "As future work, we plan to extend this work to use semi-supervised and unsupervised approaches that can make use of cross-language information propagation.",
        "We believe that it is important for the research community to continue to invest in building better resources in \"source\" languages, as it looks the most promising approach.",
