        "Coreference resolution is the problem of identifying which mentions (i.e., noun phrases) refer to which real-world entities.",
        "The availability of annotated coreference corpora produced as a result ofthe MUC conferences and the ACE evaluations has prompted the development of a variety of supervised machine learning approaches to coreference resolution in recent years.",
        "The focus of learning-based coreference research has also shifted from the acquisition of a pairwise model that determines whether two mentions are co-referring (e.g., Soon et al.",
        "(2001), Ng and Cardie (2002), Yang et al.",
        "(2003)) to the development of rich linguistic features (e.g., Ji et al.",
        "(2005), Ponzetto and Strube (2006)) and the exploitation of advanced techniques that involve joint learning (e.g., Daumé III and Marcu (2005)) and joint inference (e.g., Denis and Baldridge (2007)) for coreference resolution and a related extraction task.",
        "The rich features, coupled with the increased complexity of coreference models, have made these supervised approaches more dependent on labeled data and less applicable to languages for which little or no annotated data exists.",
        "Given the growing importance of multilingual processing in the NLP community, however, the development of unsupervised and weakly supervised approaches for the automatic processing ofresource-scarce languages has become more important than ever.",
        "In fact, several popular weakly supervised learning algorithms such as self-training, co-training (Blum and Mitchell, 1998), and EM (Dempster et al., 1977) have been applied to coreference resolution (Ng and Cardie, 2003) and the related task of pronoun resolution (Müller et al., 2002; Kehler et al., 2004; Cherry and Bergsma, 2005).",
        "Given a small number of coreference-annotated documents and a large number of unlabeled documents, these weakly supervised learners aim to incrementally augment the labeled data by iteratively training a classifieron the labeled data and using it to label mention pairs randomly drawn from the unlabeled documents as coreferent or not coreferent.",
        "However, classifying mention pairs using such iterative approaches is undesirable for coreference resolution: since the non-coreferent mention pairs significantly outnumber their coreferent counterparts, the resulting classifiers generally have an increasing tendency to (mis)label a pair as non-coreferent as bootstrapping progresses (see Ng and Cardie (2003)).",

        "inducing coreference partitions on unlabeled documents, rather than classifying mention pairs, via EM clustering (Section 2).",
        "In fact, our model combines the best of two worlds: it operates at the document level, while exploiting essential linguistic constraints on coreferent mentions (e.g., gender and number agreement) provided by traditional pairwise classification models.",

        "In this section, we will explain how we recast unsupervised coreference resolution as EM clustering.",
        "We begin by introducing some of the definitions and notations that we will use in this paper.",
        "A mention can be a pronoun, a name (i.e., a proper noun), or a nominal (i.e., a common noun).",
        "An entity is a set of coreferent mentions.",
        "Given a document D consisting of n mentions, mi,..., mn, we use Pairs(D) to denote the set of Q) mention pairs, [mij | 1 < i < j < n}, where mij is formed from mentions mi and mj.",
        "The pairwise probability formed from mi and mj refers to the probability that the pair mij is coreferent and is denoted as Pcoref (mij ).",
        "A clustering of n mentions is an n x n Boolean matrix C, where Cij (the (i,j)-th entry of C) is 1 if and only if mentions mi and mj are coref-erent.",
        "An entry in C is relevant if it corresponds to a mention pair in Pairs(D).",
        "A valid clustering is a clustering in which the relevant entries satisfy the transitivity constraint.",
        "In other words, C is valid if and only if (Cij =1 A Cjk = 1) ==> Cik = 1 V 1 < i < j < k < n. Hence, a valid clustering corresponds to a partition of a given set of mentions, and the goal of coreference resolution is to produce a valid clustering in which each cluster corresponds to a distinct entity.",
        "As mentioned previously, our generative model operates at the document level, inducing a valid clustering on a given document D. More specifically, our model consists of two steps.",
        "It first chooses a clustering C based on some clustering distribution P(C), and then generates D given C:",
        "P (D, C ) = P (C )P (D | C ).",
        "To facilitate the incorporation of linguistic constraints defined on a pair of mentions, we represent D by its mention pairs, Pairs(D).",
        "Now, assuming that these mention pairs are generated conditionally independently of each other given Cij,",
        "P(mij | Cij).",
        "mij EPairs(D)",
        "Next, we represent mij as a set of seven features that is potentially useful for determining whether mi and mj are coreferent (see Table 1).",
        "Hence, we can rewrite P(D | C) as",
        "mij dPairs(D)",
        "where mj is the value of the kth feature of mij.",
        "To reduce data sparseness and improve the estimation of the above probabilities, we make conditional independence assumptions about the generation of these feature values.",
        "Specifically, as shown in the first column of Table 1, we divide the seven features into three groups (namely, strong coreference indicators, linguistic constraints, and mention types), assuming that two feature values are conditionally independent if and only if the corresponding features belong to different groups.",
        "With this assumption, we can decompose P(mj, ...m | Cij) into a product of three probabilities: P(mj, mj , mj | Cij), P(mj,mj,mj | Cij), and P(mj | Cij).",
        "Each of these distributions represents a pair of multinomial distributions, one for the coreferent mention pairs (Cij = 1) and the other for the non-coreferent mention pairs (Cij = 0).",
        "Hence, the set of parameters of our model, 6, consists of P(mi,m,m | c), P (m, m, m | c), and P (m | c).",
        "Table 1 : Feature set for representing a mention pair.",
        "The first six features are relational features that test whether some property P holds for the mention pair under consideration and indicate whether the mention pair is TRUE or FALSE w.r.t.",
        "P; a value of Not Applicable is used when property P does not apply.",
        "To induce a clustering C on a document D, we run EM on our model, treating D as observed data and C as hidden data.",
        "Specifically, we use EM to iteratively estimate the model parameters, 6, from documents that are probabilistically labeled (with clusterings) and apply the resulting model to probabilistically relabel a document (with clusterings).",
        "More formally, we employ the following EM algorithm:",
        "E-step: Compute the posterior probabilities of the clusterings, P(C| D, 6), based on the current 6.",
        "M-step: Using P(C| D, 6) computed in the E-step, find the 6' that maximizes the expected complete log likelihood, £ C P (C |D, 6) log P (D, C |6').",
        "We begin the induction process at the M-step.",
        "To find the 6 that maximizes the expected complete log likelihood, we use maximum likelihood estimation with add-one smoothing.",
        "Since P(C|D, 6) is not available in the first EM iteration, we instead use an initial distribution over clusterings, P (C).",
        "The question, then, is: which P(C) should we use?",
        "One possibility is the uniform distribution over all (possibly invalid) clusterings.",
        "Another, presumably better, choice is a distribution that assigns non-zero probability mass to only the valid clusterings.",
        "Yet another possibility is to set P(C) based on a document labeled with coreference information.",
        "In our experiments, we employ this last method, assigning a probability of one to the correct clustering of the labeled document (see Section 4.1 for details).",
        "After (re-)estimating 6 in the M-step, we proceed to the E-step, where the goal is to find the conditional clustering probabilities.",
        "Given a document D, the number of coreference clusterings is exponential in the number of mentions in D, even if we limit our attention to those that are valid.",
        "To cope with this computational complexity, we approximate the E-step by computing only the conditional probabilities that correspond to the N most probable coreference clusterings given the current 6.",
        "We identify the N most probable clusterings and compute their probabilities as follows.",

        "In this section, we will give an overview of their model, discuss its weaknesses and propose three modifications to the model.",
        "For consistency, we follow Haghighi and Klein's (H&K) notations.",
        "Z is the set of random variables that refer to (indices of) entities.",
        "0z is the set of parameters associated with entity z.",
        "0 is the entire set of model parameters, which includes all the 0z's.",
        "Finally, X is the set of observed variables (e.g., the head of a mention).",
        "Given a document, the goal is to find the most probable assignment of entity indices to its mentions given the observed values.",
        "In other words, we want to maximize P(Z|X).",
        "In a Bayesian approach, we compute this probability by integrating out all the parameters.",
        "Specifically,",
        "P(Z|X) = j P(Z|X,0)P(0|X)#.",
        "The original H&K model is composed of a set of models: the basic model and two other models (namely, the pronoun head model and the salience model) that aim to improve the basic model.",
        "The basic model generates a mention in a two-step process.",
        "First, an entity index is chosen according to an entity distribution, and then the head of the mention is generated given the entity index based on an entity-specific head distribution.",
        "Here, we assume that (1) all heads H are observed and (2) a mention is represented solely by its head noun, so nothing other than the head is generated.",
        "Furthermore, we assume that the head distribution is drawn from a symmetric Dirichlet with concentration Ah.",
        "Hence, where Hi;j is the head of mention j in document i, and nh;Z is the number of times head h is emitted by entity index z in (Z, H – iJ).",
        "On the other hand, since the number of entities in a document is not known a priori, we draw the entity distribution from a Dirichlet process with concentration a, effectively yielding a model with an infinite number of mixture components.",
        "Using the Chinese restaurant process representation (see Teh et al.",
        "(2006)),",
        "P(Zi,- = z|Z – i,j) ocj a ' if f = ZnewJ I nz , otherwise where nz is the number of mentions in Z – iJ labeled with entity index z, and znew is a new entity index not already in Z – iJ.",
        "To perform inference, we use Gibbs sampling (Geman and Geman, 1984) to generate samples from this conditional distribution:",
        "where the two distributions on the right are defined as above.",
        "Starting with a random assignment of entity indices to mentions, the Gibbs sampler iteratively re-samples an entity index according to this posterior distribution given the current assignment.",
        "Head generation in the basic model is too simplistic: it has a strong tendency to assign the same entity index to mentions having the same head.",
        "This is particularly inappropriate for pronouns.",
        "Hence, we need a different model for generating pronouns.",
        "Before introducing this pronoun head model, we need to augment the set of entity-specific parameters, which currently contains only a distribution over heads (0Z).",
        "Specifically, we add distributions 0Z, 0z , and over entity properties: is a distribution over semantic types (per, org, loc, mi sc), over gender (male, female, either, neuter), and over number (sg, pl).",
        "We assume that each ofthese distributions is drawn from a symmetric Dirichlet.",
        "A small concentration parameter is used, since each entity should have a dominating value for each of these properties.",
        "Now, to estimate , , and , we need to know the gender, number, and semantic type ofeach mention.",
        "For some mentions (e.g., \"he\"), these properties are easy to compute; for others (e.g., \"it\"), they are not.",
        "Whenever a mention has unobserved properties, we need to fill in the missing values.",
        "We could resort to sampling, but sampling these properties is fairly inefficient.",
        "So, following H&K, we keep soft counts for each of these properties and use them rather than perform hard sampling.",
        "When an entity z generates a pronoun h using the pronoun head model, it first generates a gender g, a number n, and a semantic type t independently from the distributions 0g, 0n, and 0*, ; and then generates h using the distribution P(H = h|G = g,N = n, T = t,9).",
        "Note that this last distribution is a global distribution that is independent of the chosen entity index.",
        "6 is a parameter drawn from a symmetric Dirichlet (with concentration XP) that encodes our prior knowledge of the relationship between a semantic type and a pronoun.",
        "For instance, given the type PER SON, there is a higher probability of generating \"he\" than \"it\".",
        "As a result, we maintain a list of compatible semantic types for each pronoun, and give a pronoun a count of (1 + XP) if it is compatible with the drawn semantic type; otherwise, we give it a count of XP.",
        "In essence, we use this prior to prefer the generation of pronouns that are compatible with the chosen semantic type.",
        "Pronouns typically refer to salient entities, so the basic model could be improved by incorporating salience.",
        "We start by assuming that each entity has an activity score that is initially set to zero.",
        "Given a set of mentions and an assignment of entity indices to mentions, Z, we process the mentions in a left-to-right manner.",
        "When a mention, m, is encountered, we multiply the activity score of each entity by 0.5 and add one to the activity score of the entity to which m belongs.",
        "This captures the intuitive notion that frequency and recency both play a role in determining salience.",
        "Next, we rank the entities based on their activity scores and discretize the ranks into five \"salience\" buckets S: top (1), high (2-3), mid (46), low (7+), and none.",
        "Finally, this salience information is used to modify the entity distribution: where Si;j is the salience value of the jth mention in document i, and Mi;j is its mention type, which can take on one of three values: pronoun, name, and nominal.",
        "P(Mi;j\\Si;j, Z), the distribution of mention type given salience, was computed from H&K's development corpus (see Table 2).",
        "According to the table, pronouns are preferred for salient entities, whereas names and nominals are preferred for entities that are less active.",
        "Table 2: Posterior distribution of mention type given salience (taken from Haghighi and Klein (2007))",
        "Next, we discuss the potential weaknesses of H&K's model and propose three modifications to it.",
        "Relaxed head generation.",
        "The basic model focuses on head matching, and is therefore likely to (incorrectly) posit the large airport and the small airport as coreferent, for instance.",
        "In fact, head matching is a relatively inaccurate indicator ofcoref-erence, in comparison to the \"strong coreference indicators\" shown in the first three rows of Table 1.",
        "To improve H&K's model, we replace head matching with these three strong indicators as follows.",
        "Given a document, we assign each of its mentions a head index, such that two mentions have the same head index if and only if at least one of the three strong indicators returns a value of True.",
        "Now, instead of generating a head, the head model generates a head index, thus increasing the likelihood that aliases are assigned the same entity index, for instance.",
        "Note that this modification is applied only to the basic model.",
        "In particular, pronoun generation continues to be handled by the pronoun head model and will not be affected.",
        "We hypothesize that this modification would improve precision, as the strong indicators are presumably more precise than head match.",
        "Agreement constraints.",
        "While the pronoun head model naturally prefers that a pronoun be generated by an entity whose gender and number are compatible with those of the pronoun, the entity (index) that is re-sampled for a pronoun according to the sampling equation for P(Zi;j \\Z_i>j, H) may still not be compatible with the pronoun with respect to gender and number.",
        "The reason is that an entity index is assigned based not only on the head distribution but also on the entity distribution.",
        "Since entities with many mentions are preferable to those with few mentions, it is possible for the model to favor the assignment of a grammatically incompatible entity (index) to a pronoun if the entity is sufficiently large.",
        "To eliminate this possibility, we enforce the agreement constraints at the global level.",
        "Specifically, we sample an entity index for a given mention with a non-zero probability if and only if the corresponding entity and the head of the mention agree in gender and number.",
        "We hypothesize that this modification would improve precision.",
        "Pronoun-only salience.",
        "In Section 3.2.3, we motivate the need for salience using pronouns only, since proper names can to a large extent be resolved using string-matching facilities and are not particularly sensitive to salience.",
        "Nominals (especially definite descriptions), though more sensitive to salience than names, can also be resolved by simple string-matching heuristics in many cases (Vieira and Poe-sio, 2000; Strube et al., 2002).",
        "Hence, we hypothesize that the use of salience for names and nominals would adversely affect their resolution performance, as incorporating salience could diminish the role of string match in the resolution process, according to the sampling equations.",
        "Consequently, we modify H&K's model by limiting the application ofsalience to the resolution of pronouns only.",

        "To evaluate our EM-based model and H&K's model, we use the ACE 2003 coreference corpus, which is composed of three sections: Broadcast News (BNEWS), Newswire (NWIRE), and Newspaper (NPAPER).",
        "Each section is in turn composed of a training set and a test set.",
        "Due to space limitations, we will present evaluation results only for the test sets of BNEWS and NWIRE, but verified that the same performance trends can be observed on NPA-PER as well.",
        "Unlike H&K, who report results using only true mentions (extracted from the answer keys), we show results for true mentions as well as system mentions that were extracted by an in-house noun phrase chunker.",
        "The relevant statistics of the",
        "BNEWS and NWIRE test sets are shown in Table 3.",
        "Scoring programs.",
        "To score the output of the coreference models, we employ the commonly-used MUC scoring program (Vilain et al., 1995) and the recently-developed CEAF scoring program (Luo, 2005).",
        "In the MUC scorer, recall is computed as the percentage of coreference links in the reference partition that appear in the system partition; precision is computed in the same fashion as recall, except that the roles of the reference partition and the system partition are reversed.",
        "As a link-based scoring program, the MUC scorer (1) does not reward successful identification of singleton entities and (2) tends to under-penalize partitions that have too few entities.",
        "The entity-based CEAF scorer was proposed in response to these two weaknesses.",
        "Specifically, it operates by computing the optimal alignment between the set of reference entities and the set of system entities.",
        "CEAF precision and recall are both positively correlated with the score of this optimal alignment, which is computed by summing over each aligned entity pair the number of mentions that appear in both entities of that pair.",
        "As a consequence, a system that proposes too many entities or too few entities will have low precision and recall.",
        "Parameter initialization.",
        "We use a small amount of labeled data for parameter initialization for the two models.",
        "Specifically, for evaluations on the BNEWS test data, we use as labeled data one randomly-chosen document from the BNEWS training set, which has 58 true mentions and 102 system mentions.",
        "Similarly for NWIRE, where the chosen document has 42 true mentions and 72 system mentions.",
        "For our model, we use the labeled document to initialize the parameters.",
        "Also, we set N (the number of most probable partitions) to 50 and ö (the start penalty used in the Bell tree) to 0.8, the latter being recommended by Luo et al.",
        "(2004).",
        "For H&K's model, we use the labeled data to tune the concentration parameter a.",
        "While H&K set a to 0.4 without much explanation, a moment's thought reveals that the choice of a should reflect the fraction of mentions that appear in a singleton cluster.",
        "We therefore estimate this value from the labeled document, yielding 0.4 for true mentions (which is consistent with H&K's choice) and 0.7 for system mentions.",
        "The remaining parameters, the X's, are all set to e-4, following H&K. In addition, as is commonly done in Bayesian approaches, we do not sample entities directly from the conditional distribution P(Z|X); rather, we sample from this distribution raised to the power exp -j^, where c=1.5, i is the current iteration number that starts at 0, and k (the number of sampling iterations) is set to 20.",
        "Finally, due to sampling and the fact that the initial assignment of entity indices to mentions is random, all the reported results for H&K's model are averaged over five runs.",
        "BNEWS",
        "NWIRE",
        "Number of documents Number of true mentions Number of system mentions",
        "51 2608 5424",
        "29 2630 5197",
        "The Heuristic baseline.",
        "As our first baseline, we employ a simple rule-based system that posits two mentions as coreferent if and only if at least one of the three strong coreference indicators listed in Table 1 returns True.",
        "Results of this baseline, reported in terms of recall (R), precision (P), and F-score (F) using the MUC scorer and the CEAF scorer, are shown in row 1 of Tables 4 and 5, respectively.",
        "Each row in these tables shows performance using true mentions and system mentions for the BNEWS and NWIRE data sets.",
        "As we can see, (1) recall is generally low, since this simple heuristic can only identify a small fraction of the coreference relations; (2) CEAF recall is consistently higher than MUC recall, since CEAF also rewards successful identification of non-coreference relations; and (3) precision for true mentions is higher than that for system mentions, since the number of non-coreferent pairs that satisfy the heuristic is larger for system mentions.",
        "The Degenerate EM baseline.",
        "Our second baseline is obtained by running only one iteration of our EM-based coreference model.",
        "Specifically, it starts with the M-step by initializing the model parameters using the labeled document, and ends with the E-step by applying the resulting model (in combination with the Bell tree search algorithm) to obtain the most probable coreference partition for each test document.",
        "Since there is no parameter reestimation, this baseline is effectively a purely supervised system trained on one (labeled) document.",
        "Results are shown in row 2 of Tables 4 and 5.",
        "As we can see, recall is consistently much higher than precision, suggesting that the model has produced fewer entities than it should.",
        "Perhaps more interestingly, in comparison to the Heuristic baseline, Degenerate EM performs consistently worse according to CEAF but generally better according to MUC.",
        "This discrepancy stems from the aforementioned properties that MUC under-penalizes partitions with too few entities, whereas CEAF lowers both recall and precision when given such partitions.",
        "Our EM-based coreference model.",
        "Our model operates in the same way as the Degenerate EM baseline, except that EM is run until convergence, with the test set being used as unlabeled data for parameter re-estimation.",
        "Any performance difference between our model and Degenerate EM can thus be attributed to EM's exploitation ofthe unlabeled data.",
        "Results of our model are shown in row 3 of Tables 4 and 5.",
        "In comparison to Degenerate EM, MUC F-score increases by 4-5% for BNEWS and 4-21% for NWIRE; CEAF F-score increases even more dramatically, by 10-17% for BNEWS and 16-27% for NWIRE.",
        "Improvements stem primarily from large gains in precision and comparatively smaller loss in recall.",
        "Such improvements suggest that our model has effectively exploited the unlabeled data.",
        "In comparison to the Heuristic baseline, we generally see increases in both recall and precision when system mentions are used, and as a result, F-score improves substantially by 7-15%.",
        "When true mentions are used, we still see gains in recall, but these gains are accompanied by loss in precision.",
        "F-score generally increases (by 2-22%), except for the case with NWIRE where we see a 0.5% drop in CEAF F-score as a result of a larger decrease in precision.",
        "The Original H&K model.",
        "We use as our third baseline the Original H&K model (see Section 3.2).",
        "Results of this model are shown in row 4 of Tables 4 and 5.",
        "Overall, it underperforms our model by 616% in MUC F-score and 6-14% in CEAF F-score, due primarily to considerable drop in both recall and precision in almost all cases.",
        "The Modified H&K model.",
        "Next, we incorporate our three modifications into the Original H&K baseline one after the other.",
        "Results are shown in rows 5-7 of Tables 4 and 5.",
        "Several points deserve mentioning.",
        "First, the addition of each modification improves the F-score for both true and system mentions",
        "Table 4: Results obtained using the MUC scoring program for the Broadcast News and Newswire data sets",
        "Table 5: Results obtained using the CEAF scoring program for the Broadcast News and Newswire data sets in both data sets using both scorers.",
        "These results provide suggestive evidence that our modifications are highly beneficial.",
        "The three modifications, when applied in combination, improve Original H&K substantially by 5-8% in MUC F-score and 7-12% in",
        "CEAF F-score, yielding results that compare favorably to those of our model in almost all cases.",
        "Second, the use of agreement constraints yields larger improvements with CEAF than with MUC.",
        "This discrepancy can be attributed to the fact that CEAF rewards the correct identification of non-coreference relations, whereas MUC does not.",
        "Since agreement constraints are intended primarily for disallowing coreference, they contribute to the successful identification of non-coreference relations and as a result yield gains in CEAF recall and precision.",
        "Third, the results are largely consistent with our hypothesis that these modifications enhance precision.",
        "Together, they improve the precision of the Original H&K baseline by 8-16% (MUC) and 1116% (CEAF), yielding a coreference model that compares favorably with our EM-based approach.",
        "Comparison with a supervised model.",
        "Finally, we compare our EM-based model with a fully supervised coreference resolver.",
        "Inspired by state-of-the-art resolvers, we create our supervised classification model by training a discriminative learner (the C4.5 decision tree induction system (Quinlan, 1993)) with a diverse set offeatures (the 34 features described in Ng (2007)) on a large training set (the entire ACE 2003 coreference training corpus), and cluster using the Bell tree search algorithm.",
        "The fully supervised results shown in row 8 of Tables 4 and 5 suggest that our EM-based model has room for improvements, especially when system mentions are used."

        "We have presented a generative model for unsupervised coreference resolution that views coreference as an EM clustering process.",

        "Despite these improvements, its performance is still not comparable to that of a fully supervised coreference resolver.",
        "A natural way to extend these unsupervised coref-erence models is to incorporate additional linguistic knowledge sources, such as those employed by our fully supervised resolver.",
