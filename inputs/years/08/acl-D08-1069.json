        "This paper investigates two strategies for improving coreference resolution: (1) training separate models that specialize in particular types of mentions (e.g., pronouns versus proper nouns) and (2) using a ranking loss function rather than a classification function.",
        "In addition to being conceptually simple, these modifications of the standard single-model, classification-based approach also deliver significant performance improvements.",
        "Specifically, we show that on the ACE corpus both strategies produce f score gains of more than 3% across the three coreference evaluation metrics (MUC, B, and CEAF)."

      "text": [
        "Coreference resolution is the task of partitioning a set of entity mentions in a text, where each partition corresponds to some entity in an underlying discourse model.",
        "While early machine learning approaches for the task relied on local, discriminative classifiers (Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002b; Morton, 2000; Kehler et al., 2004), more recent approaches use joint and/or global models (McCallum and Wellner, 2004; Ng, 2004; Daumé III and Marcu, 2005; Denis and Baldridge, 2007a).",
        "This shift improves performance, but the systems are considerably more complex and often less efficient.",
        "Here, we explore two simple modifications of the first type of approach that yield performance gains which are comparable, and sometimes better, to those obtained with these more complex systems.",
        "These modifications involve: (i) the use of rankers instead of classifiers, and (ii) the use of linguistically motivated, specialized models for different types of mentions.",
        "Ranking models provide a theoretically more adequate and empirically better alternative approach to pronoun resolution than standard classification-based approaches (Denis and Baldridge, 2007b).",
        "In essence, ranking models directly capture during training the competition among potential antecedent candidates, instead of considering them independently.",
        "This gives the ranker additional discriminative power and in turn better antecedent selection accuracy.",
        "Here, we show that ranking is also effective for the wider task of coreference resolution.",
        "Coreference resolution involves several different types of anaphoric expressions: third-person pronouns, speech pronouns (i.e., first and second person pronouns), proper names, definite descriptions and other types of nominals (e.g., anaphoric uses of indefinite, quantified, and bare noun phrases).",
        "Different anaphoric expressions exhibit different patterns of resolution and are sensitive to different factors (Ariel, 1988; van der Sandt, 1992; Gundel et al., 1993), yet most machine learning approaches have ignored these differences and handle these different phenomena with a single, monolithic model.",
        "A few exceptions are worth noting.",
        "Morton (2000) and Ng (2005b) propose different classifiers models for different NPs for coreference resolution and pronoun resolution, respectively.",
        "Other partially capture the differential preferences between different anaphors via different sample selection strategies during training (Ng and Cardie, 2002b; Uryupina, 2004).",
        "More recently, Haghighi and Klein (2007) use the distinction between pronouns, nominals and proper nouns",
        "Proceedings of the 2008 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 660-669, Honolulu, October 2008.",
        "©2008 Association for Computational Linguistics",
        "in their unsupervised, generative model for corefer-ence resolution; for their model, this is absolutely critical for achieving better accuracy.",
        "Here, we show that using specialized models for different types of referential expressions improves performance for supervised models (both classifiers and rankers).",
        "Both these strategies lead to improvements for all three standard coreference metrics: muc (Vilain et al., 1995), B (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998), and CEAF (Luo, 2005).",
        "In particular, our specialized ranker system provides absolute f score improvements against an otherwise identical standard classifier system by 3.2%, 3.1%, and 3.6% for MUC, B, and CEAF, respectively."

        "Numerous approaches to anaphora and coreference resolution reduce these tasks to a binary classification task, whereby pairs of mentions are classified as coreferential or not (McCarthy and Lehnert, 1995; Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002b).",
        "Usually used in combination with a greedy right-to-left clustering, these approaches make very strong independence assumptions.",
        "Not only do they model each coreference decision separately, they actually model each pair of mentions as a separate event.",
        "Recasting these tasks as ranking tasks partly addresses this problem by directly making the comparison between different candidate antecedents for an anaphor part of the training criterion.",
        "Each candidate is assigned a conditional probability with respect to the entire candidate set.",
        "(Re)rankers have been successfully applied to numerous NLP tasks, such as parse selection (Osborne and Baldridge, 2004; Toutanova et al., 2004), parse reranking (Collins and Duffy, 2002; Charniak and Johnson, 2005), question-answering (Ravichandran et al., 2003).",
        "The twin-candidate classification approach proposed by (Yang et al., 2003) shares some similarities with the ranker in making the comparison between candidate antecedents part of training.",
        "An important difference however is that under the twin-candidate approach, candidates are compared in pairwise fashion (and the best overall candidate is the one that has won the most round robin contests), while the ranker considers the entire candidate set at once.",
        "Another advantage of the ranking approach is that its complexity is only square in the number of mentions, while that of the twin-candidate model is cubic (see Denis and Baldridge (2007b) for a more detailed comparison in the context of pronoun resolution).",
        "Our ranking models for coreference take the following log-linear form:",
        "Eexp E IV j fj (TT,ak)",
        "where n stands for the anaphoric expression, ai for an antecedent candidate, fj the weighted features of the model.",
        "The denominator consists of a normalization factor over the k candidate mentions.",
        "Model parameters were estimated with the limited memory variable metric algorithm and Gaussian smoothing (o-=1000), using TAD M (Malouf, 2002).",
        "For the training of the different ranking models, we use the following procedure.",
        "For each model, instances are created by pairing each anaphor of the proper type (e.g., definite description) with a set of candidates which contains: (i) a true antecedent, and (ii) a set of non-antecedents.",
        "The selection of the true antecedent varies depending on the model we are training: for pronominal forms, the antecedent is selected as the closest preceding mention in the chain; for non-pronominal forms, we used the closest preceding non-pronominal mention in the chain as the antecedent.",
        "For the creation of the non-antecedent set, we collect all the non-antecedents that appear in a window of two sentences around the antecedent.",
        "At test time, we consider all preceding mentions as potential antecedents.",
        "Not all referential expressions in a given document are anaphors: some expressions introduce a discourse entity, rather than accessing an existing one.",
        "Thus, coreference resolvers must have a way of identifying such \"discourse-new\" expressions.",
        "This is easily handled in the standard classification approach: a mention will not be resolved if none of its candidates is classified positively (i.e., as coreferen-tial).",
        "The problem is more troublesome for rankers, which always pick an antecedent from the candidate set.",
        "A natural solution is to use a model that specifically predicts the discourse status (discourse-new vs. discourse-old) of each expression: only expressions that are classified as \"discourse-old\" by this model are considered by rankers.",
        "Ng and Cardie (Ng and Cardie, 2002a) introduced the use of an \"anaphoricity\" classifier to act as a filter for coreference resolution in order to correct errors where antecedents are mistakenly identified for non-anaphoric mentions or antecedents are not determined for mentions which are indeed anaphoric.",
        "Their approach produced significant improvements in precision, but with consequent larger losses in recall.",
        "Ng (2004) improves recall by optimizing the anaphoricity threshold.",
        "By using joint inference for anaphoricity and coreference, Denis and Baldridge (2007a) avoid cascade-induced errors without the need to separately optimize the threshold.",
        "We use a similar discourse status classifier to Ng and Cardie's as a filter on mentions for our rankers.",
        "We rely on three main types of information sources: (i) the form of mention (e.g., type of linguistic expression, number of tokens), (ii) positional features in the text, (iii) comparisons of the given mention to the mentions that precede it in the text.",
        "Evaluated on the ACE datasets, training the model on the train texts, and applying the classifier to the devtest texts, the model achieves an overall accuracy score of 80.8%, compared to a baseline of 59.7% when predicting the majority class (\"discourse-old\")."

      "heading": "3. Specialized models",
      "text": [
        "Our second strategy is to use different, specialized models for different referential expressions, similarly to Elwell and Baldridge's (2008) use ofconnec-tive specific models for identifying the arguments of discourse connectives.",
        "For this, one must determine along which dimension to split such expressions.",
        "For example, Ng (2005b) learns models for each set of anaphors that are lexically identical (e.g., I, he, they, etc.).",
        "This option is possible for closed sets like pronouns, but not for other types of anaphors like proper names and definite descriptions.",
        "Another option is to rely on the particular linguistic form of the different expressions, as signaled by the head word category and the determiner (if any).",
        "More concretely, we use separate models for the following types: (i) third person pronouns, (ii) speech pronouns, (iii) proper names, (iv) definite descriptions, and (v) others (i.e., all expressions that don't fall into the previous categories).",
        "The correlation between the form of a referential expression and its anaphoric behavior is actually central to various linguistic accounts (Prince, 1981; Ariel, 1988; Gundel et al., 1993).",
        "Basically, the idea is that linguistic form is an indicator of the status of the corresponding referent in the discourse model.",
        "That is, the use by the speaker of a particular linguistic form corresponds to a particular level of activation (or familiarity or salience or accessibility) in (what she thinks is) the addressee's discourse model.",
        "For many authors, the relation takes the form of a continuum and is often represented in the form of a referential hierarchy, such as:",
        "Accessibility Hierarchy (Ariel, 1988) Zero pronouns >> Pronouns >> Demonstrative pronouns >> Demonstrative NPs >> Short PNs >> Definite descriptions >> Full PNs >> Full PNs + appositive",
        "The higher up, the more accessible (or salient) the entity is.",
        "At the extremes are pronouns (these forms typically require a previous mention in the local context) and proper names (these forms are often used without previous mentions of the entity).",
        "This type of hierarchy is validated by corpus studies of the distribution of different types of expressions.",
        "For instance, pronouns find their antecedents very locally (in a window of 1-2 sentences), while proper names predominantly find theirs at longer distances (Ariel, 1988).",
        "Using discourse structure, Asher et al.",
        "(2006) show that while anaphoric pronouns systematically obey the right-frontier constraint (i.e., their antecedents have to appear on the right edge of the discourse graph), this is less so for definites, and even less so for proper names.",
        "From a machine learning perspective, these findings suggest that features encoding some aspect of salience (e.g., distance, syntactic context) are likely to receive different sets of parameters depending on the form of the anaphor.",
        "This therefore suggests that better parameters are likely to be learned in the context of different models.",
        "While the above studies focus primarily on salience, there are of course other dimensions according to which anaphors differ in their resolution preferences.",
        "Thus, the resolution of lexical expressions like definite descriptions and proper names is likely to benefit from the inclusion of features that compare the strings of the anaphor and the candidate antecedent (e.g., string matching) and features that identify particular syntactic configurations like appositive structures.",
        "This type of information is however much less likely to help in the resolution of pronominal forms.",
        "The problem is that, within a single model, such features are likely to receive strong parameters (due to the fact that they are good predictors for lexical anaphors) in a way that might eventually hurt pronominal resolutions.",
        "Note that our split of referential types only partially cover the referential hierarchies of Ariel (1988) or Gundel et al.",
        "(1993).",
        "Thus, there is no separate model for demonstrative noun phrases and pronouns: these are very rare in the corpus we used (i.e., the ace corpus).",
        "These expressions were therefore handled through the \"others\" model.",
        "There is however a model for first and second person pronouns (i.e., speech pronouns): this is justified by the fact that these pronouns behave differently from their third person counterparts.",
        "These forms indeed often behave like deictics (i.e., they refer to discourse participants) or they appear within a quote.",
        "The total number of anaphors (i.e., of mentions that are not chain heads) in the data is 19, 322 and 4, 599 for training and testing, respectively.",
        "The distribution of each anaphoric type is presented in Table 1.",
        "Roughly, third person pronouns account for 22-24% of all anaphors in the entire corpus, speech pronouns for 11-13%, proper names for 33-40%, and definite descriptions for 16-17%.",
        "The distribution is slightly different from one dataset to another, probably reflecting genre differences.",
        "For instance, B NEWS shows a larger proportion of pronouns in general (pronominal forms account for 40-44% of all the anaphoric forms).",
        "We use five broad types of features for all mention types, plus three others used by specific types, summarized in Table 3.",
        "Our feature extraction relies on limited linguistic processing: we only made use of a sentence detector, a tokenizer, a POS tagger (as provided by the OpenNLP Toolkit) and the WordNetdatabase.",

        "Common to these metrics is: (i) they operate by comparing the set of chains S produced by the system against the true chains T, and (ii) they report performance in terms of recall and precision.",
        "There are however important differences in how each metric computes these scores, each producing a different bias.",
        "MUC scores are based on the number of links (pairs of mentions) common to S and T. Recall is the number of common links divided by the total number of links in T; precision is the number of common links divided by the total number of links in S. This focus gives MUC two main biases.",

        "The recall score for a mention i is , while the precision score for i is 1.",

        "The Constrained Entity Aligned F-Measure (CEAF) (Luo, 2005).",
        "aligns each system chain S with at most one true chain T. It finds the best one-to-one mapping between the set of chains S and T, which is equivalent to finding the optimal alignment in a bipartite graph.",
        "The best mapping maximizes the similarity over pairs of chains (Si ,Ti), where the similarity between two chains is the number of common mentions to the two chains.",
        "With CEAF, recall is computed as the total similarity divided by the number of mentions in all the T (i.e., the self-similarity), while precision is the total similarity divided by the number of mentions in S.",
        "Table 6 gives scores for all three metrics for the different models on the entire ACE corpus.",
        "Two main patterns emerge: significant improvements are obtained by using specialized models (class vs class+sp and class+ds vs class+ds+sp) and by using a ranker (class+ds+sp vs rank+ds+sp).",
        "Overall, the rank+ds+sp system significantly outperforms the other systems on the three different metrics.",
        "The f scores for rank+ds+sp are 71.6% with the MUC metric, 72.7% with the B, and 67.0% with the CEAF metric.",

        "An interesting point of comparison is provided by Ng (2007), who also relies on true mentions and reports MUC f-scores only slightly superior to ours (73.8%) while relying on perfect semantic class information.",
        "His best results otherwise are 64.6%.",
        "The fact that our improvements are consistent across the different evaluation metrics is remarkable, especially given that these three metrics are quite different in the way they compute their scores.",
        "The gains in f-score range from 1.2 to 5.4% on the MUC metric (i.e., error reductions of 4 to 15.9%), from 1.4 to 3.5% on the B metric (i.e., error reductions of 4.8 to 11.4%), and from 1.7 to 4.7% on the CEAF metric (i.e., error reductions of 6.9 to 17%).",
        "The larger improvements come from recall, with improvements ranging from 1.9 to 7.1% with MUC, from 2.4 to 5.6% with B.",

        "The overall improvements found with rank+ds+sp suggest that it is able to capitalize on the better antecedent selection capabilities offered by the ranking approach.",
        "This is supported by the error analysis on the development data.",
        "Errors made by a coreference system can be conceptualized as falling into three main classes: (i) \"missed anaphors\" (i.e., an anaphoric mention that fails to be linked to a previous mention), (ii) \"spurious anaphors\" (i.e., an non-anaphoric mention that is linked to a previous mention), and (iii) \"invalid resolutions\" (i.e., a true anaphor that is linked to a incorrect antecedent).",
        "The two first types of error pertain to the determination of the discourse status of the mention, while the third regards the selection of an antecedent (i.e., anaphora resolution).",
        "Considering the systems' invalid resolutions, we found that the rank+ds+sp had a much lower error rate: only 17.9% of all true anaphors were incorrectly resolved by this system, against 23.1% for class, 24.9% for class+ds, 20.4% for class+sp, and 22.1% for class+ds+sp.",

        "MUC, B, and CEAF, respectively.",
        "Despite the fact that this MUC score beats rank+ds+sp's, it is actually worse than even the basic model class for B and CEAF.",
        "This difference fact that MUC gives more recall credit for large chains without a consequent precision reduction, and shows the importance of using B and CEAF scores in addition to MUC.",
