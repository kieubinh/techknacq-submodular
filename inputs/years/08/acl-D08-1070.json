        "The method needs very few samples for tasks such as textual entailment, where the final outcome is binary, in agreement with a theoretical result on the rate of convergence of the voting Gibbs classifier due to Ng and Jordan (2001).",
        "While their sampling method is inherently approximate, our full pipeline model M2 is exact in the sense that feature expectations are computed exactly in polynomial time whenever the inference step at each stage can be done in polynomial time, irrespective of the cardinality of the final output space.",
        "Also, the pipeline models M2 and M3 and their more efficient alternatives propagate uncertainty during both training and testing through the vector of probabilistic features, whereas the sampling method takes advantage of the probabilistic nature of the outputs only during testing.",
        "Overall, the two approaches can be seen as complementary.",
        "In order to be applicable with minimal engineering effort, the sampling method needs NLP researchers to write packages that can generate samples from the posterior.",

        "We have also shown that additional independence assumptions can make the approach more practical by significantly reducing the time complexity.",
        "Existing learning based models can implement the new method by replacing the original feature vector with a more dense vector of probabilistic features.",
        "It is essential that every stage in the pipeline produces probabilistic features, and to this end we have described an effective method for associating probabilities with output substructures.",
        "We have shown for NER that simply using the probabilities associated with features that appear only in the top annotation can lead to useful improvements in performance, with minimal engineering effort.",
        "In future work we plan to empirically evaluate NER with an approximate version of the full model M2 which, while more demanding in terms of time complexity, could lead to even more significant gains in accuracy.",
