        "When two NLP systems are run on the same data, we expect certain constraints to hold between their outputs.",
        "This is a form of prior knowledge.",
        "We propose a self-training framework that uses such information to significantly boost the performance of one of the systems.",
        "The key idea is to perform self-training only on outputs that obey the constraints.",
        "Our motivating example in this paper is the task pair: named entity recognition (NER) and shallow parsing (aka syntactic chunking).",
        "Consider a hidden sentence with known POS and syntactic structure below.",
        "Further consider four potential NER sequences for this sentence.",
        "Without ever seeing the actual sentence, can we guess which NER sequence is correct?",
        "NER1 seems wrong because we feel like named entities should not be part of verb phrases.",
        "NER2 seems wrong because there is an NNP (proper noun) that is not part of a named entity (word 5).",
        "NER3 is amiss because we feel it is unlikely that a single name should span more than one NP (last two words).",
        "NER4 has none of these problems and seems quite reasonable.",
        "In fact, for the hidden sentence, NER4 is correct .",
        "The remainder of this paper deals with the problem of formulating such prior knowledge into a workable system.",
        "There are similarities between our proposed model and both self-training and co-training; background is given in Section 2.",
        "We present a formal model for our approach and perform a simple, yet informative, analysis (Section 3).",
        "This analysis allows us to define what good and bad constraints are.",
        "Throughout, we use a running example of NER using hidden Markov models to show the efficacy of the method and the relationship between the theory and the implementation.",
        "Finally, we present full-blown results on seven different NER data sets (one from CoNLL, six from ACE), comparing our method to several competitive baselines (Section 4).",
        "We see that for many of these data sets, less than one hundred labeled NER sentences are required to get state-of-the-art performance, using a discriminative sequence labeling algorithm (Daumé III and Marcu, 2005)."

        "That is, can we learn f2 (and/or f 1) using significantly fewer labeled examples than if we did not have x?",
        "Moreover, we have assumed that x is correct, but is this enough?",
        "Intuitively, no: a function x that returns 1 regardless of its inputs is clearly not useful.",
        "Given this, what other constraints must be placed on x.",
        "We address these questions in Sections 3.3.",
        "However, first we define our algorithm.",

        "In our example, this means that we have a small amount of labeled NER data and a large amount of labeled POS/chunk data.",
        "We use 3500 sentences from CoNLL (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003) as the NER data and section 20-23 of the WSJ (Marcus et al., 1993; Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) as the POS/chunk data (8936 sentences).",
        "We are only interested in learning to do NER.",
        "Details of the exact HMM setup are in Section 4.2.",

        "(Note that we assume f1 G C1, which is obviously not true for language.)",
        "Our constraint function x will require the following for agreement: (1) any NNP must be part of a named entity; (2) any named entity must be a subsequence of a noun phrase.",
        "This is precisely the set of constraints discussed in the introduction.",
        "Running Example",
        "We call the following algorithm \"One-Sided Learning with Hints,\" since it aims only to learn f2: 1: Learn h2 directly on D 2: For each example (x, y1) G Dunlab3: Compute y2 = h2(x) 4: If x(y1,y2),add (x,y2) to D 5: Relearn h2 on the (augmented) D 6: Go to (2) if desired",

        "In the two-sided version, we assume that we have a small amount of data labeled by f1 (call this D1), a small amount of data labeled by f2 (call this D2) and a large amount of unlabeled data (call this Dunlab).",

        "The baseline HMMs achieve F-scores of 50.8 and 76.3, respectively.",
        "In step 2, we add 7512 examples to each data set.",
        "After step 3, the new models achieve F-scores of 54.6 and 79.2, respectively.",
        "The gain for NER is lower than before as it is trained against \"noisy\" syntactic labels.",
        "Our goal is to prove that one-sided learning with hints \"works.\"",
        "That is, if C2 is learnable from large amounts of labeled data, then it is also learn-able from small amounts of labeled data and large amounts of f1 -labeled data.",
        "This is formalized in Theorem 1 (all proofs are in Appendix A).",
        "However, before stating the theorem, we must define an \"initial weakly-useful predictor\" (terminology from Blum and Mitchell(1998)), and the notion of noisy PAC-learning in the structured domain.",
        "Definition 2.",
        "We say that h is a weakly-useful predictor of f if for all y: PrD [h(x) = y] > e and Prp [f (x) = y | h(x) = y' = y] > Prp [f (x) = y] + e.",
        "This definition simply ensures that (1) h is nontrivial: it assigns some non-zero probability to every possible output; and (2) h is somewhat indicative of f. In practice, we use the hypothesis learned on the small amount of training data during step (1) of the algorithm as the weakly useful predictor.",
        "Definition 3.",
        "We say that C is PAC-learnable with noise (in the structured setting) if there exists an algorithm with the following properties.",
        "For any c G C, any distribution D over X, any 0 < n < 1/ |Y|, any 0 < e < 1, any 0 < ö < 1 and any n < no < 1/ |Y|, if the algorithm is given access to examples drawn EXVSN(c, D) and inputs e, ö and n0, then with probability at least 1 – ö, the algorithm returns a hypothesis h G C with error at most e. Here, EXSN(c, D) is a structured noise oracle, which draws examples from D, labels them by c and randomly replaces with another label with prob.",
        "n.",
        "Note here the rather weak notion of noise: entire structures are randomly changed, rather than individual labels.",
        "Furthermore, the error is 0/1 loss over the entire structure.",
        "Collins (2001) establishes learnability results for the class of hyperplane models under 0/1 loss.",
        "While not stated directly in terms of PAC learnability, it is clear that his results apply.",
        "Taskar et al.",
        "(2005) establish tighter bounds for the case of Hamming loss.",
        "This suggests that the requirement of 0/1 loss is weaker.",
        "As suggested before, it is not sufficient for x to simply be correct (the constant 1 function is correct, but not useful).",
        "We need it to be discriminating, made precise in the following definition.",
        "Definition 4.",
        "We say the discrimination of x for his Prp[x(f1(x),h(x))]-1.",
        "In other words, a constraint function is discriminating when it is unlikely that our weakly-useful predictor h chooses an output that satisfies the constraint.",
        "This means that if we do find examples (in our unlabeled corpus) that satisfy the constraints, they are likely to be \"useful\" to learning.",
        "Running Example",
        "In the NER HMM, let h be the HMM obtained by training on the small labeled NER data set and f 1is the true syntactic labels.",
        "We approximate PrDby an empirical estimate over the unlabeled distribution.",
        "This gives a discrimination is 41.6 for the constraint function defined previously.",
        "However, if we compare against \"weaker\" constraint functions, we see the appropriate trend.",
        "The value for the constraint based only on POS tags is 39.1 (worse) and for the NP constraint alone is 27.0 (much worse).",
        "Theorem 1.",
        "Suppose C2 is PAC-learnable with noise in the structured setting, h2 is a weakly useful predictor off2, and x is correct with respect to D, f1, f2, h°, and has discrimination > 2(|Y| – 1).",
        "Then C2 is also PAC-learnable with one-sided hints.",
        "The way to interpret this theorem is that it tells us that if the initial h2 we learn in step 1 of the onesided algorithm is \"good enough\" (in the sense that it is weakly-useful), then we can use it as specified by the remainder of the one-sided algorithm to obtain an arbitrarily good h2 (via iterating).",
        "The dependence on |Y| is the discrimination bound for x is unpleasant for structured problems.",
        "If we wish to find M unlabeled examples that satisfy the hints, we'll need a total of at least 2M(|Y| – 1) total.",
        "This dependence can be improved as follows.",
        "Suppose that our structure is represented by a graph over vertices V, each of which can take a label from a set Y.",
        "Then, |Y| = \\Yv \\, and our result requires that x be discriminating on an order exponential in V. Under the assumption that x decomposes over the graph structure (true for our example) and that C2 is PAC-learnable with per-vertex noise, then the discrimination requirement drops to 2 | V| (|Y| – 1).",
        "In NER, |Y| = 9 and |V| « 26.",
        "This means that the values from the previous example look not quite so bad.",
        "In the 0/1 loss case, they are compared to 10; in the Hamming case, they are compared to only 416.",
        "The ability of the one-sided algorithm follows the same trends as the discrimination values.",
        "Recall the baseline performance is 50.",
        "8.",
        "With both constraints (and a discrimination value of 41.6), we obtain a score of 58.9.",
        "With just the POS constraint (discrimination of 39.1), we obtain a score of 58.1.",
        "With just the NP constraint (discrimination of 27.0, we obtain a score of 54.5.",
        "The final question is how one-sided learning relates to two-sided learning.",
        "The following definition and easy corollary shows that they are related in the obvious manner, but depends on a notion of uncor-relation between h1 and h2.",
        "Definition 5.",
        "We say that h1 and h2 are uncorrelated if PrD [h1(x) = y1 | h2(x) = y2,x] = Prp [h1(x) = y1 | x].",
        "Corollary 1.",
        "Suppose C1 and C2 are both PAC-learnable in the structured setting, h1 and h2 are weakly useful predictors of f1 and f2, and x is correct with respect to D, f1 , f2, h1 and h2, and has discrimination > 4(|Y| – 1) (for 0/1 loss) or > 4 | V| (| Y| – 1) (for Hamming loss), and that h° and h2 are uncorrelated.",
        "Then C1 and C2 are also PAC-learnable with two-sided hints.",

        "These 1m sentences were selected by dev-set relativization against the union of the two development data sets.",
        "Following similar ideas to those presented by Blum and Mitchell (1998), we employ two slight modifications to the algorithm presented in Section 3.2.",
        "First, in step (2b) instead of adding all allowable instances to the labeled data set, we only add the top R (for some hyper-parameter R), where \"top\" is determined by average model confidence for the two tasks.",
        "Second, Instead of using the full un-labeled set to label at each iteration, we begin with a random subset of 10R unlabeled examples and another add random 10R every iteration.",
        "We use the same baseline systems as in one-sided learning: a Baseline that learns the two tasks independently; a variant of the Baseline on which the output of the POS/chunker is used as a feature for the NER; a variant based on self-training; the hints-based method.",

        "This is not surprising: the form of the constraint function we use tells us a lot about the NER task, but relatively little about the syntactic chunking task.",
        "In particular, it tells us nothing about phrases other than NPs.",
        "On the other hand, for NER, we see that both self-training and learning with hints improve over the baseline.",

        "We have presented a method for simultaneously learning two tasks using prior knowledge about the relationship between their outputs.",
        "This is related to joint inference (Daumé III et al., 2006).",
        "However, we do not require that that a single data set be labeled for multiple tasks.",
        "In all our examples, we use separate data sets for shallow parsing as for named-entity recognition.",
        "Although all our experiments used the LaSO framework for sequence labeling, there is noting in our method that assumes any particular learner; alternatives include: conditional random fields (Lafferty et al., 2001), independent predictors (Punyakanok and Roth, 2001), max-margin Markov networks (Taskar et al., 2005), etc.",
        "Our approach, both algorithmically and theoretically, is most related to ideas in co-training (Blum and Mitchell, 1998).",
        "The key difference is that in co-training, one assumes that the two \"views\" are on the inputs; here, we can think of the two output spaces as being the difference \"views\" and the compatibility function x being a method for reconciling these two views.",
        "Like the pioneering work of Blum and Mitchell, the algorithm we employ in practice makes use of incrementally augmenting the unlabeled data and using model confidence.",
        "Also like that work, we do not currently have a theoretical framework for this (more complex) model.",
        "It would also be interesting to explore soft hints, where the range of x is [0,1] rather than {0,1}.",
        "Recently, Ganchev et al.",
        "(2008) proposed a co-regularization framework for learning across multiple related tasks with different output spaces.",
        "Their approach hinges on a constrained EM framework and addresses a quite similar problem to that addressed by this paper.",
        "Chang et al.",
        "(2008) also propose a \"semisupervised\" learning approach quite similar to our own model.",
        "The show very promising results in the context of semantic role labeling.",
        "Given the apparent (very!)",
        "recent interest in this problem, it would be ideal to directly compare the different approaches.",
        "In addition to an analysis of the theoretical properties of the algorithm presented, the most compelling avenue for future work is to apply this framework to other task pairs.",
        "With a little thought, one can imagine formulating compatibility functions between tasks like discourse parsing and summarization (Marcu, 2000), parsing and word alignment, or summarization and information extraction."
