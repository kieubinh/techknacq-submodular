        "We show how these constraints can be used to create a more densely-connected network of events, and how global consistency can be enforced by incorporating these constraints into an integer linear programming framework.",

        "However, most work on event-event ordering has focused on improving classifiers for pairwise decisions, ignoring obvious contradictions in the global space of events when misclassifications occur.",
        "A global framework to repair these event ordering mistakes has not yet been explored.",
        "This paper addresses three main factors involved in a global framework: the global optimization algorithm, the constraints that are relevant to the task, and the level of connectedness across pairwise decisions.",
        "We employ Integer Linear Programming to address the first factor, drawing from related work in paragraph ordering (Bramsen et al., 2006).",
        "After finding minimal gain with the initial model, we explore reasons for and solutions to the remaining two factors through temporal reasoning and transitivity rule expansion.",
        "We analyze the connectivity of the Timebank Corpus and show how textual events can be indirectly connected through a time normalization algorithm that automatically creates new relations between time expressions.",
        "We show how this increased connectivity is essential for a global model to improve performance.",
        "We present three progressive evaluations of our global model on the Timebank Corpus, showing a 3.6% gain in accuracy over its original set of relations, and an 81% increase in training data size from previous work.",
        "In addition, we present the first results on Timebank that include an unknown relation, establishing a benchmark for performance on the full task of document ordering."

        "We then expanded this dataset using transitive closure.",
        "Unlike the previous evaluation, we also use this entire dataset for testing, not just for training.",
        "Thus, all event-event relations in Bethard as well as Timebank are used to expand the dataset with transitive closure and are used in training and testing.",
        "We wanted to fully evaluate document performance on every possible event-event relation that logically follows from the data.",
        "As before, we converted IBefore and IAfter into before and after respectively, while all other relations are reduced to unknown.",
        "This relation set coincides with TempEval-07 s core three relations (although they use vague instead of unknown).",
        "Rather than include all unlabeled pairs in our unknown set, we only include the unlabeled pairs that span at most one sentence boundary.",
        "In otherwords, events in adjacent sentences are included in the unknown set if they were not tagged by the Timebank annotators.",
        "The intuition is that annotators are more likely to label nearby events, and so events in adjacent sentences are more likely to be actual unknown relations if they are unlabeled.",
        "It is more likely that distant events in the text were overlooked by convenience, not because they truly constituted an unknown relationship.",
        "Thesetofpossiblesentence-adjacentunknownre-lations is very large (approximately 50000 unknown compared to 7000 before), and so we randomly select a percentage of these relations for each evaluClassification Accuracy",

        "There are three columns with accuracy results of increasing complexity.",
        "The first, base, are results from pairwise classification decisions over Timebank and Bethard with no global model.",
        "The second, global, are results from the Integer Linear Programming global constraints, using the pairwise confidence scores from the base evaluation.",
        "Finally, the global+time column shows the ILP results when all event-time, time-time, and automatically induced time-time relations are included in the global graph.",
        "The ILP approach does not alone improve performance on the event-event tagging task, but adding the time expression relations greatly increases the global constraint results.",
        "This is consistent with the results from out first two experiments.",
        "The evaluation with 1% of the unknown tags shows an almost 2% improvement in accuracy.",
        "The gain becomes smaller as the unknown set increases in size (1.0% gain with 13% unknown).",
        "Unknown relations will tend to be chosen as more weight is given to unknowns.",

        "This set was chosen for comparison because it has a similar number of unknown labels as before labels.",
        "We see an increase in precision in both the before and after decisions by up to 2.7%, an increase in recall up to 2.9%, and an fscore by as much as 2.0%.",
        "The unknown relation shows mixed results, possibly due to its noisy behavior as discussed throughout this paper.",
        "Our results on the two-way (before/after) task show that adding additional implicit temporal constraints and then performing global reasoning results in significant improvements in temporal ordering of events (3.6% absolute over simple pairwise decisions).",
        "Both before and after also showed increases in precision and recall in the three-way evaluation.",
        "However, unknown did not parallel this improvement, nor are the increases as dramatic as in the two-way evaluation.",
        "We believe this is consistent with the noise that exists in the Timebank corpus for un-labeled relations.",
        "Evidence from Bethard's independent annotations directly point to missing relations, but the dramatic increase in the size of our closure data (81%) from adding a small amount of time-time relations suggests that the problem is widespread.",
