        "In a language like English, tense is an explicit (and maybe imperfect) grammaticalization of the temporal location of situations, and such temporal location is either directly or indirectly defined in relation to the moment of speech.",
        "Chinese does not have gram-maticalized tense in the sense that Chinese verbs are not morphologically marked for tense.",
        "This is not to say, however, that Chinese speakers do not attempt to convey the temporal location of situations when they speak or write, or that they cannot interpret the temporal location when they read Chinese text, or even that they have a different way of representing the temporal location of situations.",
        "In fact, there is evidence that the temporal location is represented in Chinese in exactly the same way as it is represented in English and most world languages: in relation to the moment of speech.",
        "One piece of evidence to support this claim is that Chinese temporal expressions like 4^ (\"today\"), ^ Ä (\"tomorrow\") and Ä (\"yesterday\") all assume a temporal deixis that is the moment of speech in relation to which all temporal locations are defined.",
        "Such temporal expressions, where they are present, give us a clear indication of the temporal location of the situations they are associated with.",
        "However, not all Chinese sentences have such temporal expressions associated with them.",
        "In fact, they occur only infrequently in Chinese text.",
        "It is thus theoretically interesting to ask, in the absence of grammatical tense and explicit temporal expressions, how do readers of a particular piece of text interpret the temporal location of situations?",
        "There are a few linguistic devices in Chinese that provide obvious clues to the temporal location of situations, and one such linguistic device is aspect markers.",
        "Although Chinese does not have grammatical tense, it does have grammaticalized aspect in the form of aspect markers.",
        "These aspect markers often give some indication of the temporal location of an event.",
        "For example, Chinese has the perfective aspect marker 7 and i, and they are often associated with the past.",
        "Progressive aspect marker on the other hand, is often associated with the present.",
        "In addition to aspect, certain adverbs also provide clues to the temporal location of the situations they are as-",

        "fe., another adverbial modifier, often indicates that the situation it modifies is in the present.",
        "However, such linguistic associations are imperfect, and they can only be viewed as tendencies rather than rules that one can use to deterministically infer the temporal location of a situation.",
        "For example, while t indeed indicates that the situation described in (1) is in the past, when it modifies a stative verb as it does in (1b), the situation is still in the present.",

        "More importantly, only a small proportion of verb instances in any given text have such explicit temporal indicators and therefore they cannot be the whole story in the temporal interpretation of Chinese text.",
        "It is thus theoretically interesting to go beyond the obvious and investigate what additional information is relevant in determining the temporal location of a situation in Chinese.",
        "Being able to infer the temporal location ofa situation has many practical applications as well.",
        "For example, this information would be highly valuable to Machine Translation.",
        "To translate a language like Chinese into a language like English in which tense is grammatically marked with inflectional morphemes, an MT system will have to infer the necessary temporal information to determine the correct tense for verbs.",
        "Statistical MT systems, the currently dominant research paradigm, typically do not address this issue directly.",
        "As a result, when evaluated for tense, current MT systems often perform miserably.",
        "For example, when a simple sentence like \"W/he Ä/tomorrow il ® /return _L ^/Shanghai\" is given to Google's state-of-the-art",
        "Machine Translation system , it produces the output \"He returned to Shanghai tomorrow\", instead of the correct \"he will return to Shanghai tomorrow\".",
        "The past tense on the verb \"returned\" contradicts the temporal expression \"tomorrow\".",
        "Determining the temporal location is also important for an Information Extraction task that extracts events so that the extracted events are put in a temporal context.",
        "Similarly, for Question Answering tasks, it is also important to know whether a situation has already happened or it is going to happen, for example.",
        "In this paper, we are interested in investigating the kind of information that is relevant in inferring the temporal location of situations in Chinese text.",
        "We approach this problem by manually annotating each verb in a Chinese document with a \"tense\" tag that indicates the temporal location of the verb.",
        "We then formulate the tense determination problem as a classification task where standard machine learning techniques can be applied.",
        "Figuring out what linguistic information contributes to the determination of the temporal location of a situation becomes a feature engineering problem of selecting features that help with the automatic classification.",
        "In Section 2, we present a linguistic annotation framework that annotates the temporal location of situations in Chinese text.",
        "In Section 3 we describe our setup for an automatic tense classification experiment and present our experimental results.",
        "In Section 4 we focus in on the features we have used in our experiment and attempt to provide a quantitative as well as intuitive explanation of the contribution of the individual features and speculate on what additional features could be useful.",

        "She used only a limited number of surface cues such as temporal adverbials and aspect markers as features and did not attempt to model the lexical aspect information such as boundedness, which we believe would have helped her system performance.",
        "Her data appeared to have a much larger percentage of verb instances that have the past tense and thus her results are mostly incomparable with that of ours."

        "We have defined the automatic inference of the temporal location of situations in Chinese text as a machine learning problem and demonstrated that a lot more information in the form of features contributes to the solution of this challenging problem than previously realized.",
        "The accuracy on the held-out test is a significant improvement over the baseline, the proportion of verbs assigned the most frequent tense (the past tense).",
        "Although there is a large drop-off from the training accuracy to the test accuracy due to the lexical nature of the features, the high training accuracy does show promise that this challenging problem is solvable with a larger training set, better modeling techniques and more refined features.",
        "In the future we will attempt to solve this problem along these lines and work toward a system that can be used in practical applications."
