        "Given the fact that a significant portion of biomedical text is negated, recognising negated instances is important in NLP applications.",

        "The system consists of two memory-based classifiers, one that decides if the tokens in a sentence are negation signals, and another that finds the full scope of the negation signals.",
        "The first classifier achieves 94.40 F1, and the second 80.99.",
        "However, the evaluation in terms of correct scopes shows the weakness of the system.",
        "This is why a postprocessing algorithm is applied.",
        "The algorithm achieves an error reduction of 21.58, with 50.05 % of fully correct scopes in the system based on predicted negation signals.",
        "These results suggest that unsupervised machine learning algorithms are suited for tackling the task, as it was expected from results obtained in other natural language processing tasks.",
        "However, results also suggest that there is room for improvement.",
        "A first improvement would consist in predicting the scope chunk per chunk instead of token per token, because most negation scope boundaries coincide with boundaries of chunks.",
        "We have highlighted the fact that our approach to negation detection focuses on finding the scope of negation signals, instead of determining whether a term is negated or not, and on applying supervised machine learning techniques.",
        "As far as we know, this approach is novel.",
        "Unfortunately, there are no previous comparable approaches to measure the quality of our results.",
        "Additionally, we have shown that negation finding can be modelled as a classification task in a way similar to other linguistic tasks like semantic role labeling.",
        "In our model, tokens of a sentence are classified as being a negation signal or not, and as being inside or outside the scope of the negation signal(s).",
        "This representation would allow to integrate the task with other semantic tasks and exploring the interaction between different types of knowledge in a joint learning setting.",
        "Further research is possible in several directions.",
        "In the first place, other machine learning algorithms could be integrated in the system in order to optimise performance.",
        "Secondly, the system should be tested in different types of biomedical texts, like full papers or medical reports to check its robustness.",
        "Finally, the postprocessing algorithm could be improved by using more sophisticated sequence classification techniques (Dietterich, 2002) ."
