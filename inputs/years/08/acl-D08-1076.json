        "Starting from an initial point Af, computing the most probable sentence hypothesis out of a set of K candidate translations Cs e , ... , eK along the line Af + 7 df results in the following optimization problem (Och, 2003):",
        "Hence, the total score for any candidate translation corresponds to a line in the plane with 7 as the independent variable.",
        "For any particular choice of 7, the decoder seeks that translation which yields the largest score and therefore corresponds to the topmost line segment.",
        "Overall, the candidate repository Cs defines K lines where each line may be divided into at most K line segments due to possible intersections with the other K – 1 lines.",
        "The sequence of the topmost line segments constitute the upper envelope which is the pointwise maximum over all lines induced by C s .",
        "The upper envelope is a convex hull and can be inscribed with a convex polygon whose edges are the segments of a piecewise linear function in 7 (Papineni, 1999; Och, 2003):",
        "Figure 1 : The upper envelope (bold, red curve) for a set of lines is the convex hull which consists of the topmost line segments.",
        "Each line corresponds to a candidate translation and is thus related to a certain error count.",
        "Envelopes can efficiently be computed with Algorithm 1.",
        "The importance of the upper envelope is that it provides a compact encoding of all possible outcomes that a rescoring of Cs may yield if the parameter set AM is moved along the chosen direction.",
        "Once the upper envelope has been determined, we can project its constituent line segments onto the error counts of the corresponding candidate translations (cf. Figure 1).",
        "This projection is independent of how the envelope is generated and can therefore be applied to any set of line segments.",

        "In each iteration, the training procedure translates the development corpus using the most recent weights set and merges the top ranked candidate translations (either represented as phrase lattices or N-best lists) into the candidate repositories before the line optimization is performed.",
        "For N-best MERT, we used N = 50 which yielded the best results.",
        "In contrast to lattice MERT, N-best MERT optimizes all dimensions in each iteration and, in addition, it also explores a large number of random starting points before it re-decodes and expands the hypothesis set.",
        "As is typical for N-best MERT, the first iteration causes a dramatic performance loss caused by overadapting the candidate repositories, which amounts to more than 27.3 BLEU points.",
        "Although this performance loss is recouped after the 5th iteration, the initial decline makes the line optimization under N-best MERT more fragile since the optimum found at the end of the training procedure is affected by the initial performance drop rather than by the choice of the initial start weights.",
        "Lattice MERT on the other hand results in a significantly faster convergence speed and reaches its optimum already in the 5th iteration.",
        "For lattice MERT, we used a graph density of 40 arcs per phrase which corresponds to an N-best size of more than two octillion (2 10) entries.",
        "This huge number of alternative candidate translations makes updating the weights under lattice MERT more reliable and robust and, compared to N-best MERT, it becomes less likely that the same feature weight needs to be picked again and adjusted in subsequent iterations.",

        "The vast number of alternative translation hypotheses represented in a lattice also increases the number of phase transitions in the error surface, and thus prevents MERT from selecting a low performing feature weights set at early stages in the optimization procedure.",
        "This is illustrated in Figure 3, where lattice MERT and N-best MERT find different optima for the weight of the phrase penalty feature function after the first iteration.",
        "Table 2 shows the BLEU score results on the NIST 2008 blind test using the combined dev1+dev2 corpus as training data.",
        "While only the aren task shows improvements on the development data, lattice MERT provides consistent gains over N-best MERT on all three blind test sets.",
        "The reduced performance for N-best MERT is a consequence of the performance drop in the first iteration which causes the final weights to be far off from the initial parameter set.",
        "This can impair the ability of N-best MERT to generalize to unseen data if the initial weights are already capable of producing a decent baseline.",
        "Lattice MERT on the other hand can produce weights sets which are closer to the initial weights and thus more likely to retain the ability to generalize to unseen data.",
        "It could therefore be worthwhile to investigate whether a more elaborated version of an initial-weights prior allows for alleviating this effect in case of N-best MERT.",
        "Table 3 shows the effect of optimizing the feature function weights along some randomly chosen directions in addition to the coordinate axes.",
        "The different local optima found on the development set by using random directions result in additional gains on the blind test sets and range from 0.1% to 0.6% absolute in terms of BLEU."

        "We presented a novel algorithm that allows for efficiently constructing and representing the un-smoothed error surface over all sentence hypotheses that are represented in a phrase lattice.",

        "Lattice MERT was shown analytically and experimentally to be superior over N-best MERT, resulting in significantly faster convergence speed and a reduced number of decoding steps.",
        "While the approach was used to optimize the model parameters of a single machine translation system, there are many other applications in which this framework can be useful, too.",
        "One possible usecase is the computation of consensus translations from the outputs of multiple machine translation systems where this framework allows us to estimate the system prior weights directly on confusion networks (Rosti et al., 2007; Macherey and Och, 2007).",
