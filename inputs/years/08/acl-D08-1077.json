        "An important problem in translation neglected by most recent statistical machine translation systems is insertion and deletion of words, such as function words, motivated by linguistic structure rather than adjacent lexical context.",
        "Phrasal and hierarchical systems can only insert or delete words in the context of a larger phrase or rule.",
        "While this may suffice when translating in-domain, it performs poorly when trying to translate broad domains such as web text.",
        "Various syntactic approaches have been proposed that begin to address this problem by learning lexicalized and unlexicalized rules.",
        "Among these, the treelet approach uses unlexicalized order templates to model ordering separately from lexical choice.",
        "We introduce an extension to the latter that allows for structural word insertion and deletion, without requiring a lexical anchor, and show that it produces gains of more than 1.0% BLEU over both phrasal and baseline treelet systems on broad domain text."

        "Among the phenomena that are modeled poorly by modern SMT systems is the insertion and deletion of words, such as function words, that are motivated by the divergent linguistic structure between source and target language.",
        "To take the simplest of examples, the English noun compound \"file name'\" would typically be translated into Spanish as \"nombre de archivo\", which requires the insertion of the preposition \"de\".",
        "Conversely, when translating from Spanish to English, the \"de\" must be deleted.",
        "At first glance, the problem may seem trivial, yet the presence and position of these function words can have crucial impact on the adequacy and fluency of translation.",
        "In particular, function words are often used to denote key semantic information.",
        "They may be used to denote case information, in languages such as Japanese.",
        "Failing to insert the proper case marker may render a sentence unreadable or significantly change its meaning.",
        "Learning these operations can be tricky for MT models best suited to contiguous word sequences.",
        "From a fluency standpoint, proper insertion of determiners and prepositions can often make the difference between laughably awkward output and natural sounding translations; consider the output \"it's a cake piece\" as opposed to \"it's a piece of cake\".",
        "Furthermore, since missing or spurious function words can confuse the target language model, handling these words properly can have an impact beyond the words themselves.",
        "This paper focuses on methods of inserting and deleting words based on syntactic cues, to be used in the context of a syntax-informed translation system.",
        "While the models we build are relatively simple and the underlying templates are easy to extract, they add significant generalization ability to the base translation system, and result in significant gains."

        "Note that the inserted word is attached to adjacent context word(s).",
        "When the test set vocabulary has significant overlap with the training vocabulary, the correct translation can often be assembled based on the head or the modifying noun.",
        "However, as we show in this paper, this is woefully inadequate when translating truly out-of-domain input.",
        "In principle, phrase-based translation systems may employ insertion phrase pairs such as but the ungrounded nature of this transformation makes its use during decoding difficult.",
        "Since there are no constraints on where such a rule may apply and the rule does not consume any input words, the decoder must attempt these rules at every point in the search.",
        "The reverse operation is more feasible to implement, though again, there is great ambiguity - a source word may be deleted at any point during the search, with identical target results.",
        "Few systems allow this operation in practice.",
        "Estimating the likelihood of this operation and correctly identifying the contexts in which it should occur remain challenging problems.",
        "Hierarchical systems, such as (Chiang, 2005) in principle have the capacity to learn insertions and deletions grounded by minimal lexical cues.",
        "However, the extracted rules use a single nonterminal.",
        "Hence, to avoid explosive ambiguity, they are constrained to contain at least one aligned pair of words.",
        "This restriction successfully limits computational complexity at a cost of generalization power.",
        "Syntax-based approaches provide fertile context for grounding insertions and deletions.",
        "Often we may draw a strong correspondence between function words in one language and syntactic constructions in another.",
        "For instance, the syntactic approach of Marcu et al.",
        "(2006) can learn unlexicalized rules that insert function words in isolation, such as:",
        "However, as discussed in (Wang, Knight & Marcu, 2007), joint modeling of structure and lexical choice can exacerbate data sparsity, a problem that they attempt to address by tree binarization.",
        "Nevertheless, as we show below, unlexicalized structural transformation rules such as (1) and (4) that allow for insertion of isolated function words, are essential for good quality translation of truly out-of-domain test data.",
        "In the treelet translation approach (Menezes & Quirk, 2007), lexical choice and syntactic reordering are modeled separately using lexicalized treelets and unlexicalized order templates.",
        "We discuss this approach in more detail in Section 4.",
        "In Section 5, we describe how we extend this approach to allow for structural insertion and deletion, without the need for content word anchors."

        "All three models give large gains of 1.5% BLEU or more on Chinese-English translation.",

        "Sentence-specific rewrite rules are constructed by unifying information from three sources: a dependency parse of the input sentence, a set of treelet translation pairs, and a set of unlexicalized order templates.",
        "Dependency parses are represented as trees: each node has a lexical label and a part of speech, as well as ordered lists of pre-and post-modifiers.",
        "A treelet represents a connected subgraph of a dependency tree; treelet translation pairs consist of source and target treelets and a node alignment.",
        "This alignment is represented by indices: each node is annotated with an integer alignment index.",
        "A source node and a target node are aligned iff they have the same alignment index.",

        "Variables, such as x0: /DT on the source side and x0: on the target side, also have parts-of-speech constraints on the source side.",

        "Note that by using different combinations of order templates, a single treelet can produce multiple rewrite rules.",

        "Hence, case markers such as \" \" and \" \" need to be inserted.",
        "Also, when noun compounds are translated, an intervening postposition such as \" \" is usually needed.",
        "Among the most common deletions are \"the\" and \"a\".",
        "This is because ]apanese does not have a notion of definiteness.",
        "Similarly, pronouns are often dropped in ]apanese.",
        "English-Spanish: We note, in Table 8.4 that even between such closely related languages, structural insertions give us noticeable improvements over the baseline treelet system.",
        "On the smaller Europarl training corpus the improvements range from 0.5% to 1.1% BLEU.",
        "On the larger training corpus we find that for the more in-domain governmental and news test sets, the effect is smaller or even slightly negative, but on the very broad web test set we still see an improvement of about 0.7% BLEU.",
        "As one might expect, as the training data size increases, the generalization power of structural insertion and deletions becomes less important when translating in-domain text, as more insertions and deletions can be handled lexically.",
        "Nevertheless, the web test results indicate that if one hopes to handle truly general input the need for structural generalizations remains.",
        "Unlike in English-]apanese, when translating from English to Spanish, structural deletions are less helpful.",
        "Used in isolation or in combination with insertion templates they have a slightly negative and/or insignificant impact in all cases.",
        "We hypothesize that when translating from English into Spanish, more words need to be inserted than deleted.",
        "Conversely, when translating in the reverse direction, deletion templates may play a bigger role.",
        "We were unable to test the reverse direction because our syntax-based systems depend on a source language parser.",
        "In future work we hope to address this.",
