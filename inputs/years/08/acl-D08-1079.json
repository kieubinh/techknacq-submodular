        "Multi-document summarization aims to produce a summary describing the main topic in a document set, without any prior knowledge.",
        "Multi-document summary can be used to facilitate users to quickly understand a document cluster.",
        "For example, a number of news services (e.g. NewsInEssence) have been developed to group news articles into news topics, and then produce a short summary for each news topic.",
        "Users can easily understand the topic they have interest in by taking a look at the short summary, without looking into each individual article within the topic cluster.",
        "Automated multi-document summarization has drawn much attention in recent years.",
        "In the communities of natural language processing and information retrieval, a series of workshops and conferences on automatic text summarization (e.g. NTCIR, DUC), special topic sessions in ACL, COLING, and SIGIR have advanced the summarization techniques and produced a couple of experimental online systems.",
        "A particular challenge for multi-document summarization is that a document set might contain diverse information, which is either related or unrelated to the main topic, and hence we need effective summarization methods to analyze the information stored in different documents and extract the globally important information to reflect the main topic.",
        "In recent years, both unsupervised and supervised methods have been proposed to analyze the information contained in a document set and extract highly salient sentences into the summary, based on syntactic or statistical features.",
        "Most recently, the graph-based models have been successfully applied for multi-document summarization by making use of the \"voting\" or \"recommendations\" between sentences in the documents (Erkan and Radev, 2004; Mihalcea and Tarau, 2005; Wan and Yang, 2006).",
        "The model first constructs a directed or undirected graph to reflect the relationships between the sentences and then applies the graph-based ranking algorithm to compute the rank scores for the sentences.",
        "The sentences with large rank scores are chosen into the summary.",
        "However, the model makes uniform use of the sentences in different documents, i.e. all the sentences are ranked without considering the document-level information and the sentence-to-document relationship.",
        "Actually, given a document set, different documents are not equally important.",
        "For example, the documents close to the main topics of the document set are usually more important than the documents far away from the main topics",

        "of the document set.",
        "This document-level information is deemed to have great impact on the sentence ranking process.",
        "Moreover, the sentences in the same document cannot be treated uniformly, because some sentences in the document are more important than other sentences because of their different positions in the document or different distances to the document's centroid.",
        "In brief, neither the document-level information nor the sentence-to-document relationship has been taken into account in the previous graph-based model.",
        "In order to overcome the limitations of the previous graph-based model, this study proposes the document-based graph model to explore document impact on the graph-based summarization, by incorporating both the document-level information and the sentence-to-document relationship in the graph-based ranking process.",
        "We develop various methods to evaluate the document-level information and the sentence-to-document relationship.",
        "Experiments on the DUC2001 and DUC2002 datasets have been performed and the results demonstrate the good effectiveness of the proposed model, i.e., the incorporation of document impact can much improve the performance of the graph-based summarization.",
        "Moreover, the proposed model is robust with respect to most incorporation schemes.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "We first introduce the related work in Section 2.",
        "The basic graph-based summarization model and the proposed document-based graph model are described in detail in Sections 3 and 4, respectively.",
        "We show the experiments and results in Section 5 and finally we conclude this paper in Section 6."
