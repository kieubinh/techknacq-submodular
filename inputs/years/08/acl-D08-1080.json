        "The points are connected to allow the reader to follow the results for each method.",
        "Because the overlap between Wikipedia and WordNet expanded queries was very low, we expected the two types of expansion to be complementary, and the combination to give better results than either expansion by itself.",
        "An analysis of results for each document with the three expansion methods - Wikipedia, WordNet, and their combination showed that the simple combination ofthe expanded words cannot take advantage of the situations when one of the two methods performs better.",
        "In future work we will explore how to detect, based on the words in the query, which type of expansion is best, and how to combine them using a weighting scheme.",
        "We choose the best configuration from above (Wikipedia expansion), and further expand the query through spreading activation and PageRank.",
        "This new type of expansion has two main parameters which influence the summarization outcome: number of top ranked nodes to add to the topic expansion, and the decay of the spreading activation algorithm.",
        "The decay parameter determines how far the influence of the starting nodes (words from query or Wikipedia-expanded query) should be felt.",
        "The results in Figure 4 - for decay values 0.1, 0.5, 0.95, (reflected through a higher decay value) keeps the summary more focused around the given topic, and leads to better results.",
        "For a high enough decay - and eventually a decay of 1 - the weights of the edges become extremely small, and due to real number representation in memory, practically 0.",
        "In this situation PageRank has no effect, and all nodes have the same rank.",
        "We fix the decay parameter to 0.9999, and we study the impact of the number of top nodes chosen after ranking with PageRank.",

        "The experiments conducted within the summarization framework of the Document Understanding Conference have confirmed that encyclopedic knowledge extracted from Wikipedia can benefit the summarization task.",
        "Wikipedia articles are a source of relevant related concepts, that are useful for expanding a summarization query.",
        "Furthermore, including information from the documents to be summarized by choosing relevant concepts - based on closeness to topic keywords and relative importance - improves even more the quality ofthe summaries, judged through ROUGE-2, ROUGE-SU4 and BE recall scores, as it is commonly done in the DUC competitions.",
        "The topic expansion methods explored lead to high summarization performance 2007 respectively according to ROUGE-SU4 scores - compared to (more than 30) DUC participating systems.",
        "The graph representation ofthe documents is central to the summarization method we described.",
        "Because of this, we plan to improve this representation by collapsing together coreferential nodes and clustering together related concepts, and verify whether such changes impact the summarization results, as we expect they would.",
        "Being able to move away from the topic within the set of documents and discover new relevant nodes is an important issue, especially from the point of view of a new summarization style -updates.",
        "In update summaries the starting point is a topic, which a summarization system must track in consecutive sets of documents.",
        "We can adjust the spreading activation parameters to how far a new set of documents is from the topic.",
        "Future work includes testing the spreading activation and page ranking method in the context of the update summarization task and exploring methods of extracting related concepts from the full text of Wikipedia articles.",
