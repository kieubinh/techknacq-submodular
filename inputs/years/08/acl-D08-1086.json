        "Language modeling is essential for large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR), which aims to determine the prior probability of a supposed word string W, p(W).",
        "Although the word-based n-gram language model remains the mainstream for",
        "Corresponding author: Xihong Wu",
        "most speech recognition systems, the utilization of linguistic knowledge is too limited in this model.",
        "Consequently, many researchers have focused on introducing more linguistic knowledge in language modeling, such as lexical knowledge , syntax and semantics of language (Wang and Vergyri, 2006; Wang et al., 2004; Charniak, 2001; Roark, 2001; Chelba, 2000; Heeman, 1998; Chelba et al., 1997).",
        "Recently, structured language models have been introduced to make use of syntactic hierarchical characteristics (Roark, 2001; Charniak, 2001; Chelba, 2000).",
        "Nevertheless, the computational complexity of decoding will be heavily increased, as they are parser-based models.",
        "In contrast, the class-based language model groups the words that have similar functions of syntax or semantics into meaningful classes.",
        "As a result, it handles the questions of data sparsity and generalization of unseen event.",
        "In practice, the part-of-speech (POS) information, capturing the syntactic role of words, has been widely used in clustering words (Wang and Vergyri, 2006; Maltese et al., 2001; Samuelsson and Reichl, 1999).",
        "In Heeman's POS language model (Heeman, 1998), the joint probability of word sequence and associated POS sequence was estimated directly, which has been demonstrated to be superior to the conditional probability previously used in the class-based models (Johnson, 2001).",
        "Moreover, a SuperARV language model was presented (Wang and Harper, 2002), in which lexical features and syntactic constraints were tightly integrated into a linguistic structure of SuperARV serving as a class in the model.",
        "Thus, these knowledge was integrated in the representation level, and then the joint probabilities",
        "Proceedings of the 2008 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 820-828, Honolulu, October 2008.",
        "Â©2008 Association for Computational Linguistics",
        "of words and corresponding SuperARVs were estimated.",
        "However, in the class-based language models, words are taken as the model units, while other units smaller or larger than words are unfeasible for modeling simultaneously, such as the Chinese characters for Chinese names.",
        "Usually, speech recognition systems can only recognize the words within a predefined dictionary.",
        "With the increase of unknown words, i.e., out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, the performance will degrade dramatically.",
        "This is because not only those unknown words cannot be recognized correctly, but the words surrounding them will be affected.",
        "Thus, many efforts have been made to deal with the issue of OOV words (Martins et al., 2006; Galescu, 2003; Bazzi and Glass, 2001), and various model units smaller than words have been examined to recognize OOVs from speech, such as phonemes (Bazzi and Glass, 2000a), variable-length phoneme sequence (Bazzi and Glass, 2001), syllable (Bazzi and Glass, 2000b) and sub-word (Galescu, 2003).",
        "Since the proper name is a typical category of OOV words and usually takes a very large proportion among all kinds of OOV words, it has been specially addressed in (Hu et al., 2006; Tanigaki et al., 2000).",
        "All those attempts mentioned above succeed in utilizing linguistic knowledge in language modeling in some degree respectively.",
        "In this study, a unified framework based approach, which aims to exploit information from multilevel linguistic knowledge, is presented.",
        "Here, the Weighted Finite State Transducer (WFST) turns to be an ideal choice for our purpose.",
        "WFSTs were formerly introduced to simplify the integration of models in speech recognition, including acoustic models, phonetic models and word n-gram (Mohri, 1997; Mohri et al., 2002).",
        "In recent years, the WFST has been successfully applied in several state-of-the-art speech recognition systems, such as systems developed by the AMI project (Hain et al., 2006), IBM (Saon et al., 2003) and AT&T (Mohri et al., 1996), and in various fields of natural language processing, such as smoothed n-gram model, partial parsing (Abney, 1996), named entities recognition (Friburger and Maurel, 2004), semantic interpretation (Raymond et al., 2006) and machine translation (Tsukada and Nathe WFST has been further used for language model adaptation, where language models of different vocabularies that represented different styles were integrated through the framework of speech translation.",
        "In WFST-based systems, all of the models are represented uniformly by WFSTs, and the general composition algorithm (Mohri et al., 2000) combines these representations flexibly and efficiently.",
        "Thereby, rather than integrating the models step by step in decoding stage, a complete search network is constructed in advance.",
        "The combined WFST will be more efficient by optimizing with determiniza-tion, minimization and pushing algorithms of WF-STs (Mohri, 1997).",
        "Besides, the researches on optimizing the search space and improving WFST-based speech recognition has been carried out, especially on how to perform on-the-fly WFSTs composition more efficiently (Hori et al., 2007; Diamantino Caseiro, 2002).",
        "In this study, we extend the linguistic knowledge used in speech recognition.",
        "As WFSTs provide a common and natural representation for lexical constraints, n-gram language model, Hidden Markov Model models and context-dependency, multilevel knowledge sources can be encoded into WFSTs under the uniform transducer representation.",
        "Then this group of WFSTs is flexibly combined together to obtain an analyzer representing knowledge of person and location names as well as POS information.",
        "Afterwards, the presented analyzer is incorporated into LVCSR to evaluate the linguistic correctness of recognition candidates by an n-best rescoring.",
        "Unlike other methods, this approach holds two distinct features.",
        "Firstly, as all multilevel knowledge sources are modeled independently, the model units such as character, words, phrase, etc., can be chosen freely.",
        "Meanwhile, the integration of these information sources is conducted in the model level rather than the representation level.",
        "This setup will help to model each knowledge source sufficiently and may promote the accuracy of speech recognition.",
        "Secondly, under this unified framework, it is easy to combine additional knowledge source into the framework with the only requirement that the new knowledge source can be represented by WF-STs.",
        "Moreover, since all knowledge sources are finally represented by a single WFST, additional efforts are not required for decoding the new knowledge source.",
        "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.",
        "In section 2, we introduce our analyzer in detail, and incorporate it into a Mandarin speech recognition system.",
        "In section 3, the simulations are performed to evaluate the analyzer and test its effectiveness when being applied to LVCSR.",
        "The conclusion appears in section 4."

        "In this section, we start by giving a brief description on WFSTs.",
        "Then some special characteristics of Chinese are investigated, and the model units are fixed.",
        "Afterwards, each knowledge source is represented with WFSTs, and then they are combined into a final WFST, so-called analyzer.",
        "At last, this analyzer is incorporated into Mandarin LVCSR.",
        "The Weighted Finite State Transducer (WFST) is the generalization of the finite state automata, in which, besides of an input label, an output label and a weight are also placed on each transition.",
        "With these labels, a WFST is capable of realizing a weighted relation between strings.",
        "In our system, log probabilities are adopted as transition weights and the relation between two strings is associated with a weight indicating the probability of the mapping between them.",
        "Given a group of WFSTs, each of which models a stage of a mapping cascade, the composition operation provides an efficient approach to combine them into a single one (Mohri et al., 2002; Mohri et al., 1996).",
        "In particular, for two WFSTs R and S, the composition T = RoS represents the composition of relations realized by R and S. The combination is performed strictly on R's output and S's input.",
        "It means for each path in T, mapping string r to string s, there must exist a path mapping r to some string t in R and a path mapping t to s in S. Decoding on the combined WFST enables to find the joint optimal results for multilevel weighted relations.",
        "This study primarily takes the person and location names as well as the POS information into account.",
        "To deal with Chinese OOV words, different from the western language in which the phoneme, syllable or sub-word are used as the model units (Bazzi and Glass, 2000a; Bazzi and Glass, 2000b; Galescu, 2003), Chinese characters are taken as the basic units.",
        "In general, a person name of Han nationality consists of a surname and a given name usually with one or two characters.",
        "Surnames commonly come from a fixed set that has been historically used.",
        "According to a recent investigation on surnames involving 296 million people, 4100 surnames are found, and 129 most used surnames account for 87% (conducted by the Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences).",
        "In contrast, the characters used in given names can be selected freely, and in many situations, some commonly used words may also appear in names, such as \"$4?R|\" (victory) and \"-^tL\"\" (the Changjiang River).",
        "Therefore, both Chinese characters and words are considered as model units in this study, and a word re-segmentation process on recognition hypotheses is necessary, where an n-gram language model based on word classes is adopted.",
        "In this work, we ignore the word boundaries of n-best hypotheses and perform a word re-segmentation for names recognition.",
        "Given an input Chinese character, it is encoded by a finite state acceptor FSAinput.",
        "For example, the input \"^^^TW\" (while synthesizing molecule) is represented as in Figure 1(a).",
        "Then a dictionary is represented by a",

        "Figure 1(b) illustrates a toy dictionary listed in Table 1, in which a successful path encodes a mapping from a Chinese character sequence to some word in the dictionary.",
        "In practice, all Chinese characters should appear in the dictionary for further incorporating models of names.",
        "Then the combination of FSAinput and FSTdict, FSTseg = FSAinput Â° FSTdict, will result in a WFST embracing all the possible candidate segmentations.",
        "Afterwards an n-gram language model based on word classes is used to weight the candidate segmentations.",
        "As in Figure 2, a toy bigram with three words is depicted by WFSTn-gram, and the word classes are defined in Table 2.",
        "Here, both in the training and test stages,",
        "Figure 2: The WFST representing a toy bigram language model, in which un(wl) denotes the unigram of wl; bi(w1,w2) and back(wl) respectively denotes the bigram of w2 and the backoff weight given the word history wl.",
        "the strings of numbers or letters in sentences are extracted according to the rules, and then substituted with the class tags, \"NUM\" and \"LETTER\" respectively.",
        "At the same time, the words, such as \"H^ \" and \"AM\", are replaced with \"NUMjf\" and \"LET-TERM\" in the dictionary.",
        "In addition, name classes, including \"CNAME\", \"TNAME\" and \"LOC\", will be set according to names recognition.",
        "Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are adopted both for names recognition and POS tagging.",
        "Here, each HMM is represented with two WFSTs.",
        "Taking the POS tagging as an example, the toy POS WFSTs with 3 different tags are illustrated in Figure 3.",
        "The emission probability of a word by a POS, (P(word/pos)), is represented as in Figure 3(a), and the bigram transition probabilities between POS tags are represented as in Figure 3(b), similar to the word n-gram.",
        "In terms of names recognition, the HMM states correspond to 30 role tags of names, some for model units of Chinese characters, such as surname, the first or second character of a given person name with two characters, the first or last character of a location name and so on, but others for model units of words, such as the word before or after a name, the words in a name and so on.",
        "When recognizing the person names, since there is a big difference between the translated names and the names of Han nationality, two types of person names are modeled separately, and substituted with two different class tags in the segmentation language model, as \"TNAME\" and \"CNAME\".",
