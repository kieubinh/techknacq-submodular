        "In machine translation (MT), confusion networks (CNs) are commonly used to represent alternative versions of sentences.",
        "Typical applications include translation of different speech recognition hypotheses (Bertoldi et al., 2007) or system combination (Fiscus, 1997; Matusov et al., 2006).",
        "A typical operation on a given CN is to find the path which minimizes or maximizes a certain evaluation metric.",
        "This operation can be used in applications like Minimum Error Rate Training (Och, 2003), or optimizing system combination as described by Hillard et al.",
        "(2007).",
        "Whereas this is easily achievable for simple metrics like the Word Error Rate (WER) as described by Mohri and Riley (2002), current research in MT uses more sophisticated measures, like the BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2001).",
        "Zens and Ney (2005) first described this task on general word graphs, and sketched a complete algorithm for calculating the maximum BLEU score in a word graph.",
        "While they do not give an estimate on the complexity of their algorithm, they note that already a simpler algorithm for calculating the Position independent Error Rate (PER) has an exponential worst-case complexity.",
        "The same can be expected for their BLEU algorithm.",
        "Dreyer et al. (2007) examined a special class of word graphs, namely those that denote constrained reorderings of single sentences.",
        "These word graphs have some properties which simplify the calculation; for example, no edge is labeled with the empty word, and all paths have the same length and end in the same node.",
        "Even then, their decoder does not optimize the true BLEU score, but an approximate version which uses a language-model-like unmodified precision.",
        "We give a very short introduction to CNs and the BLEU score in Section 2.",
        "In Section 3 we show that finding the best BLEU score is an NP-hard problem, even for a simplified variant of BLEU which only scores unigrams and bigrams.",
        "The main reason for this problem to become NP-hard is that by looking at bigrams, we allow for one decision to also influence the following decision, which itself can influence the decisions after that.",
        "We also show that this also holds for unigram BLEU and the position independent error rate (PER) on a slightly augmented variant of CNs which allows for edges to carry multiple symbols.",

        "But even a simple, common procedure as BLEU scoring, which can be performed in linear time on single sentences, becomes a potentially intractable problem as soon as it has to be performed on a slightly more powerful representation, such as confusion networks.",
        "This rather surprising result is the motivation of this paper.",

        "An important corollary of this work is that calculating the BLEU-best path on general word graphs is also NP-complete, as CNs are a true subclass of word graphs.",
        "It is still desirable to calculate a \"good\" path in terms of the BLEU score in a CN, even if calculating the best path is infeasible.",
        "In Section 5, we present an algorithm which can calculate \"good\" solutions for CNs in polynomial time.",
        "This algorithm can easily be extended to handle arbitrary word graphs.",

        "When implementing this algorithm, Hypotheses should be compared on the modified BLEUS precision by Lin and Och (2004) because the original BLEU precision equals zero as long as there are no higher n-gram matches in the partial hypotheses, which renders meaningful comparison hard or impossible.",
        "In the rightmost column, all path hypotheses within a node have the same hypothesis length.",
        "Consequently, we can select the hypothesis with the best (brevity-penalized) BLEU score by multiplying the appropriate brevity penalty to the precision of the best path ending in each of these nodes.",
        "If we always expand all possible path hypotheses within the nodes, and basically run a full search, we will always find the BLEU-best path this way.",
        "From the proof above, it follows that the number of path hypothesis we would have to keep can become exponentially large.",
        "Fortunately, if a \"good\" solution is good enough, we do not have to keep all possible path hypotheses, but only the S best ones for a given constant S, or those with a precision not worse than c times the precision of the best hypothesis within the node.",
        "Assuming that adding and removing an element to/from a size-limited stack of size S takes time O(log S), that we allow at most E empty edges in a solution, and that there are j edges in each of the n positions, this algorithm has a time complexity of",

        "While this algorithm searches for the best path for a single sentence only, a common task is to find the best BLEU score over a whole test set which can mean suboptimal BLEU scores for individual sentences.",
        "This adds an additional combinatorial problem over the sentences to the actual decoding process.",
        "Both Zens and Ney (2005) and Dreyer et al. (2007) use a greedy approach here; the latter estimated the impact of this to be insignificant in random sampling experiments.",
        "In our experiments, we used the per-sentence BLEUS score as (greedy) decision criterion, as this is also the pruning criterion.",
        "One possibility to adapt this approach to Zens's/Dreyer's greedy approach for system-level BLEU scores might be to initialize n-gram counts and hypothesis length not to zero at the beginning of each sentence, but to those of the corpus so far.",

        "As a corollary, any proposed algorithm to find the path with an optimal BLEU score in a CN, even more in an arbitrary word graph, which runs in worst case polynomial time can only deliver an approximation.",
