        "In latent variable approaches to parsing (Matsuzaki et al., 2005; Petrov et al., 2006), one models an observed treebank of coarse parse trees using a grammar over more refined, but unobserved, derivation trees.",
        "The parse trees represent the desired output of the system, while the derivation trees represent the typically much more complex underlying syntactic processes.",
        "In recent years, latent variable methods have been shown to produce grammars which are as good as, or even better than, earlier parsing work (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000).",
        "In particular, in Petrov et al.",
        "(2006) we exhibited a very accurate category-splitting approach, in which a coarse initial grammar is refined by iteratively splitting each grammar category into two subcategories using the EM algorithm.",
        "Of course, each time the number of grammar categories is doubled, the number of binary productions is increased by a factor of eight.",
        "As a result, while our final grammars used few categories, the number of total active (non-zero) productions was still substantial (see Section 7).",
        "In addition, it is reasonable to assume that some generatively learned splits have little discriminative utility.",
        "In this paper, we present a discriminative approach which addresses both of these limitations.",
        "We introduce multi-scale grammars, in which some productions reference fine categories, while others reference coarse categories (see Figure 2).",
        "We use the general framework of hidden variable CRFs (Lafferty et al., 2001; Koo and Collins, 2005), where gradient-based optimization maximizes the likelihood of the observed variables, here parse trees, summing over log-linearly scored derivations.",
        "With multi-scale grammars, it is natural to refine productions rather than categories.",
        "As a result, a category such as NP can be complex in some regions of the grammar while remaining simpler in other regions.",
        "Additionally, we exploit the flexibility of the discriminative framework both to improve the treatment of unknown words as well as to include span features (Taskar et al., 2004), giving the benefit of some input features integrally in our dynamic program.",
        "Our multi-scale grammars are 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the fully-split baseline grammar and 20 times smaller than the generative split-and-merge grammars of Petrov et al.",

        "However, in all of these cases, the final parsing performance fell short of the best generative models by several percentage points or only short sentences were used.",
        "Only in combination with a generative model was a discriminative component able to produce high parsing accuracies (Charniak and Johnson, 2005; Huang, 2008).",
        "Multi-scale grammars, in contrast, give higher accuracies using smaller grammars than previous work in this direction, outperforming top generative models in grammar size and in parsing accuracy."
