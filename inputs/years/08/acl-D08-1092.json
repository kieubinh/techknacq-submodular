        "It is certainly possible to augment these simple features with what would amount to monolingual reranking features, but we do not explore that option here.",

        "Second, even without matchings to worry about, standard methods for maximizing the above formulation would require summation over pairs of trees, and we want to assume a fairly generic interface to independent monolingual parsers (though deeper joint modeling and/or training is of course a potential extension).",
        "As we have chosen to operate in a reranking mode over monolingual k-best lists, we have another issue: our k-best outputs on the data which trains our model may not include the gold tree pair.",
        "We therefore make several approximations and modifications, which we discuss in turn.",
        "Because summing over alignments a is intractable, we cannot evaluate (2) or its derivatives.",
        "However, if we restrict the space of possible alignments, then we can make this optimization more feasible.",
        "One way to do this is to stipulate in advance that for each tree pair, there is a canonical alignment ao(t, t').",
        "Of course, we want a0 to reflect actual correspondences between t and t', so we want a reasonable definition that ensures the alignments are of reasonable quality.",
        "Fortunately, it turns out that we can efficiently optimize a given a fixed tree pair and weight vector:",

        "Then, we simplify (2) by fixing the alignments a0:",
        "This optimization has no latent variables and is therefore convex and straightforward.",
        "However, while we did use this as a rapid training procedure during development, fixing the alignments a priori is both unsatisfying and also less effective than a procedure which allows the alignments a to adapt during training.",
        "Again, for fixed alignments a, optimizing w is easy.",
        "Similarly, with a fixed w, finding the optimal a for any particular tree pair is also easy.",
        "Another option is therefore to use an iterative procedure that alternates between choosing optimal alignments for a fixed w, and then reoptimizing w for those fixed alignments according to (3).",

        "Since these sets are not guaranteed to contain the gold trees g and g', our next approximation is to define a set of pseudo-gold trees, following previous work in monolingual parse reranking (Charniak and Johnson, 2005).",
        "We define T (T') as the Fi-optimal subset of T (T').",
        "We then modify (4) to reflect the fact that we are seeking to maximize the likelihood of trees in this subset:",
        "To reduce the time and space requirements for training, we do not always use the full k-best lists.",
