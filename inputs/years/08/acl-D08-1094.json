        "Semantic spaces are a popular framework for the representation of word meaning, encoding the meaning of lemmas as high-dimensional vectors.",
        "In the default case, the components of these vectors measure the co-occurrence of the lemma with context features over a large corpus.",
        "These vectors are able to provide a robust model of semantic similarity that has been used in NLP (Salton et al., 1975; McCarthy and Carroll, 2003; Manning et al., 2008) and to model experimental results in cognitive science (Landauer and Dumais, 1997; McDonald and Ramscar, 2001).",
        "Semantic spaces are attractive because they provide a model of word meaning that is independent of dictionary senses and their much-discussed problems (Kil-garriff, 1997; McCarthy and Navigli, 2007).",
        "In a default semantic space as described above, each vector represents one lemma, averaging over all its possible usages (Landauer and Dumais, 1997; Lund and Burgess, 1996).",
        "Since the meaning of words can vary substantially between occurrences (e.g., for polysemous words), the next necessary step is to characterize the meaning of individual words in context.",
        "There have been several approaches in the literature (Smolensky, 1990; Schütze, 1998; Kintsch, 2001; McDonald and Brew, 2004; Mitchell and La-pata, 2008) that compute meaning in context from lemma vectors.",
        "Most of these studies phrase the problem as one of vector composition: The meaning of a target occurrence a in context b is a single new vector c that is a function (for example, the centroid) of the vectors: c = a 0 b.",
        "The context b can consist of as little as one word, as shown in Example (1).",
        "In (1a), the meaning of catch combined with ball is similar to grab, while in (1b), combined with disease, it can be paraphrased by contract.",
        "Conversely, verbs can influence the interpretation of nouns: In (1a), ball is understood as a spherical object, and in (1c) as a dancing event.",
        "b. catch a disease c. attend a ball",
        "In this paper, we argue that models of word meaning relying on this procedure of vector composition are limited both in their scope and scalability.",
        "The underlying shortcoming is a failure to consider syntax in two important ways.",
        "The syntactic relation is ignored.",
        "The first problem concerns the manner of vector composition, which ignores the relation between the target a and its context b.",
        "This relation can have a decisive influence on their interpretation, as Example (2) shows:",
        "Proceedings of the 2008 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 897-906, Honolulu, October 2008.",
        "©2008 Association for Computational Linguistics",
        "In (2a), the meaning of the verb draw can be paraphrased as pull, while in (2b) it is similar to sketch.",
        "This difference in meaning is due to the difference in relation: in (2a), horse is the subject, while in (2b) it is the object.",
        "On the modeling side, however, a vector combination function that ignores the relation will assign the same representation to (2a) and (2b).",
        "Thus, existing models are systematically unable to capture this class of phenomena.",
        "Single vectors are too weak to represent phrases.",
        "The second problem arises in the context of the important open question of how semantic spaces can \"scale up\" to provide interesting meaning representations for entire sentences.",
        "We believe that the current vector composition methods, which result in a single vector c, are not informative enough for this purpose.",
        "One proposal for \"scaling up\" is to straightforwardly interpret c = a 0 b as the meaning of the phrase a + b (Kintsch, 2001; Mitchell and Lapata, 2008).",
        "The problem is that the vector c can only encode a fixed amount of structural information if its dimensionality is fixed, but there is no upper limit on sentence length, and hence on the amount of structure to be encoded.",
        "It is difficult to conceive how c could encode deeper semantic properties, like predicate-argument structure (distinguishing \"dog bites man\" and \"man bites dog\"), that are crucial for sentence-level semantic tasks such as the recognition of textual entailment (Dagan et al., 2006).",
        "An alternative approach to sentence meaning would be to use the vector space representation only for representing word meaning, and to represent sentence structure separately.",
        "Unfortunately, present models cannot provide this grounding either, since they compute a single vector c that provides the same representations for both the meanings of a and b in context.",
        "In this paper, we propose a new, structured vector space model for word meaning (svs) that addresses these problems.",
        "A svs representation of a lemma comprises several vectors representing the word's lexical meaning as well as the selectional preferences that it has for its argument positions.",
        "The meaning of word a in context b is computed by combining a with b's selectional preference vector specific to the relation between a and b, addressing the first problem above.",
        "In an expression a + b, the meanings of a and b in this context are computed as two separate vectors a' and b'.",
        "These vectors can then be combined with a representation of the structure's expression (e.g., a parse tree), to address the second problem discussed above.",
        "We test the svs model on the task of recognizing contextually appropriate paraphrases, finding that svs performs at and above the state-of-the-art.",

        "After this set has been narrowed down in a self-inhibitory network, the meaning of the predicate-argument combination is obtained by computing the centroid of its members' vectors.",
        "The procedure does not take the relation between p and a into account.",

        "This framework allows sensitivity to the relation.",
        "However, the concrete instantiations that Mitchell and Lapata consider disregards K and R, thus sharing the other models' limitations.",

        "Smolensky (1990) uses tensor product to combine two word vectors a and b into a vector c representing the expression a + b.",
        "The vector c is located in a very high-dimensional space and is thus capable of encoding the structure of the expression; however, this makes the model infeasible in practice, as dimensionality rises with every word added to the representation.",
        "Jones and Mewhort (2007) represent lemma meaning by using circular convolution to encode n-gram co-occurrence information into vectors of fixed dimensionality.",
        "Similar to Brew and McDonald (2004), they predict most likely next words in a sequence, without taking syntax into account.",
        "Kernel methods.",
        "One of the main tests for the quality of models of word meaning in context is the ability to predict the appropriateness of paraphrases in given a context.",
        "Typically, a paraphrase applies only to some senses of a word, not all, as can be seen in the paraphrases \"grab\" and \"contract\" of \"catch\".",
        "Vector space models generally predict paraphrase appropriateness based on the similarity between vectors.",
        "This task can also be addressed with kernel methods, which project items into an implicit feature space for efficient similarity computation.",
        "Consequently, vector space methods and kernel methods have both been used for NLP tasks based on similarity, notably Information Retrieval and Textual Entailment.",
        "Nevertheless, they place their emphasis on different types of information.",
        "Current kernels are mostly tree kernels that compare syntactic structure, and use semantic information mostly for smoothing syntactic similarity (Moschitti and Quarteroni, 2008).",

        "Our eventual aim is a model that can give a compositional account of a word's meaning in context, where all words in an expression disambiguate one another according to the relations between them.",
        "We will explore the usability of vector space models of word meaning in NLp applications, formulated as the question of how to perform inferences on them in the context of the Textual Entailment task (Dagan et al., 2006).",
        "paraphrase-based inference rules play a large role in several recent approaches to Textual Entailment (e.g. Szpektor et al. (2008)); appropriateness judgments of paraphrases in context, the task of Experiments 1 and 2 above, can be viewed as testing the applicability of these inferences rules.",
