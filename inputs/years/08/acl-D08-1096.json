        "Linguistic inference then directly operates on these stored exemplars.",
        "In this paper, we propose a new approach to lexical syntactic acquisition in the framework of exemplar theory.",
        "Our approach uses an evaluation measure that is different from previous work.",
        "Lexical syntactic acquisition is most often evaluated with respect to standard syntactic categories like verb and noun.",
        "Our first contribution in this paper is that we instead evaluate learned representations in the context of a syntactic task.",
        "This task is the determination of an aspect of grammaticality that we call local syntactic coherence.",
        "Our second contribution is a graph-theoretic model of the acquisition of lexical syntactic representations that is more rigorous than previous heuristic proposals.",
        "The graph-theoretic model can learn both categorical and non-categorical (or graded) representations.",
        "The model is also a unified framework for syntagmatic and paradigmatic relations (as will be discussed below), and for lowerorder syntactic relations (those that can be directly observed from the input) and higher-order syntactic relations (those that require some generalization from what is directly observable).",

        "Our third contribution is to show that, in the context of acquisition, graded representations are superior to standard categorical representations in supporting judgments of local syntactic coherence.",
        "A graded representation formalism is one that, for any two words, can represent a third word whose syntactic properties are intermediate between the two words (Manning and Schütze, 1999).",
        "Clearly exemplar theory is not the only framework in which lexical acquisition has been explored.",
        "Gleitman (1990) for example argues for syntactic bootstrapping to infer lexical semantics, work not at odds with our own (see discussion on the role of semantics below).",
        "Our argument for the importance of distributional evidence does not call into question the large body of work in child language acquisition that demonstrates that \"part of the capacity to learn languages must be 'innate' \" (Gleitman and Newport, 1995).",
        "Tabula rasa learning is not possible.",
        "Our goal is not to show that language acquisition proceeds with a minimum of inductive bias.",

        "In the context sequence model for exemplar-theoretic phonetics (Wade et al., 2008), we represent speech using amplitude envelopes derived from the acoustic signal and then compute similarity as the integral over the correlation of the two acoustic signals.",
        "For the syntactic level, we need a representation that has two key properties of the representation we use in phonetics in order to support an exemplar-theoretic account.",
        "First, the representation must be directly derivable from the perceived input.",
        "In particular, it cannot rely on the results of any disambiguation that would occur either as part of exemplar-theoretic perception or in further downstream processing.",
        "Second, it must support similarity computations.",
        "Accordingly, we first motivate the representation we use and then introduce a similarity measure on these representations.",
        "Representation.",
        "There are two main sources of directly observable information about the syntactic properties of words: semantic cues (e.g., things are often referred to with nouns) and the neighbors of a word in sentences that it is used in.",
        "In this paper, we only consider the second source of information for acquisition, lexical neighbors.",
        "We further limit ourselves to the immediate left and right lexical neighbors (see discussion in Section 7).",
        "When using lexical neighbors as the basis of representation, we have to make a basic choice as to whether we look at left and right neighbors separately or whether we only look at the \"correlated\" neighborhood information of left and right neighbors jointly.",
        "Our approach is based on the first alternative: we separate the processing of left and right neighbors.",
        "We do this for two reasons.",
        "First, generalization improves and model complexity decreases if left-neighbor information and right-neighbor information are looked at separately.",
        "E.g., the right neighbors of to, might and not are similar because all three words can be followed by base verbs like dance: to dance, might dance, (might) not dance.",
        "But their left neighbors are very different.",
        "Second, exemplar-theoretic similarity is best defined at the smallest possible scale in order to allow optimal matching between parts of the stimulus and parts of memory.",
        "In phonetics, we use a time scale of 10s of milliseconds or even less.",
        "Conceivably, one could also use segments (e.g., consonants and vowels) as the smallest unit; however, this would presume a segmented signal.",
        "And segmentation is part of the perception task we want to explain in the first place.",
        "Separating left and right neighbors - which amounts to looking at left and right local contexts of each word separately - is the smallest scale we can operate at when doing syntactic matching.",
        "We choose this small scale for the same reasons as we choose a small scale in phonetics: to ensure maximum flexibility when matching parts of the stimulus with exemplars in memory.",
        "Using words, bigrams or larger units would reduce the flexibility in matching and require a larger amount of experience (or training data) to learn a particular generalization.",
        "We refer to the representations of left and right contexts of a given word as half-words.",
        "In other words, we split a word into two entities, a left halfword that characterizes its behavior to the left and a right halfword that characterizes its behavior to the right.",
        "Thus left-context and right-context components of the representation of a given focus word are defined, where a left (right) halfword consists of a probability distribution over all words that occur to the left (right) of the focus word and the dimensionality of the vector for each word is dependent on the number of distinct neighbors (left and right).",
        "For example, having experienced take doll twice and drop doll once, then the left context distribution, or left halfword of doll, dolli, is P(take) = 2/3, P(drop) = 1/3.",
        "By extension, the phrase take the doll is represented as the following six half-words: takei, taker, thei, ther, dolli, and dollr.",
        "Distance measure.",
        "The basic intuition behind local syntactic coherence is that an important component of syntactic wellformedness - and a component that is of particular importance in acquisition - is whether a similar sequence has already been stored as grammatical in memory.",
        "The same way that a phonetic signal that is well-formed in a particular language has many similar exemplars in memory, a syntactic sequence should also be licensed by similar, previously perceived sequences in memory.",
        "To operationalize this notion, we need to be able to compute the similarity or distance between an input stimulus and exemplars in memory.",
        "We do this by first defining a distance measure for sequences of fixed length.",
        "The distance A between two sequences of halfwords < gi,... ,gn > and < hi,..., hn > is defined to be the sum of the distances of their half-words:",
        "A(<gi,..., gn>,<hi,hn>) = En=i A(gi, hi) This definition presupposes a definition of the distance of two halfwords which will be given below.",

        ".",
        ", gn locally coherent if there is a sequence hi,...,hn in memory with A(< gi,...,gn >,< hi,..., hn >) < 6 where 6 is a parameter.",
        "Finally, we define a sentence to be locally n-coherent if all of its subsequences of length n are locally coherent.",
        "The graph-theoretic model that is introduced in the next section will be evaluated with respect to how well it captures local syntactic coherence.",
        "This enables us to evaluate the model with respect to a task as opposed to its ability to reproduce a particular linguistic representation of syntactic categories.Obviously, the notion of local syntactic coherence only captures some aspects of syntax - e.g., it does not capture long-distance dependencies.",
