        "We designed two experiments to test the accuracy of our classifiers.",
        "The first experiment evaluates the individual contribution of different feature types to question classification accuracy.",
        "In particular, the SVM and ME are trained from the UIUC 5500 training data using the following feature sets: 1) wh-word + head word, 2) wh-word + head word + direct hypernym, 3) wh-wod + head word + indirect hyper-nym, 4) unigram, 5) bigram, 6) trigram, and 7) word shape.",
        "We set up the tests of 1), 2) and 3) due to the fact that wh-word and head word can be treated as a unit, and hypernym depends on head word.",
        "In the second experiment, feature sets are incrementally feeded to the SVM and ME.",
        "The parameters for both SVM and ME classifiers (e.g., the C in the SVM) are all with the default values.",
        "In order to facilitate the comparison with previously reported results, the question classification performance is measured by accuracy, i.e., the proportion of the correctly classified questions among all test questions.",
        "Table 1 shows the question classification accuracy of SVM and ME using individual feature sets for 6 coarse and 50 fine classes.",
        "Among all feature sets, wh-word + head word proves to be very informative for question classification.",

        "(2005) that WordNet hypernym benefits mainly on the 50 fine classes classification.",
        "Li and Roth (2006) made use of semantic features including named entities, WordNet senses, class-specific related words, and distributional similarity based categories.",
        "Their system managed to improve around 4 percent with the help of those semantic features.",
        "They reported that WordNet didn't contribute much to the system, while our results show that the WordNet significantly boosts the accuracy.",
        "The reason may be that their system expanded the hypernyms for each word in the question, while ours only expanded the head word.",
        "In doing so, the augmentation does not introduce much noisy information.",
        "Notice that the inclusion of various depth of hypernyms results in different accuracy.",
        "The depth of six brings the highest accuracy of 85.4% and 85.6% for SVM and ME under 50 classes, which is very competitive to the previously reported best accuracy of 86.2% (Krishnan et al., 2005).",
        "Our second proposed WordNet semantic feature, the indirect use of hypernym, does not perform as good as the first approach; it only contributes the accuracy gain of 1.8 and 1.6 in the fine classes for SVM and ME respectively.",
        "The reason may be two fold: 1) the description words (usually one to three words) of question categories are not representative enough, and 2) the indirect use of hypernyms via the WordNet similarity package is not as efficient as direct use of hypernyms.",
        "Among the surface words features, unigram feature perform the best with accuracy of 80.4% for SVM under 50 classes, and 88.0% for SVM under 6 classes.",
