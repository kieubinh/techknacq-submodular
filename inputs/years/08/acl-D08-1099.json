      "text": [
        "SEAL was originally designed to handle only relevant input seeds.",
        "When provided with a mixture of relevant and irrelevant answers from a QA system, the performance would suffer.",
        "In this section, we propose three modifications to SEAL to improve its ability to handle noisy input seeds.",
        "For each expansion, SEAL's fetcher concatenates all seeds and sends them as one query to the search engines.",
        "However, when the seeds are noisy, the documents fetched are constrained by the irrelevant seeds, which decreases the chance of finding good documents.",
        "To overcome this problem, we designed an aggressive fetcher (AF) that increases the chance of composing queries containing only relevant seeds.",
        "It sends a two-seed query for every possible pair of seeds to the search engines.",
        "If there are n input seeds, then the total number of queries sent would be .",
        "For example, suppose SEAL is given a set of noisy seeds: Boston, Seattle and Carnegie-Mellon (assuming Carnegie-Mellon is irrelevant), then by using AF, one query will contain only relevant seeds (as shown in Table 1).",
        "The documents are then collected and sent to SEAL's extractor for learning wrappers.",
        "Table 1: Example queries and their quality given the seeds Boston, Seattle and Carnegie-Mellon, where Carnegie-Mellon is assumed to be irrelevant.",
        "SEAL's extractor requires the longest common contexts to bracket at least one instance of every seed per web page.",
        "However, when seeds are noisy, such common contexts usually do not exist or are too short to be useful.",
        "To solve this problem, we propose a lenient extractor (LE) which only requires the contexts to bracket at least one instance of a minimum oftwo seeds, instead of every seed.",
        "This increases the chance of finding longest common contexts that bracket only relevant seeds.",
        "For instance, suppose SEAL is given the seeds from the previous example (Boston, Seattle and Carnegie-Mellon) and the passage below.",
        "Then the extractor would learn the wrappers shown in Table 2.",
        "\"While attending a hearing in Boston City Hall, Alan, a professor at Boston University, met Tina, his former student at Seattle University, who is studying at Carnegie-Mellon University Art School and will be working in Seattle City Hall.\"",

        "As illustrated, with lenient extraction, SEAL is now able to learn the second wrapper because it brackets one instance of at least two seeds (Boston and Seattle).",
        "This can be very helpful if the list question is asking for city names rather than university names.",
        "The extractor then uses these wrappers to extract additional answer candidates, by searching for other strings that fit into the placeholders of the wrappers.",
        "Note that the example was simplified for ease of presentation.",
        "The wrappers are actually character-based (as opposed to word-based) and are likely to contain HTML tags when generated from real web pages.",
        "Most QA systems use keywords from the question to guide the retrieval of relevant documents and the extraction of answer candidates.",
        "We believe these keywords are also important for SEAL to identify additional instances of correct answers.",
        "For example, if the seeds are George Washington, John Adams, and Thomas Jefferson, then without using any context from the question, SEAL would output a mixture of founding fathers and presidents of the U.S.A. To solve this problem, we devised a hinted expansion (HE) technique that utilizes the context given in the question to constrain SEAL's search space on the Web.",
        "This is achieved by appending keywords from the question to every query that is sent to the search engines.",
        "The rationale is that the retrieved documents will also match the keywords, which may increase the chance of finding those documents that contain our desired set of answers."

        "In the second phase, we evaluated the approach by applying SEAL to the output from QA systems that performed the best on the list questions in the TREC 15 evaluation.",
        "In both phases, the answers found by SEAL were retrieved from the Web instead of the AQUAINT newswire corpus used in the TREC evaluations.",
        "However, we rejected answers if they could only be found in the Web and not in the AQUAINT corpus to avoid an unfair advantage over the QA systems: TREC participants were allowed to extract candidates from the Web (or any other source), but they had to identify a supporting document in the AQUAINT corpus for each answer and thus could not return answers that were not covered by the corpus.",
        "Preliminary experiments showed that we can obtain a good balance between the amount and quality of the documents fetched by using only rare question terms as hint words.",
        "In particular, we select the three question words that occur least frequently in a sample of the AQUAINT corpus as hints.",
        "The candidate answers were evaluated by using the answer keys, composed of regular expression patterns, obtained from the TREC website.",
        "We did not extend the patterns with additional correct answers found in our experiments.",
        "These answer keys were not officially used in the TREC evaluation; thus the baseline scores we computed for Ephyra and other QA systems in our experiments are slightly different from those officially reported.",
        "We evaluated our SE approach on Ephyra using the list questions from TREC 13, 14, and 15 (55, 93, and 89 questions, respectively).",
        "For each question, the top four answer candidates from Ephyra were given as input seeds to SEAL.",
        "Initial experiments showed that by adding additional seeds, the effectiveness of our approach can be improved at the expense of a longer runtime.",
        "We report both mean average precision (MAP) and Fi scores.",
        "For the Fi scores, we drop answer candidates with low confidence scores by applying a relative cut-off threshold: an answer candidate is dropped if the ratio of its confidence score and the score of the top answer is below a threshold.",
        "An optimal threshold for a question is a threshold that maximizes the Fi score for that particular question.",
        "For each TREC dataset, we conducted three experiments: (1) evaluation of answer candidates using MAP; (2) evaluation using average Fi with an optimal threshold for each question; and (3) evaluation using average Fi with thresholds trained by 5-fold cross validation.",
        "For each of those 5-fold validations, only one threshold was determined for all questions in the training folds.",
        "Table 3: Mean average precision of Ephyra, its top four answers, and various SEAL configurations, where LE is Lenient Extractor, AF is Aggressive Fetcher, and HE is Hinted Expander.",

        "We evaluated two SE approaches, SEAL and Google Sets, on the five QA systems that performed the best on the list questions in TREC 15.",
        "For each question, the top four answer candidates from those systems were given as input seeds to SEAL and Google Sets.",
        "Unlike the candidates found by Ephyra, these candidates were provided without confidence scores; hence, we assumed they all have a score of 1.0.",
        "In our experiments with SEAL, we first determined a single threshold that optimizes the average of the Fi scores of the top five systems in both TREC 13 and 14.",
        "We then obtained evaluation results for the top systems in TREC 15 by using this trained threshold.",
        "When performing hinted expansion, the keywords (or hint words) for each question were extracted by Ephyra's question analysis component.",
        "In our experiments with Google Sets, we requested Small Sets of items and again measured the performance in terms of F1 scores.",

        "We have shown that our SE approach is capable of improving the performance of QA systems on list questions by utilizing only their top four answer candidates as seeds.",
        "We have also illustrated a feasible and effective method for integrating a SE approach into any QA system.",
        "We would like to emphasize that for each of the experiments we conducted, all that the SE system received as input were the top four noisy answers from a QA system and three keywords from the TREC questions.",
        "We have shown that higher quality candidates support more effective set expansion.",
        "In the future, we will investigate how to utilize more answer candidates from the QA system and determine the minimal quality of those candidates required for SE approach to make an improvement.",
        "We have also shown that, in terms of F1 scores with trained thresholds, the hybrid method improves the Ephyra QA system on all datasets and also improves four out of the five systems that performed the best on the list questions in TREC 15.",
        "However, the final list of answers only comprises candidates found by both the QA system and the SE algorithm.",
        "In future experiments, we will investigate other methods of merging answer candidates, such as taking the union of answers from both systems.",
        "We expect further improvements from adding candidates that are found only by the QA system, but it is unclear how the confidence measures from the two systems can be combined effectively.",
        "We would also like to emphasize that the SE approach is entirely language independent, and thus can be readily applied to answer candidates in other languages.",
        "In future experiments, we will investigate its performance on question answering tasks in languages such as Chinese and Japanese.",
        "As pointed out previously, the performance of the SE approach highly depends on the accuracy of the seeds.",
        "However, QA systems are usually not optimized to provide few high-precision results, but treat precision and recall as equally important.",
        "This leaves room for further improvements, e.g. by applying stricter answer validation techniques to the seeds used for SE.",
        "We also plan to analyze the effectiveness of our approach across different question types and evaluate it on more complex questions such as the rigid list questions in the new TAC QA evaluation, which ask for opinion holders and subjects."
