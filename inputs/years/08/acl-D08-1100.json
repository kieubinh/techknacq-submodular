        "In recent dialog management frameworks, such as RavenClaw (Bohus and Rudnicky, 2003) and Collagen (Rich et al., 2001), domain-dependent components of a dialog manager are clearly separated from domain-independent components.",
        "This separation allows rapid development of a dialog management module in a new task-oriented domain as dialog system developers can focus only on specifying domain-specific dialog information (e.g. the Dialog Task Specification in RavenClaw and Task Models in Collagen) while general dialog behaviors (e.g. turn-taking, confirmation mechanism, and generic help) are provided by the framework.",
        "For task-oriented domains, the domain-specific dialog information is equivalent to task-specific information.",
        "Examples of the task-specific information are steps in a task and domain keywords.",
        "Specifying task-specific knowledge by hand is still a time consuming process (Feng et al., 2003).",
        "Furthermore, the hand-crafted knowledge may not reflect users' perceptions of a task (Yankelovich, 1997).",
        "To reduce the subjectivity of system developers, recorded conversations of humans performing a similar task as a target dialog system have been used to help the developers design the task specification.",
        "Nevertheless, analyzing a corpus of dialogs by hand requires a great deal of human effort (Bangalore et al., 2006).",
        "This paper investigates the feasibility of automating this dialog analysis process through a machine-learning approach.",
        "By inferring the task-specific dialog information automatically from human-human interaction data, the knowledge engineering effort could be reduced as the developers need to only revise learned information rather than analyzing a large amount of data.",
        "Acquiring the task-specific knowledge from a corpus of human-human dialogs is considered a knowledge acquisition process, where the target task structure has not yet been specified but will be explored from data before a dialog system is built.",
        "This is contrasted with a dialog structure recognition process (Alexandersson and Reithinger, 1997;",
        "Proceedings of the 2008 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 955-964, Honolulu, October 2008.",
        "©2008 Association for Computational Linguistics",
        "Bangalore et al., 2006; Hardy et al., 2004), where pre-specified dialog structure components are recognized as a dialog progresses.",
        "We use an unsupervised learning approach in our knowledge acquisition process as it can freely explore the structure in the data without any influence from human supervision.",
        "Woszczyna and Waibel (1994) showed that when modeling a dialog state transition diagram from data an unsupervised approach outperformed a supervised one as it better reflects the characteristic of the data.",
        "It is also interesting to see how well a machine-learning approach can perform on the problem of task-specific knowledge acquisition when no assumption about the domain is made and no prior knowledge is used.",
        "Examination of task-oriented human-human dialogs show that task-specific information can be observed in dialog transcription; therefore, it should be feasible to be infer it through an unsupervised learning approach.",
        "Figure 1 (a) shows a dialog in an air travel domain.",
        "This dialog is organized into three parts according to the three steps (i.e. reserve a flight, reserve a car, reserve a hotel) required to accomplish the task, creating a travel itinerary.",
        "Domain keywords (highlighted in bold) required to accomplish each step are clearly communicated.",
        "To infer task-specific knowledge from data using an unsupervised learning approach, two problems need to be addressed: 1) choosing an appropriate dialog representation that captures observable task-specific knowledge in a dialog, and 2) developing an unsupervised learning approach that infers the task-specific knowledge modeled by this representation from in-domain human-human dialogs.",
        "The first problem is discussed in Section 3 where a form-based dialog structure representation is proposed.",
        "After describing the definition of each component in the form-based dialog structure representation, examples of how a domain expert models the task-specific information in a dialog with the form-based representation are given Section 3.1.",
        "Then the annotation experiment which was used to verify that the form-based representation can be understood and applied by other human annotators is discussed in Section 3.2.",
        "For the second problem, we modify existing unsupervised learning approaches to make them suitable for inferring the structure of a spoken dialog.",

        "Many models have been proposed to account for the structure of a human-human conversation.",
        "Many such models focus on other aspects of a dialog such as coordinated activities, i.e. turn-taking and grounding, (Traum and Hinkelman, 1992) and regular patterns in the dialog (Carletta et al., 1997) rather than the domain-specific information communicated by participants.",
        "More complicated dialog representations (Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Litman and Allen, 1987) model several aspects of a dialog including domain-specific information.",
        "However, additional components in these models, such as beliefs and intentions, are difficult to observe directly from a conversation and, as for the current technology, may not be learnable through an unsupervised learning approach.",
        "Since the task-specific information that we would like to model will be used for configuring a dialog system, we can view this information from a dialog system perspective.",
        "Our dialog representation is based on form, a data representation used in a form-based (or frame-based) dialog system.",
        "A form is a simple representation that captures necessary task-specific information communicated through dialog.",
        "This information is observable from dialog transcription (see below) and thus could be inferred through an unsupervised learning approach.",
        "Typically, a form corresponds to a database query form while slots in the form represent search criteria.",
        "Nevertheless, a form can represent related pieces of information required to perform any domain action not just a database query action.",
        "With this more general definition of a form, a form-based dialog structure representation can be applied to various types of task-oriented domains where dialog participants have to gather pieces of information, analogous to search criteria, through dialog in order to perform domain actions that fulfill a dialog goal.",
        "Chotimongkol (2008) provided examples of these domains, for instance, meeting (Banerjee and Rudnicky, 2006) and flight simulation control (Gorman et al., 2003).",
        "In the form-based dialog structure representation, task-specific information in each dialog is organized into a three-level structure of concept, subtask and task.",
        "A concept is a word or a group of words which captures a piece of information required to perform a domain action.",
        "A subtask is a subset of a dialog which contains sufficient concepts to execute a domain action that advances a dialog toward its goal.",
        "A task is a subset of a dialog (usually the entire dialog) which contains all the subtasks that belong to the same goal.",
        "A subtask can also be considered as a step in a task.",
        "In terms of representation, a task is represented by a set of forms, one for each of its subtasks.",
        "A concept is a slot in a form.",
        "To model the structure of a dialog in a new domain with the form-based dialog structure representation, a list of tasks, subtasks, and concepts in that domain has to be specified.",
        "This list is considered a domain-specific tagset.",
        "The form-based dialog structure framework only provides the definitions of these components (i.e. task, subtask, and concept), which can be regarded as meta-tags and are domain-independent.",
        "A list of tasks, subtasks, and concepts can be identified manually as shown in Section 3.1 or automatically through a machine-learning approach as discussed in Section 4.",
        "Section 3.1 illustrates how a domain expert models the task-specific information in two task-oriented domains, air travel planning (information-accessing) and map reading (problem-solving), with the form-based representation.",
        "These examples also show that the form-based dialog structure representation",
        "Form: flight reservation",
        "is sufficient for modeling task-specific information in dissimilar domains.",
        "Nonetheless, by focusing on observable task-specific information and describing this information using a simple model, the form-based dialog structure representation cannot model the information that is not clearly expressed in a dialog.",
        "Example of such information in an air travel domain is the pickup date of a car rental which may not be discussed in a dialog as it can be inferred from the arrival date of the corresponding flight.",
        "Furthermore, the form-based representation is not well suited for modeling a complex dialog that has a dynamic structure such as a tutoring dialog.",
        "Figure 1 illustrates how a dialog in the air travel domain (Eskenazi et al., 1999) can be represented with the form-based dialog structure representation.",
        "A dialog in this domain usually has a single goal, to create an air-travel itinerary which may include hotel and car reservations.",
        "Thus, the entire dialog corresponds to one task.",

        "The forms that represent these subtasks are shown in Figure 1 (b) - (d).",
        "Each form contains a set of concepts necessary for making the corresponding reservation.",
        "For a display purpose, the values of these slots are omitted.",
        "A subtask can be further decomposed.",
        "For example, to reserve a round trip ticket, two database lookup actions, one for each leg, are required.",

        "Note that we are interested in the process of designing a domain-specific tagset from the definitions of task, subtask, and concept provided by the framework, not in the process of using an existing tagset to annotate data (see for example (Carletta et al., 1997)).",
        "The description of the framework is provided in annotation guidelines along with examples from the domains that were not used in the experiment.",
        "The experimental procedure is as follows: the subjects first developed their own tagset according to the guidelines by analyzing a set of in-domain dialogs, and then annotate those dialogs with the tagset they had designed.",
        "To obtain enough annotated instances for each dialog structure component and to make the annotation simple, the dialog structure annotation part of the experiment was divided into two sub-parts: concept annotation and task/sub-task annotation.",

        "Consistency in applying the form-based dialog structure representation shows that the representation is unambiguous and could potentially be identified through a machine-learning approach.",
        "When comparing among components, concepts were annotated more consistently than tasks and subtasks in terms of both accuracy and acceptability.",

        "A Label representation, on the other hand, only represents a concept word by its label.",
        "This representation is based on the assumption that a list of concepts occurring in one subtask is distinguishable from a list of concepts occurring in other subtasks regardless of the values of the concepts; hence, a concept label is more informative than its value.",
        "This representation provides an abstraction over all different values of the same concept type.",
        "For example, [Airline]:northwest and [Airline]:delta are represented with the same token [Airline].",

        "k is set to half the average subtask length.",
        "C. F-1 is a modification of the standard f-measure (a harmonic mean of precision and recall) that gives credit to some near misses.",
        "Since the segmented dialogs will later be used to identify a set of forms and their associated slots, the segment that contains the same set of concepts as the reference segment is acceptable even if its boundaries are slightly different from the reference.",

        "We found that a small window size and a low cut-off threshold are more suitable for identifying fine-grained segments as in the case of subtasks.",
        "However, we also found that TextTiling is quite robust as varying these two parameters doesn't severely degrade its performance (Chotimongkol, 2008).",
        "The threshold for selecting data-driven stop words was set to u + 2*g; where u. is the mean of the regularity counts of all the words in a given dialog and g is their standard deviation.",

        "Unsurprisingly, the proposed regularity counts discover stop words that are specific to spoken dialogs, but are absent from the hand-crafted list, e.g. \"okay\" and \"yeah\".",
        "For HMM-based segmentation, the segmentation result obtained when modeling the HMM states from predicted subtasks generated by Text-Tiling (4th row) is better than the result obtained when modeling the HMM states from utterances (3rd row).",
        "Predicted segments provide more context to the clustering algorithm that induces the HMM states.",
        "As a result a more robust state representation is obtained.",
        "A more efficient clustering algorithm can also improve the performance of the HMM-based segmentation algorithm since it provides a state representation that better differentiates among dialog segments which belong to dissimilar subtasks.",
        "When the Label representation which yielded a better subtask clustering result (see Section 4.2) was used, HMM-based segmentation produced a better result (5th row) especially in the map reading domain.",
        "These numbers may appear modest compared to the numbers obtained when segmenting expository text.",
        "However, predicting the boundaries of fine-grained subtasks is more difficult even with a supervised learning approach (Ar-guello and Rosé, 2006).",
        "Our results are comparable to Arguello and Rosé's (2006) results.",

        "The HMM-based algorithm can identify more boundaries between fine-grained subtasks, which occur more often in the map reading domain.",
        "TextTiling, which relies on local lexical cohesion, is unlikely to find two significant drops in lexical similarity that are only a couple of utterances apart, and thus fails to detect boundaries of short segments.",
        "However, HMM-based segmentation misses more boundaries between two subtask occurrences of the same type, which occurs more often in the air travel domain, as they are usually represented by the same state.",
        "We evaluated the subtask clustering algorithm on the same data set used in the dialog segmentation evaluation.",

        "These QSs were obtained by comparing the output clusters against a set of reference subtasks.",
        "See (Chotimongkol and Rud-nicky, 2002) for the definition of QS.",
        "When predicted segments were clustered, the quality of the output (2nd row) is not as good as when the reference segments were used (1st row) as inaccurate segment boundaries affected the performance of the clustering algorithm.",
        "However, the qualities of subtasks that occur frequently are not much different.",
        "In terms of feature representation, the clustering algorithm that uses the Label representation achieved better performance in both domains.",
        "When the sets of concepts in all of the subtasks are disjoint, the clustering algorithm that uses the Label representation can achieve a very good result as in the map reading domain.",
        "This result is even better than the result obtained when the reference segments were clustered by the algorithm that uses the Label+Word representation.",
        "These results demonstrate that an appropriate feature representation provides more useful information to the clustering algorithm than accurate segment boundaries.",
