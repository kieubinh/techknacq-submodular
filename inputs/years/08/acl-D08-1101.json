        "Existing research in dialog analysis has focused on several specific problems including dialog act detection (e.g., Byron and Heeman 1998), segmentation and chunking (e.g., Hearst 1993), topic detection (e.g., Zimmerman et al. 2005), distillation and summarization (e.g., Mishne et al. 2005) etc.",
        "The breath of this research reflects the increasing importance that dialog analysis has for multiple domains and applications.",
        "While historically, dialog analysis research has initially leveraged the corresponding techniques originally intended for textual document analysis, techniques tailored specifically for dialog processing eventually should be able to address the sparseness, noise, and time considerations intrinsic to dialog and conversations.",
        "The approach proposed in this paper focuses on the relative change of rank ordering of words occurring in a conversation according to their frequencies.",
        "Our approach emphasizes relatively improbable terms by focusing on terms that are relatively unlikely to appear frequently and thus weighting their change in rank more once they are observed.",
        "Our technique achieves this in a non-parametric fashion without explicitly computing probabilities, without the assumption of an underlying distribution, and without the computation of likelihoods.",
        "In general, non-parametric approaches to data analysis are well known and present several attractive characteristics (as a general reference see Hollander and Wolfe 1999).",
        "Non-parametric approaches require few assumptions about the data analyzed and can present computational advantages over parametric approaches especially when the underlying distributions of the data are not normal.",
        "In specific, our approach uses rank order statistics of word-feature frequencies to compute a relative rank-differential statistic.",
        "This paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we introduce and describe our basic approach (the relative rank differential RRD function and its sorted list).",
        "In Section 3 we address the temporal nature of dialogs and describe considerations to dynamically update the RRD statistics in an online fashion especially for the case of shifting temporal windows of analysis.",
        "In Section 4 we relate the RRD approach to relevant existing and previous dialog and text analysis approaches.",
        "In Section 5 we illustrate the usefulness of our metric by analyzing a set of conversations in various ways using the RRD.",
        "Specifically, in that section we will empirically demonstrate its robustness to noise and data sparseness compared to the popular term frequency and TF-IDF cosine distance approaches in",

The exponent w in the denominator allows us to emphasize or deemphasize changes in terms according to their position or rank in the language (or universal) dictionary.",
        "Typically we will want to increase the denominator's value (i.e., deemphasize) for terms that have very low frequency (and their rank value in the universal dictionary is large) so that only relatively big changes in rank will result in substantial values of this function.",
        "When alpha is zero, the RRD focuses on every word identically as we consider only the absolute change in rank.",
        "For alpha equal to 1.0 the relative change in rank gets scaled down linearly according to its rank, while for alphas larger than 1.0 the numerator will scale down or reduce to a larger extent the value of relative rank differential for words that have large rank value.",
        "Based on each word's relative rank differential we can compute the ranked list of words sorted in decreasing order by their corresponding value of relative rank differential.",
        "Let this sorted list of words be denoted by R(d\", dS ) = [w1, w2,...}.",
        "So that c(wi ) is larger than c(wj ) for every j where i < j .",
        "We now provide some intuition on the ranked RRD lists and the RRD function.",
        "The ranked dictionary of a language contains information about the frequency of all words in a language (i.e., across the universe of conversations) while the segment counterpart pertains a single conversation or segment thereof.",
        "The relative rank differential tells us how different a word is ranked in a conversation segment from the universal language, but this difference is normalized by the universal rank of the word.",
        "Intuitively, and especially when alpha equals 1.0, the RRD denotes some sort of percent change in rank.",
        "This also means that this function is less sensitive to small changes in frequency in the case of frequent words and to small changes in rank in case of infrequent words.",
        "Finally, the sorted list R(d\", dS ) contains in order of importance the most relatively salient terms of a dialog segment, as measured by relative changes or differences in rank."

        "Many techniques of text and dialog analysis utilize a word frequency vector based approach (e.g., Chu-Carroll et al. 1999) in which lexical features counts (term frequencies) are used to populate the vector.",
        "Sometimes the term frequency is normalized by document size and weighted by the inverse document frequency (TF-IDF).",
        "The TF-IDF and TF metrics are the base of other approaches like discriminative classification (Kuo and Lee 2003; and Li and Huerta 2004), Text Tilling or topic chains (Hearst 1993; Zechner 2001), and latent semantic indexing (Landauer et al. 1998).",
        "Ultimately, these types of approaches are the foundation of complex classification and document understanding systems which use these features together with possibly more sophisticated classification algorithms (e.g., D'Avanzo et al. 2007).",
        "When using TF and TF-IDF approaches, it is important to notice that by normalizing the term frequency by the document length, TF-based approaches are effectively equivalent to estimation of a multinomial distribution.",
        "The variance of the estimate will be larger as the number of observations decreases.",
        "Recently, approaches that explicitly establish this parametric assumption and perform parameter inference have been presented in (Blei et al. 2003).",
        "This work is an example of the potential complexity associated when performing parameter inference.",
        "The area of adaptation of frequency parameters for ASR, specifically the work of (Church 2000), is relevant to our work in the sense that both approaches emphasize the importance of and present a method to update the lexical or semantic feature statistics on-line.",
        "In the area of non-parametric processing of dialog and text, the work of (Huffaker et al. 2006), is very close to the work in this paper as it deals with non-parametric statistics of the word frequencies (rank of occurrences) and uses the Spearman's Correlation Coefficient.",
        "Our work differs from this approach in two ways: first, the Relative Rank Differential tells us about the relative change in rank (while SCC focuses in the absolute change) and secondly, from the ranked RDD list, we can identify the saliency of each term (as opposed to simply computing the overall similarity between two passages)."

        "In this paper we presented a novel non parametric rank-statistics based method for the semantic analysis of conversations and dialogs.",
        "Our method is implementable in segment-based or dialog-based modalities, as well as in batch form and in on-line or dynamic form.",
        "Applications of our method include topic detection, event tracking, story/topic monitoring, new-event detection, summarization, information filtering, etc.",
        "Because our approach is based on non-parametric statistics it has favorable intrinsic benefits, like making no assumptions about the underlying data, which makes it suitable for the use of both lexical semantic features as well as classifier-based semantic features.",
        "Furthermore, our approach could, in the future, benefit from classical non-parametric approaches like block-treatment analysis etc.",
        "We demonstrated that our approach is as effective in query classification as TF and TF-IDF in low noise and no noise (i.e., distortion) conditions, and consistently better than those techniques in noisy conditions.",
        "We also found RRD to be more robust to query data sparseness than TF and TF-IDF.",
        "These results provide a motivation to combine our statistic with other techniques like topic chains, textilling, latent semantic indexing, and discriminant classification approaches; specifically RRD could replace TF and TF-IDF based features.",
        "Future work could focus on applying ranking statistics to techniques for mining and tracking temporal and time-changing parameters in conjunction with techniques like (Agrawal and Srikant 1995; Pratt 2001; Last et al. 2001).",
        "Another area of possible future work is the detection and separation of multiple underlying trends in dialogs.",
        "Our approach is also suited for the analysis of large streams of real time conversations, and this is a very important area of focus as presently more and more conversational data gets generated through channels like chat, mobile telephony, VoIP etc."
