        "Multilingual speakers often switch back and forth between languages when speaking or writing, mostly in informal settings.",
        "The mixing of languages involves very elaborated patterns and forms and we usually use the term Code-Switching (CS) to encompass all of them (Lipski, 1978).",
        "Before the Internet era, CS was mainly used in its spoken form.",
        "But with so many different informal interaction settings, such as chats, forums, blogs, and web sites like Myspace and Facebook, CS is being used more and more in written form.",
        "For English and Spanish,",
        "CS has taken a step further.",
        "It has become a hallmark of the chicano culture as it is evident by the growing number of chicano writers publishing work in Spanish-English CS.",
        "We have not completely discovered the process of human language acquisition, especially dual language acquisition.",
        "Findings in linguistics, sociolinguistics, and psycholinguistics show that the production of code-switched discourse requires a very sophisticated knowledge of the languages being mixed.",
        "Some theories suggest bilingual speakers might have a third grammar for processing this type of discourse.",
        "The general agreement regarding CS is that switches do not take place at random and instead it is possible to identify rules that bilingual speakers adhere to.",
        "Understanding the CS process can lead to accurate methods for the automatic processing of bilingual discourse, and corpus-driven studies about CS can also inform linguistic theories.",
        "In this paper we present exploratory work on learning to predict CS points using a machine learning approach.",
        "Such an approach can be used to reduce perplexity of language models for bilingual discourse.",
        "We believe that CS behavior can be learned by a classifier and the results presented in this paper support our belief.",
        "One of the difficult aspects of trying to predict CS points is how to evaluate the performance of the learner since switching is intrinsically motivated and there are no forced switches (Sankoff, 1998b).",
        "Therefore, standard classification measures for this task such as precision, recall, F-measure, or accuracy, are not the best approach for measuring the effectiveness of a CS predictor.",

        "The blending pattern most widely known, and studied, is code-switching, which refers to the mixing of words from two languages, but the words themselves do not suffer any syntactic or phonological alterations.",
        "The CS points can lie at sentence boundaries, but very often we will also observe CS inside sentences.",
        "According to (Sankoff, 1998b; Poplack, 1980; Lipski, 1978) when CS is used inside a sentence, it can only happen at syntactic boundaries shared by both languages, and the resulting monolingual fragments will conform to the grammar of the corresponding language.",
        "In this CS theory the relationship between both languages is symmetric lexical items from one language can be replaced by the corresponding items in the second language and vice versa.",
        "Another prevalent linguistic theory argues the contrary: there is an asymmetric relation where the changes can occur only in one direction, which reflects the existence of a Matrix Language (ML), the dominant language, and an Embedded Language (EL), or subordinate language (Joshi, 1982).",
        "The Matrix Language Frame model, proposed and extended by Scotton-Myers, supports this asymmetric relation theory.",

        "We refer to this transcription as the Spanglish data set.",
        "We are currently in the process of collecting new transcriptions of this conversation in order to measure inter annotator agreement.",
        "Machine learning algorithms have proven to be surprisingly good at language processing tasks, including optical character recognition, text classification, named entity extraction, and many more.",
        "The premise of our paper is that machine learning algorithms can also be successful at learning how to code-switch as well as humans.",
        "At the very least we want to provide encouraging evidence that this is possible.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, there is no previous work related to the problem of automatically predicting CS points.",
        "Our machine learning framework then is inspired by existing theories of CS and existing work on part-of-speech tagging code-switched text (Solorio and Liu, 2008).",
        "In our approach, each word boundary is a potential point for switching - an instance of the learning task.",
        "It should be noted that we can only rely on the history of words preceding potential CS points in order to extract meaningful features.",
        "Otherwise, if we look also into the future, we could just do language identification to extract the CS points.",
        "However, our goal is to provide methods that can be used in real time applications, where we do not have access to observations beyond the point of interest.",
        "Another restriction we imposed on the method is related to the size of the context used.",
        "A sentence can be code-switched in different ways, with all different versions adhering to the CS \"grammar\".",
        "The number of permissible CS sentences grows almost exponentially with the length of the sentence.",
        "By limiting the length of the context to at most two words we are trying to avoid some sort of over fitting by having the model making assumptions over the interaction of the two languages that will be too weak, or speaker-dependent.",
        "Previous studies have identified several socio-pragmatic functions of code-switching.",
        "The most common include direct quotation, emphasis, clarification, parenthetical comments, tags, and trigger switches.",
        "Other characteristics relevant to CS behavior are the topic being discussed, the speakers involved, the setting where the conversation is taking place, and the level of familiarity between the speakers.",
        "Having encoded information regarding the CS function and the aforementioned relevant factors might help in predicting upcoming CS points.",
        "However, annotating this information in the transcription can be time consuming and very often this information is not readily available.",
        "Therefore, at the expense of making this task even more difficult, we decided against trying to include this type of information and include only lexical and syntactic features, to evaluate a practical and cost effective method for this task.",
        "Table 1 shows the list of features.",
        "All of these features are associated with word wn, the word immediately preceding boundary n. Feature 1 is the word form.",

        "Attributes 5 to 7 are extracted from the English version, which include the POS tag, the confidence, and the lemma for that word.",

        "This preference seems to support the assumption of the asymmetry between the two languages and the existence of an ML.",
        "This however is not the case for VFI, only a little over 50% of the positive predictions belong to this scenario.",
        "Another interesting finding is the learner's tendency to predict a code-switch after observing words like \"Yeah\", \"anyway\", \"no\", and \"shower\".",
        "The first two seem to fit the pattern of idiomatic expressions.",
        "According to Montes-Alcala this type of CS includes linguistic routines and fillers that are difficult to translate accurately (Montes-Alcala, 2007), which might be the case of \"anyway\", and unconscious changes, which can explain the case of \"Yeah\".",
        "The case of \"shower\" and \"no\" are more difficult to explain, they might be overfitting patterns from the learners.",

        "However the average score for VFI is lower than random.",
        "More experiments are needed to see if by choosing the setting where VFI had the highest F-measure would make a difference in this respect.",
        "Overall the subjects rated the human-generated CS sentences lower than what we were expecting, although it is clear that they consider these sentences more natural sounding than the rest.",
        "This low rating might be related to the attitude several evaluators expressed toward CS.",
        "In the evaluation form we asked the judges to express their opinion on CS and several of them indicated feelings along the lines of \"we shouldn't codeswitch\".",
        "There are several ways in which two parallel sentences can be combined in CS, and possibly several will sound natural, but from our results, it is clear that the NB algorithm was indeed able to generate a human-like CS behavior that was successfully differentiated from randomly-generated sentences.",
        "By looking at the set of automatically generated code-switched sentences, we realized that the majority of the sentences are grammatical and natural sounding.",
        "We believe that for a large number of the sentences it would be hard for a human to distinguish the sentences that were automatically generated from the human-generated ones.",
        "One of the give away clues is when a multi-word expression is CS, or a tag line.",
        "Table 5 shows three examples from the sentences evaluated.",
        "In the table there is an example in sentence 1c where the noun phrase is code-switched, the sentence is grammatical according to Spanish rules, but it sounds very odd to have the noun carta followed by the adjective in English, \"astrological\".",
        "Other interesting features are present in example 3 where for the same noun phrase \"produce section\" we have both, the female marking determiner la and the masculine el.",
        "The same thing happens for the noun phrase \"check-out line\".",
        "We would need to have a larger occurrence of these instances in our test set to determine if on average one form is preferred over the other.",
        "In another experiment, we measured the prediction performance of NB and VFI on the 30 code-switched sentences used in this part of the evaluation.",
        "The best results, an F-measure of 0.418, were achieved by NB when a context of 1 word was used, and no words, nor lemmas were included as features.",
        "This is the same setting used for the generation process.",
        "In contrast, VFI reached an F-measure of0.351 on this same setting.",
        "30 sentences represent a very small dataset but the results are very promising since the speakers are different in the training and testing dataset.",
        "Moreover, these results support the claim that written and spoken CS obey similar rules."

        "We presented preliminary results on learning to predict CS points with machine learning.",
        "One of the possible applications of our method involves fine-tuning the weights in a multilingual language model, for instance, as part of a speech recognizer for Span-glish.",
        "With this in mind, we restricted the possible features in the learning scenario allowing only lexical and syntactic features that could be automatically generated from the text.",
        "Empirical evaluations on a Spanglish conversation showed that Naive Bayes and VFI can predict with acceptable F-measures possible CS points, considering the difficulty of the task.",
        "Prediction of CS points can help improve multilingual language models.",
        "Evaluation of our approach cannot be done based only on the gold-standard set since there is no single right answer in this task.",
        "Therefore, we complemented the evaluation by involving judgements from bilingual speakers.",
        "We generated CS sentences by taking the predictions from the classifiers to merge parallel sentences.",
        "On average, the sentences generated from the NB model were rated closer to the original sentences, and a lot higher than the ones from a random generator.",
        "Most of the sentences sounded human-like.",
        "But because the process is automatic we did find some awkward constructions, for example plural vs singular noun-verb agreement, or multi-word phrases that were code-switched in the middle.",
        "Perhaps a multi-word recognition feature could improve results.",
        "One of the advantages of technological development and economic globalization is that more people from different regions of the world with different cultures, and therefore, different languages will be in closer contact.",
        "As a result, code-switching will become more popular.",
        "It is important to start addressing this type of bilingual communication from a computational linguistics point ofview.",
        "This work is one of the few attempts to fill the gap.",
        "Some directions for future work include: exploring the extent to which our results can be improved by including a multi-word expression recognition system.",
        "We also want to investigate the integration of our approach to multilingual language models and move beyond CS to address other deeper linguistic phenomena.",
        "Lastly, we would like to explore similar approaches in other popular language combinations."
