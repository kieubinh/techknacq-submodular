        "Native speakers of a language intuitively recognize different degrees of antonymy – whether two words are strongly antonymous (hot-cold, good-bad, friend-enemy), just semantically contrasting (enemy-fan, cold-lukewarm, ascend-slip) or not antonymous at all (penguin-clown, cold-chilly, boat-rudder).",
        "Over the years, many definitions of antonymy have been proposed by linguists (Cruse, 1986; Lehrer and Lehrer, 1982), cognitive scientists (Kagan, 1984), psycholinguists (Deese, 1965), and lexicographers (Egan, 1984), which differ from each other in small and large respects.",
        "In its strictest sense, antonymy applies to gradable adjectives, such as hot-cold and tall-short, where the two words represent the two ends of a semantic dimension.",
        "In a broader sense, it includes other adjectives, nouns, and verbs as well (life-death, ascend-descend, shout-whisper).",
        "In its broadest sense, it applies to any two words that represent contrasting meanings.",
        "We will use the term degree of antonymy to encompass the complete semantic range – a combined measure of the contrast in meaning conveyed by two words and the tendency of native speakers to call them opposites.",
        "The higher the degree of antonymy between a target word pair, the greater the semantic contrast between them and the greater their tendency to be considered antonym pairs by native speakers.",
        "Automatically determining the degree of antonymy between words has many uses including detecting and generating paraphrases (7he dementors caught Sirius Black / Black could not escape the dementors) and detecting contradictions (Marneffe et al., 2008; Voorhees, 2008) (Kyoto has a predominantly wet climate / It is mostly dry in Kyoto).",
        "Of course, such \"contradictions\" may be a result of differing sentiment, new information, non-coreferent mentions, or genuinely contradictory statements.",
        "Antonyms often indicate the discourse relation of contrast (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002).",
        "They are also useful for detecting humor (Mihalcea and Strapparava, 2005), as satire and jokes tend to have contradictions and oxymorons.",
        "Lastly, it is useful to know which words are semantically contrasting to a target word, even if simply to filter them out.",
        "For example, in the automatic creation of a thesaurus it is necessary to distinguish near-synonyms from word pairs that are semantically contrasting.",
        "Measures of distributional similarity fail to do so.",
        "Detecting antonymous words is not sufficient to solve most of these problems, but it remains a crucial, and largely unsolved, component.",

        "Lexicons of pairs of words that native speakers consider antonyms have been created for certain languages, but their coverage has been limited.",
        "Further, as each term of an antonymous pair can have many semantically close terms, the contrasting word pairs far outnumber those that are commonly considered antonym pairs, and they remain unrecorded.",
        "Even though a number of computational approaches have been proposed for semantic closeness, and some for hypernymy-hyponymy (Hearst, 1992), measures of antonymy have been less successful.",
        "To some extent, this is because antonymy is not as well understood as other classical lexical-semantic relations.",
        "We first very briefly summarize insights and intuitions about this phenomenon, as proposed by linguists and lexicographers (Section 2).",
        "We discuss related work (Section 3).",
        "We describe the resources we use (Section 4) and present experiments that examine the manifestation of antonymy in text (Sections 5 and 6).",
        "We then propose a new empirical approach to determine the degree of antonymy between two words (Section 7).",
        "We compiled a dataset of 950 closest-opposite questions, which we used for evaluation (Section 8).",
        "We conclude with a discussion of the merits and limitations of this approach and outline future work."

      "text": [
        "Antonymy, like synonymy and hyponymy, is a lexical-semantic relation that, strictly speaking, applies to two lexical units – combinations of surface form and word sense.",
        "(That said, for simplicity and where appropriate we will use the term \"antonymous words\" as a proxy for \"antonymous lexical units\".)",
        "However, accepting this leads to two interesting and seemingly paradoxical questions (described below in the two subsections).",
        "Native speakers of a language consider certain contrasting word pairs to be antonymous (for example, large-small), and certain other seemingly equivalent word pairs as less so (for example, large-little).",
        "A number of reasons have been suggested: (1) Cruse (1986) observes that if the meaning of the target words is completely defined by one semantic dimension and the words represent the two ends of this semantic dimension, then they tend to be considered antonyms.",
        "We will refer to this semantic dimension as the dimension of opposition.",
        "(2) If on the other hand, as Lehrer and Lehrer (1982) point out, there is more to the meaning of the antonymous words than the dimension of opposition – for example, more semantic dimensions or added connotations – then the two words are not so strongly antonymous.",
        "Most people do not think of chubby as a direct antonym of thin because it has the additional connotation of being cute and informal.",
        "(3) Cruse (1986) also postulates that word pairs are not considered strictly antonymous if it is difficult to identify the dimension of opposition (for example, city-farm).",
        "(4) Charles and Miller (1989) claim that two contrasting words are identified as antonyms if they occur together in a sentence more often than chance.",
        "However, Murphy and Andrew (1993) claim that the greater-than-chance co-occurrence of antonyms in sentences is because together they convey contrast well, which is rhetorically useful, and not really the reason why they are considered antonyms in the first place.",
        "Two words (more precisely, two lexical units) are considered to be close in meaning if there is a lexical-semantic relation between them.",
        "Lexical-semantic relations are of two kinds: classical and non-classical.",
        "Examples of classical relations include synonymy, hyponymy, troponymy, and meronymy.",
        "Non-classical relations, as pointed out by Morris and Hirst (2004), are much more common and include concepts pertaining to another concept (kind, chivalrous, formal pertaining to gentlemanly), and commonly co-occurring words (for example, problem-solution pairs such as homeless, shelter).",
        "Semantic distance (or closeness) in this broad sense is known as semantic relatedness.",
        "Two words are considered to be semantically similar if they are associated via the synonymy, hyponymy-hypernymy, or the troponymy relation.",
        "So terms that are semantically similar (plane-glider, doctor-surgeon) are also semantically related, but terms that are semantically related may not always be semantically similar (plane-sky, surgeon-scalpel).",
        "Antonymy is unique among these relations because it simultaneously conveys both a sense of closeness and of distance (Cruse, 1986).",
        "Antonymous concepts are semantically related but not semantically similar."

        "We randomly selected a thousand antonym pairs (nouns, verbs, and adjectives) from WordNet and counted the number of times (1) they occurred individually and (2) they co-occurred in the same sentence within a window of five words, in the British National Corpus (BNC) (Burnard, 2000).",
        "We then calculated the mutual information for each of these word pairs and averaged it.",
        "We randomly generated another set of a thousand word pairs, without regard to whether they were antonymous or not, and used it as a control set.",

        "Of course, a number of non-antonymous words also tend to co-occur more often than chance – commonly known as collocations.",

        "The meaning of the utterance will be inverted, of course, but the sentence will remain grammatical and linguistically plausible.",
        "This came to be known as the substitutability hypothesis.",

        "They found that given a sentence with the target adjective removed, most people did not confound the missing word with its antonym.",
        "Justeson and Katz (1991) later showed that in sentences that contain both members of an antonymous adjective pair, the target adjectives do indeed occur in similar syntactic structures at the phrasal level.",

        "More precisely, the approach presents a way to determine whether one word pair is more antonymous than another.",

        "In order to best evaluate a computational measure of antonymy, we need a task that not only requires knowing whether two words are antonymous but also whether one word pair is more antonymous than another pair.",
        "Therefore, we evaluated our system on a set of closest-opposite questions.",
        "Each question has one target word and five alternatives.",
        "The objective is to identify that alternative which is the closest opposite of the target.",
        "For example, consider: adulterate: a. renounce b. forbid c. purify d. criticize e. correct Here the target word is adulterate.",
        "One of the alternatives provided is correct, which as a verb has a meaning that contrasts with that of adulterate; however, purify has a greater degree of antonymy with adulterate than correct does and must be chosen in order for the instance to be marked as correctly answered.",
        "This evaluation is similar to how others have evaluated semantic distance algorithms on TOEFL synonym questions (Turney, 2001), except that in those cases the system had to choose the alternative which is closest in meaning to the target.",
        "We looked on the World Wide Web for large sets of closest antonym questions.",
        "We found two independent sets of questions designed to prepare students for the Graduate Record Examination.",
        "The first set consists of 162 questions.",
        "We used this set to develop our approach and will refer to it as the development set.",
        "Even though the algorithm does not have any tuned parameters per se, the development set helped determine which cues of antonymy were useful and which were not.",
        "The second set has 1208 closest-opposite questions.",
        "We discarded questions that had a multiword target or alternative.",
        "After removing duplicates we were left with 950 questions, which we used as the unseen test set.",
        "Interestingly, the data contains many instances that have the same target word used in different senses.",
        "For example:",
        "In (1), obdurate is used in the hardened in feelings sense and the closest opposite is tender.",
        "In (2), it is used in the resistant to persuasion sense and the closest opposite is yielding.",
        "In (3), it is used in the persistent sense and the closest opposite is transitory.",
        "The datasets also contain questions in which one or more of the alternatives is a near-synonym of the target word.",
        "For example:",
        "astute: a. shrewd b. foolish",
        "c. callow d. winning e. debating Observe that shrewd is a near-synonym of astute.",
        "The closest-opposite of astute is foolish.",
        "A manual check of a randomly selected set of 100 test-set questions revealed that, on overage, one in four had a near-synonym as one of the alternative.",
        "8.2 Experiments",
        "We used the algorithm proposed in Section 7 to automatically solve the closest-opposite questions.",
        "Since individual words may have more than one meaning, we relied on the hypothesis that the intended sense of the alternatives are those which are most antonymous to one of the senses of the target word.",
        "(This follows from the discussion earlier in Section 7.2.3.)",
        "So for each of the alternatives we used the target word as context (but not the other alternatives).",
        "We think that using a larger context to determine antonymy will be especially useful when the target words are found in sentences and natural text – something we intend to explore in the future.",
        "Table 2 presents results obtained on the development and test data using different combinations of the seed sets and the adjacency heuristic.",
        "If the system did not find any evidence of antonymy between the target and any of its alternatives, then it refrained from attempting that question.",
        "We therefore report precision (number of questions answered correctly / number of questions attempted), recall (number of questions answered correctly / total number of questions), and F-score values (2 P R P R ).",
        "Observe that all results are well above the random baseline of 0.20 (obtained when a system randomly guesses one of the five alternatives to be the answer).",
        "Also, using only the small set of sixteen affix rules, the system performs almost as well as when it uses 10,807 WordNet antonym pairs.",
        "Using both the affix-generated and the WordNet seed sets, the system obtains markedly improved precision and coverage.",
        "Using only the adjacency heuristic gave best precision values (upwards of 0.8) with substantial coverage (attempting close to halfthe questions).",

        "We have proposed an empirical approach to antonymy that combines corpus co-occurrence statistics with the structure ofa published thesaurus.",
        "The method can determine the degree of antonymy or contrast between any two thesaurus categories (sets of words representing a coarse concept) and between any two word pairs.",
        "We evaluated the approach on a large set of closest-opposite questions wherein the system not only identified whether two words are antonymous but also distinguished between pairs of antonymous words of different degrees.",
        "It achieved an F-score of 0.7 in this task where the random baseline was only 0.2.",
        "When aiming for high precision it scores over 0.8, but there is some drop in the number of questions attempted.",
        "In the process of developing this approach we validated the co-occurrence hypothesis proposed by Charles and Miller (1989) on a large set of 1000 noun, verb, and adjective pairs.",
        "We also gave empirical proof that antonym pairs tend to be used in similar contexts – the distributional hypothesis for antonyms.",
        "Our future goals include porting this approach to a cross-lingual framework in order to determine antonymy in a resource-poor language by combining its text with a thesaurus from a resource-rich language.",
        "We will use antonym pairs to identify contrast relations between sentences to in turn improve automatic summarization.",
        "We also intend to use the approach proposed here in tasks where keyword matching is especially problematic, for example, separating paraphrases from contradictions."
