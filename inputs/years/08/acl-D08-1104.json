        "Some phrases like kick the bucket are ambiguous with regard to whether they carry literal or idiomatic meaning in a certain context.",

        "We term the resolution of the literal/idiomatic ambiguity as idiom identification, hereafter.",
        "Idiom identification is classified into two kinds; one is for idiom types and the other is for idiom tokens.",
        "With the former, phrases that can be interpreted as idioms are found in text corpora, typically for compiling idiom dictionaries.",
        "On the other hand, the latter helps identify a phrase in context as a true idiom or a phrase that should be interpreted literally (a literal phrase, henceforth).",
        "In this paper, we deal with the latter, i.e., idiom token identification.",
        "Despite the recent enthusiasm for multiword expressions (MWEs) (Grégoire et al., 2007; Grégoire et al., 2008), the idiom token identification is in an early phase of its development.",
        "Given that many NLP tasks like machine translation or parsing have been developed as a result of the availability of language resources, idiom token identification should also be developed when adequate idiom resources are provided.",
        "To this end, we have constructed a Japanese idiom corpus.",
        "We have also conducted an idiom identification experiment using the corpus that we hope will be a good reference point for future studies on the task.",
        "We drew on a standard WSD framework with machine learning exploiting both features commonly used in the WSD studies and idiom-specific features.",
        "This paper reports in detail the corpus and the result of the experiment; herein, it must be noted that to the best of our knowledge, the corpus and the experiment are the largest ever of their kind.",
        "We only deal with the ambiguity between literal and idiomatic interpretations.",

        "In this paper, we reported on the idiom corpus we have constructed and the idiom identification experiment using the corpus.",
        "As mentioned in §4.3, some idioms are short of examples in the current idiom corpus.",
        "We plan to collect more examples by using different characters.",
        "In the Japanese language, there are basically three character systems: Hiragana, Katakana, and Chinese characters.",
        "Thus, you can write an idiom in different characters.",
        "For example, mune-o utu (chest-ACC hit) 'impress' can be either or",
        "In spite of its imperfection, we are sure that we can learn a lot about the idiom identification from the corpus, since, as far as we know, it is the largest-ever one, and so is the idiom identification experiment reported in §5.",
        "Also, we showed that a standard supervised WSD method works well for the idiom identification.",
        "Our system achieved the accuracy of 89.25% and 88.86% with/without idiom-specific features.",
        "Though we dealt with as many as 90 idioms, practical NLP systems are required to deal with many more idioms.",
        "Toward a scalable idiom identification, we have to develop an unsupervised or semi-supervised method.",
        "The unsupervised method of",

        "Also, the dataset of HSU came from newspaper articles, while our dataset came from the web.",
        "Birke and Sarkar (2006) requires WordNet.",
        "Fortunately, the Japanese WordNet is now available (Isa-hara et al., 2008), thus we can try their method.",
        "Also, CFS propose a language-independent unsupervised method.",
        "These could be of help.",
        "At any rate, our idiom corpus will play an important role in the development of unsupervised or semi-supervised methods, and the experimental results obtained in this study will be a good reference point to evaluate those methods."
