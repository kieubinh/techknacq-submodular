        "However, these techniques often require tagged corpora, which are not readily available to many languages.",
        "So far, reducing the cost of human annotation is one of the important problems for building NLP systems.",
        "To mitigate the problem of hand-tagging resources, semi(or minimally)-supervised and unsupervised techniques have been actively studied.",
        "Hearst (1992) first presented a bootstrapping method which requires only a small amount of instances (seed instances) to start with, but can easily multiply the number of tagged instances with minimal human annotation cost, by iteratively applying the following phases: pattern induction, pattern ranking/selection, and instance extraction.",
        "Bootstrapping has been widely adopted in NLP applications such as word sense disambiguation (Yarowsky, 1995), named entity recognition (Collins and Singer, 1999) and relation extraction (Riloff and Jones, 1999; Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006).",
        "However, it is known that bootstrapping often acquires instances not related to seed instances.",
        "For example, consider the task of collecting the names of common tourist sites from web corpora.",
        "Given words like \"Geneva\" and \"Bali\" as seed instances, bootstrapping would eventually learn generic patterns such as \"pictures\" and \"photos,\" which also co-occur with many other unrelated instances.",
        "The subsequent iterations would likely acquire frequent words that co-occur with these generic patterns, such as \"Britney Spears.\"",
        "This phenomenon is called semantic drift (Curran et al., 2007).",
        "A straightforward approach to avoid semantic drift is to terminate iterations before hitting generic patterns, but the optimal number of iterations is task dependent and is hard to come by.",
        "The recently proposed Espresso (Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006) algorithm incorporates sophisticated scoring functions to cope with generic patterns, but as Komachi and Suzuki (2008) pointed out, Espresso still shows semantic drift unless iterations are terminated appropriately.",
        "Another deficiency in bootstrapping is its sensitivity to many parameters such as the number of",

        "seed instances, the stopping criterion ofiteration, the number of instances and patterns selected on each iteration, and so forth.",
        "These parameters also need to be calibrated for each task.",
        "In this paper, we present a graph-theoretic analysis of Espresso-like bootstrapping algorithms.",
        "We argue that semantic drift is inherent in these algorithms, and propose to use two graph-based algorithms that are theoretically less prone to semantic drift, as an alternative to bootstrapping.",
        "After a brief review of related work in Section 2, we analyze in Section 3 a bootstrapping algorithm (Simplified Espresso) which can be thought of as a degenerate version of Espresso.",
        "Simplified Espresso is simple enough to allow an algebraic treatment, and its equivalence to Kleinberg's HITS algorithm (Kleinberg, 1999) is shown.",
        "An implication of this equivalence is that semantic drift in this bootstrapping algorithm is essentially the same phenomenon as topic drift observed in link analysis.",
        "Another implication is that semantic drift is inevitable in Simplified Espresso as it converges to the same score vector regardless of seed instances.",
        "The original Espresso also suffers from the same problem as its simplified version does.",
        "It incorporates heuristics not present in Simplified Espresso to reduce semantic drift, but these heuristics have limited effect as we demonstrate in Section 3.3.",
        "In Section 4, we propose two graph-based algorithms to reduce semantic drift.",
        "These algorithms are used in link analysis community to reduce the effect of topic drift.",
        "In Section 5 we apply them to the task of word sense disambiguation on Senseval-3 Lexical Sample Task and verify that they indeed reduce semantic drift.",

        "Also, Filtered Espresso without early stopping shows more or less identical performance to Simplified Espresso.",
        "It is implied that the heuristics of filtering and early stopping is a crucial step not to select generic patterns in Espresso, and the result is consistent with the experiment of convergence process of Espresso in Section 3.3.",
        "Filtered Espresso halted after the seventh iteration (Filtered Espresso (optimal stopping)) is comparable to the proposed methods.",
        "However, in bootstrapping, not only the number of iterations but also a large number of parameters must be adjusted for each task and domain.",
        "This shortcoming makes it hard to adapt bootstrapping in practical cases.",
        "One of the main advantages of the proposed methods is that they have only one parameter Ã and are much easier to tune.",
        "It is suggested in Sections 3.3 and 4.1 that Espresso and the von Neumann kernel with large Ã converge to the principal eigenvector of A, though the result does not seem to support this claim (both Simplified-and Filtered Espresso are 10 points lower than the most frequent sense baseline).",
        "The reason seems to be because Espresso and the von Neumann kernels use pointwise mutual information as a weighting factor so that the principal eigenvector of A may not always represent the most frequent sense.",
        "We also show the results of previous graph-based methods (Agirre et al., 2006), based on Hyper-Lex (Veronis, 2004) and PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998).",
        "The experimental set-up is the same as ours in that they do not use the sense tags of training corpus to construct a co-occurrence graph, and they use the sense tags of all the S3LS training corpus for mapping senses to clusters.",
        "However, these methods have seven parameters to tune in order to achieve the best performance, and hence are difficult to optimize.",
        "Figure 4 shows the performance of the von Neumann kernels with a diffusion factor Ã.",
