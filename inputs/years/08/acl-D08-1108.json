        "On the other hand, certain relations exist between the informal and formal text, and informal text often has a viable formal equivalent.",
        "Table 1 shows several naturally occurring examples of informal expressions in Chinese, and Table 2 provides a more detailed inventory and characterization of this phenomena.",
        "The first example of informal phrase \"88\" is used very often in Chinese on-line chat when a person wants to say \"bye-bye\" to the other person.",
        "This can be explained as follows.",
        "In Chinese, the standard equivalent to \"bye-bye\" is whose PinYin is \"BaiBai\".",
        "Coincidentally, the PinYin of \"88\" is \"BaBa\".",
        "Because \"BaBa\" and \"BaiBai\" are near homophones, people often use \"88\" to represent either for input convenience or just for fun.",
        "The other relations in Table 1 are formed due to similar processes as will be described later.",
        "Due to the often substantial divergence between informal and formal text, a text-processing system trained on formal text does not typically work well on informal genres.",
        "For example, in a machine translation system (Koehn et al., 2007), if the bilingual training data does not contain the word \"M W\" (the second example in Table 1), it leaves the word untranslated.",
        "On the other hand, if the word \"M W\" does appear in the training data but it has only a translation \"gruel\" as that is the meaning in the formal text, the translation system may wrongly translate \"M W\" into \"gruel\" for the informal text where the word \"M W\" is more likely to mean \"like\".",
        "Therefore, as a text-normalization step, it is desirable to transform the informal text into its standard formal equivalent before feeding it into a general-purpose text-processing system.",
        "Unfortunately, there are many processes for generating informal expressions in common use today.",
        "Such transformations are highly flexible/diverse, and new phrases are invented on the Internet every day due to major news events, popular movies, TV shows, radio talks, political activities, and so on.",
        "Therefore, it is of great interest to have a data-driven method that can automatically find the relations between informal and formal expressions.",

        "In this section, we describe the phenomena and provide examples of the relations between formal and informal expressions in Chinese (we refer to the relation as formal-informal phrases hereafter, even in the case of single-word expressions).",
        "We manually collected 908 formal-informal relations, and classified these relations into four categories.",
        "We collected these pairs by investigating multiple webpages where the formal-informal relations are manually compiled, and then merged these seed relations and removed duplicates.",
        "In this way, the 908 examples should give good coverage on the typical categories in the formal-informal relations.",
        "Also, the distribution of the categories found in the 908 examples should be representative of the actual distribution of the formal-informal relations occurring in the real text.",
        "Table 2 presents these categories and examples in each category.",
        "In the last column, the table also shows the relative frequency of each category, computed based on the 908 examples.",
        "Recall that we represent Chinese words in the format: Chinese characters (optional PinYin equivalent in parentheses and optional English gloss in brackets).",
        "In general, a homophone is a word that is pronounced the same as another word but differs in meaning and/or written-form.",
        "Here, we use the word \"homophone\" in a loose way.",
        "In particular, we refer an informal phrase as a homophone of a formal phrase if its pronunciation is the same or similar to the formal phrase.",
        "In the three examples belonging to the homophone category in Table 2, the first example is a true homophone, while the other two are loose homophones.",
        "The third example represents a major subclass where the informal phrase is a number (e.g., 88).",
        "Informal Category",
        "For illustrative purposes, we can present the transformation path showing how the informal phrase is obtained from the formal phrase.",
        "In particular, the transformation path for this category is \"Formal – PinYin – Informal (similar or same PinYin as the formal phrase)\".",
        "A Chinese abbreviation of a formal phrase is obtained by selecting one or more characters from this formal phrase, and the selected characters can be at any position in the formal phrase (Li and Yarowsky, 2008; Lee, 2005; Yin, 1999).",
        "In comparison, an acronym is a special form of abbreviation, where only the first character of each word in the formal phrase is selected to form the informal phrase.",
        "Table 2 presents three examples belonging to this category.",
        "While the first example is an abbreviation, and the other two examples are acronyms.",
        "The transformation path for the second example is \"Formal – PinYin – Acronym\", and the transformation path for the third example is \"Formal – English – Acronym\".",
        "Clearly, they differ in whether PinYin or English is used as a bridge.",
        "A transliteration is transcribing a word or text written in one writing system into another writing system.",
        "Table 2 presents examples belonging to this category.",
        "In the first example, the Chinese informal phrase \"f&li. (FenSi)[a Chinese food]\" can be thought as a transliteration of the English phase \"fans\" as the pronunciation of \"fans\" is quite similar to the PinYin \"FenSi\".",
        "The transformation path for this category is \"Formal – English – Chinese Transliteration\".",
        "Due to the inherently informal and flexible nature of expressions in informal genre, the formation of an informal phrase can be very complex or ad-hoc.",
        "For example, an informal phrase can be generated by applying the above transformation rules jointly.",
        "More importantly, many relations cannot be described using a simple set of rules.",
        "Table 2 presents three such examples, where the first two examples are generated by applying rules jointly and the third example is created by decomposing the Chinese characters in the formal form.",
        "The statistics collected from the 904 examples tells us that about 45% of the relations belonging to this category.",

        "In this section, we describe an approach that automatically discovers the relation between a formal phrase and an informal phrase from web corpora.",
        "Specifically, we propose a bootstrapping procedure to identify a list of candidate informal phrases.",
        "Given a target informal phrase, we retrieve a large set of of instances in context from the Web, generate candidate hypotheses (i.e, candidate formal phrases) from the data, and rank the hypotheses by using a conditional log-linear model.",
        "The log-linear model is very flexible to incorporate both the rule-and datadriven intuitions (described in Sections 2 and 3, respectively) into the model as feature functions.",
        "Before finding the formal phrase corresponding to an informal phrase, we first need to identify informal phrases of interest.",
        "For example, one can collect informal phrases manually.",
        "However, this is too expensive as new relations between informal and formal phrases emerge every day on the Internet.",
        "Alternatively, one can employ a large amount of formal text (e.g., newswire) and informal text (e.g., Internet blogs) to derive such a list as follows.",
        "Specifically, from the informal corpus we can extract those phrases whose frequency in the informal corpus is significantly different from that in the formal corpus.",
        "However, such a list may be quite noisy, i.e., many of them are not informal phrases at all.",
        "An alternative approach to extracting the informal phrases is to use a bootstrapping algorithm (e.g., Yarowsky (1995)).",
        "Specifically, we first manually collect a small set of example relations.",
        "Then, using these relations as a seed set, we extract the text patterns (e.g., the definition pattern showing how the informal and formal phrases co-occur in the data as discussed in Section 3.1).",
        "With these patterns, we identify many more new relations from the data and augment them into the seed set.",
        "The procedure iterates.",
        "Using such an approach, we should be able to extract a large list of formal-informal relations.",
        "Clearly, the list extracted in this way may be quite noisy, and thus it is important to exploit both the data-and rule-driven intuitions to rank these relations properly.",
        "Given an informal phrase, we retrieve training data from the web on the fly.",
        "Specifically, we first use a search engine to identify a set of hyper-links that point to web pages containing contexts relevant to the informal phrase, and then follow the hyper-links to download the web pages.",
        "The input to the search engine is a text query.",
        "One can simply use the informal phrase as a query.",
        "However, this may lead to a set of pages that have nothing to do with the informal phrase.",
        "For example, if we search the informal phrase \"88\" (the third example in Table 2) using the well-known Chinese search engine www.baidu.com, none of the top-10 pages are related to the informal phrase \"88\".",
        "To avoid this situation, one can use a search engine that is dedicated to informal text search (e.g., blogsearch.baidu.com).",
        "Alternatively, one can use the general-purpose search engine but expanding the query with domain information.",
        "For example, for the informal phrase \"88\", we can use a query \"88 where means internet language.",
        "Given an informal phrase, we generate a set of hypotheses which are candidate formal phrases corresponding to the informal phrase.",
        "We considered two general approaches to the generation of hypotheses.",
        "Rule-driven Hypothesis Generation: One can use the rules described in Section 2 to generate a set of hypotheses.",
        "However, with this approach, one may generate an exponential number of hypotheses.",
        "For example, assuming the number of English words starting with a given letter is O(| V|), we can generate O(| V |n) hypotheses given an acronym containing n letters.",
        "Another problem with this approach is that a relation between an informal phrase and a formal phrase may not be explained by a specific rule.",
        "In fact, as shown in the last row of Table 2, such relations consist of 44.8% of all corpus instances.",
        "Data-driven Hypothesis Generation: With data retrieved from the Web, we can generate hypotheses by enumerating the frequent n-grams co-occurring with the informal phrase within certain distance.",
        "This exploits the data co-occurrence phenomena described in Section 3, that is, the formal phrase tends to co-occur with the informal phrase nearby in the data, for the multiple reasons described above.",
        "This can deal with the cases where the relation between an informal phrase and a formal phrase cannot be explained by a rule.",
        "However, it also suffers from the over-generation problem as in the rule-driven approach.",
        "In this paper, we use the data-driven method to generate hypotheses, and rank the hypotheses using a conditional log-linear model that incorporates both the rule and data intuitions as feature functions.",
        "Log-linear models are known for flexible incorporation of features into the model.",
        "Each feature function reflects a hint/intuition that can be used to rank the hypotheses.",
        "In this subsection, we develop a conditional log-linear model that incorporates both the rule and data intuitions as feature functions.",
        "Given an informal phrase (say x) and a candidate formal phrase (say y), the model assigns the pair a score (say s(x, y)), which will be used to rank the hypothesis y.",
        "The score s(x, y) is a linear combination of the feature scores (say $i(x, y)) over a set of feature functions indexed by i.",
        "Formally, where K is the number of feature functions defined and ai is the weight assigned to the i-th feature function (i.e., To learn the weight vector a, we first define a probability measure, where Z (x, a ) is a normalization constant.",
        "Now, we define the regularized log-likelihood (LLR) of the training data (i.e, a set of pairs of (x, y)), as follows, where N is the number of training examples, and the regularization term ^2 is a Gaussian prior with a variance a (Roark et al., 2007).",
        "The optimal weight vector a * is obtained by maximizing the regularized log-likelihood (LLR), that is, arg max LLR(a)",
        "To maximize the above function, we use a limited-memory variable method (Benson and More, 2002) that is implemented in the TAO package (Benson et al., 2002) and has been shown to be very effective in various natural language processing tasks (Malouf, 2002).",
        "During test time, the following decision rule is normally used to predict the optimal formal phrase y* for a given informal phrase x,",
        "arg max y s(x,y).",
        "As mentioned before, we incorporate both the rule-and data-driven intuitions as feature functions in the log-linear model.",
        "Rule-driven feature functions: Clearly, if a pair (x, y) matches the rule patterns described in Table 2, the pair has a high possibility to be a true formal-informal relation.",

        "• LD-PinYin(x, y): the Levenshtein distance on PinYin of x and y.",

        "Data-driven feature functions: As described in Section 3, the informal and formal phrases tends to co-occur in the data.",
        "Here, we develop several feature functions to reflect this intuition.",
        "• n-gram co-occurrence relative frequency: we collect the n-grams that occur in the data within a window of the occurrence of the informal phrase, and compute their relative frequency as feature values.",
        "Since different orders of grams will have quite different statistics, we define 7 features in this category: 1-gram, 2-gram, 3-gram, 4-gram, 5-gram, 6to10-gram, and 11to15-gram.",
        "Note that the order n of a n-gram is in terms of number of Chinese characters instead of words.",

        "• Features on the number of relevant web-pages: another interesting feature function can be defined as follows.",
        "For each candidate relation (x, y), we use the pair as a query to search the web, and treat the number of pages returned by the search engine as a feature value.",

        "Computing the top-N precision (instead of just computing the usual top-1 precision) is meaningful especially when we consider our relation extractor as an intermediate step in an end-to-end text-processing system (e.g., machine translation) since the final decision can be delayed to later stage based on more evidence.",

        "Moreover, the data-driven features are more helpful than the rule-driven features (e.g, 25.3% absolute improvement in 1-best precision), while the combination of these features does boost the performance of any individual feature set (e.g., 10.4% absolute improvement in 1-best precision over the case using data-driven features only).",

        "Automatically extracting the relations between full-form Chinese phrases and their abbreviations is an interesting and important task for many NLP applications (e.g., machine translation, information retrieval, etc.).",
        "Recently, Chang and Lai (2004), Lee (2005), Chang and Teng (2006), Li and Yarowsky (2008) have investigated this task.",
        "Specifically, Chang and Lai (2004) describes a hidden markov model (HMM) to model the relationship between a full-form phrase and its abbreviation, by treating the abbreviation as the observation and the full-form words as states in the model.",
        "Using a set of manually-created full-abbreviation relations as training data, they report experimental results on a recognition task (i.e., given an abbreviation, the task is to obtain its full-form, or the vice versa).",
        "Chang and Teng (2006) extends the work in Chang and Lai (2004) to automatically extract the relations between full-form phrases and their abbreviations, where both the full-form phrase and its abbreviation are not given.",
        "Clearly, the method in (Chang and Lai, 2004; Chang and Teng, 2006) is supervised because it requires the full-abbreviation relations as training data.",
        "Li and Yarowsky (2008) propose an unsupervised method to extract the relations between full-form phrases and their abbreviations.",
        "They exploit the data co-occurrence phenomena in the newswire text, as we have done in this paper.",
        "Moreover, they augment and improve a statistical machine translation by incorporating the extracted relations into the baseline translation system.",
        "Other interesting work that addresses a similar task as ours includes the work on homophones (e.g., Lee and Chen (1997)), abbreviations with their definitions (e.g., Park and Byrd (2001)), abbreviations and acronyms in the medical domain (Pakhomov, 2002), and transliteration (e.g., (Knight and Graehl, 1998; Virga and Khudanpur, 2003; Li et al., 2004; Wu and Chang, 2007)).",
        "While all the above work deals with the relations occurring within the formal text, we consider the formal-informal relations that occur across both formal and informal text, and we extract the relations from the web corpora, instead from just formal text.",
        "Moreover, our method is semi-supervised in the sense that the weights of the feature functions are tuned in a supervised log-linear model using a small number of seed relations while the generation and ranking of the hypotheses are unsupervised by exploiting the data co-occurrence phenomena."

    {
      "heading": "7. Conclusions",
      "text": [
        "In this paper, we have first presented a taxonomy of the formal-informal relations occurring in Chinese text.",
        "We have then proposed a novel method for discovering and modeling the relationship between informal Chinese expressions (including colloquialisms and instant-messaging slang) and their formal equivalents.",
        "Specifically, we have proposed a bootstrapping procedure to identify a list of candidate informal phrases in web corpora.",
        "Given an informal phrase, we retrieved contextual instances from the web using a search engine, generated hypotheses of formal equivalents via this data, and ranked the hypotheses using a conditional log-linear model.",
        "In the log-linear model, we incorporated as feature functions both rule-based intuitions and data cooccurrence phenomena (either as an explicit or indirect definition, or through formal/informal usages occurring in free variation in a discourse).",
        "We tested our system on manually collected test examples, and found that the (formal-informal) relationship discovery and extraction process using our method achieves an average 1-best precision of 62%.",
        "Given the ubiquity of informal conversational style on the internet, this work has clear applications for text normalization in text-processing systems including machine translation aspiring to broad coverage."
