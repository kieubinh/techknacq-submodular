        "Traditional supervised learning algorithms use whatever labeled data is provided to induce a model.",
        "By contrast, active learning gives the learner a degree of control by allowing it to select which instances are labeled and added to the training set.",
        "A typical active learner begins with a small labeled set L, selects one or more informative query instances from a large unlabeled pool U, learns from these labeled queries (which are then added to L), and repeats.",
        "In this way, the learner aims to achieve high accuracy with as little labeling effort as possible.",
        "Thus, active learning can be valuable in domains where unlabeled data are readily available, but obtaining training labels is expensive.",
        "Such is the case with many sequence labeling tasks in natural language domains.",
        "For example, part-of-speech tagging (Seung et al., 1992; Lafferty et al., 2001), information extraction (Scheffer et al., 2001; Sang and DeMeulder, 2003; Kim et al., 2004), and document segmentation (Carvalho and Cohen, 2004) are all typically treated as sequence labeling problems.",
        "The source data for these tasks (i.e., text documents in electronic form) are often easily obtained.",
        "However, due to the nature of sequence labeling tasks, annotating these texts can be rather tedious and time-consuming, making active learning an attractive technique.",
        "While there has been much work on active learning for classification (Cohn et al., 1994; McCallum and Nigam, 1998; Zhang and Oles, 2000; Zhu et al., 2003), active learning for sequence labeling has received considerably less attention.",
        "A few methods have been proposed, based mostly on the conventions of uncertainty sampling, where the learner queries the instance about which it has the least certainty (Scheffer et al., 2001; Culotta and McCallum, 2005; Kim et al., 2006), or query-by-committee, where a \"committee\" of models selects the instance about which its members most disagree (Dagan and Engelson, 1995).",
        "We provide more detail on these and the new strategies we propose in Section 3.",
        "The comparative effectiveness of these approaches, however, has not been studied.",
        "Furthermore, it has been suggested that uncertainty sampling and query-by-committee fail on occasion (Roy and McCallum, 2001; Zhu et al., 2003) by querying outliers, e.g., instances considered informative in isolation by the learner, but containing little information about the rest of the distribution of instances.",
        "Proposed methods for dealing with these shortcomings have so far only considered classification tasks.",

        "We also point out where we think these approaches may be flawed, and propose several novel query strategies to address these issues.",
        "One of the most common general frameworks for measuring informativeness is uncertainty sampling (Lewis and Catlett, 1994), where a learner queries the instance that it is most uncertain how to label.",
        "Culotta and McCallum (2005) employ a simple uncertainty-based strategy for sequence models called least confidence (LC):",
        "fLC(x) = 1 - P(yb|x; 6).",
        "Here, yb is the most likely label sequence, i.e., the Viterbi parse.",
        "This approach queries the instance for which the current model has the least confidence in its most likely labeling.",
        "For CRFs, this confidence can be calculated using the posterior probability given by Equation (1).",
        "Scheffer et al.",
        "(2001) propose another uncertainty strategy, which queries the instance with the smallest margin between the posteriors for its two most likely labelings.",
        "We call this approach margin (M):",
        "<<M(x) = -(P(yb|x; 6) - P(yb|x; 6)).",
        "Here, yb and yb are the first and second best label sequences, respectively.",
        "These can be efficiently computed using the N-best algorithm (Schwartz and Chow, 1990), a beam-search generalization of Viterbi, with N = 2.",
        "The minus sign in front is simply to ensure that <<fM acts as a maximizer for use with Algorithm 1.",
        "Another uncertainty-based measure of informativeness is entropy (Shannon, 1948).",
        "For a discrete random variable Y, the entropy is given by H (Y ) = - i P (Vi ) log P (y), and represents the information needed to \"encode\" the distribution of outcomes for Y.",
        "As such, is it often thought of as a measure of uncertainty in machine learning.",
        "In active learning, we wish to use the entropy of our model's posteriors over its labelings.",
        "One way this has been done with probabilistic sequence models is by computing what we call token entropy (TE):",
        "where is the length of x, m ranges over all possible token labels, and Pq(yt = m) is shorthand for the marginal probability that m is the label at position t in the sequence, according to the model.",
        "For CRFs and HMMs, these marginals can be efficiently computed using the forward and backward algorithms (Rabiner, 1989).",
        "The summed token entropies have typically been normalized by sequence length , to avoid simply querying longer sequences (Baldridge and Osborne, 2004; Hwa, 2004).",
        "However, we argue that querying long sequences should not be explicitly discouraged, if in fact they contain more information.",
        "Thus, we also propose the total token entropy (TTE) measure:",
        "ffTTE(x)= t x (TE(x).",
        "For most sequence labeling tasks, however, it is more appropriate to consider the entropy of the label sequence y as a whole, rather than some aggregate of individual token entropies.",
        "Thus an alternate query strategy is sequence entropy (SE):",
        "where y ranges over all possible label sequences for input sequence x.",
        "Note, however, that the number of possible labelings grows exponentially with the length of x.",
        "To make this feasible, previous work (Kim et al., 2006) has employed an approximation we call N-best sequence entropy (NSE):",
        "Given: Labeled set C, unlabeled pool U, query",
        "strategy <<(•), query batch size B",

        "For N = 2, this approximation is equivalent to f M, thus N-best sequence entropy can be thought of as a generalization of the margin approach.",
        "Recently, an efficient entropy calculation via dynamic programming was proposed for CRFs in the context of semi-supervised learning (Mann and Mc-Callum, 2007).",
        "We use this algorithm to compute the true sequence entropy (3) for active learning in a constant-time factor of Viterbi's complexity.",
        "Hwa (2004) employed a similar approach for active learning with probabilistic context-free grammars.",
        "Another general active learning framework is the query-by-committee (QBC) approach (Seung et al., 1992).",
        "In this setting, we use a committee of models C = {6(1),..., 6(C)} to represent C different hypotheses that are consistent with the labeled set C. The most informative query, then, is the instance over which the committee is in most disagreement about how to label.",
        "In particular, we use the query-by-bagging approach (Abe and Mamitsuka, 1998) to learn a committee of CRFs.",
        "In each round of active learning, C is sampled (with replacement) L times to create a unique, modified labeled set C(c).",
        "Each model 6(c) G C is then trained using its own corresponding labeled set C(c).",
        "To measure disagreement among committee members, we consider two alternatives.",
        "Dagan and Engelson (1995) introduced QBC with HMMs for part-of-speech tagging using a measure called vote entropy (VE):",
        "where V (yt, m) is the number of \"votes\" label m receives from all the committee member's Viterbi la-belings at sequence position t.",
        "McCallum and Nigam (1998) propose a QBC strategy for classification based on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, an information-theoretic measure of the difference between two probability distributions.",
        "The most informative query is considered to be the one with the largest average KL divergence between a committee member's posterior label distribution and the consensus.",
        "We modify this approach for sequence models by summing the average KL scores using the marginals at each token position and, as with vote entropy, normalizing for length.",
        "We call this approach Kullback-Leibler (KL):",
        "where (using shorthand again):",
        "D(6(c)||C) = £ Pe<.)",
        "(yt = m)log Pg-((Vt= ^ .",
        "Here Pc(yt = m) = C Ylc=i Pe(=) (v* = m), or the \"consensus\" marginal probability that m is the label at position t in the sequence.",
        "Both of these disagreement measures are normalized for sequence length T. As with token entropy (2), this may bias the learner toward querying shorter sequences.",
        "To study the effects of normalization, we also conduct experiments with non-normalized variants fTVE and fTKL.",
        "Additionally, we argue that these token-level disagreement measures may be less appropriate for most tasks than measuring the committee's disagreement about the label sequence y as a whole.",
        "Therefore, we propose sequence vote entropy (SVE):",
        "where NC is the union of the N-best parses from all models in the committee C, and P (y |x; C) = C YC=1 P(y |x; 6(c)), or the \"consensus\" posterior probability for some label sequence y.",
        "This can be thought of as a QBC generalization of N-best entropy, where each committee member casts a vote for the posterior label distribution.",
        "We also explore a sequence Kullback-Leibler (SKL) variant:",
        "A third general active learning framework we consider is to query the instance that would impart the greatest change to the current model ifwe knew its label.",
        "Since we train discriminative models like CRFs using gradient-based optimization, this involves querying the instance which, if labeled and added to the training set, would create the greatest change in the gradient of the objective function (i.e., the largest gradient vector used to re-estimate parameter values).",
        "Let V^(C; 6) be the gradient of the log-likelihood I with respect to the model parameters 6, as given by Sutton and McCallum (2006).",
        "Now let W(C+<x,y); 6) be the new gradient that would be obtained by adding the training tuple (x, y) to C. Since the query algorithm does not know the true label sequence y in advance, we instead calculate the expected gradient length (EGL):",
        "approximated as an expectation over the N-best la-belings, where | • | is the Euclidean norm of each resulting gradient vector.",
        "We first introduced this approach in previous work on multiple-instance active learning (Settles et al., 2008), and adapt it to query selection with sequences here.",
        "Note that, at query time, V^(C; 6) should be nearly zero since I converged at the previous round of training.",
        "Thus, we can approximate W(C+<x>y); 6) « W((x, y); 6) for computational efficiency, because the training instances are assumed to be independent.",
        "It has been suggested that uncertainty sampling and QBC are prone to querying outliers (Roy and Mc-Callum, 2001; Zhu et al., 2003).",
        "Figure 2 illustrates this problem for a binary linear classifier using uncertainty sampling.",
        "The least certain instance lies on the classification boundary, but is not \"representative\" of other instances in the distribution, so knowing its label is unlikely to improve accuracy on the data as a whole.",
        "QBC and EGL exhibit similar behavior, by spending time querying possible outliers simply because they are controversial, or are expected to impart significant change in the model.",
        "Figure 2: An illustration of when uncertainty sampling can be a poor strategy for classification.",
        "Shaded polygons represent labeled instances (C), and circles represent unlabeled instances (U).",
        "Since A is on the decision boundary, it will be queried as the most uncertain.",
        "However, querying B is likely to result in more information about the data as a whole.",
        "We argue that this phenomenon can occur with sequence labeling tasks as well as with classification.",
        "To address this, we propose a new active learning approach called information density (ID):",
        "That is, the informativeness of x is weighted by its average similarity to all other sequences in U, subject to a parameter ß that controls the relative importance of the density term.",
        "In the formulation presented above, sequence entropy f SE measures the \"base\" informativeness, but we could just as easily use any of the instance-level strategies presented in the previous sections.",
        "This density measure requires us to compute the similarity of two sequences.",
        "To do this, we first transform each x, which is a sequence of feature vectors (tokens), into a single kernel vector x:",
        "where fj (xt) is the value of feature fj for token xt, and J is the number of features in the input representation.",
        "In other words, sequence x is compressed into a fixed-length feature vector x, for which each element is the sum of the corresponding feature's values across all tokens.",
        "We can then use cosine similarity on this simplified representation:",
        "We have also investigated similarity functions based on exponentiated Euclidean distance and KL-divergence, the latter of which was also employed by McCallum and Nigam (1998) for density-weighting QBC in text classification.",
        "However, these measures show no improvement over cosine similarity, and require setting additional hyper-parameters.",
        "One potential drawback of information density is that the number of required similarity calculations grows quadratically with the number of instances in U.",
        "For pool-based active learning, we often assume that the size of U is very large.",
        "However, these densities only need to be computed once, and are independent of the base information measure.",
        "Thus, when employing information density in a real-world interactive learning setting, the density scores can simply be precomputed and cached for efficient lookup during the actual active learning process.",
        "We also introduce a query selection strategy for sequence models based on Fisher information, building on the theoretical framework of Zhang and Oles (2000).",
        "Fisher information I(6) represents the overall uncertainty about the estimated model parameters 6, as given by:",
        "I(6) = - x P(x) J P(y |x; 6)log P(y |x; 6).",
        "For a model with K parameters, the Fisher information takes the form of a K x K covariance matrix.",
        "Our goal in active learning is to select the query that most efficiently minimizes the model variance reflected in I(6).",
        "This can be accomplished by optimizing the Fisher information ratio (FIR):",
        "where Ix(6) and Iu(6) are Fisher information matrices for sequence x and the unlabeled pool U, respectively.",
        "The leading minus sign again ensures that <<fFIR is a maximizer for use with Algorithm 1.",
        "Previously, Fisher information for active learning has only been investigated in the context of simple binary classification.",
        "When employing FIR with sequence models like CRFs, there are two additional computational challenges.",
        "First, we must integrate over all possible labelings y, which can, as we have seen, be approximated as an expectation over the N-best labelings.",
        "Second, the inner product in the ratio calculation (4) requires inverting a K x K matrix for each x.",
        "In most interesting natural language applications, K is very large, making this algorithm intractable.",
        "However, it is common in similar situations to approximate the Fisher information matrix with its diagonal (Nyffenegger et al., 2006).",
        "Thus we estimate Ix(6) using:",
        "I\" (6) = ^E Ix(u) (6).",
        "For CRFs, the partial derivative at the root of each element in the diagonal vector is given by:",
        "which is similar to the equation used to compute the training gradient, but without a regularization term.",
        "A smoothing parameter 6 ^ 1 is added to prevent division by zero when computing the ratio.",
        "Notice that this method implicitly selects representative instances by favoring queries with Fisher information Ix(6) that is not only high, but similar to that of the overall data distribution Iu(6).",
        "This is in contrast to information density, which tries to query representative instances by explicitly modeling the distribution with a density weight."

        "In fact, the normalized variants are often inferior even to the baselines.",
        "While an argument can be made that these shorter sequences might be easier to label from a human annotator's perspective, our ongoing work indicates that the relationship between instance length and actual labeling costs (e.g., elapsed annotation time) is not a simple one.",
        "Analysis of our experiment logs also shows that length-normalized methods are occasionally biased toward short sequences with little intuitive value (e.g., sentences with few or no entities to label).",
        "In addition, vote entropy appears to be a better disagreement measure for QBC strategies than KL divergence.",
        "Finally, Fisher information (FIR), while theoretically sound, exhibits behavior that is difficult to interpret.",
        "It is sometimes the winning strategy, but occasionally only on par with the baselines.",
        "When it does show significant gains over the other strategies, these gains appear to be only for the first several queries (e.g., NLPBA and BioCreative in Figure 3).",
        "This inconsistent performance may be a result of the approximations made for computational efficiency.",
        "Expected gradient length (EGL) also appears to exhibit mediocre performance, and is likely not worth its additional computational expense.",
        "Here we discuss the execution times for each query strategy using current hardware.",
        "The uncertainty sampling methods are roughly comparable in run time (token-based methods run slightly faster), each routinely evaluating tens of thousands of sequences in under a minute.",
        "The QBC methods, on the other hand, must retrain multiple models with each query, resulting in a lag of three to four minutes per query batch (and up to 20 minutes for corpora with more entity labels).",
        "The expected gradient length and Fisher information methods are the most computationally expensive, because they must first perform inference over the possible labelings and then calculate gradients for each candidate label sequence.",
        "As a result, they take eight to ten minutes (upwards of a half hour on the larger corpora) for each query.",
        "Unlike the other strategies, their time complexities also scale linearly with the number of model parameters K which, in turn, increases as new sequences are added to L.",
        "As noted in Section 3.4, information density incurs a large computational cost to estimate the density weights, but these can be precomputed and cached for efficient lookup.",
        "In our experiments, this preprocessing step takes less than a minute for the smaller corpora, about a half hour for CoNLL-03 and BioCreative, and under two hours for NLPBA.",
        "The density lookup causes no significant change in the run time of the base information measure.",
        "Given these results, we advocate information density with an uncertainty sampling base measure in practice, particularly for active learning with large corpora."
