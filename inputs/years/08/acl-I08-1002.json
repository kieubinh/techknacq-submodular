        "Frequency of Substring with Reduction A linear algorithm was proposed in (Lii et al., 2004) to produce a list of such reduced substrings for a given corpus.",
        "The basic idea is that if two partially overlapped n-grams have the same frequency in the input corpus, then the shorter one is discarded as a redundant word candidate.",

        "Proper pruning of candidates with low goodness scores to enhance this quality enhances the segmentation performance significantly.",
