        "Such automatic discovering and threading could be quite valuable in many applications where people need timely and efficient access to large quantities of information.",
        "Supported by such technology, users could be alerted with new events and new information about known events.",
        "By examining one or two stories, users define the topic described in them.",
        "Then with TDT technologies they could go to a large archive, find all the stories about this topic, and learn how it evolved.",
        "Story link detection, as the core technology defined in TDT, is a task of determining whether two stories are about the same topic, or topically linked.",
        "In TDT, a topic is defined as \"something that happens at some specific time and place\" (Allan, 2002).",
        "Link detection is considered as the basis of other event-based TDT tasks, such as topic tracking, topic detection, and first story detection.",
        "Since story link detection focuses on the streams of news stories, it has its specific characteristic compared with the traditional Information Retrieval (IR) or Text Classification task: new topics usually come forth frequently during the procedure of the task, but nothing about them is known in advance.",
        "The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the procedure of story link detection; Section 3 introduces the related work in story link detection; Section 4 explains a baseline method which will be compared with the proposed dynamic method in Section 5; the experiment results and analysis are given in Section 6; finally, Section 7 concludes the paper."

        "One important issue in the vector model is weighting the individual terms (features) that occur in the vector.",

        "The tf shows how much a term represents the story, while the idf reflects the distinctive ability of distinguishing current story from others.",

        "We call this as incremental tf * idf weighting.",

      "text": [
        "Investigation on the TDT corpus shows that news stories are usually short, which makes that their representation models are too sparse to reflect topics described in them.",
        "A possible method of solving this problem is to extend stories with other related information.",
        "The information can be synonym in a dictionary, related documents in external corpora, etc.",
        "However, extending with synonym is mainly adding repetitious information, which can not define the topics more clearly.",
        "On the other hand, topic-based research should be real-sensitive.",
        "The corpora in the same period as the test corpora are not easy to gather, and the number of related documents in previous period is very few.",
        "So it is also not feasible to extend the stories with related documents in other corpora.",
        "We believe that it is more reasonable that the best extending information may be the story corpus itself.",
        "Following the TDT evaluation requirement, we will not use entire corpus at a time.",
        "Instead, when we process current pair of stories, we utilize all the stories before the current pair in the story corpus.",
        "In addition, topics described by stories usually evolve along with time.",
        "A topic usually begins with a seminal event.",
        "After that, it will focus mainly on the consequence of the event or other directly related events as the time goes.",
        "When the focus in later stories has changed, the words used in them may change remarkably.",
        "Keeping topic descriptions unchanged from the beginning to the end is obviously improper.",
        "So topic representation models should also be updated as the topic emphases in stories has changed.",
        "Formerly we have planed to use related information to extend a story to make up the information shortage in stories.",
        "Considering more about topic evolution, we extend a story with its latest related story.",
        "In addition, up to now almost all research in story link detection takes the hypothesis that whether two stories in one pair are topically linked is independent of that in another pair.",
        "But we realize that if two stories in a pair describe a same topic, one story can be taken as related information to extend another story in later pairs.",
        "Compared with extending with more than one story, extending only with its latest related story can keep representation of the topic as fresh as possible, and avoid extending too much similar information at the same time, which makes the length of the extended vector too long.",
        "Since the vector will be renormalized, a too big length means evidently decreasing the weight of an individual feature which will instead cause a lower cosine similarity.",
        "This idea has also been confirmed by the experiment showing that the performance extending with one latest related story is superior to that extending with more than one related story, as described in section 6.3.",
        "The experiment results also show that this method of dynamic information extending apparently improves the performance of story link detection.",
        "The proposed dynamic method is actually the baseline method plus dynamic information extending.",
        "The preprocessing, feature weighting and similarity computation in dynamic method are similar as those in baseline method.",
        "However, the vector representation for a story here is dynamic.",
        "This method needs a training corpus to get the extending threshold deciding whether a story should be used to extend another story in a pair.",

        "But topically link threshold is also necessary to be properly defined to approach a better performance.",

        "Whenever a story has an extending story, its vector representation will update to include the extending information.",
        "Having the extending method, the representation model can have more information to describe the topic in a story and make the topic evolve along with time.",
        "The dynamic method can define topic description clearer and get a more accurate similarity between stories.",
        "In the dynamic method, we have tried two ways for the generation of dynamic vector models: increment model and average model.",
        "Supposing we use vector model M1 = {(f1i,w1i),i > 1} of story s1 to extend vector model M2 = {(f2i, w2i), i > 1} ofstory s2, M2 will change to representing the latest evolving topic described in current story after extending.",

        "This dynamic model will take account of all information in M1 .",
        "So the difference between those two dynamic models is the weight recalculation method of the feature occurred in both M1 and M2.",

        "Story link detection is a key technique in TDT research.",
        "Though many approaches have been tried, there are still some characters ignored.",
        "After analyzing the characters and deficiency in TDT stories and story link detection, this paper presents a method of dynamic information extending to improve the system performance by focus on two problems: information deficiency and topic evolution.",
        "The experiment results indicate that this method can effectively improve the performance on both miss and false alarm rates, especially the later one.",
        "However, we should realize that there are still some problems to solve in story link detection.",
        "How to compare general topically linked stories and how to compare stories describing a TDT topic from different angles will be very vital to improve system performance.",
        "The next work will focus on mining more and deeper useful information in TDT stories and exploiting more proper models to represent them.",
