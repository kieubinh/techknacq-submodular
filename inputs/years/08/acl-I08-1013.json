        "Current research in the automatic compilation of bilingual dictionaries from corpora uses ofcompara-ble corpora.",
        "Comparable corpora gather texts sharing common features (domain, topic, genre, discourse) without having a source text-target text relationship.",
        "They are considered by human translators more trustworthy than parallel corpora (Bowker and Pearson, 2002).",
        "Moreover, they are available for any written languages and not only for pairs of languages involving English.",
        "The compilation of specialized dictionaries should take into account multiword terms (MWTs) that are more precise and specific to a particular scientific domain than singleword terms (SWTs).",
        "The standard approach is based on lexical context analysis and relies on the simple observation that a SWT or a MWT and its translation tend to appear in the same lexical contexts.",
        "Correct results are obtained for SWTs with an accuracy of about 80% for the top 10-20 proposed candidates using large comparable corpora (Fung, 1998; Rapp, 1999; Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002) or 60% using small comparable corpora (Dejean and Gaussier, 2002).",
        "In comparison, the results obtained for MWTs are disappointing.",
        "For instance, (Morin et al., 2007) have achieved 30% and 42% precision for the top 10 and top 20 candidates in a 0.84 million-word French-Japanese corpus.",
        "These results could be explained by the low frequency of MWTs compared to SWTs, by the lack of parallelism between the source and the target MWT extraction systems, and by the low performance of the alignment program.",
        "For SWTs, the process is in two steps: looking in a dictionary, and if no direct translation is available, starting the contextual analysis.",
        "Looking in the dictionary gives low results for MWTs: 1% compared to 30% for French and 20% for Japanese SWTs (Morin and Daille, 2006).",
        "To extend the coverage of the bilingual dictionary, an intermediate step is added between looking in the dictionary and the contextual analysis that will propose several translation candidates to compare with the target MWTs.",
        "These candidate translations are obtained thanks to a compositional translation method (Melamed, 1997; Grefenstette, 1999).",
        "This method reveals some limits when MWTs in the source and the target languages do not share the same syntactic patterns.",
        "In this paper, we put forward an extended compositional method that bridges the gap between MWTs of different syntactic structures through morphological links.",
        "We experiment within this method of French-Japanese lexical alignment, using multilingual terminology mining chain made up of two terminology extraction systems; one in each language, and an alignment program.",
        "The term extraction systems are publicly available and both extract MWTs.",
        "The alignment program makes use of the direct context-vector approach (Fung, 1998; Rapp, 1999).",

        "5.",
        "The candidate translations of a lexical unit are the target lexical units closest to the translated context vector according to vector distance.",
        "In this approach, the translation of the lexical units of the context vectors (step 3 of the previous approach), which depends on the coverage ofthe bilingual dictionary vis-a-vis the corpus, is the most important step: the greater the number of elements translated in the context vector, the more discriminating the context vector in selecting translations in the target language.",
        "Since the lexical units refer to SWTs and MWTs, the dictionary must contain many entries which occur in the corpus.",
        "For SWTs, combining a general bilingual dictionary with a specialized bilingual dictionary or a multilingual thesaurus to translate context vectors ensures that much of their elements will be translated (Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002; Dejean et al., 2002).",
        "For a MWT to be translated, steps 3 to 5 could be avoided thanks to a compositional method that will propose several translation candidates to directly compare with the target MWTs identified in step 1.",
