        "In addition, existing work were mostly empirically motivated and derived.",

        "Automatic term recognition, also referred to as term extraction or terminology mining, is the process of extracting lexical units from text and filtering them for the purpose of identifying terms which characterise certain domains of interest.",
        "This process involves the determination of two factors: unithood and termhood.",
        "Unithood concerns with whether or not a sequence of words should be combined to form a more stable lexical unit.",
        "On the other hand, termhood measures the degree to which these stable lexical units are related to domain-specific concepts.",
        "Unithood is only relevant to complex terms (i.e. multi-word terms) while termhood (Wong et al., 2007a) deals with both simple terms (i.e. singleword terms) and complex terms.",
        "Recent reviews by (Wong et al., 2007b) show that existing research on unithood are mostly carried out as a prerequisite to the determination of termhood.",
        "As a result, there is only a small number of existing measures dedicated to determining unithood.",
        "Besides the lack of dedicated attention in this sub-field of term extraction, the existing measures are usually derived from term or document frequency, and are modified as per need.",
        "As such, the significance of the different weights that compose the measures usually assume an empirical viewpoint.",
        "Obviously, such methods are at most inspired by, but not derived from formal models (Kageura and Umino, 1996).",
        "The three objectives of this paper are (1) to separate the measurement of unithood from the determination of termhood, (2) to devise a probabilistically-derived measure which requires only one threshold for determining the unithood of word sequences using non-static textual resources, and (3) to demonstrate the superior performance of the new probabilistically-derived measure against existing empirical measures.",
        "In regards to the first objective, we will derive our probabilistic measure free from any influence of termhood determination.",
        "Following this, our unithood measure will be an independent tool that is applicable not only to term extraction, but many other tasks in information extraction and text mining.",
        "Concerning the second objective, we will devise our new measure, known as the Odds of Unithood (OU), which are derived using Bayes Theorem and founded on a few elementary probabilities.",
        "The probabilities are estimated using Google page counts in an attempt to eliminate problems related to the use of static corpora.",
        "Moreover, only one threshold, namely, OUT is required to control the functioning of OU.",
        "Regarding the third objective, we will compare our new OU against an existing empirically-derived measure called Unithood (UH) (Wong et al., 2007b) in terms of their precision, recall and accuracy.",
        "In Section 2, we provide a brief review on some of existing techniques for measuring unithood.",
        "In Section 3, we present our new probabilistic approach, the measures involved, and the theoretical and intuitive justification behind every aspect of our measures.",
        "In Section 4, we summarize some findings from our evaluations.",
        "Finally, we conclude this paper with an outlook to future work in Section 5."

        "Some of the most common measures of unithood include pointwise mutual information (MI) (Church and Hanks, 1990) and log-likelihood ratio (Dunning, 1994).",

        "The mutual information for two words a and b is defined as:",
        "where p(a) and p(b) are the probabilities of occurrence of a and b.",

        "Log-likelihood ratio attempts to quantify how much more likely one pair of words is to occur compared to the others.",
        "Despite its potential, \"How to apply this statistic measure to quantify structural dependency of a word sequence remains an interesting issue to explore.\"",
        "(Kit, 2002).",
        "(Seretan et al., 2004) tested mutual information, log-likelihood ratio and t-tests to examine the use of results from web search engines for determining the collocational strength of word pairs.",
        "However, no performance results were presented.",
        "(Wong et al., 2007b) presented a hybrid approach inspired by mutual information in Equation 1, and C-value in Equation 3.",
        "The authors employ Google page counts for the computation of statistical evidences to replace the use of frequencies obtained from static corpora.",
        "Using the page counts, the authors proposed a function known as Unithood (UH) for determining the mergeability of two lexical units ax and ay to produce a stable sequence of words s. The word sequences are organised as a set W = {s,ax,ay} where s = axbay is a term candidate, b can be any preposition, the coordinating conjunction \"and\" or an empty string, and ax and ay can either be noun phrases in the form Adj*N + or another s (i.e. defining a new s in terms of other s).",
        "The authors define UH as:",
        "> IDR\") 0 otherwise where MI+, MIIDT, IDR+ and IDR\" are thresholds for determining mergeability decisions, and MI(ax, ay) is the mutual information between ax and ay, while ID(ax, s), ID(ay, s) and IDR(ax, ay) are measures of lexical independence of ax and ay from s. For brevity, let z be either ax or ay, and the independence measure ID(z, s) is then defined as:",
        "if(nz > Us) otherwise where nz and ns is the Google page count for z and s respectively.",
        "On the other hand, IDR(ax, ay) = I^ia'^).",
        "Intuitively, UH(ax, ay) states that the two lexical units ax and ay can only be merged in two cases, namely, 1) if ax and ay has extremely high mutual information (i.e. higher than a certain threshold MI+), or 2) if ax and ay achieve average mutual information (i.e. within the acceptable range of two thresholds MI + and MI\") due to both of their extremely high independence (i.e. higher than the threshold IDt) from s.",
        "(Frantzi, 1997) proposed a measure known as Cvalue for extracting complex terms.",
        "The measure ID(ax,s) > IDt A ID (ay ,s) > IDt A IDR+ > IDR(ax,ay) is based upon the claim that a substring of a term candidate is a candidate itself given that it demonstrates adequate independence from the longer version it appears in.",
        "For example, \"E. coli food poisoning\", \"E. coli\" and \"foodpoisoning\" are acceptable as valid complex term candidates.",
        "However, \"E. coli food\" is not.",
        "Therefore, some measures are required to gauge the strength of word combinations to decide whether two word sequences should be merged or not.",
        "Given a word sequence a to be examined for unithood, the Cvalue is defined as:",
        "where \\a\\ is the number of words in a, La is the set of longer term candidates that contain a, 9 is the longest n-gram considered, fa is the frequency of occurrence of a, and a / La.",
        "While certain researchers (Kit, 2002) consider Cvalue as a termhood measure, others (Nakagawa and Mori, 2002) accept it as a measure for unithood.",
        "One can observe that longer candidates tend to gain higher weights due to the inclusion of log2 \\ a\\ in Equation 3.",
        "In addition, the weights computed using Equation 3 are purely dependent on the frequency of a.",
        "3 A Probabilistically-derived Measure for Unithood Determination",
        "We propose a probabilistically-derived measure for determining the unithood of word pairs (i.e. potential term candidates) extracted using the head-driven left-right filter (Wong, 2005; Wong et al., 2007b) and Stanford Parser (Klein and Manning, 2003).",
        "These word pairs will appear in the form of ( ax , ay) A with ax and ay located immediately next to each other (i.e. x + 1 = y), or separated by a preposition or coordinating conjunction \"and\" (i.e. x + 2 = y).",
        "Obviously, ax has to appear before ay in the sentence or in other words, x < y for all pairs where x and y are the word offsets produced by the Stanford Parser.",
        "The pairs in A will remain as potential term candidates until their unithood have been examined.",
        "Once the unithood of the pairs in A have been determined, they will be referred to as term candidates.",
        "Formally, the unithood of any two lexical units ax and ay can be defined as Definition 1 The unithood of two lexical units is the \"degree of strength or stability of syntagmatic combinations and collocations\" (Kageura and Umino, 1996) between them.",
        "It is obvious that the problem of measuring the unithood of any pair of words is the determination of their \"degree\" of collocational strength as mentioned in Definition 1.",
        "In practical terms, the \"degree\" mentioned above will provide us with a way to determine ifthe units ax and ay should be combined to form s, or left alone as separate units.",
        "The collocational strength of ax and ay that exceeds a certain threshold will demonstrate to us that s is able to form a stable unit and hence, a better term candidate than ax and ay separated.",
        "It is worth pointing that the size (i.e. number of words) of ax and ay is not limited to 1.",
        "For example, we can have ax = \"National Institute\", b=\"of\" and ay =\"Allergy and Infectious Diseases\".",
        "In addition, the size of ax and ay has no effect on the determination of their unithood using our approach.",
        "As we have discussed in Section 2, most of the conventional practices employ frequency of occurrence from local corpora, and some statistical tests or information-theoretic measures to determine the coupling strength between elements in W = { s, ax , ay} .",
        "Two of the main problems associated with such approaches are:",
        "• Data sparseness is a problem that is well-documented by many researchers (Keller et al., 2002).",
        "It is inherent to the use of local corpora that can lead to poor estimation of parameters or weights; and",
        "• Assumption of independence and normality of word distribution are two of the many problems in language modelling (Franz, 1997).",
        "While the independence assumption reduces text to simply a bag of words, the assumption of normal distribution of words will often lead to incorrect conclusions during statistical tests.",
        "As a general solution, we innovatively employ results from web search engines for use in a probabilistic framework for measuring unithood.",
        "As an attempt to address the first problem, we utilise page counts by Google for estimating the probability of occurrences of the lexical units in W.",
        "We consider the World Wide Web as a large general corpus and the Google search engine as a gateway for accessing the documents in the general corpus.",
        "Our choice of using Google to obtain the page count was merely motivated by its extensive coverage.",
        "In fact, it is possible to employ any search engines on the World Wide Web for this research.",
        "As for the second issue, we attempt to address the problem of determining the degree of collocational strength in terms of probabilities estimated using Google page count.",
        "We begin by defining the sample space, N as the set of all documents indexed by Google search engine.",
        "We can estimate the index size of Google, N using function words as predictors.",
        "Function words such as \"a\", \"is\" and \"with\", as opposed to content words, appear with frequencies that are relatively stable over many different genres.",
        "Next, we perform random draws (i.e. trial) of documents from N. For each lexical unit w € W, there will be a corresponding set of outcomes (i.e. events) from the draw.",
        "There will be three basic sets which are of interest to us:",
        "Definition 2 Basic events corresponding to each w € W :",
        "• X is the event that ax occurs in the document",
        "• Y is the event that ay occurs in the document",
        "• S is the event that s occurs in the document",
        "It should be obvious to the readers that since the documents in S have to contain all two units ax and ay, S is a subset of X n Y or S C X n Y.",
        "It is worth noting that even though S C X n Y, it is highly unlikely that S = X n Y since the two portions ax and ay may exist in the same document without being conjoined by b.",
        "Next, subscribing to the frequency interpretation of probability, we can obtain the probability of the events in Definition 2 in terms of Google page count:",
        "where nx, ny and ns is the page count returned as the result of Google search using the term [+\"ax \"], [+\"ay\"] and [+\"s\"], respectively.",
        "The pair of quotes that encapsulates the search terms is the phrase operator, while the character \"+\" is the required operator supported by the Google search engine.",
        "As discussed earlier, the independence assumption required by certain information-theoretic measures and other Bayesian approaches may not always be valid, especially when we are dealing with since the occurrences of ax and ay in documents are inevitably governed by some hidden variables and hence, not independent.",
        "Following this, we define the probabilities for two new sets which result from applying some set operations on the basic events in Definition 2:",
        "where nxy is the page count returned by Google for the search using [+\"ax \" +\"ay \"].",
        "Defining P (X n Y) in terms of observable page counts, rather than a combination of two independent events will allow us to avoid any unnecessary assumption of independence.",
        "Next, referring back to our main problem discussed in Definition 1, we are required to estimate the strength of collocation of the two units ax and ay.",
        "Since there is no standard metric for such measurement, we propose to address the problem from a probabilistic perspective.",
        "We introduce the probability that s is a stable lexical unit given the evidence s possesses:",
        "Definition 3 Probability of unithood:",
        "where U is the event that s is a stable lexical unit and E is the evidences belonging to s. P(U|E) is the posterior probability that s is a stable unit given the evidence E. P(U) is the prior probability that s is a unit without any evidence, and P(E) is the prior probability of evidences held by s. As we shall see later, these two prior probabilities will be immaterial in the final computation of unithood.",
        "Since s can either be a stable unit or not, we can state that, where U is the event that s is not a stable lexical unit.",
        "Since Odds = P/(1 – P), we multiply both sides of Definition 3 by (1 – P (U |E to obtain,",
        "By substituting Equation 6 in Equation 7 and later, applying the multiplication rule P (U |E )P (E) = P(E |U7)P(U) to it, we will obtain:",
        "We proceed to take the log of the odds in Equation 8 (i.e. logit) to get:",
        "While it is obvious that certain words tend to co-occur more frequently than others (i.e. idioms and collocations), such phenomena are largely arbitrary (Smadja, 1993).",
        "This makes the task of deciding on what constitutes an acceptable collocation difficult.",
        "The only way to objectively identify stable lexical units is through observations in samples of the language (e.g. text corpus) (McKeown and Radev, 2000).",
        "In other words, assigning the apri-ori probability of collocational strength without empirical evidence is both subjective and difficult.",
        "As such, we are left with the option to assume that the probability of s being a stable unit and not being a stable unit without evidence is the same (i.e. P(U) = P(U) = 0.5).",
        "As a result, the second term in Equation 9 evaluates to 0:",
        "We introduce a new measure for determining the odds of s being a stable unit known as Odds of Unit-hood (OU):",
        "Definition 4 Odds of unithood",
        "Assuming that the evidences in E are independent of one another, we can evaluate OU(s) in terms of:",
        "(a) The area with darker (b) The area with darker shade is the set X n Y \\ S. shade is the set S'.",
        "Comput-Computing the ratio of P (S) ing the ratio of P (S) and the and the probability of this area probability of this area (i.e. will give us the first evidence.",
        "P(S') = 1 – P(S)) will give us the second evidence.",
        "Figure 1: The probability of the areas with darker shade are the denominators required by the evidences e1 and e2 for the estimation of OU(s).",
        "where are individual evidences possessed by s.",
        "With the introduction of Definition 4, we can examine the degree of collocational strength of axand ay in forming s, mentioned in Definition 1 in terms of OU(s).",
        "With the base of the log in Definition 4 more than 1, the upper and lower bound of OU(s) would be +to and – to, respectively.",
        "OU(s) = +oo and OU(s) = – to corresponds to the highest and the lowest degree of stability of the two units ax and ay appearing as s, respectively.",
        "A high OU(s) would indicate the suitability for the two units ax and ay to be merged to form s. Ultimately, we have reduced the vague problem of the determination of unithood introduced in Definition 1 into a practical and computable solution in Definition 4.",
        "The evidences that we propose to employ for determining unithood are based on the occurrences of s, or the event S if the readers recall from Definition 2.",
        "We are interested in two types of occurrences of s, namely, the occurrence of s given that ax and ay have already occurred or X n Y, and the occurrence of s as it is in our sample space, N. We refer to the first evidence e1 as local occurrence, while the second one e2 as global occurrence.",
        "We will discuss the intuitive justification behind each type of occurrences.",
        "Each evidence captures the occurrences of s within a different confinement.",
        "We will estimate these evidences in terms of the elementary probabilities already defined in Equations 4 and 5.",
        "The first evidence e1 captures the probability of occurrences of s within the confinement of ax and ay or Xn Y.",
        "As such, P(e11U) can be interpreted as the probability of s occurring within X n Y as a stable unit or P(S|X n Y).",
        "On the other hand, P(e1|U7) captures the probability of s occurring in X n Y not as a unit.",
        "In other words, P(e1|U7) is the probability of s not occurring in X n Y, or equivalently, equal to P((X n Y \\ S)|(X n Y)).",
        "The set X n Y \\ S is shown as the area with darker shade in Figure 1(a).",
        "Let us define the odds based on the first evidence as:",
        "and since s ç (x n y) and (x n y \\ s) ç (x n y), units ax and ay is attributable to s. Referring back to Ol, whenever the denominator P(X n Y \\ S) becomes less than P(S), we can deduce that ax and ay actually exist together as s more than in other forms.",
        "At one extreme when P(X n Y \\ S) = 0, we can conclude that the co-occurrence of ax and ay is exclusively for s. As such, we can also refer to OL as a measure of exclusivity for the use of ax and ay with respect to s. This first evidence is a good indication for the unithood of s since the more the existence of ax and ay is attributed to s, the stronger the collocational strength of s becomes.",
        "Concerning the second evidence, OG attempts to capture the extent to which s occurs in general usage (i.e. World Wide Web).",
        "We can consider OG as a measure of pervasiveness for the use of s. As s becomes more widely used in text, the numerator in OG will increase.",
        "This provides a good indication on the unit-hood of s since the more s appears in usage, the likelier it becomes that s is a stable unit instead of an occurrence by chance when ax and ay are located next to each other.",
        "As a result, the derivation of OU(s) using OL and OG will ensure a comprehensive way of determining unithood.",
        "Finally, expanding OU(s) in Equation 11 using Equations 12 and 13 will give us:",
        "and Ol = 1 if P(X n Y \\ S) = 0.",
        "The second evidence e2 captures the probability of occurrences of s without confinement.",
        "If s is a stable unit, then its probability of occurrence in the sample space would simply be P(S).",
        "On the other hand, if s occurs not as a unit, then its probability of non-occurrence is 1 – P (S).",
        "The complement of S, which is the set S' is shown as the area with darker shade in Figure 1(b).",
        "Let us define the odds based on the second evidence as:",

        "As such, the decision on whether ax and ay should be merged to form s can be made based solely on the Odds ofUnithood (OU) defined in Equation 14.",

        "OU is derived using Bayes Theorem and is founded upon two evidences, namely, local occurrence and global occurrence.",
        "Elementary probabilities estimated using page counts from the Google search engine are utilised to quantify the two evidences.",
        "The new probabilistically-derived measure OU is then evaluated against an existing empirical function known as Unithood (UH).",
        "Our new measure OU achieved a precision and a recall of 100% and 95.83% respectively, with an accuracy at 97.26% in measuring the unithood of 1,825 test cases.",
        "OU outperformed UH by 2.63%, 3.33% and 2.74% in terms of precision, recall and accuracy, respectively.",
        "Moreover, our new measure requires only one threshold, as compared to five in UH to control the mergeability decision.",
        "More work is required to establish the coverage and the depth of the World Wide Web with regards to the determination of unithood.",
        "While the Web has demonstrated reasonable strength in handling general news articles, we have yet to study its appropriateness in dealing with unithood determination for technical text (i.e. the depth of the Web).",
        "Similarly, it remains a question the extent to which the Web is able to satisfy the requirement of unithood determination for a wider range of genres (i.e. the coverage of the Web).",
        "Studies on the effect of noises (e.g. keyword spamming) and multiple word senses on unithood determination using the Web is another future research direction.",
