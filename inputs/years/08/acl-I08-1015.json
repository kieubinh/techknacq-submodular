        "Text data usually contains complex semantic information which is communicated using a combination of words.",
        "Ideally, the representation used should capture and reflect this fact in order to semantically drive the clustering algorithm and obtain better results.",
        "The Bag of Words (BoW) (Salton et al., 1975) scheme is a very popular scheme which has been used for representing documents.",
        "But, this scheme ignores many of the linguistic and semantic features contained in text documents.",
        "This paper explores an alternative representation for documents, using lexical chains, which encodes some of the semantic information contained in the document.",
        "This representation results in improved performance on the clustering tasks and achieves a drastic reduction in the size of the feature space as well.",
        "The BoW scheme was originally designed for the Information Retrieval domain (Salton, 1989) where the aim was to 'index' the document and not necessarily to model the topic distribution.",
        "This representation has since been adopted as the defacto document representation scheme for supervised and unsupervised learning on documents.",
        "The BoW scheme represents features as an unordered set of words contained in the document, along with their frequency count.",
        "The BoW scheme assumes that the distribution of words in a document reflect the underlying distribution of topics and hence if the documents are grouped on the basis of the similarity of the words contained in them, it will implicitly result in a clustering based on topics.",
        "This representation, using a simple frequency count alone, does not capture all the underlying information present in the documents.",
        "Moreover, it ignores information such as position, relations and co-occurrences among the words.",
        "In addition, the feature space formed will be very huge and sparse resulting in time and space costs as well.",
        "Lexical Chaining is a technique which seeks to identify and exploit the semantic relatedness of words in a document.",
        "It is based on the phenomenon of lexical cohesion (Halliday and Hasan, 1976) and works on the premise that semantically related words co-occur close together in a passage more than \"just by chance\".",
        "Lexical chaining is the process of identifying and grouping such words together to form chains which in turn will help in identifying and representing the topic and content of the document.",
        "Lexical chains have been used as an intermediate representation of text for various tasks such as automatic text summarisation (Barzilay and Elhadad, 1997; Silber and McCoy, 2002), malapropism detection and correction (Hirst and St-Onge, 1997), and hypertext construction (Green, 1998).",
        "An algorithm for computing lexical chains was first given by (Morris and Hirst, 1991) using the Roget's Thesaurus (Kirkpatrick, 1998).",
        "Since an electronic version of the Roget's Thesaurus was not available then, later algorithms were based on the WordNet lexical database (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "We present here a two pass algorithm to compute a representation of documents using lexical chains and use these lexical chains to derive feature vectors.",
        "These lexical chain based feature vectors are used to cluster the documents using two different algorithms - k-Means and Co-clustering.",
        "k-Means is a well studied clustering algorithm widely used in the text domain.",
        "Co-clustering, also known as bi-clustering (Madeira and Oliveira, 2004), is a clustering approach which was developed in the bioinformatics domain for clustering gene expressions.",
        "Since the text domain shares a lot of characteristics (high dimensionality, sparsity, etc.)",
        "of gene expression data, a lot of interest has been generated recently in applying the co-clustering approaches (Dhillon et al., 2003) to the text domain with promising results.",
        "Co-clustering (Dhillon etal., 2003; Sra et al., 2004) exploits the duality between rows and columns of the document-term matrix used to represent the features, by simultaneously clustering both the rows and columns.",
