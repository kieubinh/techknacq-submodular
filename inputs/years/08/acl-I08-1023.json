        "Users will be frustrated if a search engine fails to perform such service and turn to other search engines to get access to news reports.",
        "In order to satisfy the users' Liyun Ru",
        "Sohu Inc. R&D center needs, many search engines, including Google and Yahoo!, provide special channels for news retrieval and their web crawlers have to download newly appeared pages as soon as possible.",
        "However, the web is growing exponentially.",
        "The amount of new pages emerging every week is 8% of the whole web[Ntoulas et al., 2004].",
        "It is almost impossible to download all novel pages in time.",
        "Only a small proportion of novel pages are temporal.",
        "They report recent events and should be downloaded immediately, others which are untemporal can be downloaded later when it is convenient.",
        "So many search engines have different types of web crawlers to download the web with different policies.",
        "A common crawler checks updates of existing pages and crawls untemporal novel pages of all kinds of web sites with a relatively low frequency, usually once a month.",
        "Common crawlers are widely adopted by most search engines, but they are not suitable for news web sites which produce a great amount of pages every day.",
        "To news pages, there will be a large gap between their publication time and downloading time.",
        "Users can not get access to news pages in time.",
        "Thus another kind of crawler called instant crawler is developed.",
        "This crawler only focuses on temporal novel pages and checks updates of news web sites with much smaller intervals.",

        "A relatively small set of web sites which provide news reporting services collectively generate many temporal web pages.",
        "These sites are valuable for instant crawlers and can be identified with web pages they previously generated.",
        "If a large proportion of web pages in a site are temporal, it is probable that pages published later from this the site will be temporal.",

        "What is more, this manually generated list is not sensitive to emerging and disappearing news sites.",
        "In this paper, we propose a method to separate temporal pages from untemporal ones based on user behavior analysis in page-view data.",
        "Temporal web page identification is the prerequisite for temporal web site identification.",
        "A web site is temporal if most pages it publishes are temporal and most of its page-views are received from temporal pages.",
        "Then all web sites are ranked according to how temporal they are.",
        "Web sites ranked at a high position are included in the seed list for instant crawlers.",
        "Instant crawlers can focus on web sites in the list and only download pages from these web sites.",
        "Such a list covers a large proportion of temporal pages with only a small overhead of untemporal pages.",
        "The result is mined from web user behavior log, which reflects users' preference and avoids subjectivity of crawler administrators.",
        "Additionally, there are web sites associated with special events, such as Olympic Games.",
        "These web sites are temporal only when Olympic Games are being held.",
        "User behavior data can reflect the appearance and disappearance of temporal web sites.",
        "An outline for the rest of the paper is as follows: Section 2 introduces earlier research in the evolution and discoverability of the web; Section 3 presents the user interest modal to describe web page lifetime from web users' perspective, then gives the definition of temporal web pages based on this model; Section 4 provides a method to generate a seed list for instant crawlers, and its result is also evaluated in the section; Section 5 discusses some alternatives in the experiment; Section 6 is the conclusion of this paper and suggests some possible directions in our future work."

        "There are three advantages of using user interest curves instead of raw page-view data.",
        "First, the number of page views is determined by the amount of user interest a page receives, but they do not strictly equal.",
        "Page view data is affected by many random factors, such as whether it is weekday or weekend.",
        "These random factors are called \"noise\" in general.",
        "Such noise can influence the number of page views, but it is not the determinant factor.",
        "The number of page views is centered on the amount of user interest and fluctuate around it, because page view data is a combination of user interest and the noise.",
        "User interest curves are less bothered by such noise since the noise is effectively eliminated after data fitting.",
        "Second, although the observing window is two months wide, which is wide enough to cover lifetime of most temporal web pages, there are still many temporal ones whose lifetime is across the observing window boundaries.",
        "Such fragmented page view records will bring in mistakes in identifying temporal web pages.",
        "But if most part of the lifetime of a web page lies in the observing window, the data fitting process is able to estimate the absent page-view data and make up the missing part of user interest curve of its whole lifetime.",
        "So the effects brought by cross-boundary web pages can be reduced.",
        "Third, user interest curve is continuous and can be integrated to show the accumulated user interest to the page in a period of time.",
        "In our experiment, we used a single threshold n and q (see Section 5) and a page is classified as a temporal one if the user interest it accumulates during n days after its birth is greater than q.",
        "But web users receive different types of news at different speed.",
        "We notice that financial, entertainment, political and military news gets through users rapidly.",
        "These kinds of news become obsolescent to users quickly, usually only a few minutes or hours after they are published.",
        "So web pages reporting such news are ephemeral and they can draw users' attention only in a short period after their birth.",
        "In contrast, it takes much more time for users to know other kinds of news.",
        "For example, a web page reporting a volcano eruption far away from users may not be so attractive and has to spend much more time to accumulate the specific proportion of user interest.",
        "So maybe it is necessary to give different thresholds for different types of news.",
        "In our experiment, we choose values of n and p in order to get the maximized hit (see Section 5).",
        "Some web crawlers may have abundant network bandwidth and want lower miss.",
        "Other crawlers whose network bandwidth is very limited are untolerant with false alarm.",
        "So the result of temporal page classification can be evaluated by linear combination with different weights Performance = A X hit - B X miss - C X false alarm",
        "Values of A, B and C can be determined according to the capacity of s crawlers.",
        "Whether a web site is temporal is determined by the proportion of its temporal pages and the proportion of its page views received from temporal pages.",
        "The two proportions are combined with different weights a and P in order to get maximized F-Measure (see Section 6).",
        "However, to some extent, the measure of page-view proportion is misleading, because a hot event which receives a great deal of user attention is usually reported by several news agencies.",
        "It is of little value to download redundant reports from different web sites although they get many page views.",
        "Page-view data discriminates against pages reporting events which receive little attention.",
        "Most of these pages cannot be replaced by others because they are usually the only page reporting such events.",
        "Whether these pages can be correctly retrieved influence user experience greatly.",
        "Users often judge a search engine by whether the pages receiving low attention can be recalled.",
        "So the temporal page proportion should be assigned with additional weight to avoid such bias."
