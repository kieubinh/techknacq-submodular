        "As the amount of information created by human beings is explosively grown in the last decade (University of California, 2003), it is getting extremely harder to obtain necessary information by conventional information access methods, i.e., Web search engines.",
        "This is obvious from the fact that knowledge workers now spend about 30% of their day on only searching for information (The Delphi Group White Paper, 2001).",
        "Hence, creation of drastically new technology is needed by integrating several disciplines such as natural language processing (NLP), information retrieval (IR) and others.",
        "Conventional search engines such as Google and Yahoo!",
        "are insufficient to search necessary information from the current Web.",
        "The problems of the conventional search engines are summarized as follows:",
        "Cannot accept queries by natural language sentences: Search engine users have to represent their needs by a list of words.",
        "This means that search engine users cannot obtain necessary information if they fail to represent their needs into a proper word list.",
        "This is a serious problem for users who do not utilize a search engine frequently.",
        "Cannot provide organized search results: A search result is a simple list consisting of URLs, titles and snippets of web pages.",
        "This type of result presentation is obviously insufficient considering explosive growth and diversity of web pages.",
        "Cannot handle synonymous expressions: Existing search engines ignore a synonymous expression problem.",
        "Especially, since Japanese uses three kinds of alphabets, Hiragana, Katakana and Kanji, this problem is more serious.",
        "For instance, although both Japanese words \" £ Hfe\" and mean child, the search engines provide quite different search results for each word.",
        "We believe that new IR systems that overcome the above problems give us more flexible and comfortable information access and that development of such systems is an important and interesting research topic.",
        "To develop such IR systems, a search engine infrastructure that plays a low-level layer role (i.e., retrieving web pages according to a user's query from a huge web page collection) is required.",
        "The Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) provided by commercial search engines can be regarded as such search engine infrastructures.",
        "The APIs, however, have the following problems:",
        "1.",
        "The number of API calls a day and the number of web pages included in a search result are limited.",
        "2.",
        "The API users cannot know how the acquired web pages are ranked because the ranking measure of web pages has not been made public.",
        "3.",
        "It is difficult to reproduce previously-obtained search results via the APIs because search engine's indices are updated frequently.",
        "These problems are an obstacle to develop new IR systems using existing search engine APIs.",
        "The research project \"Cyber Infrastructure for the Information-explosion Era\" gives researchers several kinds of shared platforms and sophisticated tools, such as an open search engine infrastructure, considerable computational environment and a grid shell software (Kaneda et al., 2002), for creation of drastically new IR technology.",
        "In this paper, we describe an open search engine infrastructure TSUB-AKI, which is one of the shared platforms developed in the Cyber Infrastructure for the Informationexplosion Era project.",
        "The overview of TSUB AKI is depicted in Figure 1.",
        "TSUB AKI is built on a highperformance computing environment consisting of 128 CPU cores and 100 tera-byte storages, and it can provide users with search results retrieved from approximately 100 million Japanese web pages.",
        "The mission of TSUBAKI is to help the development of new information access methodology which solves the problems of conventional information access methods.",
        "This is achieved by the following TSUBAKI's characteristics:",
        "API without any restriction: TSUB AKI provides its API without any restrictions such as the limited number of API calls a day and the number of results returned from an API per query, which are the typical restrictions of the existing search engine APIs.",
        "Consequently, TSUBAKI API users can develop systems that handle a large number of web pages.",
        "This feature is important for dealing with the Web that has the long tail aspect.",
        "Transparent and reproducible search results:",
        "TSUBAKI makes public not only its ranking measure but also its source codes, and also provides reproducible search results by fixing a crawled web page collection.",
        "Because of this, TSUBAKI keeps its architecture transparency, and systems using the API can always obtain previously-produced search results.",
        "Web standard format for sharing preprocessed web pages: TSUBAKI converts a crawled web page into a web standard format data.",
        "The web standard format is a data format used in TSUBAKI for sharing preprocessed web pages.",
        "Section 2 presents the web standard format in detail.",
        "Indices generated by deep NLP: TSUBAKI indexes all crawled web pages by not only words but also dependency relations for retrieving web pages according to the meaning of their contents.",
        "The index data in TSUBAKI are described in Section 3.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",

        "In the remainder of this section, we describe a web standard format used in TSUBAKI for sharing preprocessed web pages and construction of a large scale web standard format data collection.",
        "The web standard format is a simple XML-styled data format in which meta-information and textinformation of a web page can be annotated.",

        "Extracted sentences are enclosed by <RawString> tags, and the analyzed results of the sentences are enclosed by <Annotation> tags.",
        "Sentences in a web page and their analyzed results can be obtained by looking at these tags in the standard format data corresponding to the page.",
        "We have crawled 218 million web pages over three months, May - July in 2007, by using the Shim-Crawler, and then converted these pages into web standard format data with results of a Japanese parser, KNP (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994), through our conversion tools.",
        "Note that this web page collection consists of pages written not only in Japanese but also in other languages.",

        "Handling of synonymous expressions is a crucial problem in IR.",
        "Especially, since Japanese uses three kinds of alphabets, Hiragana, Katakana and Kanji, spelling variation is a big obstacle.",

        "Japanese.",
        "Although these spellings mean child, existing search engines handle them in totally different manner.",
        "Handling of spelling variations is important for improving search engine performance.",
        "To handle spelling variations properly, TSUBAKI exploits results of JUMAN (Kurohashi et al., 1994), a Japanese morphological analyzer.",
        "JUMAN segments a sentence into words, and gives representative forms of the words simultaneously.",
        "For example, JUMAN gives us \"^HS\" as a representative form of the words \" CHfe \", H \" and TSUBAKI indexes web pages by word representative forms.",
        "This allows us to retrieve web pages that include different spellings of the queries.",
        "TSUBAKI also indexes word positions for providing search methods such as an exact phrase search.",
        "A word position reflects the number of words appearing before the word in a web page.",

        "The understanding of web page contents is crucial for obtaining necessary information from the Web.",
        "The word frequency and link structure have been used as clues for conventional web page retrieval.",

        "S1: Japan exports automobiles to Germany.",
        "S2: Germany exports automobiles to Japan.",
        "Although the above sentences have different meanings, they consist of the same words.",
        "This means that a word index alone can never distinguish the semantic difference between these sentences.",
        "On the other hand, syntactic parsers can produce different dependency relations for each sentence.",
        "Thus, the difference between these sentences can be grasped by looking at their dependency relations.",
        "We expect that dependency relations work as efficient clues for understanding web page contents.",
        "As a first step toward web page retrieval considering the meaning of web page contents, TSUBAKI indexes web pages by not only words but also dependency relations.",
