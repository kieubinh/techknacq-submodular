        "Based on the progress of spoken language processing, the main target ofspeech processing has shifted from speech recognition to speech understanding.",
        "Since speech-based information retrieval (IR) must extract user intention from speech queries, it is thus a typical speech understanding task.",
        "IR typically searches for appropriate documents such as newspaper articles or Web pages using statistical matching for a given query.",
        "To define the similarity between a query and documents, the word vector space model or \"bag-of-words\" model is widely adopted, and such statistics as the TF-IDF measure are introduced to consider the significance of words in the matching.",
        "Therefore, when using automatic speech recognition (ASR) as a front-end of such IR systems, the significance of the words should be considered in ASR; words that greatly affect IR performance must be detected with higher priority.",
        "Based on such a background, ASR evaluation should be done from the viewpoint of the quality of mis-recognized words instead of quantity.",
        "From this point of view, word error rate (WER), which is the most widely used evaluation measure of ASR accuracy, is not an appropriate evaluation measure when we want to use ASR systems for IR because all words are treated identically in WER.",
        "Instead of WER, weighted WER (WWER), which considers the significance of words from a viewpoint of IR, has been proposed as an evaluation measure for ASR.",
        "Nanjo et.al showed that the ASR based on the Minimum Bayes-Risk framework could reduce WWER and the WWER reduction was effective for key-sentence indexing and IR (H.Nanjo et al., 2005).",
        "To exploit ASR which minimizes WWER for IR, we should appropriately define weights of words.",
        "Ideal weights would give a WWER equivalent to IR performance degradation when a corresponding ASR result is used as a query for the IR system.",
        "After obtaining such weights, we can predict IR degradation by simply evaluating ASR accuracy, and thus, minimum WWER decoding (ASR) will be the most effective for IR.",
        "For well-defined IRs such as relational database retrieval (E.Levin et al., 2000), significant words (=keywords) are obvious.",
        "On the contrary, determining significant words for more general IR task (T.Misu et al., 2004) (C.Hori et al., 2003) is not easy.",
        "Moreover, even if significant words are given, the weight of each word is not clear.",
        "To properly and easily integrate the ASR system into an IR system, the weights of words should be determined automatically.",
        "Conventionally, they are determined by an experienced system designer.",
        "Actually, in conventional studies of minimum WWER decoding for key-sentence indexing (H.Nanjo and T.Kawahara, 2005) and IR (H.Nanjo et al., 2005), weights were defined based on TF-IDF values used in back-end indexing or IR systems.",
        "These values reflect word significance for IR, but are used without having been proven suitable for IR-oriented ASR.",

        "Figure 2 shows the correlations between WER and IRDR.",
        "Correlation coefficient between both is 0.119.",
        "WER is not correlated with IRDR.",
        "Since our IR system only uses the statistics of nouns, WER is not an appropriate evaluation measure for IR.",

        "Figure 3 shows the correlations between KER and IRDR.",
        "Although IRDR is more correlated with KER than WER, KER is not significantly correlated with IRDR (correlation coefficient: 0.224).",
        "Thus, KER is not a suitable evaluation measure of ASR for IR.",
        "This fact shows that each keyword has a different influence on IR and should be given a different weight based on its influence on IR.",
        "In ASR for IR, since some words are significant, each word should have a different weight.",

        "Using the same test data (107 queries), keyword weights were estimated with the proposed estimation method.",
        "The correlation between IRDR and WKER calculated with the estimated word weights is shown in Figure 4.",
        "A high correlation between IRDR and WKER is confirmed (correlation coefficient: 0.969).",
        "The result shows that the proposed method works well and proves that giving a different weight to each word is significant.",
        "The proposed method enables us to extend textbased IR systems to speech-based IR systems with typical text queries for the IR system, ASR results of the queries, and answer sets for each query.",
        "ASR results are not necessary since they can be substituted with simulated texts that can be automatically generated by replacing some words with others.",
        "On the contrary, text queries and answer sets are indispensable and must be prepared.",
        "It costs too much to make answer sets manually since we should consider whether each answer is relevant to the query.",

        "In this section, we discuss the problem of word weight estimation.",
        "Although we obtained high correlation between IRDR and KWER, the estimation may encounter the over-fitting problem when we use small estimation data.",
        "When we want to design a speech-based IR system, a sufficient size of typical queries is often prepared, and thus, our proposed method can estimate appropriate weights for typical significant words.",

        "There are much room to improve unsupervised estimation method.",
        "In addition, since typical queries for IR system will change according to the users, current topic, and so on, word weights should be updated accordingly.",
