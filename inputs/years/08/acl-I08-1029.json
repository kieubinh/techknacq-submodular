        "Prosody plays a crucial role in language understanding.",
        "In addition to the well-known effects in tone languages such as Chinese, prosody in English also plays a significant role, where pitch accents can indicate given/new information status, and boundary tones can distinguish statements from yes-no questions.",
        "However, recognition of such prosodic features poses significant challenges due to differences in surface realization from the underlying form.",
        "In particular, context plays a significant role in prosodic realization.",
        "Contextual effects due articulatory constraints such maximum speed of pitch change (Xu and Sun, 2002) from neighboring syllables and accents can yield co-articulatory effects at the intonational level, analogous to those at the segmental level.",
        "Recent phonetic research (Xu, 1999;",
        "Sun, 2002; Shen, 1990) has demonstrated the importance of coarticulation for tone and pitch accent recognition.",
        "In addition context affects interpretation of prosodic events; an accent is viewed as high or low relative to the speaker's pitch range and also relative to adjacent speech.",
        "Some recent acoustically focused approaches (Sun, 2002; Levow, 2005) to tone and pitch accent recognition have begun to model and exploit these contextual effects on production.",
        "Following the Parallel Encoding and Target Approximation (PENTA) (Xu, 2004), this work assumes that the prosodic target is exponentially approached during the course of syllable production, and thus the target is best approximated in the later portion of the syllable.",
        "Other contextual evidence such as relative pitch height or band energy between syllables has also been employed (Levow, 2005; Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2006).",
        "Interestingly, although earlier techniques (Ross and Ostendorf, 1994; Dusterhoff et al., 1999) employed Hidden Markov Models, they did not explicitly model these coarticulatory effects, and recent approaches have primarily employed local classifiers, such as decision trees (Sun, 2002; Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2006) or Support Vector Machines (Levow, 2005).",
        "Another body of work on pitch accent recognition has focused on exploitation of lexical and syntactic information to predict ToBI labels, for example for speech synthesis.",
        "These approaches explored a range of machine learning techniques from local classifiers such as decision trees (Sun, 2002) and RIPPER (Pan and McKeown, 1998) to sequence models such as Conditional Random Fields (CRFs)(Gregory and Altun, 2004) more recently.",
        "The systems often included features that captured local or longer range context, such as n-gram probabilities, neighboring words, or even indicators of prior mention.",
        "(Chen et al., 2004; Rangarajan Sridhar et al., 2007) explored the integration of based prosodic and lexico-syntactic evidence in GMM-based and maximum entropy models respectively.",
        "Here we explore the use of contextual acoustic and lexical models within a sequence learning framework.",
        "We analyze the interaction of different feature types on prediction of prosodic labels using linear-chain CRFs.",
        "We demonstrate improved recognition by integration of textual and acoustic cues, well-supported by the sequence model.",
        "Finally we consider the joint prediction of multiple prosodic label types, finding improvement for joint modeling in the case of feature sets with lower initial performance.",
        "We begin by describing the ToBI annotation task and our experimental data.",
        "We then discuss the choice of conditional random fields and the use of linear chain and factorial models.",
        "Section 4 describes the contextual acoustic model and text-based features.",
        "Section 5 presents the experimental structure and results.",
        "We conclude with a brief discussion of future work.",
        "We employ a subset of the Boston Radio News Corpus (Ostendorf et al., 1995), employing data from speakers f1a, f2b, m1b, and m2b, for experimental consistency with (Chen et al., 2004; Rangara-jan Sridhar et al., 2007).",
        "The corpus includes pitch accent, phrase and boundary tone annotation in the ToBI framework (Silverman et al., 1992) aligned with manual transcription and manual and automatic syllabification of the materials.",
        "Each word was also manually part-of-speech tagged.",
        "The data comprises over forty thousand syllables, with speaker f2b accounting for just over half the data.",
        "Following earlier research (Ostendorf and Ross, 1997; Sun, 2002), we collapse the ToBI pitch accent labels to four classes: unaccented, high, low, and down-stepped high for experimentation, removing distinctions related to bitonal accents.",
        "We also consider the binary case of distinguishing accented from unaccented syllables, (Gregory and Altun, 2004; Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2006; Ananthakrishnan and Narayanan, 2006).",
        "For phrase accents and boundary tones, we consider only the binary distinction between phrase accent/no phrase accent and boundary tone/no boundary tone.",

        "Most prior acoustically based approaches to prosodic labeling have used local classifiers.",
        "However, on phonological grounds, we expect that certain label sequences will be much more probable than others.",
        "For example, sequences of multiple high accents are relatively uncommon in contrast to the case of an unaccented syllable preceding an accented one.",
        "This characteristic argues for a model which encodes and exploits inter-label dependencies.",
        "Furthermore, under the ToBI labeling guidelines, the presence of a boundary tone dictates the co-occurrence of a phrase accent label.",
        "To capture these relations between labels of different types, we also consider factorial models.",
        "Conditional Random Fields (Lafferty et al., 2001) are a class of graphical models which are undirected and conditionally trained.",
        "While they can represent long term dependencies, most applications have employed first-order linear chains for language and speech processing tasks including POS tagging, sentence boundary detection (Liu et al., 2005), and even text-oriented pitch accent prediction(Gregory and Altun, 2004).",
        "The models capture sequential label-label relations, but unlike HMMs, the conditionally trained model can more tractably support larger text-based feature sets.",
        "Factorial CRFs (Sut-ton, 2006; McCallum et al., 2003) augment the linear sequence model with additional cotemporal labels, so that multiple (factors) labels are predicted at each time step and dependencies between them can be modeled.",
        "Examples of linear-chain and factorial CRFs appear in Figure 1.",
        "In the linear chain example, the fi items correspond to the features and the yi to labels to be predicted, for example prosodic and text features and pitch accent labels respectively.",
        "The vertical lines correspond to the dependencies between the features and labels; the horizontal lines indicate the dependencies between the labels in sequence.",
        "In the factorial CRF example, the fi again represent the features, while the xi, yi, and zi represent the boundary tone, phrase accent, and pitch accent labels that are being predicted.",
        "The horizontal arcs again model the sequential bigram label-label dependencies between labels of the same class; the vertical arcs model the dependencies between both the features and labels, and bigram dependencies between the labels of each of the different pairs of factors.",
        "Thus, we jointly predict pitch accent, phrase accent, and boundary tone and, the prediction of each label depends on the features, the other labels predicted for the same syllable, and the sequential label of the same class.",
        "So, pitch accent prediction depends on the features, pitch accent predicted for the neighboring syllable, and phrase and boundary tone predictions for the current syllable.",
        "We employ the Graphical Models for Mallet (GRMM) implementation (Sutton, 2006), adapted to also support the real-valued acoustic features required for these experiments; in some additional contrastive experiments on zero order models, we also employ the Mallet implementation (McCallum, 2002).",

        "Using Praat's (Boersma, 2001) \"To pitch\" and \"To intensity\" functions and the phoneme, syllable, and word alignments provided in the corpus, we extract acoustic features for the region of interest.",
        "This region corresponds to the syllable nucleus in English.",

        "Recent phonetic research (Xu, 1997; Shih and Kochanski, 2000) has identified significant effects of carryover coarticulation from preceding adjacent syllable tones.",
        "To minimize these effects consistent with the pitch target approximation model (Xu et al., 1999), we compute slope features based on the second half of this region, where this model predicts that the underlying pitch height and slope targets of the syllable will be most accurately approached.",

        "The first set of features, referred to as \"extended features\", includes the maximum and mean pitch from adjacent syllables as well as the nearest pitch points from the adjacent syllables.",
        "These features extend the modeled tone beyond the strict bounds of the syllable segmentation.",

        "Finally, we also employ some positional and du-rational features.",
        "Many prosodic phenomena are affected by phrase or sentence position; for example, both pitch and intensity tend to decrease across an utterance, and pitch accent realization may also be affected by cooccurring phrase accents or boundary tones.",
        "As syllable duration typically increases under both accenting and phrase-final lengthening, this information can be useful in prosodic labeling.",
        "Finally, pause information is also associated with prosodic phrasing.",
        "Thus, we include following features:",
        "• two binary features indicating initial and final in a pseudo-phrase, defined as a silence-delimited interval,",
        "• duration of syllable nucleus, and",
        "• durations of pause preceding and following the syllable.",
        "In prior experiments using support vector machines (Levow, 2005), variants of this representation achieved competitive recognition levels for both tone and pitch accent recognition.",
        "We employ text-based models similar to those employed by (Sun, 2002; Rangarajan Sridhar et al., 2007).",
        "For each syllable, we capture the following manually annotated features:",
        "• The phonetic form of the current syllable, the previous two syllables, and the following two syllables,",
        "• binary values indicating whether each of the current, previous, and following syllables are lexically stressed,",

        "Finally, we will also integrate prior work on subsyllable segmentation to identify the best approximation of the prosodic target with the CRF framework to produce a fine-grained sequence model of prosodic realization in context."
