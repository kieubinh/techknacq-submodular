        "In the training phase, bilingual parallel sentences are preprocessed and aligned using alignment algorithms or tools such as GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003).",
        "Phrase pairs are then extracted to be a phrase translation table.",
        "Probabilities of a few predefined features are computed and assigned to the phrase pairs.",
        "The final outcome of the training is a translation table consisting of source phrases, target phrases, and lists of probabilities of features.",
        "In the decoding phase, the translation of a test source sentence is made by reordering the target phrases corresponding to the source phrases, and searching for the best hypothesis that yields the highest scores defined by the search criterion.",
        "However, this mechanism cannot solve unknown word translation problems.",
        "Unknown words (UNK) point to those unseen words in the training or non-existing words in the translation table.",
        "One strategy to deal with translating unknown words is to remove them from the target sentence without translation on assumption of fewer UNKs in the test data.",
        "Of course, this simple way produces a lower quality of translations if there are a lot of UNKs in the test data, especially for using a Chinese word segmenter that produces many UNKs.",
        "The translation of UNKs need to be solved by a special method.",
        "The translation of Chinese unknown words seems more difficult than other languages because Chinese language is a non-inflected language.",
        "Unlike other languages (Yang and Kirchhoff, 2006; NieBlen and Ney, 2000; Goldwater and McClosky, 2005), Chinese UNK translation cannot use information from stem and inflection analysis.",
        "Using machine transliteration can resolve part of UNK translation (Knight and Graehl, 1997).",
        "But this approach is effective for translating phonetically related unknown words, not for other types.",
        "No unified approach for translating Chinese unknown words has been proposed.",
        "In this paper we propose a novel statistics-based approach for unknown word translation.",
        "This approach uses the properties of Chinese word composition rules - Chinese words are composed of one or more Chinese characters.",

        "We train a subword based translation model and use the model to translate the subword sequence.",
