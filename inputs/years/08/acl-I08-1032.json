        "We are currently developing an English-to-Japanese translation aid system aimed at volunteer translators mainly working online (Abekawa and Kageura, 2007), As part of this project, we are developing a module that notifies (inexperienced) translators of awkwardly translated expressions that may need refinement or editing.",
        "In most cases, translators first make draft translations, and then examine and edit them later, often repeatedly.",
        "Thus there are normally at least two versions of a given translation, i.e. a draft and the final translation.",
        "In commercial translation environments, it is sometimes the case that texts are first translated by inexperienced translators and then edited by experienced translators.",
        "However, this does not apply to voluntary translation.",
        "In addition, volunteer translators tend to be less experienced than commercial translators, and devote less time to editing.",
        "It would therefore be of great help to these translators if the CAT system automatically pointed out awkward translations for possible modification.",
        "In order to realise such a system, it is necessary to first clarify (i) the basic types of modification made by translators to draft translations, and (ii) what triggers these modifications.",
        "In section 2 we introduce the data used in this study.",
        "In section 3, we clarify the nature of modification in the translation process.",
        "In section 4, we identify the actual modification patterns in the data.",
        "In section 5, focusing on \"the change from the passive to the active voice\" pattern, we analyse and clarify the triggers that may lead to modification.",
        "Section 6 is devoted to an experiment in which machine learning methods are used to detect modification candidates.",
        "The importance of the various triggers is examined, and the performance of the system is evaluated."

        "As little research has been carried out into the process by which translators modify draft translations, we manually analysed a part of the data in which modifications were made, in consultation with a translator.",
        "In the modification process, the translator first recognises (though often not consciously) one of a number of states in a draft translation and the underlying cause of the state.",
        "S/he then modifies the draft translation if necessary.",
        "Table 2 shows the basic classification of states and possible causes.",
        "Although the states are conceptually clear, it is not necessarily the case that translators can judge the state of a given translation consistently, because judging a sentence as being \"natural\" or \"confusing\" is not a binary process but a graded one, and the distinction between different states is often not immediately clear.",
        "Many concrete modification patterns found in the data are covered in translation textbooks (Anzai, 1995; Nakamura, 2003).",
        "However, although it is obvious in some cases that a section of translated text needs to be modified, in other cases it is less clear, and judgments will vary according to the translator.",
        "The task that automatic notification addresses, therefore, is essentially an ambiguous one, even though the actual system output may be binary.",
        "We also identified the distinction between two types of modification: (i) \"generative\" modification, in which the modified translation is generated on the spot, with reference to the English original; and (ii) \"considered\" modification, in which alternate expressions (phrases, collocations, etc.)",
        "are retrieved from the depository of useful, elegant, or conventional expressions in the translator's mind.",
        "These two types of modification can be activated in the face of one token of modification at once."

      "heading": "4. Modification patterns",
      "text": [
        "The most natural way to classify modification patterns is by means of basic linguistic labels such as \"change of voice\" or \"change from nominal modification to adverbial modification\" (cf. Anzai, 1995).",
        "These modification patterns consist of one or more primitive operations.",
        "For instance, a \"change of voice\" may consist of such primitive operations as \"changing the case-marker of the subject,\" \"swapping the position of subject and object,\" etc.",
        "As preparation, we extracted modification patterns from the data.",
        "In order to do so, we first aligned the \"Draft\" and the \"Final\" at the sentence level using DP matching, and then at the morpheme level using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003).",

        "As a result, GIZA++ sometimes misaligns the units.",
        "From the aligned \"Draft\" and \"Final\" data, we identified the primitive operations.",
        "We limited these operations to syntactic operations and semantic operations such as the changing of content words, because the latter is hard to generalise with a small amount of data.",
        "Primitive operations were extracted by calculating the difference between corresponding bunsetsu, which basically consist of a content word and postpositions/suffixes, in the \"Draft\" and in the \"Final\".",
        "An example is given in Table 3.",
        "Table 4 shows the five most frequent changes in verb inflections and case markers, which are two dominant classes of primitive operation.",
        "In addition, we observed deletions and insertions of Sahen verbs.",
        "Modification patterns were identified by observing the degree of co-occurrence among these primitive operations.",
        "We used Cabocha to identify the syntactic dependencies and used the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) to calculate the degree of co-occurrence of primitive operations that occupy syntactically dependent positions.",
        "Table 5 shows the top five pairwise co-occurrence patterns.",
        "Three main modification patterns were identified: (i) a change from the passive to the active voice (226 cases); (ii) a change from a Sahen verb to a Sahen noun (208 cases); and (iii) a change from nominal modification to clausal structure.",
        "These patterns have been discussed in studies of paraphrases (Inui and Fujita, 2004) and in translation textbooks (Anzai, 1995; Nakamura, 2003).",
        "We focus on \"the change from the passive to the active voice\".",
        "It is one of the most important and interesting modification patterns because (i) it is mostly concerned with the main clausal structure in which other modifications are embedded; and (ii) the use of active and passive voices differs greatly between English and Japanese and thus there will be much to reveal."

        "From the 100 sample sentences, we excluded 23 cases, 18 of which were judged as in need of modification by one of the translators and 5 of which were judged as in need of modification by both of the translators.",
        "We manually analysed the remaining 77 cases.",
        "Rather than the problems with the features that we used, we identified the potential factors that would contribute to the restriction of modification.",
        "Three types of restricting factor were recognised:",
        "1.",
        "The nature of individual verbs allows or requires the passive voice.",
        "Within the data, three subtypes were identified, i.e. (i) the use of the passive is natural irrespective of context, as in \" MM^ti (consumed)\" (48 cases); (ii) the use of the passive is natural within certain fixed syntactic patterns, as in \"X fcfSns Y (Y called X)\" (10 cases); and (iii) the passive is used as part of a common collocation, as in \"^Si-Hfc tit: (attacked by anxiety)\" (2 cases);",
        "2.",
        "The use of the active voice is blocked by selectional restrictions, as in \"ffSftfeill (a sediment made by ...)\" (1 case); and",
        "3.",
        "The structure of the sentence requires the passive, as in \"*^ffl±*S^^T**S^^5±* T^5,fffl^T-Et©^^*'SS$nT^t (The biggest companies were all companies making cars, in which most of the oil was consumed)\" (16 cases).",
        "Together they cover 73 cases (in 4 out of 77 cases we could not identify the factor, and in 4 of the 73 cases two of the above factors were identified).",
        "It is anticipated that the first type (60 cases; about 85%) could be dealt with by introducing \"pulling\" triggers, i.e. using large corpora to identify the characteristics of the use of voice for individual verbs, in order to enable the system to judge the desirability of given expressions vis-a-vis the conventional alternatives.",
        "To deal with the second type requires a detailed semantic description of nouns, which is difficult to achieve, though in some cases it could be approximated by collocational tendencies.",
        "In regards to the third type of false positive, we expected that the type of features used in the experiment would have been sufficient to eliminate them, but this was not the case.",
        "In fact, many of the features require discourse level information, such as the choice of subject within the flow of discourse, in order to function properly, which we did not take into account.",
        "Although high-performance discourse processing is still in an embryonic stage, in the setting of the present study the correspondence between key information in English and that in Japanese could be used to deal with this type of false positive.",
        "Here, it is necessary to find factors that would promote modification.",
        "Among the 33 false negatives, 4 were judged as not in need of modification by both the translators.",
        "We thus examined the remaining 29 cases.",
        "In 13 cases, the verb was replaced by another verb.",
        "Including these cases, we identified four basic factors that are related to triggering modification:",
        "1.",
        "The nature of the individual verbs strongly requires the active voice, either independently or within the particular context, as in h Ufa h ftSLfc (was asked by)\" (9 cases);",
        "2.",
        "The structure of the sentence is rendered rather awkward by the use of passives, as in nfcTty^ ht^Ci5U^-M*$5 (areport published in ...... by analysts)\" (4 cases);",
        "3.",
        "A given lexical collocation is unnatural or awkward, as in \"^^TfflSR**^SWcMj-htiSCfc",
        "(that all investments be screened is collectively insisted)\" (2 cases); and",
        "4.",
        "A lexicalised collocation in the draft was subtly awkward and there is a better collocation or expression that fits the situation (14 cases).",
        "Together they cover 26 cases.",
        "We could not identify features in 3 cases.",
        "As in false positives, the first, second and fourth types (22 cases or about 85% are fully covered by these three types) could be dealt with by introducing \"pulling\" triggers, using large external corpora.",
        "cases) could be dealt with by introducing \"pulling\" triggers.",
        "If these false positives could be removed completely, the precision would become well over 0.5 (193/(697-330)) and the ratio of notified cases would become about one third ((697-330)/1120) of the total relevant cases.",
        "Though it is unreasonable to assume this ideal case, this indicates that the features we defined and introduced in this study – though limited to those related to \"pushing\" triggers – were effective, and that what we have achieved by using these features is very promising in terms of realising a system that notifies users of awkward translations."
