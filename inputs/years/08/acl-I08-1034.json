        "We use language every day to convince, explain, manipulate and thus reach our goals.",
        "This aspect of language use is even more obvious in the context of negotiations.",
        "The parties must reach an agreement on the partitioning or sharing of a resource, while each party usually wants to leave the negotiation table with the larger piece of the pie.",
        "These tendencies become stronger when negotiators use only electronic means to communicate, that is to say, participate in electronic negotiations.",
        "In face-to-face contact, prosody and body language often have a crucial role in conveying attitudes and feelings.",
        "E-negotiators, on the other hand, must rely only on texts.",
        "We perform automatic analysis of the textual data in e-negotiations.",
        "We identify linguistic expressions of such negotiation-specific behaviour that are indicative of the final outcome of the process - success or failure - and observe how powerful a tool language is in helping people get what they want.",
        "In this paper we focus on the negotiation as an ongoing process.",
        "We analyze the linguistic features of messages exchanged at various points in the course of the negotiation, to determine the time frame in which the outcome becomes decided.",
        "From our experimental point of view, we determine the segment of the negotiation which is most predictive of the outcome.",
        "There is an imposed three-week deadline in the electronic negotiations that we analyze.",
        "We hypothesize that the pressure of the deadline is reflected in the messages exchanged.",
        "The messages written later in the process are more indicative of the outcome of the process.",
        "Our empirical results support this hypothesis; an analysis of the linguistic features that make this prediction possible shows what the negotiators' main concerns are as the deadline draws near.",
        "Here is what our results contribute to the field of text analysis.",
        "Research on text records of face-to-face negotiations suggests that the language patterns used in the first half of a negotiation predict the negotiation outcome better than those in the second half (Simons, 1993).",
        "The explanation was that in the first phase people establish contact, exchange personal information and engage in general polite conversation, creating a foundation of trust between partners.",
        "No numerical data, however, supported this diagnosis, and there was no distinction between the prediction of successful and unsuccessful outcomes.",
        "When it comes to text classification, our hypothesis says that the classification of the second parts of e-negotiation texts is more accurate with respect to the outcome than the classiication of the first parts.",
        "This makes e-negotiation texts different from newsgroup messages, newspaper articles and other documents classified by Blatak et al.",
        "(2004), where texts showed better classification Accuracy on their initial parts.",
        "We report the results of several sets of Machine Learning (ML) experiments.",
        "Performed on varying-size text data segments, they support our hypothesis.",
        "We worked with a collection of transcripts of negotiations conducted over the Internet using the Web-based negotiation support system Inspire (Ker-sten and Zhang, 2003).",
        "Kersten and Zhang (2003) and Nastase (2006) classified e-negotiation outcomes using non-textual data.",
        "Classification based on texts is discussed in (Sokolova et al., 2005; Sokolova and Szpakowicz, 2006).",
        "None of those experiments considered segmenting the data, although Sokolova and Szpakowicz (2006) analyzed the importance of the first part of e-negotiations.",
        "The work we present here is the irst attempt to investigate the effect of parts of e-negotiation textual data on classification quality.",
        "In this study we do not report types of expressions that are relevant to success and failure of negotiations.",
        "These expressions have been presented and analyzed in (Sokolova and Szpakowicz, 2005).",
        "In section 2 we take a brief look at other work on the connection between behaviour and language.",
        "In section 3 we present our data and their representation for ML experiments, and we further motivate our work.",
        "Section 4 describes the experiments.",

        "In the 1980s, Rodger Bailey developed the Language and Behaviour Profile based on 60 meta-programs.",
        "Charvet (1997) presents a simplified approach with 14 meta-programs.",
        "This profile proposes that people's language patterns are indicators of behavioural preferences.",
        "In the study of planning dialogues (Chu-Carroll and Carberry, 2000), Searle's theory of speech acts used through the discourse analysis also supports the fact that language carries much of people's behaviour and emotions.",
        "Reitter and Moore (2007) studied repetitions in task-oriented conversations.",
        "They demonstrated that a speaker's short-term ability to copy the interlocutor's syntax is autonomous from the success of the task, whereas long-term adaptation varies with such success.",
        "We consider a negotiation to be a communication in which the participants want to reach an agreement relative to the splitting/sharing of resources.",
        "Language is one of the tools used to reach the goal.",
        "We propose that not all messages exchanged throughout a negotiation have the same effect on the negotiation outcome.",
        "To test this hypothesis, we take an ever smaller segment of the negotiation, and see how well we can predict the outcome of the process, based only on the messages in this fragment.",
        "We encountered several challenges in predicting e-negotiation outcomes using the messages exchanged.",
        "First, electronic negotiations usually do not have a sequential-stage model of behaviour (Koeszegi et al., 2007), which is common in face-to-face negotiations (Adair and Brett, 2005).",
        "Here is an example of behavioural phases in face-to-face negotiations: Perform Relational Positioning – Identify the Problem – Generate Solutions – Reach Agreement.",
        "Unexpected turns and moves - typical of human behaviour - make prediction of the negotiation outcome difficult.",
        "In case of electronic negotiation, the absence of the usual negotiation structure further complicates the outcome prediction.",
        "This distinguishes e-negotiations from agent-customer phone conversations studied in (Takeuchi et al., 2007), where an agent follows the call flow predefined by his company's policy.",
        "The longer an e-negotiation takes, the more elaborate the structure of the e-negotiation process becomes.",
        "Simpler e-negotiation may involve an exchange of well-structured business documents such as predefined contract or retail transactions.",
        "A more complex process comprises numerous offers and counteroffers and has a high degree of uncertainty because ofthe possible unpredictability ofne-gotiation moves.",
        "The next challenge stems from the limitations imposed by the use of electronic means.",
        "This overloads text messages with various tasks: negotiation issues themselves, introductions and closures traditional in negotiations, and even socializing.",
        "On the other hand, electronic means make the contacts less formal, allowing people to communicate more freely.",
        "As a result, the data have a high volume of informality such as abbreviations or slang.",
        "The last challenge is specific to text analysis.",
        "E-negotiations usually involve a multicultural audience of varied background, many of whom are not native English speakers.",
        "While communicating in English, they introduce a fair amount of spelling and grammatical mistakes."

        "These circumstances are reflected in the language of texts exchanged in negotiations, and distinguish this type of texts from casual email exchange and postings on discussion groups and chat boards.",
        "We claim that the language captured in e-negotiation textual data changes as a negotiation progresses, and that this is clearly detectable, even though it does not follow a sequential-stage model common in face-to-face-negotiations (Adair and Brett, 2005) or an agent-customer interaction call flow recommended by a company (Takeuchi et al., 2007).",

        "The correct classification of positive examples (successful negotiations), however, diminishes when splits become smaller; this applies to the performance of all three classifiers.",
        "This means that at the end of the negotiations the class of successful negotiations becomes more diverse and, subsequently, multi-modal, and the trends are more difficult to capture by the classifiers.",

        "The opposite is true for SVM and DT: their Accuracy on the tail segments is lower than on the complete data.",
