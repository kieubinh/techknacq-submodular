        "The problem is relevant in several domains where the user has to repeatedly write reports based on events in the domain, for example, weather reports (Reiter et al., 2005), medical reports (Elhadad et al., 2005), weekly class project reports (Kumar et al., 2007) and so forth.",
        "On observing the data from these domains, we notice a templatized nature of report items.",

        "The corresponding template is shown in (4) with slots containing their respective domain entity types.",
        "Instantiations of (4) may produce (1)-(3) and similar sentences.",
        "This kind of sentence structure motivates an approach of segmenting the problem of closed domain summarization into two major steps of automatic template extraction and learning aggregators, which are pattern detectors that assimilate information from the events, to populate these templates.",

        "We experimented with two independent, arguably complementary techniques for clustering and aligning - a predicate argument based approach that extracts more general templates containing one predicate and a ROUGE (Lin, 2004) based approach that can extract templates containing multiple verbs.",

        "(Riloff, 1996) describes an interesting work on the generation of extraction patterns from untagged text, but the analysis is syntactic and the patterns do not resemble the templates that we aim to extract.",
        "(Yangarber et al., 2000) describe another system called ExDisco, that extracts event patterns from un-annotated text starting from seed patterns.",
        "Once again, the text analysis is not deep and the patterns extracted are not sentence surface forms.",
        "(Collier, 1998) proposed automatic domain template extraction for IE purposes where MUC type templates for particular types of events were constructed.",
        "The method relies on the idea from (Luhn, 1958) where statistically significant words of a corpus were extracted.",
        "Based on these words, sentences containing them were chosen and aligned using subject-object-verb patterns.",
        "However, this method did not look at arbitrary syntactic patterns.",
        "(Filatova et al., 2006) improved the paradigm by looking at the most frequent verbs occurring in a corpus and aligning subtrees containing the verb, by using the syntactic parses as a similarity metric.",
        "However, long distance dependencies of verbs with constituents were not looked at and deep semantic analysis was not performed on the sentences to find out similar verb subcategorization frames.",
        "In contrast, in our predicate argument based approach we look into deeper semantic structures, and align sentences not only based on similar syntactic parses, but also based on the constituents' roles with respect to the main predicate.",

        "This is a freely available parallel corpus consisting of weather data and human written forecasts describing them.",
        "The dataset showed regularity in sentence structure and belonged to a closed domain, making the variations in surface forms more constrained than completely free text.",
        "After sentence segmentation we arrived at a set of 3262 sentences.",
        "From this set, we selected 3000 for template extraction and kept aside 262 sentences for testing.",
        "For semantic analysis, we used the ASSERT toolkit (Pradhan et al., 2004) that produces shallow semantic parses using the PropBank conventions.",
        "As a by product, it also produces syntactic parses of sentences, using the Charniak parser (Charniak, 2001).",
        "For each sentence, we maintained a part-of-speech tagged (leaves of the parse tree), parsed, baseNPtagged and semantic role tagged version.",
        "The baseNPs were retrieved by pruning the parse trees and not by using a separate NP chunker.",
        "The reason for having a baseNP tagged corpus will become clear as we go into the detail of our template extraction techniques.",
        "Figure 1 shows a typical output from the Charniak parser and Figure 2 shows the same tree with nodes under the baseNPs pruned.",
        "We identified the need to have a domain entity tagger for matching constituents in the sentences.",
        "A low over the Norwegian Sea will move North and weaken",
        "Any tagger for named entities was not suitable for weather forecasts since unique constituent types assumed significance unlike newswire data.",
        "Since the development of such a tagger was beyond the scope of the present work, we developed a module that took baseNP tagged sentences as input and produced tags across words and baseNPs that were domain entities.",
        "The development of such a module by hand was easy because of a limited vocabulary (< 1000 words) of the data and the closed set nature of most entity types (e.g the direction entity could take up a finite set of values).",

        "We adopted two parallel approaches.",
        "First, we investigated a predicate-argument based approach where we consider the set of all propositions in our dataset, and cluster them based on their verb sub-categorization frame.",
        "Second, we used ROUGE, a summarization evaluation metric that is generally used to compare machine generated and human written summaries.",
        "We uniquely used this metric for clustering similar summary items, after abstracting the surface forms to a representation that facilitates comparison of a pair of sentences.",
        "The following subsections detail both the techniques.",
        "Analysis of predicate-argument structures seemed appropriate for template extraction for a few reasons: Firstly, complicated sentences with multiple verbs are broken down into propositions by a semantic role labeler.",
        "The propositions are better generalizable units than whole sentences across a corpus.",
        "Secondly, long distance dependencies of constituents with a particular verb, are captured well by a semantic role labeler.",
        "Finally, if verbs are considered to be the center of events, then groups of sentences with the same semantic role sequences seemed to form clusters conveying similar meaning.",
        "We explain the complete algorithm for template extraction in the following subsections.",
        "[ARGM-DIR North ] and weaken southwestwards] and build on Sunday.",
        "We performed a verb based clustering as the first step.",
        "Instead of considering a unique set of verbs, we considered related verbs as a single verb type.",
        "The relatedness of verbs was derived from Wordnet (Fellbaum, 1998), by merging verbs that appear in the same synset.",
        "This kind of clustering is not ideal in a corpus containing a huge variation in event streams, like newswire.",
        "However, the results were good for the weather domain where the number of verbs used is limited.",
        "The grouping procedure resulted in a set of 82 clusters with 6632 propositions.",
        "Each verb cluster was considered next.",
        "Instead of finding structural similarities of the propositions in one go, we first considered the semantic role sequences for each proposition.",
        "We searched for propositions that had exactly similar role sequences and grouped them together.",
        "To give an example, both sentences 5 and 6 have the matching role sequence ARG0-ARGM-MOD-TARGET-ARGM-DIR.",
        "The intuition behind such clustering is straightforward.",
        "Propositions with a matching verb type with the same set of roles arranged in a similar fashion would convey similar meaning.",
        "We observed that this was indeed true for sentences tagged with correct semantic role labels.",
        "Instead of considering matching role sequences for a set of propositions, we could as well have considered matching bag of roles.",
        "However, for the present corpus, we decided to use strict role sequence instead because of the sentences' rigid structure and absence of any passive sentences.",
        "This subclustering step resulted in smaller clusters, and many of them contained a single proposition.",
        "We threw out these clusters on the assumption that the human summarizers did not necessarily have a template in mind while writing those summary items.",
        "As a result, many verb types were eliminated and only 33 verb-type clusters containing several sub-clusters each were produced.",
        "Groups of propositions with the same verb-type and semantic role sequences were considered in this step.",
        "For each group, we looked at individual semantic roles to find out similarity between them.",

        "The plausible reason for the poor performance seems to be that the technique is based on MDL (Minimum Description Length) principle.",

        "We finally chose a combined Precision and Recall measure (not f-measure) in which both the scores were independently thresholded.",
        "The motivation for the measure is that in our domain we desire to have high precision matches.",
        "Additionally we need to control the length of the sentences in the cluster for which we require a Recall threshold.",
        "F-measure (which is the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall) does not give us the required individual control.",
        "We set up our experiments such that while comparing two sentences the longer sentence is always treated as the reference and the shorter one as the candidate.",
        "This helps us in interpreting the Precision/Recall measures better and thresholding them accordingly.",
        "The approach gave us 149 clusters, which looked good on empirical evaluation.",
        "We can argue that using this modified similarity function for previous unsupervised approaches could have given better results, but we did not reevaluate those approaches as our aim of getting a reasonable clustering approach is fulfilled with this simple scheme and tuning the unsupervised approaches can be interesting future work.",
