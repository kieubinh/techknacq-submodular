        "Named entity (NE) translation plays an important role in machine translation, information retrieval, and question answering.",
        "It is a challenging task because, although there are many online bilingual dictionaries, they usually lack domain specific words or NEs.",
        "Furthermore, new NEs are generated everyday, but bilingual dictionaries cannot update their contents frequently.",
        "Therefore, it is necessary to construct a named entity translation (NET) system.",
        "Economic ties between China and Korea have become closer as China has opened its markets further, and demand for the latest news and information from China continues to grow rapidly in Korea.",
        "One key way to meet this demand is to retrieve information written in Chinese by using Korean queries, referred to as Korean-Chinese cross-language information retrieval (KCIR).",
        "The main challenge involves translating NEs because they are usually the main concepts of queries.",
        "In (Chen et al., 1998), the authors romanized Chinese NEs and selected their English transliterations from English NEs extracted from the Web by comparing their phonetic similarities with Chinese NEs.",
        "Yaser Al-Onaizan (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002) transliterated an NE in Arabic into several candidates in English and ranked the candidates by comparing their counts in several English corpora.",
        "Unlike the above works, whose target languages are alphabetic, in KC translation, the target language is Chinese, which uses an ideographic writing system.",
        "Korean-Chinese NET is much more difficult than NET considered in previous works because, in Chinese, one syllable may map to tens or hundreds of characters.",
        "For example, if an NE written in Korean comprises three syllables, there may be thousands of possible translation candidates in Chinese.",
        "In this paper, we propose an effective hybrid NET method which can help improve performance of cross-language information retrieval systems.",
        "We also describe the construction of a Korean-Chinese CLIR system able to evaluate the effectiveness of our NE translation method.",
        "2 Difficulties in Korean-Chinese Named Entity Translation for IR",
        "Most Korean NEs originate from Hanja.",
        "Therefore, the most straightforward way to translate a Korean name into Chinese is to use its Hanja equivalent.",
        "Take the name of Korea's president, -^ft\" (No Mu-hyeon), as an example.",
        "We can directly convert it to its Hanja equivalent: \"itS;$£\" (Lu Wu-Xuan).",
        "Or in the case of the city name \"-r -tb\" (Pusan/H I/Fu-shan) and the company name \"4^\" (Samsung/HM/San-xing), Chinese also presents Hanja equivalents.",
        "If the Hanja name is unknown, the name is translated character by character.",
        "Each Hangul character is basically translated into a corresponding Hanja character.",
        "For example, the name of the Korean actor £1 (Cho In-seong) is usually translated as \"Hf~$c\" (Zhao Ren-cheng) because is mapped to 'H', mapped to '{\"', and mapped to ' JjSc'.",
        "However, that translation may differ from the person's given Hanja name.",
        "For native Korean NEs which have no corresponding Hanja characters, we must turn to transliteration or convention.",
        "Take the name of South Korea's capital \"^-H-\" (Seoul) as an example.",
        "Before 2005, Chinese media and government used the old Hanja name of the city \"MW (Han-cheng), which was used during Joseon dynasty (A.D. 1392-1910).",
        "However, after 2005, Chinese switched to using the transliteration \"f flf\" (Shou-er) instead of \"M W\" at the request of the Seoul Metropolitan Government.",
        "This example illustrate how more than one Chinese translation for a Korean name is possible, a phenomenon which, at times, makes Korean-Chinese information retrieval more difficult.",
        "To translate a Chinese NE written in Hangul, we begin by considering the two CK NET approaches.",
        "The older is based on the Sino-Korean pronunciation and the newer on the Mandarin.",
        "For example, \"}E W\" (Taiwan) used to be transliterated solely as (Dae-man).",
        "However, during the 1990s, transliteration based on Mandarin pronunciation became more popular.",
        "Presently, the most common transliteration for is \"eH-St\" (Ta-i-wan), though the Sino-Korean-based \"tfl ^b\" is still widely used.",
        "For Chinese personal names, both ways are used.",
        "For example, the name of Chinese actor Jackie Chan (\"JjScfl\" Cheng-long) is variously transliterated as W\" Seong-ryong (Sino-Korean) and Cheong-rung (Mandarin).",
        "Translating Chinese NEs by either method is a major challenge because each Hangul character may correspond to several different Chinese characters that have similar pronunciations in Korean.",
        "This results in thousands of possible combinations of Chinese characters, making it very difficult to choose the most widely used one one.",
        "Japanese NEs may contain Hiraganas, Katakanas, or Kanjis.",
        "For each character type, J-C translation rules may be similar to or very different from KC translation rules.",
        "Some of these rules are based on Japanese pronunciation, while some are not.",
        "For NEs composed of all Kanjis, their Chinese translations are generally exactly the same as their Kanji written forms.",
        "In contrast, Japanese NEs are transliterated into Hangul characters.",
        "Take M\" (Nagoya) for example.",
        "Its Chinese translation \"J M\" is exactly the same as its Kanji written form, while its pronunciation (Ming Gu Wu) is very different from its Japanese pronunciation.",
        "This is different from its Korean translation, j2.",
        "(Na go ya).",
        "In this example, we can see that, because the translation rules in Chinese and Korean are different, it is ineffective to utilize phonetic similarity to find the Chinese translation equivalent to the Korean translation.",
        "In both Korean and Chinese, transliteration methods are mostly used to translate non-CJK NEs.",
        "Korean uses the Hangul alphabet for transliteration.",
        "Because of the phonology of Korean, some phonemes are changed during translation because the language lacks these phonemes.",
        "(Oh, 2003; Lee, 2003) In contrast, Chinese transliterates each syllable in a NE into Chinese characters with similar pronunciation.",
        "Although there are some conventions for selecting the transliteration characters, there are still many possible transliterations since so many Chinese characters have the same pronunciation.",
        "For instance, the name \"Greenspan\" has several Chinese transliterations, such as \"Mtyf^ftM\" (Ge-lin-si-ban) and \"M'W8fM\" (Ge-lin-si-pan).",
        "In summary, it is difficult to match a non-CJK NE transliterated from Korean with its Chinese transliteration due to the latter's variations."

        "In this section, we describe our Korean-Chinese NE translation method for dealing with the problems described in Section 2.",
        "We either translate NE candidates from Korean into Chinese directly, or translate them into English first and then into Chinese.",
        "Our method is a hybrid of two components: extended bilingual dictionaries and web-based NET.",
        "The first step is to identify which words in a query are NEs.",
        "In general, Korean queries are composed of several eojeols, each of which is composed of a noun followed by the noun's postposition, or a verb stem followed by the verb's ending.",
        "We remove the postposition or the ending to extract the key terms, and then select person name candidates from the key terms.",
        "Next, the maximum matching algorithm is applied to further segment each term into words in the Daum Korean-Chinese bilingual dictionary.",
        "If the length of any token segmented from a term is 1, the term is regarded as an NE to be translated.",
        "Most NEs are not included in general bilingual dictionaries.",
        "We adopt two online databases to translate NEs: Wikipedia and Naver people search.",
        "In Wikipedia, each article has an inter-language link to other language editions, which we exploit to translate NEs.",
        "Each NE candidate is first sent to the Korean Wikipedia, and the title of the matched article's Chinese version is treated as the NE's translation in Chinese.",
        "However, if the article lacks a Chinese version, we use the English edition to acquire the NE's translation in English.",
        "The English translation is then transliterated into Chinese by the method described in Section 3.3.3.",
        "Most NEs are person names that cannot all be covered by the encyclopedia.",
        "We use Naver people search engine to extend the coverage of person names.",
        "Naver people search is a translation tool that maintains a database of famous people's basic profiles.",
        "If the person is from CJK, the search engine returns his/her name in Chinese; otherwise, it returns the name in English.",
        "In the former case, we can adopt the returned name directly, but in the latter, we need to translate the name into Chinese.",
        "The translation method is described in Section 3.3.3.",
        "Obviously, the above methods cannot cover all possible translations of NEs.",
        "Therefore, we propose a pattern-based method to find the translation from the Web.",
        "Since the Chinese translations of some NEs cannot be found by patterns, we find their Chinese translations indirectly by first finding their English translations and then finding the Chinese translations.",
        "Therefore, we must generate KC patterns to extract KC translation pairs, as well as K-E and EC patterns to extract K-E and EC pairs, respectively.",
        "Our motivation is to learn patterns for extracting NEs written in the source language and their equivalents in the target language from the Web.",
        "First, we need to prepare the training set.",
        "To generate KC and K-E patterns, we collect thousands of NEs that originated in Korean, Chinese, Japanese, or non-CJK languages from Dong-A Ilbo (a South Korean newspaper).",
        "Then, all the Korean NEs are translated into Chinese manually.",
        "NEs from non-CJK languages are also translated into English.",
        "To generate EC patterns, we collect English NEs from the MUC-6 and MUC-7 datasets and translate them into Chinese manually.",
        "We submit each NE in the source language (source NE) and its translation in the target language as a query to Google search engine.",
        "For instance, the Korean NE \"H]!^!",
        "]^\" and its translation \"Major League\" are first composed as a query \"+^] °] ^ B] ZL + Major League\", which is then sent to Google.",
        "The search engine will return the relevant web documents with their snippets.",
        "We collect the snippets in the top 20 pages and we break them into sentences.",
        "Only the sentences that contain at least one source NE and its translation are retained.",
        "For each pair of retained sentences, we apply the Smith-Waterman local alignment algorithm to find the longest common string, which is then added to the candidate pattern pool.",
        "During the alignment process, positions where the two input sequences share the same word are counted as a match.",
        "The following is an example of a pair of sentences that contains \"H B];i\" and its",
        "English translation, \"Major League\":",
        "After alignment, the pattern is generated as:",
        "<Korean NE>(<English Translation>)^",
        "This pattern generation process is repeated for each NE-translation pair.",
        "After learning the patterns, we have to filter out some ineffective patterns.",
        "First, we send a Korean NE, such as \"H °1 ^ 5 Zt\", to retrieve the snippets in the top 50 pages.",
        "Then, we apply all the patterns to extract the translations from the snippets.",
        "The correct rate of each translation pattern is calculated as follows: CorrectRate = C'correct/Call, where Ccorrect is the total number of correct translations extracted by the pattern and Call is the total number of translations extracted by the pattern.",
        "If the correct rate of the pattern is below the threshold t, the pattern will be dropped.",
        "The translations of some NEs, especially from CJK, can be found comparatively easily from the Web.",
        "However, for other NEs, especially from non-CJK, this is not the case.",
        "Therefore, we split the translation process into two stages: the first translates the NE into its English equivalent, and the second translates the English equivalent into Chinese.",
        "To find an NE's Chinese translation, we first apply the translation patterns to extract possible Chinese translations.",
        "If its Chinese translation cannot be found, the K-E patterns are used to find its English translation instead.",

        "We employ Wikipedia, Naver people search, and the pattern-based method simultaneously to translate the NE candidate \"5I^iL\" (Kosovo).",
        "Up to now, there is no article about Kosovo in Korean Wikipedia.",
        "Naver people search does not contain an article either because it is not a person name.",
        "Meanwhile, since the KC translation patterns cannot extract any Chinese translations, the K-E patterns are used to get the English translations, such as \"Kosovo\", \"Cosbo\", and \"Kosobo\".",
        "The EC patterns are then employed to get the Chinese translation from the three English translations.",
        "Among them, only Chinese translations for \"Kosovo\" can be found because the other two are either wrong or rarely used translations.",

        "They are all correct transliterations.",
        "A Hangul word might have many meanings.",
        "Besides, sometimes the translation patterns might extract wrong translations of the NE.",
        "This phenomenon causes ambiguities during information retrieval and influence the performance of IR significantly.",
        "To solve this problem, we adopt the mutual information score (MI score) to evaluate the co-relation between a translation candidate tcij for a term qti and all translation candidates for all the other terms in Q; tcij's MI score given Q is calculated as follows:",
        "MIscore(tCijQ) = Xig PT(kMt) where Z(qtx) is the number of translation candidates of the x-th query term qtx; tcxy is y-th translation candidate for qtx; Pr(tcij ,tcxy) is the probability that tcij and tcxy co-occur in the same sentence; and Pr(tcij) is the probability of tcij.",
        "Next, we compute the ratio of the each candidate's score over the highest candidate's score as follows: ScoreRatio(tcij) = MI score(tcij|Q)/MI score(tcih|Q), where tcih is the candidate with highest MI score from the qti.",
        "If the candidate's score ratio is below the threshold tmi, the candidate will be discarded.",
        "Here, we use the above example to illustrate the term disambiguation mechanism.",
        "For the given English term \"Kosovo\", the MI scores of \"4fW£\", \"4fWf£\", and \"f4Wft\" are computed; \"4Wt£\" achieves the highest score, while the score ratio of the other two candidates are much lower than the threshold.",
        "Thus, only \"4fWt£\" is treated as Kosovo's translation and used to build the final Chinese query to perform the IR.",

        "The other category contains names with few relevant web pages, like the non-CJK names \"?>M^|-2- M^\" (Antonio Toddy).",
        "The other problem is that our method can translate the Korean NEs into correct Chinese translations, but not the translation used in the CIRB 4.0 news collection.",
        "For example, \"^-^L£l 3\" (Kursk) is translated into (Ku-er-si-ke) correctly, but only the transliteration \"f4^T55\" (Ke-si-ke) is used in CIRB 4.0.",

        "In this paper, we have considered the difficulties that arise in translating NEs from Korean to Chinese for IR.",

        "To evaluate our method, we use the topics and document collection of the NTCIR-5 CLIR task.",
        "Our method's performance on KCIR is over five times better than that of the baseline configuration with only an offline dictionary-based translation module.",
        "Moreover, its overall MAP score is up to 0.2986, and its MAP on the NE topics is up to 0.3385 which is even better than that of the Chinese monolingual IR system.",
        "The proposed method can translate NEs that originated in the Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and non-CJK languages and improve the performance of KCIR substantially.",
