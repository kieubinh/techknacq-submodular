        "We train classifiers with unigram features for each emotion class using Support Vector Machine (SVM) for predicting the emotion category of the sentences in our corpus.",
        "SVM has been shown to be useful for text classification tasks (Joachims, 1998), and has previously given good performance in sentiment classification experiments (Kennedy report results from tenfold cross-validation experiments conducted using the SMO implementation of SVM in Weka (Witten and Frank, 2005).",
        "In each experiment, we represent a sentence by a vector indicating the number of times each feature occurs.",
        "In the first experiment, we use only corpus-based unigram features.",
        "We obtain high precision values for all emotion classes (as shown in Table 4), and the recall and F-measure values surpass baseline values for all classes except no-emotion.",
        "This validates our premise that unigrams can help learn lexical distributions well to accurately predict emotion categories.",
        "Next, we use as features all words in the emotion lexicon acquired from Roget's Thesaurus (RT).",
        "The F-measure scores beat the baseline for four out of seven classes.",
        "When we combine both corpus-based unigrams with RT features, we can increase recall values across all seven classes.",
        "Finally, we add features from WordNet-Affect to the feature set containing corpus unigrams and RT features.",
        "This leads to further improvement in overall performance.",
        "Combining all features, we achieve highest recall values across all but one class.",
        "The resulting F-measure values (ranging from 0.493 to 0.751) surpass the baseline values across all seven classes.",
        "This increase was found to be statistically significant (paired t-test, p=0.05)."

        "We observe that corpus-based features and emotion-related features together contribute to improved performance, better than given by any one type of feature group alone.",
        "Any automatic way of recognizing emotion should inevitably take into account a wide variety of words that are semantically connected to emotions.",
        "While some words are obviously affective, many more are only potentially affective.",
        "The latter derive their affective property from their associations with emotional concepts.",
        "For instance, words like \"family\", \"friends\", \"home\" are not inherently emotional, but because of their well-known semantic association with emotion concepts, their presence in a sentence can be taken as an indicator of emotion expression in the sentence.",
        "We can interpret the results as indicators of how much correlation the classifiers can find between the features and the predicted class.",
        "Considering our best results using all features, we find that this correlation is highest for the \"happy\" class, indicated by a precision of 0.813 and recall of 0.698, the highest among all classes.",
        "We can therefore conclude that it is easier to discern happiness in text than Ekman's other basic emotions."

      "text": [
        "Working on a corpus of blog sentences annotated with emotion labels, we were able to demonstrate that a combination of corpus-based unigram features and features derived from emotion lexicons can help automatically distinguish basic emotion categories in written text.",
        "When used together in an SVM-based learning environment, these features increased recall in all cases and the resulting F-measure values significantly surpassed the baseline scores for all emotion categories.",
        "In addition, we described a method of building an emotion lexicon derived from Roget's Thesaurus on the basis of semantic relatedness of words to a set of basic emotion words for each emotion category.",
        "The effectiveness of this emotion lexicon was demonstrated in the emotion classification tasks."
