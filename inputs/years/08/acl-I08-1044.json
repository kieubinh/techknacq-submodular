        "Named entity recognition (NER) is the task of identifying and classifying phrases that denote certain types of named entities (NEs), such as person names (PERs), locations (LOCs) and organizations (ORGs) in text documents.",
        "It is a well-established task in the NLP and data mining communities and is regarded as crucial technology for many higher-level applications, such as information extraction, question answering, information retrieval and knowledge management.",

        "Compared to European-language NER, Chinese NER seems to be more difficult (Yu et al., 2006).",
        "Recent approaches to Chinese NER are a shift away from manually constructed rules or finite state patterns towards machine learning or statistical methods.",
        "However, rule-based NER systems lack robustness and portability.",
        "Statistical methods often suffer from the problem of data sparsity, and machine learning approaches (e.g., Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) (Bikel et al., 1999; Zhou and Su, 2002), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) (Isozaki and Kazawa, 2002), Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) (Borthwick, 1999; Chieu and Ng, 2003), Transformation-based Learning (TBL) (Brill, 1995) or variants of them) might be unsatisfactory to learn linguistic information in Chinese NEs.",
        "Current state-of-the-art models often view Chinese NER as a classification or sequence labeling problem without considering the linguistic and structural information in Chinese NEs.",
        "They assume that entities are independent, however in most cases this assumption does not hold because of the existing relationships among the entities.",
        "They seek to locate and identify named entities in text by sequentially classifying tokens (words or characters) as to whether or not they participate in an NE, which is sometimes prone to noise and errors.",
        "In fact, Chinese NEs have distinct linguistic characteristics in their composition and human beings usually use prior knowledge to recognize NEs.",
        "For example, about 365 of the highest frequently used surnames cover 99% Chinese surnames (Sun et al., 1995).",

        "Inspired by the above observation, we propose a new framework based on probabilistic graphical models with first-order logic which treats Chinese NER as a statistical relational learning (SRL) problem and makes use of domain knowledge.",

        "We then exploit a variety of domain knowledge into Markov Logic Networks (MLNs), a powerful combination of logic and probability, to validate and correct errors made in the base system.",

        "Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001) are undirected graphical models trained to maximize the conditional probability of the desired outputs given the corresponding inputs.",
        "CRFs have the great flexibility to encode a wide variety of arbitrary, non-independent features and to straightforwardly combine rich domain knowledge.",
        "Furthermore, they are discriminatively trained, and are often more accurate than generative models, even with the same features.",
        "CRFs have been successfully applied to a number of real-world tasks, including NP chunking (Sha and Pereira, 2003), Chinese word segmentation (Peng et al., 2004), information extraction (Pinto et al., 2003; Peng and McCallum, 2004), named entity identification (Mc-Callum and Li, 2003; Settles, 2004), and many others.",

        "We also observe some important issues that significantly influence the performance as follows: Window size: The primitive window size we use is 5 ( 2 characters preceding the current character and 2 following the current character).",
        "We extend the window size to 7 but find that it slightly hurts.",
        "The reason is that CRFs can deal with non-independent features.",
        "A larger window size may introduce noisy and irrelevant features.",
        "Feature representation: For character features, we use character identities.",
        "For word features, BIES representation (each character is beginning of a word, inside of a word, end of a word, or a single word) is employed.",
        "Labeling scheme: The labeling scheme can be BIO, BIOE or BIOES representation.",
        "In BIO representation, each character is tagged as either the beginning of a named entity (B), a character inside a named entity (I), or a character outside a named entity (O).",
        "In BIOE, the last character in an entity is labeled as E while in BIOES, single-character entities are labeled as S. In general, BIOES representation is more informative and yields better results than both BIO and BIOE.",
        "Even though the CRF model is able to accommodate a large number of well-engineered features which can be easily obtained across languages, some NEs, especially LOCs and ORGs are difficult to identify due to the lack of linguistic or structural characteristics.",

        "We begin by briefly reviewing the necessary background of MLNs, including weight learning and inference.",
        "A Markov Network (also known as Markov Random Field) is a model for the joint distribution of a set of variables (Pearl, 1988).",
        "It is composed of an undirected graph G = (V, E) and a set of real-valued potential functions </>k. A First-Order Knowledge Base (KB) (Genesereth and Nisls-son, 1987) is a set of sentences or formulas in first-order logic.",
        "A Markov Logic Network (MLN) (Richardson and Domingos, 2006) is a KB with a weight attached to each formula (or clause).",
        "Together with a set of constants representing objects in the domain, it species a ground Markov Network containing one feature for each possible grounding of a first-order formula F in the KB, with the corresponding weight w. The basic idea in MLNs is that: when a world violates one formula in the KB it is less probable, but not impossible.",
        "The fewer formulas a world violates, the more probable it is.",
        "The weights associated with the formulas in an MLN jointly determine the probabilities of those formulas (and vice versa) via a log-linear model.",

        "These networks will have certain regularities in structure and parameter given by the MLN and they are called ground Markov Networks.",
        "Suppose Peter(A), Smith(B) and IBM(X) are 3 constants, a KB and generated features are listed in Table 1.",
        "The formula Employ(x,y) ==Person(x),Company(y) means x is employed by y and Colleague(x,y) == Employ(x,z) AEmploy(y,z) means x and y are colleagues if they are employed by the same company.",

        "In the case of Chinese NER, a named entity can be connected to another named entity for instance, because they share the same location salient word.",
        "Thus in an undirected graph, two node types exist, the LOC nodes and the location salient word nodes.",
        "The links (edges) indicate the relation (LOCs contain location salient words) between them.",
        "This representation can be well expressed by MLNs.",
        "However, one problem concerning relational data is, how to extract useful relations for Chinese NER.",
        "There are many kinds of relations between NEs, some relations are critical to the NER problem while others not.",
        "Another problem that we address is whether these relations can be formulated in first-order logic and combined in MLNs.",
        "In Section 3.3, we exploit domain knowledge.",

        "In this framework, the Gibbs sampling algorithm is to generate an instance from the distribution of each variable in turn, conditional on the current values of the other variables.",
        "The key to the Gibbs sampler is that one only considers univariate conditional distributions-the distribution when all of the random variables but one are assigned fixed values.",
        "One way to speed up Gibbs sampling is by Simulated Tempering (Marinari and Parisi, 1992), which performs simulation in a generalized ensemble, and can rapidly achieve an equilibrium state.",

        "MC-SAT works well and is guaranteed to be sound, even when deterministic or near-deterministic dependencies are present in real-world reasoning.",
        "Besides MCMC framework, maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference can be carried out using a weighted satisfiability solver like MaxWalkSAT.",
        "It is closely related to maximum likelihood (ML), but employs an augmented optimization objective which incorporates a prior distribution over the quantity one wants to estimate.",
