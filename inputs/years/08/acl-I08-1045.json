        "That is tested on all the baseline feature sets.",
        "In Table 2 the comparison is shown for only two features - f2 and f6 which are defined in Table 1.",
        "It may be observed that the relative advantage of using both gazetteer and context patterns together over using them individually is not much.",
        "For example, when gazetteer information are added with f2, the f-value is increased by 6.38%, when context patterns are added the f-value is increased by 6.64%., but when both are added the increment is 7.27%.",
        "This may be due to the fact that both gazetteer and context patterns lead to the same identifications.",
        "Using the comprehensive feature set (using gazetteer information and context patterns) the MaxEnt based NER system achieves the maximum f-value of 81.52%."
