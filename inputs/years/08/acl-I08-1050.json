        "It has been an assumption for text classification tasks to decide a class label independently of other class labels.",
        "However, as described in Section 1, scientific abstracts have typical moves of rhetorical roles: it would be very peculiar if result sentences appearing before method sentences were described in an abstract.",
        "Moreover, we would like to model the structure of abstract sentences rather than modeling just the section label for each sentence.",
        "Thus, the task is more suitably formalized as a sequence labeling problem: given an abstract with sentences x = (x1,...,xn), determine the optimal sequence of section names y = (y1, ...,yn) of all possible sequences.",

        "This paper presented a novel approach to identifying rhetorical roles in scientific abstracts using CRFs.",
        "The proposed method achieved more successful results than any other previous reports.",
        "The CRF classifier had roughly 5% advantage on per-abstract accuracy over SVM.",
        "The BI representation of section names also boosted the classification accuracy by 5%.",
        "In total, the proposed method gained more than 10% improvement on per-abstract accuracy.",
        "We have evaluated the proposed method only on medical literatures.",
        "In addition to improving the classification performance, a future direction for this study would be to examine the adaptability of the proposed method to include other types of texts.",
        "We are planning to construct a summarization system using the proposed method."
