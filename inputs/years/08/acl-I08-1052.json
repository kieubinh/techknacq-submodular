        "We found that extracted relations are reliable, and the transitivity in the taxonomy relatively valid.",
        "Relations inferred by transitivity, however, are less reliable than those directly derived from noun-classifier agreement.",
        "Future work includes investigating a way to enlarge classifier taxonomies.",
        "Currently, not all classifiers are included in our taxonomy, and it consists of a set of fragmented structures.",
        "A more sophisticated method to build a large taxonomy including more classifiers should be examined.",
        "Our method should also be refinedinorder tomake superordinate-subordinate relations inferred by the transitivity more reliable.",
        "We are now investigating a stepwise method to construct taxonomies that prefers more reliable relations, i.e. an initial taxonomy is built with a small number of highly reliable relations, and is then expanded with less reliable ones.",
