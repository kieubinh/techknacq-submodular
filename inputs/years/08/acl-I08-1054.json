        "In the field of automated question answering (QA), a variety of information sources and multiple extraction techniques can all contribute to producing relevant answers in response to natural-language questions submitted by users.",
        "Yet the nature of the information source which is mined for answers, together with the scope of the questions, have the most significant impact on the overall architecture of a QA system.",
        "When compared to the average queries submitted in a decentralized information seeking environment such as Web search, fact-seeking questions tend to specify better the nature of the information being sought by the user, whether it is the name of the longest river in some country, or the name of the general who defeated the Spanish Armada.",
        "In order to understand the structure and the linguistic clues encoded in natural-language questions, many QA systems employ sophisticated techniques, thus deriving useful information such as terms, relations among terms, the type of the expected answers (e.g., cities vs. countries vs. presidential candidates), and other semantic constraints (e.g., the elections from 1978 rather than any other year).",
        "One class of questions whose characteristics place them closer to exploratory queries, rather than standard fact-seeking questions, are definition questions.",
        "Seeking information about an entity or a concept, questions such as \"Who is Caetano Veloso?\" offer little guidance as to what particular techniques could be used in order to return relevant information from a large text collection.",
        "In fact, the same user may choose to submit a definition question or a simpler exploratory query (Caetano Veloso), and still look for text snippets capturing relevant properties of the question concept.",
        "Various studies (Chen et al., 2006; Han et al., 2006) illustrate the challenges introduced by definition questions.",
        "As such questions have a less irregular form than other open-domain questions, recognizing their type is relatively easier (Hildebrandt et al., 2004).",
        "Conversely, the identification of relevant documents and the extraction of answers to definition questions are more laborious, and the impact on the architecture of QA systems is quite significant.",
        "Indeed, separate, dedicated modules, or even end-to-end systems are specifically built for answering definition questions (Kla-vans and Mures, an, 2001; Hildebrandt et al., 2004; Greenwood and Saggion, 2004).",
        "The importance of definition questions among other question categories is confirmed by their inclusion among the evaluation queries from the QA track of TREC evaluations (Voorhees and Tice, 2000).",
        "This paper investigates the impact of temporallyanchored text snippets derived from the Web, in answering definition questions and, more generally, exploratory queries.",
        "Section 2 describes a lightweight mechanism for extracting text snippets and associated dates from sentences in Web documents.",
        "Section 3 assesses the coverage of the extracted snippets.",
        "As shown in Section 4, relevant events, in which the question concept was involved, can be captured by matching the queries on the text snippets, and organizing the snippets around the associated dates.",

        "All experiments rely on the unstructured text in approximately one billion documents in English from a 2003 Web repository snapshot of the Google search engine.",
        "Pre-processing of the documents consists in HTML tag removal, simplified sentence boundary detection, tokenization and part-of-speech tagging with the TnT tagger (Brants, 2000).",
        "No other tools or lexical resources are employed.",
        "A sequence of sentence tokens represents a potential date if it consists of: single year (four-digit numbers, e.g., 1929); or simple decade (e.g., 1930s); or month name and year (e.g., January 1929); or month name, day number and year (e.g., January 15, 1929).",
        "Dates occurring in text in any other format are ignored.",
        "To avoid spurious matches, such as 1929 people, potential dates are discarded if they are immediately followed by a noun or noun modifier, or immediately preceded by a noun.",
        "To convert document sentences into a few text snippets associated with dates, the overall structure of sentences is roughly approximated.",
        "Deep text analysis may be desirable but simply not feasible on the Web.",
        "As a lightweight alternative, the proposed extraction method approximates the occurrence and boundaries of text snippets through the following set of lexico-syntactic patterns: (Pi): (Date [,|-|(|nil] [when] Snippet [,|-|)|.]}",
        "(P2): ([StartSent] [In|On] Date [,|-|(|nil] Snippet [,|-|)|.]}",
        "(P3): ([StartSent] Snippet [in|on] Date [EndSent]} (P4): ([Verb] [OptionalAdverb] [in|on] Date}",
        "The first extraction pattern, Pi, targets sentences with adverbial relative clauses introduced by wh-adverbs and preceded by a date, e.g.:",
        "\"By [Date 1910], when [snippet Korea was annexed to Japan], the Korean population in America had grown to 5,008\".",
        "Comparatively, P2 and P3 match sentences that start or end in a simple adverbial phrase containing a date.",
        "In the case of P4, the occurrence of relevant dates within sentences is approximated by verbs followed by a simple adverbial phrase containing a date.",
        "P4 marks the entire sentence as a potential nugget because it lacks the punctuation clues in the other three patterns.",
        "The patterns must satisfy additional constraints in order to match a sentence.",
        "These constraints constitute heuristics to avoid, rather than solve, complex linguistic phenomena.",
        "Thus, a nugget is always discarded if it does not contain a verb, or contains any pronoun.",
        "Furthermore, the snippets in P2 and P3 must start with, and the nugget in P4 must contain a noun phrase, which in turn is approximated by the occurrence of a noun, adjective or determiner.",
        "The combination of patterns and constraints is by no means definitive or error-free.",
        "It is a practical solution to achieve graceful degradation on large amounts of data, reduce the extraction errors, and improve the usefulness of the extracted snippets.",
        "As such, it emphasizes robustness at Web scale, without taking advantage of existing specification languages for representing events and temporal expressions occurring in text (Pustejovsky et al., 2003), and forgoing the potential benefits of more complex methods that extract temporal relations from relatively clean text collections (Mani et al., 2006)."

        "A side effect of the latter heuristic is to boost the snippets in which the query terms occur as a phrase, rather than as scattered term matches.",
