        "Following the trend of non-factoid QA, we are seeing the emergence of work on why-QA; e.g., answering generic \"why X?\"",
        "questions (Verberne, 2006).",
        "However, since why-QA is an inherently difficult problem, there have only been a small number of fully implemented systems dedicated to solving it.",
        "Recent systems at NTCIR-6 Question Answering Challenge (QAC-4) can handle why-questions (Fukumoto et al., 2007).",
        "However, their performance is much lower (Mori et al., 2007) than that of factoid QA systems (Fukumoto et al., 2004; Voorhees and Dang, 2005).",
        "We consider that this low performance is due to the great amount of hand-crafting involved in the systems.",
        "Currently, most of the systems rely on hand-crafted patterns to extract and evaluate answer candidates (Fukumoto et al., 2007).",
        "Such patterns include typical cue phrases and POS-tag sequences related to causality, such as \"because of\"and \"by reason of\" However, as noted in (Inui and Okumura, 2005), causes are expressed in various forms, and it is difficult to cover all such expressions by hand.",
        "Hand-crafting is also very costly.",
        "Some patterns may be more indicative of causes than others.",
        "Therefore, it may be useful to assign different weights to the patterns for better answer candidate extraction, but currently this must be done by hand (Mori et al., 2007).",
        "It is not clear whether the weights determined by hand are suitable.",
        "In this paper, we propose a corpus-based approach for why-QA in order to reduce this hand-crafting effort.",
        "We automatically collect causal expressions from corpora to improve the coverage of causal expressions, and utilize a machine learning technique to train a ranker of answer candidates on the basis of features created from the expressions together with other possible features related to causality.",
        "The ranker is trained to maximize the QA performance with regards to a corpus of why-questions and answers, automatically tuning the weights of the features.",

        "Although systems that can answer why-questions are emerging, they tend to have limitations in that they can answer questions only with causal verbs (Girju, 2003), in specific domains (Khoo et al., 2000), or questions covered by a specific knowledge base (Curtis et al., 2005).",
        "Recently, Verberne (2006; 2007a) has been intensively working on why-QA based on the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1988).",
        "However, her approach requires manually annotated corpora with RST relations.",
        "When we look for fully implemented systems for generic \"why X?\"",
        "questions, we only find a small number of such systems.",
        "Since why-QA would be a challenging task when tackled straightforwardly, requiring common-sense knowledge and semantic interpretation of questions and answer candidates, current systems place higher priority on achiev-ability and therefore use hand-crafted patterns and heuristics to extract causal expressions as answer candidates and use conventional sentence similarity metrics for answer candidate evaluation (Fukumoto, 2007; Mori et al., 2007).",
        "We argue, in this paper, that this hand-crafting is the cause of the current low performance levels.",
        "Recently, (Shima and Mi-tamura, 2007) applied a machine learning approach towhy-QA,buttheyalsorelyonmanuallyselected cue words to create their features.",
        "Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) techniques can be used to automatically detect causal expressions.",
        "In the CoNLL-2005 shared task (SRL for English), the best system found causal adjuncts with a reasonable accuracy of 65% (Marquez et al., 2005).",
        "However, when we analyzed the data, we found that more than half of the causal adjuncts contain explicit cues such as \"because.\"",
        "Since causes are reported to be expressed by a wide variety of linguistic phenomena, not just explicit cues (Inui and Okumura, 2005), further verification is needed before SRL can be safely used for why-QA.",
        "Why-questions are a subset of non-factoid questions.",
        "Since non-factoid questions are observed in many FAQ sites, such sites have been regarded as valuable resources for the development of non-factoid QA systems.",
        "Examples include Burke et al.",
        "(1997), who used FAQ corpora to analyze questions to achieve accurate question-type matching; Soricut and Brill (2006), who used them to train statistical models for answer evaluation and formulation; and Mizuno et al.",

      "heading": "3. Approach",
      "text": [
        "In this paper, we propose a corpus-based approach for why-QA in order to reduce the hand-crafting effort that is currently necessary.",
        "We first automatically collect causal expressions from corpora and use them to create features to represent an answer candidate.",
        "The features are then used to train an answer candidate ranker that maximizes the QA performance with regards to a corpus of why-questions and answers.",
        "We also enumerate possible features that may be useful for why-QA to be incorporated in the training to improve the QA performance.",
        "Following the systems at QAC-4 (Fukumoto, 2007) and the answer analysis in (Verberne, 2007b; Verberne et al., 2007), we consider the task of why-QA to be a sentence/paragraph extraction task.",
        "We also assume that a document retrieval module of a system returns top-N documents for a question on the basis of conventional IR-related metrics and all sentences/paragraphs extracted from them are regarded as answer candidates.",
        "Hence, the task becomes the ranking of given sentences/paragraphs.",
        "For an answer candidate (a sentence or a paragraph) to be the correct answer, the candidate should (1) have an expression indicating a cause and (2) be similar to the question in content, and (3) some causal relation should be observed between the candidate and the question.",
        "For example, an answer candidate \"X was arrested for fraud.\"",
        "is likely to be a correct answer to the question \"Why was X arrested?\"",
        "because \"for fraud\" expresses a cause, the question and the answer are both about the same event (X being arrested), and \"fraud\" and \"arrest\" indicate a causal relation between the question and the candidate.",
        "Condition (3) would be especially useful when the candidates do not have obvious cues or topically similar words/phrases to the question; it may be worthwhile to rely on some prior causal knowledge to select one over others.",
        "Although current working systems (Fukumoto, 2007; Mori et al., 2007) do not explicitly state these conditions, they can be regarded as using hand-crafted patterns for (1) and (3).",
        "Lexical similarity metrics, such as cosine similarity and n-gram overlaps, are generally used for (2).",
        "We represent each answer candidate with causal expression, content similarity, and causal relation features that encode how it complies with the three conditions.",
        "Here, the causal expression features are those based on the causal expressions we aim to collect automatically.",
        "For the other two types of features, we turn to the existing similarity metrics and dictionaries to derive features that would be useful for why-QA.",
        "To train a ranker, we create a corpus of why-questions and answers and adopt one of the machine learning algorithms for ranking.",
        "The following sections describe the three types of features, the corpus creation, and the ranker training.",
        "The actual instances of the features, the corpus, and the ranker will be presented in Section 4.",
        "With the increasing attention paid to SRL, we currently have a number of corpora, such as PropBank that are tagged with semantic relations including a causal relation.",
        "Since text spans for such relations are annotated in the corpora, we can simply collect the spans marked by a causal relation as causal expressions.",
        "Since an answer candidate that has a matching expression for one of the collected causal expressions is likely to be expressing a cause as well, we can make the existence of each expression a feature.",
        "Although the collected causal expressions without any modification might be used to create features, for generality, it would be better to abstract them into syntactic patterns.",
        "From m causal expressions/patterns automatically extracted from corpora, we can create m binary features.",
        "In addition, some why-QA systems may already possess some good hand-crafted patterns to detect causal expressions.",
        "Since there is no reason not to use them if we know they are useful for why-QA, we can create a feature indicating whether an answer candidate matches existing hand-crafted patterns.",
        "In general, if a question and an answer candidate share many words, it is likely that they are about the same content.",
        "From this assumption, we create a feature that encodes the lexical similarity of an answer candidate to the question.",
        "To calculate its value, existing sentence similarity metrics, such as cosine similarity or n-gram overlaps, can be used.",
        "Even if a question and an answer candidate do not share the same words, they may still be about the same content.",
        "One such case is when they are about the same topic.",
        "To express this case as a feature, we can use the similarity of the question and the document in which the answer candidate is found.",
        "Since the documents from which we extract answer candidates typically have scores output by an IR engine that encode their relevance to the question, we can use this score or simply the rank of the retrieved document as a feature.",
        "A question and an answer candidate may be semantically expressing the same content with different expressions.",
        "The simplest case is when synonyms are used to describe the same content; e.g., when \"arrest\" is used instead of \"apprehend.\"",
        "For such cases, we can exploit existing thesauri.",
        "We can create a feature encoding whether synonyms of words in the question are found in the answer candidate.",
        "We could also use the value of semantic similarity and relatedness measures (Pedersen et al., 2004) or the existence of hypernym or hyponym relations as features.",
        "There are semantic lexicons where a semantic relation between concepts is indicated.",
        "For example, the EDR dictionary shows whether a causal relation holds between two concepts; e.g., between \"murder\" and \"arrest.\"",
        "Using such dictionaries, we can create pairs of expressions, one indicating a cause and the other its effect.",
        "If we find an expression for a cause in the answer candidate and that for an effect in the question, it is likely that they hold a causal relation.",
        "Therefore, we can create a feature encoding whether this is the case.",
        "In cases where such semantic lexicons are not available, they may be automatically constructed, although with noise, using causal mining techniques such as (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002; Girju, 2003; Chang and Choi, 2004).",
        "For ranker training, we need a corpus of why-questions and answers.",
        "Because we regard the task of why-QA as a ranking of given sentences/paragraphs, it is best to prepare the corpus in the same setting.",
        "Therefore, we use the following procedure to create the corpus: (a) create a question, (b) use an IR engine to retrieve documents for the question, (c) select among all sentences/paragraphs in the retrieved documents those that contain the answer to the question, and (d) store the question and a set of selected sentences/paragraphs with their document IDs as answers.",
        "Having created the QA corpus, we can apply existing machine learning algorithms for ranking, such as RankBoost (Freund et al., 2003) or Ranking SVM (Joachims, 2002), so that the selected sentences/paragraphs are preferred to non-selected ones on the basis of their features.",
        "Good ranking would result in good Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), which is one of the most commonly used measures in QA."
