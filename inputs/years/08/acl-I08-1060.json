        "Information retrieval (IR) could leverage synonyms to improve the coverage of search results (Qiu and Frei, 1993).",
        "For example, when we input the query 'transportation in India' into an IR system, the system can expand the query to its synonyms; e.g. 'transport' and 'railway', to find more documents.",

        "A bilingual synonym set is a set of translation-equivalent term pairs sharing the same meaning.",
        "Although a number of studies have aimed at identifying synonyms, this is the first study that simultaneously finds synonyms in two languages, to our best knowledge.",
        "Let us consider the case where a user enters the Japanese query 'kojo' (Xi|§, industrial plant) into a cross-lingual IR system to find English documents.",
        "After translating the query into the English translation equivalent, plant,' the cross-lingual IR system may expand the query to its English synonyms, e.g. factory,' and workshop,' and retrieve documents that include the expanded terms.",
        "However, the term plant' is ambiguous; the system may also expand the query to vegetable,' and the system is prevented by the term which is different from our intention.",
        "In contrast, the system can easily reject the latter expansion, vegetable,' if we are aware of bilingual synonyms, which indicate synonymous relations over bilingual lexicons: (kojo, plant) ~ (kojo, factory) and (shokubutsu, plant) ~ (shokubutsu, vegetable) (See Figure 1).",
        "The expression of the translation equivalent, (kojo, plant), helps a cross-lingual IR system to retrieve documents that include the term 'plant,' used in the meaning for kojo, or industrial plants.",

        "Designing features for bilingual synonyms such as spelling variations and bilingual associations, we train a classifier with a manually annotated bilingual lexicon with synonymous information.",
        "In order to evaluate the performance of our method, we carried out experiments to identify bilingual synonyms by two approaches: the direct identification of bilingual synonym pairs, and bilingual synonym pairs merged from two monolingual synonym lists.",
        "Experimental results show that our approach achieves the F-scores 89.3% in the former approach and 91.4% in the latter, thus outperforming the baseline method that employs only bilingual relations as its clues.",

        "These methods often extract not only synonyms, but also semantically related terms, such as antonyms, hyponyms and coordinate terms such as cat' and dog.'",
        "Some studies make use of bilingual corpora or dictionaries to find synonyms in a target language (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Shimohata and Sumita, 2002; Wu and Zhou, 2003; Lin et al., 2003).",

        "Although they make use of bilingual dictionaries, this study aims at finding bilingual synonyms directly.",
        "In the approaches based on monolingual dictionaries, the similarities of definitions of lexical items are important clues for identifying synonyms (Blon-del et al., 2004; Muller et al., 2006).",
        "For instance, Blondel et al.",
        "(2004) constructed an associated dictionary graph whose vertices are the terms, and whose edges from v1 to v2 represent occurrence of v2 in the definition for vi.",
        "They choose synonyms from the graph by collecting terms pointed to and from the same terms.",
        "Another strategy for finding synonyms is to consider the terms themselves.",
        "We divide it into two approaches: rule-based and distance-based.",
        "Rule-based approaches implement rules with language-specific patterns and detect variations by applying rules to terms.",
        "Stemming (Lovins, 1968; Porter, 1980) is one of the rule-based approaches, which cuts morphological suffix inflections, and obtains the stems of words.",
        "There are other types of variations for phrases; for example, insertion, deletion or substitution of words, and permutation of words such as view point' and point of view' are such variations (Daille et al., 1996).",
        "Distance-based approaches model the similarity or dissimilarity measure between two terms to find similar terms.",
        "The edit distance (Levenshtein, 1966) is the most widely-used measure, based on the minimum number of operations of insertion, deletion, or substitution of characters for transforming one term into another.",

        "To investigate the effectiveness of each feature, we compared the scores when we remove several features.",
        "Table 7 shows these results.",
        "Contrary to our intuition, we found that features of agreement of the first characters (hi) remarkably degraded the recall without gains in precision.",
        "One of the reasons for such results is that there are many cases of non-synonyms that have the same first character.",
        "We need to investigate more effective combinations of features or to apply other machine learning techniques for improving the performance.",
        "From these results, we consider that the features of h4 are effective for improving the recall, and that the features of h2 and h5 contribute improvement of both the precision and the recall.",
        "h3, h6, h7, and combinatorial features seem to improve the recall at the expense of precision.",
        "Which measure is important depends on the importance of our target for using this technique.",
        "It depends on the requirements that we emphasize, but in general the recall is more important for finding more bilingual synonyms."

        "This paper proposed a method for identifying bilingual synonyms in a bilingual lexicon by using clues of spelling variations.",
        "We described the notion of bilingual synonyms, and presented two approaches for identifying them: one is to directly predict the relation, and another is to merge monolingual synonyms identified, according to the bilingual lexicon.",
        "Our experiments showed that the proposed method significantly outperformed the method that did not use features primarily with spelling variations; the proposed method extracted bilingual synonyms with high precision and recall.",
        "In addition, we found that merging monolingual synonyms by the dictionary is effective for finding bilingual synonyms; there occur few errors through the assumption described in Section 3.2.1.",
        "Our future work contains implementing more features for identifying synonymous relations, constructing bilingual synonym sets, and evaluating our method for specific tasks such as thesaurus construction or cross-lingual information retrieval.",
        "Currently, the features used do not include other clues with spelling variations, such as the weighted edit distance, transformation patterns, stemming and so on.",
        "Another important clue is distributional information, such as the context.",
        "We can use both monolingual and bilingual corpora for extracting distributions of terms, and bilingual corpora are expected to be especially effective for our goal.",
        "We did not perform an experiment to construct bilingual synonym sets from synonym pairs in this paper.",
        "Described in Section 3.1, bilingual synonym sets can be constructed from bilingual synonym pairs by assuming some approximations.",
        "The approximation that permits transitivity of bilingual synonymous relations increases identified bilingual synonyms, and thus causes an increase in recall and decrease in precision.",
        "It is an open problem to find appropriate strategies for constructing bilingual synonym sets.",
        "Finally, we plan to evaluate our method for specific tasks.",
        "For data-driven machine translation, it is expected that data sparseness problem is alleviated by merging the occurrences of low-frequency terms.",
        "Another application is cross-lingual information retrieval, which can be improved by using candidate expanded queries from bilingual synonym sets."
