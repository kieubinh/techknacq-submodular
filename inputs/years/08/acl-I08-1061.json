        "We propose a seed learning based approach for extracting semantic relations (hyponyms, meronyms and cousins) that improves upon existing induction frameworks by combining evidence from multiple semantic relation types.",
        "We show that using a joint model for extracting different semantic relations helps to induce more relation-specific patterns and filter out the generic patterns.",
        "The patterns can then be used for extracting new wordpairs expressing the relation.",
        "Note that the only training data used in the algorithm are the few seed pairs required to start the bootstrapping process, which are relatively easy to obtain.",
        "We evaluate the taxonomy induction algorithm on English and a second language (Hindi) and show that it can reliably and accurately induce taxonomies in two diverse languages.",
        "We further show how having induced parallel taxonomies in two languages can be used for augmenting a translation dictionary between those two languages.",
        "We make use of the automatically induced hyponym/hypernym relations in each language to create a transitive \"bridge\" for dictionary induction.",
        "Specifically, the dictionary induction task relies on the key observation that words in two languages (e.g. English and Hindi) have increased probabilities of being translations of each other if their hypernyms or hyponyms are translations of one another."

        "To be able to automatically create taxonomies such as WordNet, it is useful to be able to learn not only hyponymy/hyponymy directly, but also the additional semantic relationships of meronymy and taxonomic cousinhood.",

        "Is X a hyponym of Y (e.g. weapon, gun)?",
        "2.",
        "Is X a part/member of Y (e.g. trigger, gun)?",

        "Following the pattern induction framework of Ravichandran and Hovy (2002), one of the ways of extracting different semantic relations is to learn patterns for each relation independently using seeds of that relation and extract new pairs using the learned patterns.",
        "For example, to build an independent model of hyponymy using this framework, we collected approximately 50 seed exemplars of hyponym pairs and extracted all the patterns that match with the seed pairs.",
        "As in Ravichandran and Hovy (2002), the patterns were ranked by corpus frequency and a frequency threshold was set to select the final patterns.",
        "These patterns were then used to extract new word pairs expressing the hy-ponymy relation by finding word pairs that occur with these patterns in an unlabeled corpus.",
        "However, the problem with this approach is that generic patterns (like \"X and Y\") occur many times in a corpus and thus low-precision patterns may end up with high cumulative scores.",
        "This problem is illustrated more clearly in Table 1, which shows a list of top five hyponymy patterns (ranked by their corpus frequency) using this approach.",
        "We overcome this problem by exploiting the multi-class nature of our task and combine evidence from multiple relations in order to learn high precision patterns (with high conditional probabilities) for each relation.",
