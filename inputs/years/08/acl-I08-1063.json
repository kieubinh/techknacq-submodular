        "In a special case in which the output nodes of the graphical model are linked by edges in a linear chain, CRFs make a first-order Markov independence assumption with binary feature functions, and thus can be understood as conditionally-trained finite state machines (FSMs) which are suitable for sequence l abeling.",

        "For example, a feature may have the value of 0 in most cases, but given the text \"points for consideration\", it has the value 1 along the transition where lt-1 corresponds to a state with the label identifying the case, lt corresponds to a state with the label history of the case, and fk is the feature function PHRASE= \"points for consideration\" belongs to s at position t in the sequence.",

        "Our approach to produce the summary is extraction-based method which identifies important elements present in a legal judgment.",

        "The automatic text summarization process starts with sending legal document to a preprocessing stage.",
        "In this preprocessing stage, the document is to be divided into segments, sentences and tokens.",
        "We have introduced some new feature identification techniques to explore paragraph alignments.",
        "This process includes the understanding of abbreviated texts and section numbers and arguments which are very specific to the structure of legal documents.",
        "The other useful statistical natural language processing tools, such as filtering out stop list words, stemming etc., are carried out i n the preprocessing stage.",
        "The resulting intelligible words are useful in the normalization of terms in the term distribution model (Saravanan et al.",
        ", 2006).",
        "During the final stage, we have altered the ranks or removed some of the sentences from the final summary based on the structure discovered using CRF.",
        "The summarization module architecture is shown in Figure 3.",
        "The application of term distribution model brings out a good extract of sentences present in a legal document to generate a summary.",
        "The sentences with labels identified during CRF implementation can be used with the term distribution model to give more significance to some of the sentences with specific roles.",

        "Our approach to summary extraction is based on the extended version of term weighting method.",
        "With the identified roles, the important sentences generated in the probabilistic model will be reordered or suppressed in the final summary.",
        "The evaluation results show that the summary generated by our summarizer is closer to the human generated head notes, compared to the other methods considered in this study.",
        "Hence the legal community will get a better insight without reading a full judgment.",
