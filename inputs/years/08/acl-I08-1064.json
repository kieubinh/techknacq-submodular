        "Likewise, the components of the multi-word timex last night align with German gestern and abend, respectively, and the timex tag is transferred to the expression gestern abend.",
        "Projection-based approaches to multilingual annotation have proven adequate in various domains, including part-of-speech tagging (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001), NP-bracketing (Yarowsky et al., 2001), dependency analysis (Hwa et al., 2005), and role semantic analysis (Padó and Lapata, 2006).",

        "Cross-lingually projected information is typically noisy, due to errors in the source annotations as well as in the word alignment.",
        "Moreover, successful projection relies on the direct correspondence assumption (DCA, Hwa et al.",
        "(2002)) which demands that the annotations in the source text be homomorphous with those in its (literal) translation.",
        "The DCA has been found to hold, to a substantial degree, for the above mentioned domains.",
        "The results we report here show that it can also be confirmed for temporal annotations in English and German.",
        "Yet, we cannot preclude divergence from translational correspondence; on the contrary, it occurs routinely and to a certain extent systematically (Dorr, 1994).",
        "We employ two different techniques to filter noise.",
        "Firstly, the projection process is equipped with (partly language-specific) knowledge for a principled account of typical alignment errors and cross-language discrepancies in the realisation of events and timexes (section 3.2).",
        "Secondly, we apply aggressive data engineering techniques to the noisy projections and use them to train statistical classifiers which generalise beyond the noise (section 5).",

        "Linguistic constraints.",
        "Following Padó and Lapata (2006), we implement a filter which discards alignments to non-content words, for two reasons: (i) alignment algorithms are known to perform poorly on non-content words, and (ii) events as well as timexes are necessarily content-bearing and hence unlikely to be realised by non-content words.",
        "This non-content (NC) filter is defined in terms of POS tags and affects conjunctions, prepositions and punctuation.",
        "In the context of temporal annotations, we extend the scope of the filter such that it effectively applies to all word classes that we deem unlikely to occur as part of a temporal entity.",
        "Therefore, the NC filter is actually defined stronger for events than for timexes, in that it further blocks projection of events to pronouns, whereas pronouns may be part of a timex such as jeden Freitag 'every Friday'.",
        "Moreover, events prohibit the projection to adverbs; this restriction is motivated by the fact that events in English are frequently translated in German as adverbials which lack an event reading (cf. head switching translations like prefer to X vs. German lieber X 'rather X').",
        "We also devise an unknown word filter: it applies to words for which no lemma could be identified in the preprocessing stage.",
        "Projection to unknown words is prohibited unless the alignment is supported bidirectionally.",
        "The strictness concerning unknown words is due to the empirical observation that alignments which involve such words are frequently incorrect.",
        "In order to adhere to the TimeML specification, a simple transformation ensures that articles and contracted prepositions such as am 'on the' are included in the extent of timexes.",
        "Another heuristics is designed to remedy alignment errors involving auxiliary and modal verbs, which are not to be annotated as events.",
        "If an event aligns to more than one word, then this filter singles out the main verb or noun and discards auxiliaries.",
        "Topological constraints.",
        "In section 3.1, we described a conservative projection principle which rejects the transfer of annotations to non-contiguous sequences.",
        "That model sets an unnecessarily modest upper bound on recall; but giving up the contiguity requirement entirely is not sensible either, since it is indeed highly unlikely for temporal entities to be realised discontinuously in either source or target language (noun phrase cohesion, Yarowsky and Ngai (2001)).",
        "Based on these observations, we propose two refined models which manipulate the projected annotation span so as to ensure contiguity.",
        "One model identifies and discards outlier alignments, which actively violate contiguity; the other one adds missing alignments, which form gaps.",
        "Technically, both models establish convexity in non-convex sets.",
        "Hence, we first have to come up with a backbone model which is less restrictive than the baseline, so that the convexation models will have a basis to operate on.",
        "A possible backbone model at,o is provided in (1).",
        "This model simply gathers all words aligned with any word covered by e in the source annotation, irrespective of contiguity in the resulting sequence of words.",
        "Discarding outlier alignments is then formalised as a reduction of at)0's output to (one of) its greatest convex subset(s) (GCS).",
        "Let us call this model at,Gcs.",
        "In terms of a linear sequence of words, at;GCS chooses the longest contiguous subsequence.",
        "The GCS-model thus serves a filtering purpose similar to the NC filter.",
        "However, whereas the latter discards single alignment links on linguistic grounds, the former is motivated by topological properties of the alignment as a whole.",
        "The second model, which fills gaps in the word alignment, constructs the convex hull of at;0 (cf. Padó and Lapata (2005)).",
