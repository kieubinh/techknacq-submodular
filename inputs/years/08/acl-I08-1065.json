        "The growing interest in practical NLP applications such as question answering, information extraction and multi-document summarization places increasing demands on the processing of relations between textual fragments such as entailment and causal relations.",
        "Such applications often need to rely on a large amount of lexical semantic knowledge.",
        "For example, a causal (and entailment) relation holds between the verb phrases wash something and something is clean, which reflects the commonsense notion that if someone has washed something, this object is clean as a result of the washing event.",
        "A crucial issue is how to obtain and maintain a potentially huge collection of such event relations instances.",
        "Motivated by this background, several research groups have reported their experiments on automatic acquisition of causal, temporal and entailment relations between event mentions (typically verbs or verb phrases) (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Inui et al., 2003; Chklovski and Pantel, 2005; Torisawa, 2006; Pekar, 2006; Zanzotto et al., 2006, etc.).",
        "The common idea behind them is to use a small number of manually selected generic lexico-syntactic cooccurrence patterns (LSPs or simply patterns).",
        "to Verb-X and then Verb-Y, for example, is used to obtain temporal relations such as marry and divorce(Chklovski and Pantel, 2005).",
        "The use of such generic patterns, however, tends to be high recall but low precision, which requires an additional component for pruning extracted relations.",
        "This issue has been addressed in basically two approaches, either by devising heuristic statistical scores (Chklovski and Pantel, 2005; Torisawa, 2006; Zanzotto et al., 2006) or training classifiers for disambiguation with heavy supervision (Inui et al., 2003).",
        "This paper explores a third way for enhancing present LSP-based methods for event relation acquisition.",
        "The basic idea is inspired by the following recent findings in relation extraction (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006, etc.",
        "), which aims at extracting semantic relations between entities (as opposed to events) from texts.",
        "(a) The use of generic patterns tends to be high recall but low precision, which requires an additional component for pruning.",
        "(b) On the other hand, there are specific patterns that are highly reliable but they are much less frequent than generic patterns and each makes only a small contribution to recall.",
        "(c) Combining a few generic patters with a much larger collection of reliable specific patterns boosts both precision and recall.",
        "Such specific patterns can be acquired from a very large corpus with seeds.",
        "Given these insights, an intriguing question is whether the same story applies to event relation acquisition as well or not.",
        "In this paper, we explore this issue through the following steps.",
        "First, while previous methods use only verb-verb cooccurrences, we use cooccurrences between verbal nouns and verbs such as cannot {find out (something)) due to the lack of {investigation) as well as verb-verb cooccurrences.",
        "This extension dramatically enlarge the pool of potential candidate LSPs (Section 4.1).",
        "Second, we extend Pantel and Pennacchiotti (2006)'s Espresso algorithm, which induces specific reliable LSPs in a bootstrapping manner for entity relation extraction, so that the extended algorithm can apply to event relations (Sections 4.2 to 4.4).",
        "Third, we report on the present results of our empirical experiments, where the extended algorithm is applied to a Japanese 500M-sentence Web corpus to acquire two types of event relations, action-effect and action-means relations (Section 5)"

        "Perhaps a simplest way of using LSPs for event relation acquisition can be seen in the method Chklovski and Pantel (2005) employ to develop VerbOcean.",
        "Their method uses a small number of manually selected generic LSPs such as to Verb-X and then Verb-Y to obtain six types of semantic relations including strength (e.g. taint - poison) and happens-before (e.g. marry - divorce) and obtain about 29,000 verb pairs with 65.5% precision.",

        "On the other hand, however, the argument kogeme (a burn) of the verb tsuku (get) cannot be dropped; otherwise, the relation would no longer hold.",
        "One straightforward way to address this problem is to expand each cooccurrence sample to those corresponding to different degrees of generalization and feed them to the relation extraction model so that its scoring function can select appropriate event pairs from expanded samples.",

        "Related to this issue, it is also crucial to devise a method for controlling argument sharing patterns.",
        "One possible approach is to employ state-of-the-art techniques for coreference and zero-anaphora resolution (Iida et al., 2006; Komachi et al., 2007, etc.)",
