        "Techniques for leveraging syntactic and morphological information for statistical machine translation (SMT) are receiving a fair amount ofattention nowadays.",
        "For SMT from English to Indian languages, these techniques are especially important for the following three reasons: (i) Indian languages differ widely from English in terms of word-order; (ii) Indian languages are morphologically quite rich; and (iii) large amounts of parallel corpora are not available for these languages, though smaller amounts of text in specific domains (such as health, tourism, and agriculture) are now becoming accessible.",
        "It might therefore be expected that using syntactic and morphological information for English to Indian language SMT will prove highly beneficial in terms of achieving reasonable performance out of limited parallel corpora.",
        "However, the difficulty in this is that crucial tools, such as parsers and morphological analyzers, are not widely available for Indian languages yet.",
