        "One of the common characteristics of human languages is that the same concept can be expressed by various linguistic expressions.",
        "Such linguistic variations are called paraphrases.",
        "Handling paraphrases is one of the key issues in a broad range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks.",
        "In information retrieval, information extraction, and question answering, technology of recognizing if or not the given pair of expressions are paraphrases is desired to gain a higher coverage.",
        "On the other hand, a system which generates paraphrases for given expressions is useful for text-transcoding tasks, such as machine translation and summarization, as well as beneficial to human, for instance, in text-to-speech, text simplification, and writing assistance.",
        "Paraphrase phenomena can roughly be divided into two groups according to their compositionality.",
        "Examples in (1) exhibit a degree of compositional-ity, while each example in (2) is composed of totally different lexical items.",
        "(1) a. be in our favor o be favorable for us b. show a sharp decrease o decrease sharply",
        "(2) a. burst into tears o cried b. comfort o console",
        "(Barzilay and McKeown, 2001) A number of studies have been carried out on both compositional (morpho-syntactic) and non-compositional (lexical and idiomatic) paraphrases (see Section 2).",
        "In most research, paraphrases have been represented with the similar templates, such as shownin (3) and(4).",

        "(4) a. X wrote Y o X is the author of Y b. X solves Y o X deals with Y",
        "The weakness of these templates is that they should be applied only in some contexts.",
        "In other words, the lack of applicability conditions for slot fillers may lead incorrect paraphrases.",
        "One way to specify the applicability condition is to enumerate correct slot fillers.",
        "For example, Pantel et al.",
        "(2007) have harvested instances for the given paraphrase templates based on the co-occurrence statistics of slot fillers and lexicalized part of templates (e.g. \"deal with\" in (4b)).",
        "Yet, there is no method which assesses semantic equivalence and syntactic substitutability of resultant pairs of expressions.",
        "In this paper, we propose a method of directly computing semantic equivalence and syntactic substitutability, i.e., paraphrasability, particularly focusing on automatically generated compositional paraphrases (henceforth, syntactic variants) of predicate phrases.",
        "While previous studies have mainly targeted at words or canned phrases, we treat predicate phrases having a bit more complex structures.",
        "This paper addresses two issues in handling phrases.",
        "The first is feature engineering.",
        "Generally speaking, phrases appear less frequently than single words.",

        "• t holds if s holds",
        "• t is substitutable for s in some context Most previous studies on acquiring paraphrase rules have evaluated resultant pairs from only the second viewpoint, i.e., semantic equivalence.",
