        "Wikipedia, one of the most frequently visited web sites nowadays, contains the largest amount of knowledge ever gathered in one place by volunteer contributors around the world (Poe, 2006).",
        "Each Wikipedia article contains information about one entity or concept, gathers information about entities of one particular type of entities (the so-called list pages), or provides information about homonyms (disambiguation pages).",
        "As of July 2007, Wikipedia contains close to two million articles in English.",
        "In addition to the English-language version, there are 200 versions in other languages.",
        "Wikipedia has about 5 million registered contributors, averaging more than 10 edits per contributor.",
        "Natural language processing and search tools can greatly benefit from Wikipedia by using it as an authoritative source of common knowledge and by exploiting its interlinked structure and disambiguation pages, or by extracting concept cooccurrence information.",
        "This paper presents a successful study on enriching the Wikipedia data with named entity tags.",
        "Such tags could be employed by disambiguation systems such as Bunescu and Pa§ca (2006) and Cucerzan (2007), in mining relationships between named entities, or in extracting useful facet terms from news articles (e.g., Dakka and Ipeirotis, 2008).",
        "In this work, we classify the Wikipedia pages into categories similar to those used in the CoNLL shared tasks (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002; Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003) and ACE (Doddington et al., 2004).",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to perform such classification on the English language version of the collection.",
        "Although the task settings are different, the results we obtained are comparable with those previously reported in document classification tasks.",
        "We examined the Wikipedia pages to extract several feature groups for our classification task.",
        "We also observed that each entity/concept has at least two pseudo-independent views (page-based features and link-based features), which allow the use a co-training method to boost the performance of classifiers trained separately on each view.",
        "The classifier that achieved the best accuracy on out test set was applied then to all Wikipedia pages and its classifications are provided to the academic community for use in future studies through a Web service."

        "This study is related to the area of named entity recognition, which has supported extensive evaluations (CoNLL and ACE).",
        "Since the introduction of this task in MUC-6 (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996), numerous systems using various ways of exploiting entity-specific and local context features were proposed, from relatively simple character-based models such as Cucerzan and Yarowsky (2002) and Klein et al.",

        "(1997), Fleischman and Hovy (2002), and Florian et al.",
        "(2003).",
        "While the task we address is not the conventional named entity recognition but rather document classification, our classes are a derived from the labels traditionally employed in named entity recognition, following the CoNLL and ACE guidelines, as described in Section 3.",
        "The areas of text categorization and document classification have also been extensively researched over time.",
        "These task have the goal of assigning to each document in a collection one or several labels from a given set, such as Newsgroups (Lang, 1995), Reuters (Reuters, 1997), Yahoo!",
        "(Mladenic, 1998), Open Directory Project (Chakrabarti et al., 2002), and Hoover's Online (Yang et al., 2002).",
        "Various supervised machine learning algorithms have been applied successfully to the document classification problem (e.g., Joachims, 1999; Quinlan, 1993; Cohen, 1995).",
        "Dumais et al.",
        "(1998) and Yang and Liu (1999) reported that support vector machines (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbor performed the best in text categorization.",
        "We adopted SVM as our algorithm of choice because of these findings and also because SVMs have been shown robust to noise in the feature set in several studies.",
        "While Joachims (1998) and Rogati and Yang (2002) reported no improvement in SVM performance after applying a feature selection step, Gabrilovich and Markovitch (2004) showed that for collection with numerous redundant features, aggressive feature selection allowed SVMs to actually improve their performance.",
        "However, performing an extensive investigation of classification performance across various machine learning algorithms has been beyond the purpose of this work, in which we ran classification experiments using SVMs and compared them only with the results of similar systems employing Naive Bayes.",
        "In addition to the traditional bag-of-words, which has been extensively used for the document classification task (e.g. Sebastiani, 2002), we employed various other Wikipedia-specific feature sets.",
        "Some of these have been previously employed for various tasks by Gabrilovich and Markovitch, (2007) , and Suchanek et al.",

        "The Wikipedia pages that we analyzed in this study can be divided into three types:",
        "Disambiguation Page (DIS): is a special kind of page that usually contains the word \"disambiguation\" in its title, and that contains several possible disambiguations of a term.",
        "Common Page (COMM): refers to a common object rather than a named entity.",
        "Generally, if the name of an object or concept appears noncapitalized in text then it is very likely that the object or the concept is of common nature (heuristic previously employed by Bunescu and Pa§ca, 2006).",
        "For example, the Wikipedia page \"Guitar\" refers to a common object rather than a named entity.",
        "Named Entity Page: refers to a specific object or set of objects in the world, which is/are commonly referred to using a certain proper noun phrase.",
        "For example, any particular person is a named entity, though the concept of \"people\" is not a named entity.",
        "Note that most names are ambiguous.",
        "\"Apollo\" can refer to more than 30 different entities of different types, for example, the Finnish rock band of the late 1960s/early 1970s , the Greek god of light, healing, and poetry, and the series of space missions run by NASA.",
        "To classify the named entities in Wikipedia, we adopted a restricted version of the ACE guidelines (ACE), using four main entity classes (also similar to the classes employed in the CoNLL evaluations):",
        "Animated Entities (PER): An animate entity can be either of type human or non-human.",
        "Human entities are either humans that are known to have lived (e.g., \"Leonardo da Vinci\", \"Britney Spears\", \"Gotthard of Hildesheim\", \"Saint Godehard\") or humanoid individuals in fictional works, such as books, movies, TV shows, and comics (e.g., \"Harry Potter\", \"Batman\", \"Sonny\" the robot from the movie \"I, Robot\").",
        "Fictional characters also include mythological figures and deities (e.g. \"Zeus\", \"Apollo\", \"Jupiter\").",
        "The fictional nature of a character must be explicitly indicated.",
        "Non-human entities are any particular animal or alien that has lived or that is described in a fictional work and can be singled out using a name.",
        "Organization Entities (ORG): An organization entity must have some formally established association.",
        "Typical examples are businesses (e.g., \"Microsoft\", \"Ford\"), governmental bodies (e.g., \"United States Congress\"), non-governmental organizations (e.g., \"Republican Party\", \"American Bar Association\"), science and health units (e.g., \"Massachusetts General Hospital\"), sports organizations and teams (e.g., \"Angolan Football Federation\", \"San Francisco 49ers\"), religious organizations (e.g., \"Church of Christ\"), and entertainment organizations, including formally organized music groups (e.g., \"San Francisco Mime Troupe\", the rock band \"The Police\").",
        "Industrial sectors and industries (e.g., \"Petroleum industry\") are also treated as organization entities, as well as all media and publications.",
        "Location Entities (LOC): These are physical locations (regions in space) defined by geographical, astronomical, or political criteria.",
        "They are of three types: Geo-Political entities are composite entities comprised of a physical location, a population, a government, and a nation (or province, state, county, city, etc.).",
        "A Wikipedia page that mentions all these components should be labeled as GeoPolitical Entity (e.g., \"Hawaii\", \"European Union\", \"Australia\", and \"Washington, D.C.\").",
        "Locations are places defined on a geographical or astronomical basis and do not constitute a political entity.",
        "These include mountains, rivers, seas, islands, continents (e.g., \"the Solar system\", \"Mars\", \"Hudson River\", and \"Mount Rainier\").",
        "Facilities are artifacts in the domain of architecture and civil engineering, such as buildings and other permanent man-made structures and real estate improvements: airports, highways, streets, etc.",
        "Miscellaneous Entities (MISC): About 25% of the named entities in Wikipedia are not of the types listed above.",
        "By examining several hundred examples, we concluded that the majority of these named entities can be classified in one of the following classes: Events refer to historical events or actions with some certain duration, such as wars,",
        "FIFA World Cup\", \"Olympic Games\", \"O.J.",
        "Simpson trial\").",
        "Works of art refer to named works that are imaginative in nature.",
        "Examples include books, movies, TV programs, etc.",
        "(e.g., the \"Batman\" movie, \"The Tonight Show\", the \"Harry Potter\" books).",
        "Artifacts refer to man-made objects or products that have a name and cannot generally be labeled as art.",
        "This includes mass-produced merchandise and lines of products (e.g. the camera \"Canon PowerShot Pro1\", the series \"Canon PowerShot\", the type of car \"Ford Mustang\", the software \"Windows XP\").",
        "Finally Processes include all named physical and chemical processes (e.g., \"Ettinghausen effect\").",

        "Recently, the Wikipedia foundation has been taken steps toward enforcing a more systematic way to add useful structured data on each page by suggesting templates to use when a new page gets added to the collection.",
        "This suggests that in a not-so-distant future, we may be able to utilize the structured data features as attribute-value pairs rather than as bags of words, which is prone to losing valuable semantic information.",
        "Finally, we have applied our classifier to all Wikipedia pages to determine their labels and made these data available in the form of a Web service, which can positively contribute to future studies that employ the Wikipedia collection."
