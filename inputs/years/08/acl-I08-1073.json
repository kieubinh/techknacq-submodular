        "Word sense disambiguation (wsd) has been an active area of research over the last decade because many researches believe it will be important for applications which require, or would benefit from, some degree of semantic interpretation.",
        "There has been considerable skepticism over whether wsd will actually improve performance of applications, but we are now starting to see improvement in performance due to wsd in cross-lingual information retrieval (Clough and Stevenson, 2004; Vossen et al., 2006) and machine translation (Carpuat and Wu, 2007; Chan et al., 2007) and we hope that other applications such as question-answering, text simplification and summarisation might also benefit as wsd methods improve.",
        "In addition to contextual evidence, most wsd systems exploit information on the most likely meaning of a word regardless of context.",
        "This is a powerful back-off strategy given the skewed nature of word sense distributions.",
        "For example, in the English coarse grained all words task (Navigli et al., 2007) at the recent SemEval Workshop the baseline of choosing the most frequent sense using the first WordNet sense attained precision and recall of 78.9% which is only a few percent lower than the top scoring system which obtained 82.5%.",
        "This finding is in line with previous results (Snyder and Palmer, 2004).",
        "Systems using a first sense heuristic have relied on sense-tagged data or lexicographer judgment as to which is the predominant sense of a word.",
        "However sense-tagged data is expensive and furthermore the predominant sense of a word will vary depending on the domain (Koeling et al., 2005; Chan and Ng, 2007).",
        "One direction of research following McCarthy et al.",
        "(2004) has been to learn the most predominant sense of a word automatically.",
        "McCarthy et al's method relies on two methods of similarity.",
        "Firstly, distributional similarity is used to estimate the predominance of a sense from the number of distribu-tionally similar words and the strength of their distributional similarity to the target word.",
        "This is done on the premise that more prevalent meanings have more evidence in the corpus data used for the distributional similarity calculations and the distribution-ally similar words (nearest neighbours) to a target reflect the more predominant meanings as a consequence.",
        "Secondly, the senses in the sense inventory are linked to the nearest neighbours using semantic similarity which incorporates information from the sense inventory.",
        "It is this semantic similarity measure which is the focus of our paper in the context of the method for acquiring predominant senses.",
        "Whilst the McCarthy et al.",
        "'s method works well for English, other inventories do not always have WordNet style resources to tie the nearest neighbours to the sense inventory.",
        "WordNet has many semantic relations as well as glosses associated with its synsets (near synonym sets).",
        "While traditional dictionaries do not organise senses into synsets, they do typically have sense definitions associated with the senses.",
        "McCarthy et al.",
        "(2004) suggest that dictionary definitions can be used with their method, however in the implementation of the measure based on dictionary definitions that they use, the dictionary definitions are extended to those of related words using the hierarchical structure of WordNet (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2002).",
        "This extension to the original method (Lesk, 1986) was proposed because there is not always sufficient overlap of the individual words for which semantic similarity is being computed.",
        "In this paper we refer to the original method (Lesk, 1986) as lesk and the extended measure proposed by Banerjee and Pedersen as Elesk.",
        "This paper investigates the potential of using the overlap of dictionary definitions with the McCarthy et al.",
        "'s method.",
        "We test the method for obtaining a first sense heuristic using two publicly available datasets of sense-tagged data in Japanese, EDR (NICT, 2002) and the Senseval-2 Japanese dictionary task (Shirai, 2001).",
        "We contrast an implementation of lesk (Lesk, 1986) which uses only dictionary definitions with the Jiang-Conrath measure (jcn) (Jiang and Conrath, 1997) which uses manually produced hyponym links and was used previously for this purpose on English datasets (McCarthy et al., 2004).",
        "The jcn measure is only applicable to the EDR dataset because the dictionary has hyponymy links which are not available in the Senseval-2 Japanese dictionary task.",
        "We also propose a new extension to lesk which does not require hand-crafted hyponym links but instead uses distributional similarity to increase the possibilities for overlap of the word definitions.",
        "We refer to this new measure as DSlesk.",
        "We compare this to the original lesk on both datasets and show that it increases recall, and sometimes precision too whilst not requiring hyponym links.",
        "In the next section we place our contribution in relation to previous work.",
        "In section 3 we summarise the methods we adopt from previous work, and describe our proposal for a semantic similarity method that can supplement the information from dictionary definitions with information from raw text.",
        "In section 4 we describe the experiments on EDR and the Senseval-2 Japanese dictionary task and we conclude in section 5."

        "For each word in each of the two texts they obtain the maximum similarity between the word and any of the words from the putative paraphrase.",
        "The similarity scores for each word of both phrases contribute to an overall semantic similarity between 0 and 1 and a threshold of 0.5 is used to decide if the candidate phrases are paraphrases.",

        "There are several issues for future directions of automatic detection of a first sense heuristic.",
        "In this paper, we proposed an adaptation of the lesk measure of gloss-based similarity, by using the average similarity between nouns in the two glosses under comparison in a bag-of-words approach without recourse to other information.",
        "However, it would be worthwhile exploring other information in the glosses, such as words of other PoS and predicate argument relations.",
        "We also hope to investigate applying alignment techniques introduced for entailment recognition (Hickl and Bensley, 2007).",
        "Another important issue in WSD is to group finegrained word senses into clusters, making the task suitable for NLP applications (Ide and Wilks, 2006).",
        "We believe that our gloss-based similarity DSlesk might be very suitable for this task and we plan to investigate the possibility.",
        "There are other approaches we would like to explore in future.",
        "Mihalcea (2005) uses dictionary definitions alongside graphical algorithms for unsupervised WSD.",
        "Whilst the results are not directly comparable to ours because we have not included contextual evidence in our models, it would be worthwhile exploring if unsupervised graphical models using only the definitions we have in our lexical resources can perform WSD on a document and give more reliable first sense heuristics."
