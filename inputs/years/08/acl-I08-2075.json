        "Sanskrit language and its grammar had exterted an emphatic impact on Computer Science and related research areas.",

        "MT of Sanskrit is never an easy task, because of structural vastness of its Grammar.",
        "Besides, its strutural vastness Sanskrit Grammar is well organized and least ambigious compared to other natural languages, illustrated by the fact of increasing fascination for this ancient Aryan language.",
        "Its grammar possesses well organized rules and meta rules to infer those rules, thus proving to be a powerful analogy to context free grammar of a computer language.",
        "Subsequently, it supports the idea of developing a parser for Sanskrit language, that would be helpful in developing a full-fledged MT system.",
        "As a part of development of parser, there are other important aspects to be taken care off.",
        "A morphological analyser and a tokenizer are two of the important components that play a vital role in the parser.",
        "A morphological analyser is used for identification of the base words from their morphonemes, further to understand the semantics of the original text.",
        "A tokenizer also plays its significant part in a parser, by identifying the group or collection of words, existing as a single and complex word in a sentence.",
        "Later on, it breaks up the complex word into its constituents in their appropriate forms.",
        "In Sanskrit, mainly we have two categories of complex words.",
        "They are• Sandhi",
        "• Samaas 1.1 Sandhi and Samaas",
        "Sandhi: When two words combine to produce a new word whose point of combination is result of annihilation of case-end of former word and case-begin of latter.",
        "In short, the resulted new character that has been created at the point of combination is exactly equivalent to the sound produced when those two words are uttered without a pause.",
        "The inverse procedure to Sandhi-formation is known as Sandhi Wicched.",
        "On the other hand, when two or more words are combined, based on their semantics then the resulting word is known as Samaas or Compound.",
        "Unlike",
        "Sandhi, the point of combination in Samaas may or may not be a deformed in the resulting word.",
        "The inverse procedure of breakup of a Samaas is known as Samaas Vigraha.",
        "Considering the complexity of this problem, we restricted our focus to Samaas Vigraha or Compound Dissolution(hereafter Compound Dissolution is referred as CD for convenience).",
