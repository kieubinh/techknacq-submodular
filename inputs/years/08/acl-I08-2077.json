        "Named Entity Recognition (NER) is an important tool in almost all Natural Language Processing (NLP) application areas.",
        "Proper identification and classification of named entities (NEs) are very crucial and pose a very big challenge to the NLP researchers.",
        "The level of ambiguity in NER makes it difficult to attain human performance.",
        "NER has applications in several domains including information extraction, information retrieval, question-answering, automatic summarization, machine translation etc.",
        "The current trend in NER is to use the machine-learning approach, which is more attractive in that it is trainable and adoptable and the maintenance of a machine-learning system is much cheaper than that of a rule-based one.",
        "The representative machine-learning approaches used in NER are Hidden Markov Model (HMM) (BBN's IdentiFinder in (Bikel et al., 1999)), Maximum Entropy (New York University's MENE in (Borthwick, 1999)) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001; McCallum and Li, 2003).",
        "There is no concept of capitalization in Indian languages (ILs) like English and this fact makes the NER task more difficult and challenging in ILs.",
        "There has been very little work in the area of NER in ILs.",
        "In Indian languages particularly in Bengali, the work in NER can be found in (Ekbal and Bandyopadhyay, 2007a; Ekbal and Bandyopadhyay, 2007b) with pattern directed shallow parsing approach and in (Ekbal et al., 2007c) with HMM.",
        "Other than Bengali, a CRF based NER system can be found in (Li and McCallum, 2004) for Hindi."

        "Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001) are used to calculate the conditional probability of values on designated output nodes given values on other designated input nodes.",
        "The conditional probability of a state sequence S =< si, s2,..., sT > given an observation sequence O =< oi,o2,... ,oT > is calculated as:",
        "where, fk(st-i,st, o, t) is a feature function whose weight Ak, is to be learned via training.",
        "The values of the feature functions may range between – to ,... + to, but typically they are binary.",
        "To make all conditional probabilities sum up to 1, we must calculate the normalization factor, which as in HMMs, can be obtained efficiently by dynamic programming.",
        "To train a CRF, the objective function to be maximized is the penalized log-likelihood of the state sequences given the observation sequences:",
        "where {< o(i) ,s(i) >} is the labeled training data.",
        "The second sum corresponds to a zero-mean, ( variance Gaussian prior over parameters, which facilitates optimization by making the likelihood surface strictly convex.",
        "Here, we set parameters A to maximize the penalized log-likelihood using Limited-memory BFGS (Sha and Pereira, 2003), a quasi-Newton method that is significantly more efficient, and which results in only minor changes in accuracy due to changes in A.",
        "When applying CRFs to the NER problem, an observation sequence is a token of a sentence or document of text and the state sequence is its corresponding label sequence.",
        "While CRFs generally can use real-valued functions, in our experiments maximum of the features are binary valued.",
        "A feature function fk(st-i, st, o, t) has a value of 0 for most cases and is only set to be 1, when st-i,st are certain states and the observation has certain properties.",

        "and location names (e.g., -land, -pur, -lia etc.)",
        "have been considered also.",
        "Here, both types of suffixes have been used.",
        "• Word prefix: Prefix information of a word is also helpful.",
        "A fixed length prefix of the current and/or the surrounding word(s) might be treated as features.",
        "• Part of Speech (POS) Information: The POS of",
        "the current and/or the surrounding word(s) can be used as features.",
        "Multiple POS information of the words can be a feature but it has not been used in the present work.",
        "The alternative and the better way is to use a coarse-grained POS tagger.",
        "Here, we have used a CRF-based POS tagger, which was originally developed with the help of 26 different POS tags, defined for Indian languages.",
        "For NER, we have considered a coarse-grained POS tagger that has only the following POS tags:",
        "NNC (Compound common noun), NN (Common noun), NNPC (Compound proper noun), NNP (Proper noun), PREP (Postpositions), QFNUM (Number quantifier) and Other (Other than the above).",
        "The POS tagger is further modified with two POS tags (Nominal and Other) for incorporating the nominal POS information.",
        "Now, a binary valued feature 'nominalPOS' is defined as: If the current/previous/next word is 'Nominal' then the 'nominalPOS' feature of the corresponding word is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to 0.",
        "This 'nominalPOS' feature has been used additionally with the 7-tag POS feature.",
        "Sometimes, postpositions play an important role in NER as postpositions occur very frequently after a NE.",
        "A binary valued feature 'nominalPREP' is defined as: If the current word is nominal and the next word is PREP then the feature 'nomianlPREP' of the current word is set to 1, otherwise set to 0.",
        "• Named Entity Information: The NE tag of the previous word is also considered as the feature.",
        "This is the only dynamic feature in the experiment.",
        "• First word: If the current token is the first word of a sentence, then the feature 'FirstWord' is set to 1.",
        "Otherwise, it is set to 0.",
        "• Digit features: Several binary digit features have been considered depending upon the presence and/or the number of digits in a token (e.g., Con-tainsDigit [token contains digits], FourDigit [token consists of four digits], TwoDigit [token consists of two digits]), combination of digits and punctuation symbols (e.g., ContainsDigitAndComma [token consists of digits and comma], ConatainsDigi-tAndPeriod [token consists of digits and periods]), combination of digits and symbols (e.g., Contains-DigitAndSlash [token consists of digit and slash],",
        "ContainsDigitAndHyphen [token consists of digits and hyphen], ContainsDigitAndPercentage [token consists of digits and percentages]).",
        "These binary valued features are helpful in recognizing miscellaneous NEs such as time expressions, monetary expressions, date expressions, percentages, numerical numbers etc.",
        "• Gazetteer Lists: Various gazetteer lists have been developed from the partially NE tagged Bengali news corpus (Ekbal and Bandyopadhyay, 2007d).",
        "These lists have been used as the binary valued features of the CRF.",
        "If the current token is in a particular list then the corresponding feature is set to 1 for the current and/or the surrounding word(s); otherwise, set to 0.",

        "The feature 'PersonPrefix' is set to 1 for the current and the next two words.",
        "(iii) Middle name (1,491 entries): These words generally appear inside the person names (e.g., chandra, nath etc.).",
        "The feature 'MiddleName' is set to 1 for the current, previous and the next words.",
        "(iv) Surname (5,288 entries): These words usually appear at the end of person names as their parts.",

        "(viii) Function words (743 entries): A list of function words has been prepared manually.",

        "(ix) Designation words (947 entries): A list of common designation words has been prepared.",
        "This helps to identify the position of the NEs, particularly person names (e.g., neta, sangsad, kheloar etc.).",
