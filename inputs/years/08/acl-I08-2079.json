        "In recent years, the chunking problem has become a hot topic in the communities of natural language processing.",
        "From 2000 to 2005, several different chunking-related tasks, such as text chunking (Sang and Buchholz, 2000), clause identification (Sang and Dejean, 2001), semantic role labeling (Carreras and Marquez, 2005), were defined in the CoNLL conferences.",
        "Much research has been devoted to the problem through different points of view.",
        "Many computational linguists regard chunking as a shallow parsing technique.",
        "Due to its efficiency and robustness on non-restricted texts, it has become an interesting alternative to full parsing in many NLP applications.",
        "On the base of the chunk scheme proposed by Abney (1991) and the BIO tagging system proposed in Ramshaw and",
        "Marcus(1995), many machine learning techniques are used to deal with the problem.",
        "However, almost all the chunking systems focus on the recognition of non-overlapping cores of chunks till now, none of them care about the internal structure analysis of chunks.",
        "In our opinion, the internal structure of a chunk, including its head and the dependency relation between head and other components, plays an important role for semantic content understanding for the chunk.",
        "They are especially useful for the languages with few morphological inflections, such as the Chinese language.",
        "Therefore, we design a multiword chunking task to recognize different multiword chunks (MWCs) with the detailed descriptions of external function and internal structure in real texts.",
        "Its main difficulty lies in the preciously identification of different lexical relationships among the MWC components.",
        "Some detailed lexical semantic knowledge is required in the task.",
        "To deal with this problem, we proposed a rule acquisition algorithm to automatically learn a MWC rule base, under the support of a large scale annotated corpus and a lexical knowledge base.",
        "We also proposed an expectation precision index to evaluate the descriptive capabilities of the refined rule base.",

        "It indicates the effectiveness of our current rule acquisition algorithm.",
        "In order to evaluate the descriptive capability of the acquired rules objectively, we proposed an expectation precision (EP) index to estimate the parsing accuracy when we apply the acquired rules to all the positive examples in the training set.",

        "An intuition assumption behind the EP definition is that a rule base with higher EP index will imply its better descriptive capability for some special linguistic phenomena.",
        "Therefore, its better parsing performance in a rule-based parser can be expected.",
        "To prove this assumption, we designed a simple comparison experiment to analyze the improvement effects of different lexical and contextual constraint used in our expanded rules.",

        "Table 3 shows the EP indexes of these rule subsets before and after rule refining.",
        "For all 150 basic rules, after rule expansion and refinement, the EP index was improved about 65%.",
        "For the simpler structure rules in subset 3 and 4, just the application of contextual constraint can bring dramatic improvement in the EP index.",
        "It indicates the importance of the local contextual information for multiword chunk recognition.",

        "Two factors contribute to this phenomenon.",
        "First, the simpler internal structures of most verb chunks guarantee the availability of almost all corresponding lexical relationship pairs.",
        "Second, most lexical pairs used in verb chunks have stronger semantic relatedness than that in noun chunks.",
        "Based on the rule base automatically acquired through the above algorithm, we developed a rule-based MWC parser to automatically recognize different kinds of MWCs in the Chinese sentences after word segmentation and POS tagging.",
        "Through 6-based disambiguation technique, the parser can output most reliable MWCs in the disambiguated region of a sentence and keep some ambigous regions with less reliable MWC structures to provide multiple selection possibilities for a full syntactic parser.",
        "Some detailed information of the parser can be found in (Zhou, 2007).",
        "We used three commonly-used indexes : precision, recall and F-measure to evaluate the performance of the parser.",

        "Three main contributions of the paper are summarized as follows.",
        "(1) We design a new multiword chunking task.",
        "Based on the topological structure definition, we establish the built-in relations between multiword chunk examples in annotated corpus and lexical relationship pairs in outside lexical knowledge base.",
        "(2) We propose an efficient algorithm to automatically acquire hierarchical structure rules from large-scale annotated corpus.",
        "By introducing different kinds of lexical knowledge coming from several different language resources, we set up an open learning environment for rule expansion and refinement.",
        "(3) We propose an expectation precision index to evaluate the descriptive capability of the refined rule base.",
        "Experimental results show that it has stronger positive association with the F-measure of parser performance evaluation.",
        "Acknowledgements.",
