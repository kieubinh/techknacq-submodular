        "First, JUMAN tends to segment a sentence into smaller morphemes than ChaSen, and this is a good tendency for morpheme-based NER systems because the boundary contradictions between morphological analysis and NEs are considered to be reduced.",
        "Figure 1 shows an example of the outputs of JUMAN and ChaSen.",
        "Although both analyses are reasonable, JUMAN divided \"Gaimusho\" and \"shin-Bei\" into two morphemes, while ChaSen left them as a single morpheme.",

        "Section 4.4.2, our NER system uses coreference relations only when coreferential expressions do not share same morphemes.",
        "Basically, such coreference relations are recognized by using automatically acquired synonym knowledge.",
        "As basic features for chunking, our NER system uses the morpheme itself, character type, POS tag and category if it exists.",
        "As character types, we defined seven types: \"kanji,\" \"hiragana,\" \"katakana,\" \"kanji with hira-gana,\" \"punctuation mark,\" \"alphabet\" and \"digit.\"",
        "As for POS tag, more than one POS feature are extracted if the target morpheme has POS ambiguity.",
        "In addition, besides POS tag obtained by JU-MAN, our system also uses POS tag obtained from Japanese morphological analyzer MeCab that uses IPADIC as a word dictionary (Asahara and Matsumoto, 2002).",
        "The JUMAN dictionary has few named entity entries; thus our system supplements the lack of lexical knowledge by using MeCab.",
        "Our NER system uses three types of global features: cache features, syntactic features and case-frame features, and a rule that reflects coreference relations.",
        "Although the coreference relations are not used as features, we describe how to use them in this section.",
        "cache feature If the same morpheme appears multiple times in a single document, in most cases the NE tags of these morphemes have some relation to each other, and the NER results for previous parts of the document can be a clue for the analysis for following parts.",

        "To utilize the information obtained from previous parts of the document, our system uses the NER results for previous parts of the document as features, called cache features.",
        "When analyzing (2), our system uses the outputs of NE recognizer for \"Kawasaki\" in the first sentence as a feature for \"Kawasaki\" in the second sentence.",
        "For simplicity, our system uses correct NE tags when training.",
        "That is, as a feature for \"Kawasaki\" in the second sentence of (2), the correct feature \"B-PERSON\" is always added when training, not always added when analyzing.",
        "coreference rule Coreference relation can be a clue for NER.",
        "This clue is considered by using cache features to a certain extent.",
        "However, if the same morpheme is not used, cache features cannot work.",
        "For example, \"NHK kokyo gakudan\" and \"N-kyo\" in (5) have coreference relation, but they do not share the same morpheme.",

        "Meanwhile, \"N-kyo,\" the abbreviation of \"NHK kokyo gakudan,\" cannot easily be recognized as \"ORGANIZATION.\"",
        "Therefore, our system uses a heuristic rule that if a morpheme sequence is analyzed to be coreferential to a previous morpheme sequence that is recognized as an NE class, the latter morpheme sequence is recognized as the same NE class.",
        "Since this heuristic rule is introduced in order to utilize the coreference relation that is not reflected by cache features, our system applies this rule only when coreferential expressions do not have any morphemes in common.",
        "syntactic feature As mentioned in Section 3, our system utilizes the information obtained from the head verb.",
        "As syntactic features, our system uses the head verb itself and the surface case of the bunsetsu that includes the target morpheme.",

        "Therefore, we construct case frames that include NE labels in advance.",
        "Case frames describe what kinds of cases each verb has and what kinds of nouns can fill a case slot.",
        "We construct them from about five hundred million sentences.",
        "We first recognize NEs appearing in the sentences by using a primitive NER system that uses only local features, and then construct the case frames from the NE-recognized sentences.",
        "To be more specific, if one tenth of the examples of a case are classified as a certain NE class, the corresponding label is attached to the case.",
        "Table 2 shows the constructed case frame of \"haken (dispatch).\"",
        "In the \"ga (nominative)\" case, the NE labels, \"ORGANIZATION\" and \"LOCATION\" are attached.",
        "We then explain how to utilize these case frames.",
        "Our system first performs case analysis, and uses as caseframe features the NE labels attached in the case to which the target morpheme is assigned.",
        "For instance, by the case analyzer, the postpositional particle \"-ha\" in (6) is recognized as meaning nominative and \"ICAO\" is assigned to the \"ga (nominative)\" case of the case frame of \"haken (dis-patch).",

        "NE tags clause by clause.",
        "The features extracted from two preceding morphemes and two succeeding morphemes are also used for chunking a target morpheme.",
        "Since SVM can solve only a two-class problem, we have to extend a binary classifier SVM to n-class classifier.",
        "Here, we employ the one versus rest method, in which we prepared n binary classifiers and each classifier is trained to distinguish a class from the rest of the classes.",
        "To consider consistency of NE tags in a clause, our system uses Viterbi search with some constraints such as a \"B-DATE\" must be followed by \"I-DATE\" or \"E-DATE.\"",
        "Since SVMs do not output probabilities, our system uses the SVM+sigmoid method (Platt et al., 2000).",
        "That is, a sigmoid function s(x) = 1/(1+exp( – [x)) is applied to map the output of SVM to a probability-like value.",
        "Our system determines NE tags by using these probability-like values.",
        "Our system is trained by TinySVM-0.09with C = 0.1 and uses a fixed value [3 = 10.",
