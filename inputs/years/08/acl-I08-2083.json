        "In instant messaging applications, a dialogue is composed of several utterances issuing by at least two users.",
        "They are different from sponsored search in that advertiser content is matched to user utterances instead of user queries.",
        "While reading users' conversation, an intention detecting system recommends suitable advertiser information at a suitable time.",
        "The time of the recommendation and the effect of advertisement have a strong relationship.",
        "The earlier the correct recommendation is, the larger the effect is.",
        "However, time and accuracy are trade-off.",
        "At the earlier stages of a dialogue, the system may have deficient information to predict suitable advertisement.",
        "Thus, a false advertisement may be proposed.",
        "On the other hand, the system may have enough information at the later stages.",
        "However, users may complete their talk at any time in this case, so the advertisement effect may be lowered.",
        "Figure 2 shows architecture of our system.",
        "In each round of the conversation, we retrieve an utterance from a given instant message application.",
        "Then, we parse the utterance and try to predict intention of the dialogue based on current and previous utterances, and consult the advertisement databases that provide sponsor links accordingly.",
        "If the information in the utterances is enough for prediction, then several candidates are proposed.",
        "Finally, based on predefined criteria, the best candidate is selected and proposed to the IM application as the sponsor link in Figure 1.",
        "In the following sections, we will explore when to make sure the intention of a dialogue with confidence and to propose suitable recommendations.",
        "In addition, we will also discuss what word features (called cue words hereafter) in the utterances are useful for the intention determination.",

      "text": [
        "This paper captures intention in dialogues of instant messaging applications.",
        "A web directory such as Yahoo!",
        "directory is considered as a category tree.",
        "Two schemes, revised tf and tf-idf, are employed to classify the utterances in dialogues.",
        "The experiments show that the tf scheme using the category tree expanded with snippets together with noun features achieves the best F-score, 0.86.",
        "The hit speed evaluation tells us the system can start making good decision when near only 37.46% of total utterances are processed.",
        "In other words, the recommended advertisements can be placed to attract users' attentions in the rest 62.54% of total utterances.",
        "Though the best model in the experiments is to use nouns as features, we note that another important language feature, verbs, is not helpful due to the characteristic of the category tree we adopted, that is, the absence of verbs in Yahoo!",
        "directory.",
        "If some other data sources can provide the cue information, verbs may be taken as useful features to boost the performance.",
        "In this paper, only one intention is assigned to the utterances.",
        "However, there may be many participants involving in a conversation, and the topics they are talking about in a dialogue may be more than one.",
        "For example, two couples are discussing a trip schedule together.",
        "After the topic is finished, they may continue the conversation for selection of hotels and buying funds separately in the same instant messaging dialogue.",
        "In this case, our system only decides the intention is Recreation, but not including Business & Economy.",
        "Long time delay of response is another interesting topic for instant messaging dialogues.",
        "Sometimes one participant could send a message, but have to wait for minutes or even hours to get response.",
        "Because the receiver might be absent, busy or just off-line, the system should be capable of waiting such a long time delay before a complete dialogue is finished in practical applications.",
        "Opinion mining is also important to the proposed model.",
        "For example, dialogue participants may talk about buying digital cameras, and one of them has negative opinions on some products.",
        "In such a case, an intelligent recommendation system should not promote such products.",
        "Once opinion extraction is introduced to intention analysis systems, customers can get not only the conversation-related, but also personally preferred sponsor links."
