        "Reflecting the rapid growth of science, technology, and economies, new technical terms and product names have progressively been created.",
        "These new words have also been imported into different languages.",
        "There are two fundamental methods for importing foreign words into a language.",
        "In the first method-translation-the meaning of the source word in question is represented by an existing or new word in the target language.",
        "In the second method-transliteration-the pronunciation of the source word is represented by using the phonetic alphabet of the target language, such as Katakana in Japanese and Hangul in Korean.",
        "Technical terms and proper nouns are often transliterated.",
        "In Chinese, Kanji is used to spell out both conventional Chinese words and foreign words.",
        "Because Kanji is ideogrammatic, an individual pronunciation can be represented by more than one character.",
        "If several Kanji strings are related to the same pronunciation of the source word, their meanings will be different and convey different impressions.",
        "For example, \"Coca-Cola\" can be represented by different Kanji strings in Chinese with similar pronunciations, such as \"RTPRTiS\" and \"Pf Pfi\".",
        "The official transliteration is \"bTPrT Xf\", which comprises \"bTP (tasty)\" and \"RTxS (pleasant)\", and is therefore associated with a positive connotation.",
        "However, \"Pf PS\" is associated with a negative connotation because this word includes \"Pf \", which is associated with \"choking\".",
        "For another example, the official transliteration of the musician Chopin's name in Chinese is \"f^I?",
        "', where \"f^\" is commonly used for Chinese family names.",
        "Other Kanji characters with the same pronunciation as \"f^\" include 'Tpf\".",
        "However, 'Tpf\", which means \"to disappear\", is not ideal for a person's name.",
        "Thus, Kanji characters must be selected carefully during transliteration into Chinese.",
        "This is especially important when foreign companies intend to introduce their names and products into China.",
        "In a broad sense, the term \"transliteration\" has been used to refer to two tasks.",
        "The first task is transliteration in the strict sense, which creates new words in a target language (Haizhou et al., 2004; Wan and Verspoor, 1998; Xu et al., 2006).",
        "The second task is back-transliteration (Knight and Graehl, 1998), which identifies the source word corresponding to an existing transliterated word.",
        "Both tasks require methods that model pronunciation in the source and target languages.",
        "However, by definition, in back-transliteration, the word in question has already been transliterated and the meaning or impression of the source word does not have to be considered.",
        "Thus, backtransliteration is outside the scope of this paper.",
        "In the following, we use the term \"transliteration\" to refer to transliteration in the strict sense.",
        "Existing transliteration methods for Chinese (Haizhou et al., 2004; Wan and Verspoor, 1998), which aim to spell out foreign names of people and places, do not model the impression the transliterated word might have on the reader.",
        "Xu et al.",
        "(2006) proposed a method to model both the impression and the pronunciation for transliteration into Chinese.",
        "In this method, impression keywords that are related to the source word are used.",
        "However, a user must provide impression keywords, which is time-consuming and expensive.",
        "In this paper, to reduce the amount of human effort, we propose a method that uses the World Wide Web to extract related terms for source words."

        "We will explain the entire process using Figure 1.",
        "There are two parts to the input for our method.",
        "First, a source word to be transliterated into Chinese is requested.",
        "Second, the category of the source word, such as \"company\" or \"person\", is requested.",
        "The output is one or more Kanji strings.",
        "Using the pronunciation model, the source word is converted into a set of Kanji strings whose pronunciation is similar to that ofthe source word.",
        "Each of these Kanji strings is a transliteration candidate.",
        "Currently, we use Japanese Katakana words as source words, because Katakana words can be easily converted into pronunciations using the Latin alphabet.",
        "In Figure 1, the Katakana word \"epuson (EPSON)\" is used as an example source word.",
        "However, in principle, any language that uses a phonetic script can be a source language for our method.",
        "Using the impression model, one or more related terms are converted into a set of Kanji characters.",
        "In Xu et al.",
        "(2006), one or more words that describe the impression of the source word are used as related terms (i.e., impression keywords).",
        "Because impression keywords are given manually, users must have a good command of Chinese.",
        "In addition, the task of providing impression keywords is expensive.",
        "We solve these problems by automatically extracting terms related to the source word from the Web.",
        "Unlike Xu at al.",
        "(2006), the language model for the category of the source word is used.",
        "For example, if the category is \"person\", Kanji characters that are often used for personal names in Chinese are preferably used for the transliteration.",
        "Because of the potentially large number of selected candidates, we need to rank the candidates.",
        "We model pronunciation, impression, and target language in a probabilistic framework, so that candidates are sorted according to their probability score.",
        "In practice, the Kanji characters derived via the impression and language models are used to re-rank the candidates derived via the pronunciation model."
