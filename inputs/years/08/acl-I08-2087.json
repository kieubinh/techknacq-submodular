        "Most of the SMT approaches integrating syntactic structures are based on probabilistic tree transducers (tree-to-tree model).",
        "This leads to a large increase in the model complexity (Yamada and Knight 2001; Yamada and Knight 2002; Gildea 2003; Galley et al.",

        "However, formally syntax-based methods propose simple but efficient ways to parse and translate sentences (Wu 1997; Chiang 2005).",
        "In this paper, we propose a new model of SMT by using structured prediction to perform tree-to-tree transductions.",
        "This model is inspired by Sa-gae and Lavie (2005), in which a stack-based representation of monolingual parsing trees is used.",
        "Our contributions lie in the extension of this representation to bilingual parsing trees based on ITGs and in the use of a structured prediction method, called SEARN (Daumé III et al.",
        "2007), to predict parsing structures.",
        "Furthermore, in order to facilitate the use of structured prediction method, we perform another transformation from ITG-like trees to label sequence with the grouping of stack operations.",
        "Then the structure preserving problem in translation is transferred to a structured prediction one tackled by sequence labeling method such as in Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging.",
        "This transformation can be performed automatically without complex linguistic information.",
        "At last, a modified search process integrating structure information is performed to produce sentence translation.",
        "Figure 1 illustrates the process flow of our model.",
        "Besides, the phrase extraction is constrained by ITGs.",

        "First, following Koehn et al.",
        "(2003), bilingual sentences are trained by GIZA++ (Och and Ney 2003) in two directions (from source to target and target to source).",
        "Then, two resulting alignments are recombined to form a whole according to heuristic rules, e.g. grow-diag-final.",
        "Second, based on the word alignment matrix, one unique parsing tree can be generated according to ITG constraints where the \"left-first\" constraint is posed.",
        "That is to say, we always make the leaf nodes as the right sons as possible as they can.",
        "Here we present two basic operations for mapping tree items, one is in order and the other is in reverse order (see Figure 2).",
        "Basic word alignments are in (a), while (b) is their corresponding alignment matrix.",
        "They can be described using ITG-like trees (c).",
        "Figure 3: \"inside-out\" transpositions (a) and (b) with two typical complex sequences (c) and (d).",
        "In (c) and (d), word correspondence f2-e2 is also extracted as sub-alignments.",
        "The two widely known situations that cannot be described by ITGs are called \"inside-out\" transpositions (Figure 3 a & b).",
        "Since they cannot be decomposed in ITGs, we consider them as basic units.",
        "In this case, phrase alignment is used.",
        "In our model, more complex situations exist for the word correspondences are generated automatically from GIZA++.",
        "At the same time, we also keep the sub-alignments in those complex situations in order to extend the coverage of translation options.",
        "The sub-alignments are restricted to those that can be described by the two basic operations.",
        "In other words, for our ITG-like tree, the nodes are mostly word pairs, except some indecomposable word sequences pairs.",
        "Figure 3 shows four typical complex sequences viewed as phrases.",
        "Therefore, our ITG-like trees take some phrase alignments into consideration and we also keep the sub-alignments in these situations.",
        "Tree items in our model are restricted to minimum constituents for the simplicity of parsing tree generation.",
        "Then we extract those word pairs from tree items, instead of all the possible word sequences, as our translation table.",
        "In this way, we can greatly reduce the number of translation pairs to be consideration.",
        "Sagae and Lavie (2005) propose a constituency-based parsing method to determine sentence dependency structures.",
        "This method is simple and efficient, which makes use of SHIFT and REDUCE operations within a stack framework.",
        "This kind of representations can be easily learned by a classifier with linear time complexity.",
        "In their method, they build a parse tree of a sentence one word at a time just as in a stack parser.",

        "Sagae and Lavie's algorithms are designed for monolingual parsing problem.",
        "We extend it to represent our ITG-like tree.",
        "In our problem, each word pairs can be viewed as tree items (nodes).",
        "To handle our tree alignment problem, we need to define two REDUCE operations: REDUCE in order and REDUCE in reverse order.",
        "We define these three basic operations as follows:",
        "• S: SHIFT - push the current item onto the stack.",
        "• R+: REDUCE in order - pop the first two items from the stack, and combine them in the original order on the target side, then push back.",
        "• R-: REDUCE in reverse order - pop the first two items from the stack, and combine them in the reverse order on the target side, then push back.",
        "Using these operators, our ITG-like tree is transformed to serial stack operations.",
        "In Figure 2, (d) is such a representation for the two basic alignments.",
        "Therefore, the structure of word aligned sentences can be transformed to an operation sequence, which represents the bilingual parsing correspondences.",
        "After that, we attach these operations to each corresponding tree item like a sequence labeling problem.",
        "We need to perform another \"grouping\" step to make sure only one operation is assigned to each item, such as \"S,R+\", \"S,R-,R+\", etc.",
        "Then, those grouped operations are regarded as a whole and performed as one label.",
        "The number of this kind of labels is decided by the training cor-pus1.",
        "Having defined such labels, the prediction of tree structures is transformed to a label prediction one.",
        "That is, giving word pairs as input, we transform them to their corresponding labels (stack operations) in the output.",
        "At the same time, tree transductions are encoded in those labels.",
        "Once all the \"labels\" are performed, there should be only one element in the stack, i.e. the generating sentence translation pairs.",
        "See Appendix A for a more complete example in Chinese-English with our defined operations.",
        "Another constraint we impose is to keep the least number of elements in stack at any time.",
        "If two elements on the top of the stack can be combined, we combine them to form a single item.",
        "This constraint can avoid having too many possible operations for the last word pair, which may make future predictions difficult."
