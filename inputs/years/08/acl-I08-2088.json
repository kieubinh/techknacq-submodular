        "Parallel corpus is one of the most important components in statistical machine translation (SMT), and there are two main factors contributing to its performance.",
        "The first is the quality of the parallel corpus, and the second is its quantity.",
        "A parallel corpus that has similar statistical characteristics to the target domain should yield a more efficient translation model.",
        "However, domain-mismatched training data might reduce the translation model's performance.",
        "A large training corpus obviously produces better quality than a small one.",
        "However, increasing the size of the training corpus causes another problem, which is increased computational processing load.",
        "This problem not only affects the training of the translation model, but also its applications.",
        "The reason for this is that a large amount of training data tends to yield a large translation model and applications then have to deal with this model.",
        "We propose a method of selecting translation pairs as the training set from a training parallel corpus to solve the problem of an expanded translation model with increased training load.",
        "This method enables an adequate training set to be selected from a large parallel corpus by using a small in-domain parallel corpus.",
        "We can make the translation model compact without degrading performance because this method effectively reduces the size of the set for training the translation model.",
        "This compact translation model can outperform a translation model trained on the entire original corpus.",
        "This method is especially effective for domains where it is difficult to enlarge the corpus, such as in spoken language parallel corpora (Kikui et al., 2006).",
        "The main approach to recovering from an un-dersupply of the in-domain corpus has been to use a very large domain-close or out-of-domain parallel corpus for the translation model training (NIST, 2006).",
        "In such case, the proposed method effectively reduces the size of the training set and translation model.",
        "Section 2 describes the method of selecting the training set.",
        "Section 3 details the experimental results for selecting the training set and actual translation from the International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation 2006 (IWSLT2006).",
