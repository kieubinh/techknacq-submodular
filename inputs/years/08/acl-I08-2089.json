        "Often more data is better data, and so it should come as no surprise that recently statistical machine translation (SMT) systems have been improved by the use of large language models (LM).",
        "However, training data for LMs often comes from diverse sources, some of them are quite different from the target domain of the MT application.",
        "Hence, we need to weight and combine these corpora appropriately.",
        "In addition, the vast amount of training data available for LM purposes and the desire to use high-order n-grams quickly exceeds the conventional computing resources that are typically available.",
        "If we are not able to accommodate large LMs integrated into the decoder, using them in re-ranking is an option.",
        "In this paper, we present and compare methods to build LMs from diverse training corpora.",
        "We also show that complex LMs can be used in re-ranking to improve performance given a strong baseline.",
        "In particular, we use high-order n-grams continuous space LMs to obtain MT of the well-known NIST 2006 test set that compares very favorably with the results reported in the official evaluation.",

        "The use of billions of words of LM training data has become standard in large-scale SMT systems, and even trillion word LMs have been demonstrated.",
        "Since lookup of LM scores is one of the fundamental functions in SMT decoding, efficient storage and access of the model becomes increasingly difficult.",
        "A recent trend is to store the LM in a distributed cluster of machines, which are queried via network requests (Brants et al., 2007; Emami et al., 2007).",
        "It is easier, however, to use such large LMs in re-ranking (Zhang et al., 2006).",
        "Since the use of clusters of machines is not always practical (or affordable) for SMT applications, an alternative strategy is to find more efficient ways to store the LM in the working memory of a single machine, for instance by using efficient prefix trees and fewer bits to store the LM probability (Federico and Bertoldi, 2006).",
        "Also the use of lossy data structures based on Bloom filters has been demonstrated to be effective for LMs (Talbot and Osborne, 2007a; Talbot and Osborne, 2007b).",
        "This allows the use of much larger LMs, but increases the risk of errors."

        "In general, the complexity to calculate one probability is dominated by the output layer dimension since the size of the vocabulary (here N=273k) is usually much larger than the dimension of the hidden layer (here H=500).",
