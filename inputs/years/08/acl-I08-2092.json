        "Defining all words in a dictionary by using a limited number of words (defining vocabulary) is helpful in language learning.",
        "For example, it would make it easy for children and second-language learners to understand definitions of all words in the dictionary if they understand all words in the defining vocabulary.",
        "In some English dictionaries such as the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE) (Proctor, 2005) and the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary (OALD) (Hornby and Ashby, 2005), 2,000-3,000 words are chosen and all headwords are defined by using the vocabulary.",
        "Such dictionaries are widely used for language learning.",
        "Currently, however, such a dictionary in which adefining vocabulary is specified has not been available in Japanese.",
        "Although many studies for",
        "Japanese \"basic vocabulary\" have been done (National Institute for Japanese Language, 2000), \"basic vocabulary\" in the studies means a vocabulary which children or second-language learners have (or should learn).",
        "In other words, the aim of such studies is to determine a set of headwords which should be included in a Japanese dictionary for children or second-language learners.",
        "We think that there is a difference between \"defining vocabulary\" and \"basic vocabulary\".",
        "Although basic vocabulary is usually intended for learning expression in newspaper/magazine articles, daily conversation, school textbook, etc, a defining vocabulary is intended for describing word definition in a dictionary.",
        "Some words (or phrases) which are of-tenusedinworddefinition, such as \"...",
        "<?",
        ")B§ (abbreviation of ...)\", \"SsUT (change/shift)\" V'f^Ip(thing/matter)\" etc, are not included in some kinds of basic vocabulary.",
        "Additionally only one word in a set of synonyms should be included in a defining vocabulary even if all of them are well-known.",
        "For example, if a word (use)\" is included in a defining vocabulary, synonyms of the word, such as Mlt~2>\", \"f OTlt~2> \"and \"ftjl \", are not needed.",
        "A goal of this study is to try to build a Japanese defining vocabulary on the basis of distribution of words usedinword definition in an existing Japanese dictionary.",
        "In this paper, as the first step of this, we introduce the method for ranking Japanese words, and show some evaluation results of applying the method to an existing Japanese dictionary.",

        "Some words in word deinition are not registered as headwords actually.",
        "For example, although a noun \"^In (English language)\" appears in word deinition, the word is not registered as a headword.",
        "Unregistered words should carefully be checked whether they are appropriate as deining vocabulary or not at the third step of our method described in section 3.",
        "In order to look at the difference between the result and so-called \"basic vocabulary\", we compared the result with two types of basic vocabulary: one was built by the National Institute for Japanese Language (including 6,099 words) and the other was built by the Chuo Institute for Educational Research (including 4,332 words) (National Institute for Japanese Language, 2001).",
        "These two types of vocabulary are intended for foreigners (second-language learners) and Japanese children (elementary school students) respectively.",
        "Figure 3 shows recall, i.e. percentage of the number of words appearing in both our result and each vocabulary out of the number of words in the vocabulary.",
        "As in the case of word coverage, the increase in recall around n =10, 000 is low if unregistered words are not removed (solid lines).",
        "If the same number of headwords as the size of each basic vocabulary are picked up from our result, it can be found that about 50% of the words are shared with each basic vocabulary (dotted lines).",
        "Some of the high-ranked words out of the two basic vocabularies and some of the low-ranked words in the vocabularies are listed in Table 2 and 3.",
        "Although it would be natural that the words listed in Table 2 are not included in the basic vocabularies, they are necessary for describing word deini-tion.",
        "On the other hand, the words listed in Table 3 may not be necessary for describing word deinition, while they are often used in daily life.",

        "In this paper, we introduced the method for ranking Japanese words in order to build a Japanese defining vocabulary.",
        "We do not think that a set of the top-n words ranked by our method could be a defining vocabulary as is.",
        "The high ranked words need to be checked whether they are appropriate as defining vocabulary or not.",
        "As described in section 1, defining all words with adefining vocabulary is helpful in language learning.",
        "In addition, we expect that the style of writing word definitions (e.g. which word should be used, whether the word should be written in kanji or hira-gana, etc.)",
        "can be controlled with the vocabulary.",
        "This kind of vocabulary could also be useful for NLP researches as well as language learning.",
        "Actually, defining vocabularies used in LDOCE and OALD are often used in some NLP researches.",
        "The future work is the following:",
        "• The size of a defining vocabulary needs to be determined.",
        "Although all words in LDOCE or OALD are defined by 2,000-3,000 words, the size of a Japanese defining vocabulary may be larger than English ones.",
        "• Wierzbicka presented the notion of conceptual primitives (Wierzbicka, 1996).",
        "We need to look into our result from a linguistic point of view, and to discuss the relation.",
        "• It is necessary to consider how to describe word definition as well as which word should be used for word definition.",
        "Definition of each word in a dictionary includes many kinds of information, not only the word sense but also historical background, grammatical issue, etc.",
        "Only word sense should be described with a defining vocabulary, since the other information is a little",
        "different from word sense and it may be difficult to describe the information with the same vocabulary.",
