        "A few studies on paraphrasing of Japanese functional expressions have been conducted.",
        "In order to implement automatic paraphrasing, some studies (Iida et al., 2001; Tsuchiya et al., 2004) use a set of paraphrasing rules, and others (Tanabe et al., 2001; Shudo et al., 2004) use semantic equivalence classes.",

        "In order to organize many different variants of functional expressions, we have designed a morphological hierarchy with nine abstraction levels (Mat-suyoshi et al., 2006).",

        "The number of entries in L (headwords) is 341, and the number of leaf nodes in L (surface forms) is 16,801.",
        "For each surface form in the hierarchy, we specified one of four styles (normal, polite, colloquial, and stiff) and connectability (what word can be to the left and right of the expression).",

        "For 435 entries in L (headwords with unique meaning) of the morphological hierarchy, from the viewpoint of paraphrasability, we have designed a semantic hierarchy with three levels according to the semantic hierarchy proposed by a book (Morita and Matsuki, 1989).",
        "The numbers of classes in the top, middle and bottom levels are 45, 128 and 199, respectively.",
        "For each entry in L, we specified one of readability levels of A1, A2, B, C, and F according to proficiency level in a book (Foundation and of International Education, Japan, 2002), where A1 is the most basic level and F is the most advanced level.",

        "However, because these methods detect only a limited number of functional expressions (and their variants), we cannot apply them to the analysis of a phrase.",
        "Another method is to add a list of about 17,000 surface forms of functional expressions to a dictionary of an existing morphological analyzer and determine connecting costs based on machine learning.",
        "However, it is infeasible because there is no large corpus in which all of these surface forms have been tagged.",
        "Instead of these methods, we use a different method of decomposing a given phrase into a sequence of content words and functional expressions.",

        "FPA can decompose a functional part (string) into a sequence of functional expressions, but fails to decompose a string when the string includes one or more content words.",
        "In order to extract a functional part from a given string, we use original MeCab.",
        "First, original MeCab decomposes a given string into a sequence of morphemes m1m2 • • • mk.",

        "This procedure is continued until FPA succeeds in decomposition.",
        "This module accepts an analyzed result c1 c2 cmf1 f2 fn and generates a list of alternative expressions for it.",
        "First, the module obtains a surface form f1 that is semantically equivalent to f1 from the dictionary in section 3.",
        "Next, it constructs c1c2 • • • cm-1 c'mwf1 by connecting f1 to c1 c2 • • • cm by the method described in section 4.",
        "Then, it obtains a surface form f2 that is semantically equivalent to f2 and constructs c1 c2 • • • cm-1c'mwf1 f2 in similar fashion.",
        "This process proceeds analogously, and finally, the module constructs c1c2^ • • cm-1dmwf'-1 f22 • • • fn as an alternative expression.",
        "Because in practice the module obtains more than one surface form that is semantically equivalent to fj by the method described in subsection 3.3, it generates more than one alternative expression by considering all possible combinations of these surface forms and excluding candidates that include two adjacent components that cannot be connected properly.",
        "If the module generates no alternative expression, it uses the semantic equivalence classes in the upper level reluctantly.",
        "Because a functional expression seems to be more standard and common as it appears more frequently in newspaper corpus, we use frequencies of functional expressions (strings) in newspaper corpus in order to rank alternative expressions.",
        "We define a scoring function as the product of frequencies of functional expressions in a phrase."
