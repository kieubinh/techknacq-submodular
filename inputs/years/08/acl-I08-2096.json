        "The fact that most of the parser evaluation resources employed consist of texts from a single genre constitutes a deficiency in most of the parser evaluations.",
        "Evaluations are typically carried out on newspaper texts, i.e. on section 23 of the Penn Treebank (PTB) (Marcus et al., 1993).",
        "A further complication is that many parsing models are trained on the same treebank.",
        "Parsers therefore come to be applied to texts from numerous other genres untested.",
        "The obvious question that confronts us in these circumstances is: How well will a parser that performs well on financial texts from the Wall Street Journal generalize to other text types?",
        "This present paper addresses parser evaluation from the perspective of coverage.",
        "It is a part of a set of evaluations in which selected parsers are evaluated using five criteria: preciseness, coverage, robustness, efficiency and subtlety.",
        "Parsing coverage refers to the ability of a parser to produce an analysis of sentences of naturally occurring freetext.",
        "We used parsing coverage to assess the generalizability of the grammars and parsing models and we looked for answers to the following research questions:",
        "• What is the parsing coverage of the evaluated parsers?",
        "• How does the text genre affect the parsing coverage?",

        "Prasad and Sarkar (2000) observe that the notion of coverage has the following two meanings in the context of parsing.",
        "Grammatical coverage is the parser's ability to handle different linguistic phenomena, and parsing coverage is a measure of the percentage of naturally occurring free text in which a parser can produce a full parse.",
        "We divide parsing coverage further into genre coverage on different types of texts such as newspapers, religious, biomedicine and fiction.",
        "Parsing coverage can be measured as the percentage of input sentences to which a parser is able to assign a parse.",
        "No annotated text is needed for performing parsing coverage evaluations.",
        "On one hand, it can be argued that coverage alone constitutes a rather weak measure of a parser's performance, and thus of its generalizability to diverse text genres.",
        "An obvious problem with measuring coverage alone is that a parser returning undetailed and flat analyses will easily get high coverage, whereas a parser that outputs detailed analyses will suffer in covering all the input sentences.",
        "Moreover, preciseness and coverage can be seen as conflicting requirements for a parser.",
        "Increasing preciseness of the grammar often causes its coverage to decrease; adding more constraints to the grammar causes some of the sentences to be rejected even they are acceptable to users of the language.",
        "Loosening the constraints allows more sentences to be parsed, thus increasing the coverage, but at the same time easily leads into overgeneration, problems with disambiguation and decreased preciseness.",
        "On the other hand, the points that we raised above indicate that there is a strong relationship between coverage and preciseness.",
        "The aim of syntactic parsers is to analyze whole sentences, not just fragments (constituents/D links) precisely.",
        "The connection between coverage and preciseness is clear in the case of sentence level evaluations measures: A sentence that cannot be fully analyzed cannot have a complete match with the correct structure in the evaluation resource.",
        "Consequently, we argue that coverage can be used a measure of generalizability; It sets the upper bound for the performance on the sentence-level evaluation measures.",
        "However, the evaluation should always be accompanied with data on the preciseness of the parser and the level of detail in its output.",
        "Relatively little work has been done on the empirical evaluation of parsers for text types other than newspaper texts.",
        "A key issue in available evalua-",
        "(e.g. spoken, written), content (topic, theme) and type (narrative, argumentation, etc.",
        ").",
        "tion materials is the genre homogeneity.",
        "Almost all the available resources are based on a single genre (nearly always newspaper texts).",
        "This makes it impossible to extrapolate anything useful about the generalizability of the developed grammars and parsing models.",
        "To our knowledge, this experiment is the only one reported in the literature that compares the coverage of a set of parsers for English.",
        "The studies that critically examine the genre dependency have come to the same unsurprising conclusion that the text genre has an effect on the parser's performance.",
        "The genre dependency of parsers is an accepted fact and has been described by, among others, Sekine (1997) and Gildea (2001).",
        "For example, Clegg and Shepherd (2005) have undertaken experiments on biomedical data using the GENIA treebank.",
        "Laakso (2005) reports experiments on the CHILDES corpus of transcribed speech between parents and the children.",
        "Mazzei and Lombardo (2004) report cross-training experiments in Italian on newspaper and civil law texts.",
        "They observed a dramatic drop of, most commonly, around 10-30 percentage points in the parsing coverage.",
        "Genre dependency is caused by several factors.",
        "One is that each text genre is characterized by genre-specific words (Biber, 1993).",
        "Another feature of genre dependency is syntactic structure distributions.",
        "Baldwin et al.",
        "(2004) have conducted one of the rare studies that offer an analysis of the main reasons for the diminished coverage.",
        "They experimented with an HPSG grammar that was a created manually based on a corpus of data extracted from informal genres such as conversations about schedules and emails about e-commerce.",
        "The grammar was used for parsing a random sample of texts from several genres.",
        "A diagnosis of failures to parse sentences with full lexical spanrevealed the following causes for the errors: missing lexical entries (40%), missing constructions (39%), preprocessor errors (4%), fragments (4%), parser failures (4%), and garbage strings (11%).",

        "The design of our test settings and materials was guided by our research questions (above).",
        "We answered the first question by parsing vast document collections with several state-of-the-art parsing systems and then measuring their parsing coverage on the data.",
        "Because we had divided our purpose-built test set into genre-specific subsets, this allowed us to measure the effects of genre variance and so provide an answer to the second research question.",
        "We also included two parsers that had been developed in the 1990s to evaluate the extent to which progress has been made in parsing technology in genre dependency and parsing coverage.",
        "The most important decision in parsing coverage evaluation is how the distinction between a covered and uncovered sentence is made.",
        "This has to be defined separately for each parser and the definition depends on the type of output.",
        "We implemented a set of Java tools to record the statistics from the parsers' outputs.",
        "In addition to completely failed parses, we recorded information about incomplete analyses and the number of times the parsers crashed or terminated during parsing.",

        "In order to cover several genres and to guarantee the diversity of the text types, we sourced a diversity of materials from several collections.",

        "Table 1 shows the sub-corpora and the figures associated with each corpus.",
        "In total there were 15,385,855 tokens.",
        "The style of the newspaper texts led us to make an initial hypothesis that a similar performance would probably be achievable with non-fiction texts, and we suspected that the legislative and fiction texts might be more difficult to parse because of the stylistic idiosyncrasies involved.",
        "Biomedical texts also contained a considerable number of words that are probably not found in the lexicons.",
        "These two difficulties were compounded in the religious texts, and the average length of the religion sub-corpus was far higher than the average.",
