        "For newspaper articles, the accuracy of dependency parsers exceeds 90% (for English), but it is still not sufficient for practical use in these NLP applications.",
        "Moreover, the accuracy declines significantly for out-of-domain text, such as weblogs and web pages, which have commonly been used as corpora.",
        "From this point of view, it is important to consider the following points to use a parser practically in applications:",
        "• to select reliable parses, especially for knowledge acquisition,",
        "• and to adapt the parser to new domains.",
        "This paper proposes a method for selecting reliable parses from parses output by a single dependency parser.",
        "We do not use an ensemble method based on multiple parsers, but use only a single parser, because speed and efficiency are important when processing a massive volume of text.",
        "The resulting highly reliable parses would be useful to automatically construct dictionaries and knowledge bases, such as case frames (Kawahara and Kuro-hashi, 2006).",
        "Furthermore, we incorporate the reliable parses we obtained into the dependency parser to achieve domain adaptation.",
        "The CoNLL 2007 shared task tackled domain adaptation of dependency parsers for the first time (Nivre et al., 2007).",
        "Sagae and Tsujii applied an ensemble method to the domain adaptation track and achieved the highest score (Sagae and Tsujii, 2007).",
        "They first parsed in-domain unlabeled sentences using two parsers trained on out-of-domain labeled data.",
        "Then, they extracted identical parses that were produced by the two parsers and added them to the original (out-of-domain) training set to train a domain-adapted model.",
        "Dredze et al.",
        "yielded the second highest scorein the domain adaptation track (Dredze et al., 2007).",
        "However, their results were obtained without adaptation.",
        "They concluded that it is very difficult to substantially improve the target domain performance over that of a state-of-the-art parser.",
        "To confirm this, we parsed the test set (CHEM) of the domain adaptation track by using one of the best dependency parsers, second-order MSTParser (McDonald et al.,",
        "!Dredze et al.",

        "Though this parser was trained on the provided out-of-domain (Penn Treebank) labeled data, surprisingly, its accuracy slightly outperformed the highest score achieved by Sagae and Tsujii (unlabeled dependency accuracy: 83.58 > 83.42 (Sagae and Tsujii, 2007)).",
        "Our goal is to improve a state-of-the-art parser on this domain adaptation track.",

        "If greater efficiency is required, it is possible to apply a pre-filter that removes long sentences (e.g., longer than 30 words), which are seldom selected by the reliability detector.",
        "In addition, our method does not depend on a particular parser, and can be applied to other state-of-the-art parsers, such as Malt Parser (Nivre et al., 2006), which is a feature-rich linear-time parser.",
