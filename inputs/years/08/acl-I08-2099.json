        "A major effort is currently underway to develop a large scale tree bank for Indian Languages (IL).",
        "The lack of such a resource has been a major limiting factor in the development of good natural language tools and applications for ILs.",
        "Apart from that, a rich and large-scale tree bank can be an indispensable resource for linguistic investigations.",
        "Some notable efforts in this direction for other languages have been the Penn Tree Bank (Marcus et al., 1993) for English and the Prague Dependency Bank (Hajicova, 1998) for Czech.",
        "It is well known that context free grammar (CFG) is not well-suited for free-word order languages (Shieber, 1985); instead dependency framework appears to be better suited (Hudson, 1984; Mel'Cuk, 1988, Bharati et al., 1995).",
        "Also, the dependency framework is arguably closer to semantics than the phrase structure grammar (PSG) if the dependency relations are judiciously chosen.",
        "In recent times many research groups have been shifting to the dependency paradigm due to this reason.",
        "Modern dependency grammar is attributed to Tesniere (1959).",
        "In a dependency analysis, there is no hierarchical arrangement of phrases (or substrings) like in phrase structure grammar.",
        "Rather, we just have words connected via dependency relations between them.",
        "Prague Dependency Bank (PDT) for Czech (which has relatively free word order) is one such large-scale effort which implements a three-tier annotation scheme and annotates morphological information, analytical and tectogrammatical level annotations at these three levels.",
        "Out of the three levels, the analytical and tectogrammatical level are dependency based.",
        "The tectogrammatical level tries to capture the deep-semantics of the sentence; the annotation at this level is very rich and is linked to the other two lower levels.",
        "Other major efforts in the dependency framework are Alpino (van der Beek et.",
        "al, 2002) for Dutch, (Rambow et.",
        "al, 2002) for English, TUT (Bosco and Lombardo, 2004) for Italian, TIGER (Brants et.",

        "ILs are morphologically rich and have a relatively flexible word order.",
        "For such languages syntactic subject-object positions are not always able to elegantly explain the varied linguistic phenomena.",
        "In fact, there is a debate in the literature whether the notions 'subject' and 'object' can at all be defined for ILs (Mohanan, 1982).",
        "Behavioral properties are the only criteria based on which one can confidently identify grammatical functions in Hindi (Mohanan, 1994); it can be difficult to exploit such properties computationally.",
        "Marking semantic properties such as thematic role as dependency relation is also problematic.",
        "Thematic roles are abstract notions and will require higher semantic features which are difficult to formulate and to extract as well.",
        "So, thematic roles are not marked at this juncture.",
        "On the other hand, the notion of kanaka relations (explained shortly) provides us a level which while being syntactically grounded also helps in capturing some semantics.",
        "What is important to note here is that such a level can be exploited computationally with ease.",
        "This provides us with just the right level of syntactico-semantic interface.",
        "The experiments conducted on the present annotated text provide empirical evidence for this claim (section 6).",
        "Paninian grammar is basically a dependency grammar (Kiparsky and Staal, 1969; Shastri, 1973).",
        "In this section we briefly discuss the Paninian model for ILs and lay down some basic concepts inherent to this framework.",
        "The main problem that the Paninian approach addresses is to identify syntactico-semantic relations in a sentence.",
        "The Paninian approach treats a sentence as a series of modifier-modified relations.",
        "A sentence is supposed to have a primary modified (the root of the dependency tree) which is generally the main verb of the sentence.",
        "The elements modifying the verb participate in the action specified by the verb.",
        "The participant relations with the verb are called kanaka.",
        "The appropriate mapping of the syntactic cues helps in identifying the appropriate karakas ('participants in an action').",
        "The framework is inspired by an inflectionally rich language like Sanskrit; it emphasizes the role of case endings or markers such as postpositions and verbal inflections.",
        "There are six basic karakas, namely; adhikarana 'location', apaadaan 'source', sampradaan 'recipient', karana 'instrument', karma 'theme', karta 'agent'.",
        "We must note here that although one can roughly map the first four karaka to their thematic role counterpart, karma and karta are very different from 'theme' and 'agent' respectively (see section 4.1.1).",
        "In our annotation scheme, we use chunks as a device for modularity.",
        "A chunk represents a set of adjacent words which are in dependency relations with each other, and are connected to the rest of the words by a single incoming dependency arc.",
        "The relations among the words in a chunk are not marked for now and hence allow us to ignore local details while building the sentence level dependency tree.",
        "Thus, in our dependency tree each node is a chunk and the edge represents the relations between the connected nodes labeled with the ka-raka or other relations.",
        "All the modifier-modified relations between the heads of the chunks (inter-chunk relations) are marked in this manner.",
        "Intra-chunk relations can be marked by a set of rules at a later point.",
        "Experiments have been conducted with high performance in automatically marking intra-chunk dependencies.",
        "Using information such as karakas based on some vibhaktis (post-positions) and other information like TAM (tense, aspect and modality) of the main verb seems very well suited for handling free word order languages.",
        "Other works based on this scheme like (Bharati et al., 1993; Bharati et al., 2002; Pedersen et al., 2004) have shown promising results.",

        "One must note here that the notion of karta, karma, etc, is not equivalent to that of the 'agent', 'theme' thematic roles (although they might map to them sometimes).",
        "The reason for this divergence in the two notions (karaka and thematic role) is due to the difference in what they convey.",
        "Thematic role is purely semantic in nature whereas the karaka is syntactico-semantic.",
        "Examples (3), illustrates this point, (3) chaabhi ne darvaazaa kholaa 'key' '-erg' 'door' 'opened' 'The key opened the door'",
        "In the above examples chaabhi is kl (karta), whereas it takes instrument thematic role.",
        "While the karaka relations are primarily motivated via verbal semantics, syntactic cues like postpositions and verbal morphology play an important role too.",
        "For example in (3) above, the ergative case 'ne' provides a strong cue to identify karta.",
        "Panini defines 'karta' as 'svatantra karta' which can be translated as 'the participant which is the most independent in a given action'.",
        "In (3) 'key' has such a property.",
        "When the speaker uses 'key' in (3), he/she intends to elevate the role of 'key' in the action of opening and does not communicate the actual agent of the action.",
        "The speaker uses 'key' as the independent participant in the act of opening.",
        "Hence, 'key' is the karta (see Bharati et al., 1995, pp.",

        "Ideally, the noun/adjective + verb sequence of the conjunct verb is placed in one chunk.",
        "Keeping this in mind, example (6) below is even more problematic,",
        "The noun prashna 'question' within the conjunct verb sequence prashna kiyaa is being modified by the adjective ek 'one' and not the entire noun-verb sequence; the annotation scheme should be able to account for this relation in the dependency tree.",
        "If prashna kiyaa is grouped as a single verb chunk, it will not be possible to mark the appropriate relation between ek and prashna.",
        "To overcome this problem it is proposed to break ek prashna kiyaa into two separate chunks, [ek prashna]/NP [kiyaa]/VG.",
        "The dependency relation of prashna with kiyaa will be POF ('Part OF' relation), i.e. the noun or an adjective in the conjunct verb sequence will have a POF relation with the verb.",
        "This way, the relation between ek and prashna becomes an intra-chunk relation as they will now become part of a single NP chunk.",
        "What makes such a sequence unique is the fact that the components which make up a conjunct verb are chunked separately, but semantically they constitute a single unit.",
        "The proposed scheme has the following advantages:",
        "(i) It captures the fact that the noun-verb seque ence is a conjunct verb by linking them with an appropriate tag, this information is extremely crucial syntactically.",
        "(ii) It allows us to deal with the modifier-modified relation between an adjective and its modified noun, as in example (6), which is a frequent phenomenon.",

        "(The head of the two (or more) conjoined elements lies in the conjunct, and may be so computed when needed.)",
        "The elements participating in the coordination can belong to various categories, such as, noun, adjective, adverbs etc; they can also be entire clauses, participles, etc.",
        "Other conjunct and punctuations which act like conjuncts are annotated similarly.",
