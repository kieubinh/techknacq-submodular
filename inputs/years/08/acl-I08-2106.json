        "This revision includes a much more detailed structure for the language realization level.",
        "1 Aims Describing the syntax and the semantics of prepositions, in a way similar to verbs (e.g. in FrameNet (www.icsi.berkeley.edu/ framenet/), or VerbNet (www.cis.upenn.edu/verbnet/)) or to nouns (as in WordNet and EuroWordNet) is obviously a very challenging, but necessary task.",
        "Prepositions turn out to be a very useful category in a number of applications such as indexing, knowledge extraction, textual entailment and question answering since they convey basic meanings of much interest like instruments, means, comparisons, amounts, approximations, localizations, etc.",
        "They must necessarily be taken into account – and rendered accurately – for effective machine translation and lexical choice in language generation.",
        "However, so far, prepositions have not been studied in NLP circles as extensively as nouns and verbs.",
        "PrepNet (http://www.irit.fr/recherches/ILPL/Site-Equipe/ILPL.htm under revision) is a framework that aims at constructing a repository of preposition syntactic and semantic behaviors.",
        "PrepNet is structured in two levels: • the abstract notion level: global, language independent, characterization of preposition senses in an abstract way, where frames represent some generic semantic aspects of these notions, • the language realization levels that deal with realizations for various languages, using a variety of marks (postpositions, affixes, compounds, etc.).",
        "However, we will keep the term 'preposition' hereafter for all these marks.",
        "We present here a revised version of a preliminary PrepNet.",
        "Besides some simplifications of the structure, innovations mainly concern the structures provided at the language realization level, motivated by the study of a few notions for a variety of languages.",
        "We provide the means to describe syntactic subcate-gorization forms, as well as semantic and pragmatic restrictions on uses.",
        "It seems that our view is now usable in a number of languages, but some are still resistant, like, e.g. Malay."

        "To elaborate an adequate formalism for the syntactic and semantic aspects of prepositions we want to encode in PrepNet, we have studied in depth preposition realizations in language around the abstract notions of theme and approximation (French, Spanish, Catalan, English, Thai) and instruments (for German, Italian, Spanish, French, Arabic and Berber, Thai, Bahasa Malaysia, Hindi, Urdu, Kashmiri, Bengali, and Filipino).",

        "From corpora, focussing on French, Spanish and English, we have studied every preposition lexeme, its distributions and constraints, and we have identified manually the different meanings they convey.",

        "This took about 1.5 man/year of work, preposition being not as numerous as e.g. verbs or adjectives (about 50 to 100).",
        "The first level, the abstract notions, is organized as follows:",
        "- a first level characterizes a semantic family,of a level roughly comparable to thematic roles: localization, manner, quantity, accompaniment, etc., - a second level accounts for the different facets of a semantic family, e.g. source, destination, via, and fixed position for the localization family, - a third level characterizes, roughly speaking, the modalities of a facet when appropriate.",
        "For example, the facet manner and attitudes is decomposed into 3 modalities: basic manner, manner by comparison and manner with a reference point.",
        "Due to space limitations, this latter level will not be much developed here.",
        "Abstract notions are the following (revised from (Saint-Dizier, 05)):",
