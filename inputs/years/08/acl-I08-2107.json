        "Recent research shows that it is possible, using current natural language processing (nlp) and machine learning technology, to automatically induce lexical classes from corpus data with promising accuracy (Merlo and Stevenson, 2001; Korhonen et 2007).",
        "This research is interesting, since lexical classifications, when tailored to the application and domain in question, can provide an effective means to deal with a number of important nl p tasks (e.g. parsing, word sense disambiguation, semantic role labeling), as well as enhance performance in many applications (e.g. information extraction, question-answering, machine translation) (Dorr, 1997; Prescher et al., 2000; Swier and Stevenson, 2004; Dang, 2004; Shi and Mihalcea, 2005).",
        "Lexical classes are useful because they capture generalizations over a range of (cross-)linguistic properties.",
        "Being defined in terms of similar meaning components and (morpho-)syntactic behaviour of words (Jackendoff, 1990; Levin, 1993) they generally incorporate a wider range of properties than e.g. classes defined solely on semantic grounds (Miller, 1990).",
        "They can be used to build a lexical organization which effectively captures generalizations and predicts much of the syntax and semantics of a new word by associating it with an appropriate class.",
        "This can help compensate for lack of data for individual words in nlp.",
        "Large-scale exploitation of lexical classes in real-world or domain-sensitive tasks has not been possible because existing manually built classifications are incomprehensive.",
        "They are expensive to extend and do not incorporate important statistical information about the likelihood of different classes for words.",
        "Automatic classification is a better alternative.",
        "It is cost-effective and gathers statistical information as a side-effect of the acquisition process.",
        "Most work on automatic classification has focussed on verbs which are typically the main predicates in sentences.",
        "Syntactic features have proved the most informative in verb classification.",
        "Experiments have been reported using both (i) deep syntactic features (e.g. subcategorization frames (scfs)) extracted using parsers and subcategorisation acquisition systems (Schulte im Walde, 2000; Korhonen et al., 2003; Schulte im Walde, 2006) and (ii) shallow ones (e.g. nps/pps preceding/following verbs) extracted using taggers and chunkers (Merlo and Stevenson, 2001; Joanis et al., 2007).",
        "(i) correspond closely with features used for manual classification (Levin, 1993).",
        "They have proved successful in the classification of German (Schulte im Walde, 2006) and English verbs (Korhonen et al., 2003).",
        "Yet promising results have also been reported when using (ii) for English verb classification (Merlo and Stevenson, 2001; Joanis et al., 2007).",
        "This may indicate that (i) are optimal for the task when combined with additional syntactic information from (ii).",
        "We investigate this matter by experimenting with a new, rich feature set which incorporates information about scfs (arguments) as well as adjuncts.",
        "It was extracted from valex, a large automatically acquired scf lexicon for English (Korhonen et al., 2006).",
        "We evaluate the feature set thoroughly using set of supervised classifiers, most of which are new in verb classification.",
        "The best performing classifier (Maximum Entropy) yields the accuracy of 60.1% on classifying 204 verbs into 17 Levin (1993) classes.",
        "This result is good, considering that we performed no sophisticated feature engineering or selection based on the properties of the target classification (Joanis et al., 2007).",
        "We propose various avenues for future work.",
        "We introduce our target classification in section 2 and syntactic features in section 3.",
        "The classification techniques are presented in section 4.",
        "Details of the experimental evaluation are supplied in section 5.",
