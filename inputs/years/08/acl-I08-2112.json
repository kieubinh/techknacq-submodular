        "To correctly extract answers, modern question answering systems depend on matching words between questions and retrieved passages containing answers.",
        "We are interested in learning hypernymic (i.e., is-a) relations involving named entities because we believe these can be exploited to improve a significant class of questions.",
        "For example, consider the following questions:",
        "• What island produces Blue Mountain coffee?",
        "• In which game show do participants compete based on their knowledge of consumer prices?",
        "• What villain is the nemesis of Dudley Do-",
        "Knowledge that Jamaica is an island, that The Price is Right is a game show, and that Snidely Whiplash is a villain, is crucial to answering these questions.",
        "Sometimes these relations are evident in the same context as answers to questions, for example, in \"The island of Jamaica is the only producer of Blue Mountain coffee\"; however, \"Jamaica is the only producer of Blue Mountain coffee\" should be sufficient, despite the fact that Jamaica is an island is not observable from the sentence.",
        "The dynamic nature of named entities (NEs) makes it difficult to enumerate all of their evolving properties; thus manual creation and curation of this information in a lexical resource such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) is problematic.",
        "Paşca and Harabagiu discuss how insufficient coverage of named entities impairs QA (2001).",
        "They write:",
        "\"Because WordNet was not designed as an encyclopedia, the hyponyms of concepts such as composer or poet are illustrations rather than an exhaustive list of instances.",
        "For example, only twelve composer names specialize the concept composer ... Consequently, the enhancement of WordNet with NE information could help QA.\"",
        "The chief contribution of this study is demonstrating that an automatically mined knowledge base, which naturally contains errors as well as correctly distilled knowledge, can be used to improve QA performance.",
        "In Section 2 we discuss prior work in identifying hypernymic relations.",
        "We then explain our methods for improved NE hyponym learning and its evaluation (Section 3) and apply the relations that are discovered to enhance question answering (Section 4).",
        "Finally we discuss our results (Section 5) and present our conclusions (Section 6)."

        "Her approach was to identify discriminating lexico-syntactic patterns that suggest hypernymic relations.",
        "For example, \"X, such as Y\", as in \"elements, such as chlorine and fluorine\".",
        "Etzioni et al.",
        "developed a system, KnowItAll, that does not require training examples and is broadly applicable to a variety of classes (2005).",
        "Starting with seed examples generated from high precision generic patterns, the system identifies class-specific lexical and part-of-speech patterns and builds a Bayesian classifier for each category.",
        "KnowItAll was used to learn hundreds of thousands of class instances and clearly has potential for improving QA; however, it would be difficult to reproduce the approach because of information required for each class (i.e., specifying synonyms such as town and village for city) and because it relies on submitting a large number of queries to a web search engine.",
        "Paşca and Van Durme looked at learning entity class membership for five high frequency classes (company, country, city, drug, and painter), using search engine query logs (2007).",
        "They reported precision at 50 instances between 0.50 and 0.82.",
        "Snow et al.",
        "have described an approach with several desirable properties: (1) it is weakly-supervised and only requires examples of hypernym/hyponym relations and unannotated text; (2) the method is suitable for both common and rare categories; and, (3) it achieves good performance without post filtering using the Web (2005; 2006).",
        "Their method relies on dependency parsing, a form of shallow parsing where each word modifies a single parent word.",
        "Hypernym/hyponym word pairs where the wordsbelong to a single WordNet synset were identified and served to generate training data in the following way: making the assumption that when the two words co-occur, evidence for the is-a relation is present, sentences containing both terms were extracted from unlabeled text.",
        "The sentences were parsed and paths between the nouns in the dependency trees were calculated and used as features in a supervised classifier for hypernymy."

        "This beneficially increases the density of training and test vectors.",
        "Third, we include additional features not based on dependency parses (e.g., morphology and capitalization).",
        "Fourth, because we are specifically interested in hypernymic relations involving named entities, we use a bootstrapping phase where training data consisting primarily of common nouns are used to make predictions and we then manually extract named entity hyponyms to augment the training data.",

        "Our synthetic data relies on hyper/hyponym pairs drawn from WordNet, which is generally rich in common nouns and lacking in proper nouns.",
        "But certain lexical and syntactic features are more likely to be predictive for NE hyponyms.",
        "For example, it is uncommon to precede a named entity with an indefinite article, and certain superlative adjectives are more likely to be used to modify classes of entities (e.g., \"the youngest coach\", \"the highest peak\").",
        "Accordingly we wanted to enrich our training data with NE exemplars.",
        "By manually reviewing highly ranked predictions of the baseline system, we identified 1356 additional pairs to augment the training data.",
        "This annotation took about a person-day.",
        "We then rescanned the corpus to build training vectors for these co-occurring nouns to produce the +NE model vectors.",
        "The +Feat model incorporated an additional 276 binary features which are listed in Table 3.",
        "We considered other features such as the frequency of patterns on the Web, but with over 17 million noun pairs this was computationally infeasible.",
