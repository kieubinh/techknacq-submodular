        "For Telugu language, we decreased the WER from 45.2% to 40.4% (by 4.8% absolute), and the IWER from 41.6% to 39.5% (2.1 % absolute), with respect to the baseline performance.",

        "Research and development in speech recognition technology has continued to grow as the cost for implementing such voice-activated systems has dropped and the usefulness and efficiency of these systems has improved.",
        "Furthermore, speech recognition has enabled the automation of certain applications that are not automatable using push-button interactive voice response (IVR) systems.",
        "Speech recognition system are based on simplified stochastic models, so any aspects of the speech that may be important to recognition but are not represented in the models cannot be used to aid in recognition.",

        "Since there have not yet been many publications on ASR for the Dravidian languages, we give here some basic information on them.",
        "Dravidian languages are spoken by more than 200 million people (Wikipedia, 2007).",
        "In phonology, Dravidian languages suffer from the lack of distinction between aspirated and unaspirated stops.",
        "While some Dravidian languages have large numbers of loan words from Sanskrit and other Indo-European languages, the words are often mispronounced by monolingual Dravidian speakers.",
        "Dravidian languages are also characterized by a three-way distinction between dental, alveoar and retroflex places of articulation as well as large numbers of liquids.",
        "In this work, we show evidence from one particular Dravidian language Telugu.",
        "Telugu belongs to the family but with ample influences by the Indo-Arian family and is the official language of the state of Andhra Pradesh, India.",
        "It is the Dravidian language with the greatest number of speakers, the second largest spoken language in India after Hindi and one of the 22 official national languages of India.",
        "The Telugu script is believed to descend from the Brahmi script of the Ashokan era.",
        "Merchants took the Eastern Chalukyan Script to Southeast Asia where it parented the scripts of Mon, Burmese, Thai, Khmer, C'am, Javanese and Balinese languages.",
        "Their similarities to Telugu script can be discerned even today.",
        "Its appearance is quite similar to the Kannada script, its closest cousin.",
        "Telugu script is written from left to right and consists of sequences of simple and/or complex characters.",
        "The script is largely syllabic in nature - the basic units of writing are syllables.",
        "Since the number of possible syllables is very large, syllables are composed of more basic units such as vowels (achchu or swar) and consonants (hallu or vyanjan).",
        "Consonants in consonant clusters take shapes which are very different from the shapes they take elsewhere.",
        "Consonants are presumed to be pure consonants, that is, without any vowel sound in them.",
        "However, it is traditional to write and read consonants with an implied 'a' vowel sound.",
        "When consonants combine with other vowel signs, the vowel part is indicated orthographically using signs known as vowel maatras.",
        "The shapes of vowel maatras are also very different from the shapes ofthe corresponding vowels.",
        "The overall pattern consists of 60 symbols, of which 16 are vowels, 3 vowel modifiers, and 41 consonants.",

        "We have recorded a large broadcast news corpus for Telugu.",
        "All commercials and stretches of spontaneous speech were removed from the data, since we focus here on ASR for an unexplored language rather than on dealing with automatic audio segmentation and spontaneous speech recognition.",
        "Overall, we had at disposal 61.2 hours of pure transcribed speech.",
        "It yields 635k word tokens, contained in manual human transcriptions.",
        "Due to rich morphology of Dravidian languages, it represents 78k different word forms, with plenty of words appearing just once.",
        "We used ~70% of data for training, ~15% for development, and the remainding ~15% for testing.",
        "For language modeling, we used a newspaper corpus containing data from three major Telugu newspapers - Andhra Prabha, Eenadu, and Vaartha.",
        "This corpus contains 20M tokens, which corresponds to 615k different word forms.",
        "The usual metric to evaluate ASR system performance is Word Error Rate (WER).",
        "Unfortunately, as we described in Section 2, Telugu is a highly in-Sectional language having a really high number of different word forms.",
        "Using WER, this cause to underestimate the real system performance, since this metric does not distinguish between confusing word identities and confusing just forms of the same word (lemma).",
        "However, it is obvious that these errors do not have the same influence on the usability of automatic transcripts.",
        "Taking an example from English, recognizing who instead of whom is not that bad as confusing boom (especially when most Americans or not able to distinguish who and whom anyway).",
        "Thus, we propose to use Inflectional Word Error Rate (IWER), which gives weight 1 to errors confusing lemmas, while only a weight 0.5 when the lemma of the incorrectly recognized word is correct, but the whole word form is not correct.",
        "Lemmas corresponding to particular word forms may be obtained using an automatic lemmatization technique.",
        "The key problem for our method (as described below) is to perform appropriate ASR confidence measuring.",
        "Confidence measures (CMs) need to be interpreted in order to decide whether a word is probably recognized correct or incorrect.",
        "In this paper, we use a confidence measure based on posterior probability formulation.",
        "It is well known that the conventional ASR algorithm is usually formulated as a pattern classification problem using the maximum a posterior (MAP) decision rule to find the most likely sequence of words W which achieves the maximum posterior probability p(W|X) given any acoustic observation X.",
        "Obviously, the posterior probability p(W|X) is a good confidence measure for the recognition decision that X is recognized as W. However, most real-world ASR systems simply ignore the term p(X) during the search, since it is constant across different words W. This explains why the raw scores are not usable as confidence scores to reflect recognition reliability.",
        "Anyway, after the normalization by p(X), the posterior probability p(W|X) can be employed as a good confidence measure; it represents the absolute quantitative measure of the correspondence between X and W.",
        "In real-world tasks, we have to either employ certain simplifying assumptions or adopt some approximate methods when estimating p(X) in order to obtain the desired posteriors.",
        "In the first category, it includes the so-called filler-based methods which try to calculate p(X) from a set of general filler or background models.",
        "These approaches are very straightforward and usually can achieve an reasonable performance in many cases.",
        "However, we rather used the so-called lattice-based methods which attempt to calculate p(X), then the posterior probability p( W |X) in turn, from a word lattice or graph based on the forwardbackward algorithm, such as Schaaf (Schaaf T. and Kemp T., 1997) and Wessel (Wessel F. et al., 1999) and their colleagues, among others.",
        "Usually, a single word lattice or graph is generated by the ASR decoder for every \"utterance\".",
        "Then, the posterior probability of each recognized word or the whole hypothesized stream ofwords can be calculated based on the word-graph from an additional post-processing stage.",
        "Since word graph is a compact and fairly accurate representation of all alternative competing hypotheses of the recognition result which usually dominate the summation when computing p(X) over a variety of hypotheses, the posterior probability calculated from a word graph can approximate the true p(W|X) very well.",
        "In our approach, we extended the lattice based CM by using an antimodel.",
        "The idea of antimodels has already been proposed for CMs (Rahim M. et al., 1997), however, it has remained unclear what data should be used to estimate these antimodels.",
        "In our work, we simply generated anti-examples from our N-gram model.",
        "The rationale behind this is very straightforward.",
        "LM constraints are very strong in determining the final ASR hypotheses, and may sometimes undesirably wash out correct acoustic posteriors.",
        "Also, when you let your LM generate sentences, these sentences correspond well to N-gram probabilities but are definitely neither grammatically nor semantically correct.",
        "Thus, these generated sentences can be very well used as anti-examples to train the antimodel.",
        "Then, we performed forced-alignment against a random transcript to generate training data for each anti-model.",
        "The main problem when applying ASR to extremely inflected languages such as Telugu, is the need to use a very large vocabulary, in order to reduce the OOV rate to an acceptable level.",
        "However, this causes problems for making the automatic transcription in a time close to the real-time.",
        "Since we cannot use such a big dictionary in these task, our first results had quite high WERs and IWERs.",
        "However, we analyzed the errors and found that some typical error patterns occur repeatedly.",
        "This fact inspired us to design and employ the following method.",
        "First, using HTK large vocabulary speech recognizer (HTK, 2007) and a bigram LM, we generated an N-best ASR output and a scored bigram lattice.",
        "Then we statistically analyzed the errors and created so-called errgrams.",
        "Errgrams are pairs of bi-grams, the first member of the pair is the correct bigram and the second member is the recognized bigram.",
        "For infrequent bigrams, the method is allowed to back-off to unigrams, using discounting based on common smoothing strategies (such Katz backoff), but the backoff is more penalized since unigram errgrams are much less reliable compared to common language modeling backoffs (such as backoff for training LMs for ASR).",
        "Errgrams were not only trained using 1-best ASR output, but to gain more real ASR data, we used 5-best hypothesis for training.",
        "For estimating errgram pairs, we also take into account confidence scores - the lower CM, the higher weight is given to a particular errgram example.",
        "By this approach, we may achieve better results with using vocabulary of standard size (< 100k), since words in \"correct\" parts of errgrams may include words that are not in the limited size vocabulary used for the first recognition pass.",
        "In other words, we can partially reduce the OOV problem by this approach.",
        "Note that LMs used for lattice rescor-ing include all such words originally missing in the baseline LM but appearing in errgrams.",
        "The errgrams trained in the above described way, are then applied in the following way during the decoding phase:"
