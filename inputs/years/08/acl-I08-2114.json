        "Although a large number of noises exist in environment, broadly they can be classified into Factory, Babble, Engine, White and Channel noises etc.",
        "However most common kind of noise encountered is white noise, may it be in communication systems due to channel or generated in the equipment due to thermal or other electronic sources or combination of noises due to Central Limit Theorem (Aleksandr Lyapunov, 1901).",
        "Noise thus corrupts the speech, causing listener's fatigue and deteriorating performance of speech systems.",
        "Application of Speech enhancement or noise cancellation algorithms alleviates such problems to some extent.",
        "In literature several speech enhancement techniques exist.",
        "Though most traditional algorithms are based on optimizing mathematical criteria, they are not well correlated with speech perception and have not been as successful in preserving or improving quality in all regions of speech, especially transitional and unvoiced.",
        "Performance is also influenced by the specific type of noise, specific SNR, noise estimate updates and algorithm parameter settings.",
        "Spectral Subtraction technique of speech enhancement is popular and is still widely used as front end to speech systems for its simplistic nature and high quality performance except at very low SNRs (J. Lim, 1983).",
        "Variety of languages exists in Indian region, with Dravidian, Tibeto-Burman, Indo-European, Indo-Aryan and Indo Iranian background.",
        "Mostly Indian languages are phonetic in nature that is there is one to one correspondence between sounds and the representative alphabet, and combining them creates similar kind of sounds.",
        "However different languages vary in its perceptibility due to differences in its phonetic contents and variations in distribution of different phonemes, stress level distribution among phonemes and of course intonation pattern, nasality usage, allophonic variants, contextual, phonotactic, or coarticulatory constraints etc.",
        "Introduction of noise in speech distorts the speech spectrum and affects its phonetic perceptibility differently, due to the factors mentioned above.",
        "Enhancement of noisy speech though reduces the noise and subsequent irritation, but generally results in distortion of the speech spectrum.",
        "The kind and amount of distortion in the spectrum of enhanced speech will depend on the particular enhancement technique applied, and the SNR of the noisy speech.",
        "Therefore different types of speech units will get affected differently by the noise and subsequent enhancement.",
        "In this paper, a novel work on identification of spoken languages, based on effect of distortion introduced by white noise in the phonetic contents of different Indian Regional languages namely Kashmiri, Bangla and Manipuri is reported.",
        "This kind of approach is not found in the literature for any other language as well.",
        "Effect of Speech enhancement technique namely spectral subtraction on noisy speech of these languages is also studied at different levels of segmental SNR.",
        "White noise has been considered for noisy spoken language, as it affects all frequency components of speech uniformly.",
        "The distortion introduced in the resulting speech is measured by estimating objective measures of perceptual speech quality such as LLR, LAR, IS and WSS (Hansen and Pellom, 1998).",
        "The variation of these estimated objective measures of the spectral distortion, with regard to a particular language, is studied and analyzed, to see language specific effects of the noise and enhancement algorithm, in order to provide clue to the identity of language in use.",
        "The paper has been organized in the following form: Section 2 gives details of Spectral Subtraction technique of enhancement used.",
        "Section 3 gives a comparative study of phonotactics of the three languages i.e. Kashmiri, Bangla and Manipuri in brief.",
