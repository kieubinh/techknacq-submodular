        "The problem of identifying good features for improving conventional language models like trigrams is presented as a classification task in this paper.",
        "The idea is to use various syntactic and semantic features extracted from a language for classifying between real-world articles and articles generated by sampling a trigram language model.",
        "In doing so, a good accuracy obtained on the classification task implies that the extracted features capture those aspects of the language that a trigram model may not.",
        "Such features can be used to improve the existing trigram language models.",

        "Statistical Language Modeling techniques attempt to model language as a probability distribution of its components like words, phrases and topics.",
        "Language models find applications in classification tasks like Speech Recognition, Handwriting Recognition and Text Categorization among others.",
        "Conventional language models based on n-grams approximate the probability distribution of a language by computing probabilities of words conditioned on previous n words as follows",
        "In most applications, lower order n-grams (such as bigram or trigram) are used but they are an unrealistic approximation of the underlying language.",
        "Higher order n-grams are desirable but they present problems concerning data sparsity.",
        "On the other hand, low order n-grams are incapable of representing other aspects of the language like the underlying topics, topical redundancy etc.",
        "In order to build a better language model, additional features have to be augmented to the existing language model (e.g. a trigram model) which capture those aspects of the language that the trigram model does not.",
        "Now, one way to test the goodness of a feature under consideration is to use it in a framework like an exponential model (Rosenfeld, 1997; Cai et al., 2000) and note the improvement in perplexity.",
        "An alternative way (Eneva et al., 2001) is as follows: Let L be the language and L be an approximation of the language obtained by sampling the trigram language model.",
        "Also, let X be a piece of text obtained from either L or L. Let y = h(f (X)) such that y = 1 if X e L and y = 0 if X e L where f (.)",
        "is the computed feature and h(.)",
        "is the hypothesis function (a classifier like AdaBoost, SVM etc).",
        "If Pr[y = h(f (x))] is found to be sufficiently high, it means that the feature f (x) is able to distinguish effectively between the actual language L and the approximate language L. In other words, f (x) captures those features of the language that are complementary to the ones captured by the trigram model and therefore f(x) is a good feature to augment the trigram language model with.",
        "The formalism explained previously can be interpreted as a classification task in-order to distinguish between Real articles and Fake articles.",
        "Articles of different lengths drawn at random from the Broadcast News Corpus (BNC) are termed as Real articles (from language L).",
        "Articles generated by sampling the trigram model trained on the same corpus are termed as Fake articles (language L).",
        "These articles together form the training data for the classifier to associate the features with the classification labels (real or fake) where the features are computed from the text.",
        "The features that give high classification accuracy on the test set of articles are considered good candidates for adding to the trigram model.",
        "Furthermore, the confidence that the classifier attaches to a classification decision can be used to compute the perplexity.",
        "In this paper, a classification-task based formalism is used to investigate the goodness of some new features for language modeling.",
        "At the same time features proposed in the previous literature on language modeling are also revisited (Cai et al., 2000) Section 2 discusses various syntactic and semantic features used for the classification task, Section 3 gives details about the experiments conducted and the classification results obtained and finally, Section 4 concludes the paper by discussing the implications of the classification results on language modeling with pointers to improvements and future work."

        "To differentiate a real article from a fake one, the empirical, syntactic and semantic characteristics of a given article are used to compute the features for the classification task.",
        "The various types of features that were experimented are as follows:",
        "Empirical features are based on the statistical analysis of both the real and fake articles.",
        "They include the count of uncommon pairs of words within an article, the ratio of perplexity of trigram and quadgram models for a given article and the nature of the POS tags that occur at the start and end of sentences in an article.",
        "Ratio of Perplexity of trigram and quad-gram models",
        "Given an article, the ratio of its perplexity for a tri-gram model to a quad-gram model is computed.",
        "The trigram and quad-gram models are both trained on the same BNC corpus.",
        "Both real and fake articles would give a low perplexity score for the tri-gram model but for the quad-gram model, real articles would have significantly lower perplexity than the fake articles.",
        "This implies that the ratio of trigram to quad-gram perplexities would be lower for a fake article than for a real article.",
        "In other words, this ratio is similar to computing the likelihood ratio of an article w.r.t the trigram and quad-gram models.",
        "The histogram in Figure 1 shows a good separation in the distribution of values of this feature for the real and fake articles which indicates the effectiveness of this feature.",
        "A quadgram language model is a better approximation of real text than a trigram model and by using this as a feature, we are able to demonstrate the usefulness of the classification task as a method for identifying good features for language modeling.",
        "In the subsequent sections, we investigate other features using this classification framework.",
        "Figure 1: Histogram for the ratio of perplexities with respect to Trigram and Quadgram Language models over the training set Count of uncommon pairs of words",
        "Content words are the frequently occurring words in the corpus excluding the stop-words.",
        "All the words in corpus are ranked according to frequency of their occurrence and content words are defined to be the words with rank between 150 and 6500.",
        "A list of common content word pairs (pairs of content words atleast 5 words apart) is prepared from the real corpus by sorting the list of content word pairs by their frequency of occurrence and retaining those above a certain threshold.",
        "For a given article, a list ofcontent word pairs is compared against this list and word pairs not in this list form the set of uncommon word pairs.",
        "A real article is expected to have lesser number of uncommon content-word pairs than fake articles.",
        "When normalized by the total number of word pairs, we get the probability of finding an uncommon content-word pair in an article.",
        "This probability is greater for fake articles than the real articles and we use this probability as a feature for the classification task.",
        "Start and End POS Tags",
        "Certain POS tags are more probable than others to appear at the beginning or end of a real sentence.",
        "This characteristic of real text could be used as a feature to distinguish real articles from fake.",
        "The distribution of POS tags of the first and last words of the sentences in an article is used as a feature.",
        "Our experiments show that this feature had very little effect in the overall contribution to the classification accuracy over the development set.",
        "These features are derived from the parse structure of the sentence.",
        "It is hypothesized that real sentences tend to be grammatical while the same may not be the case for fake sentences.",
        "An objective measure of the grammaticality of a sentence can be obtained by running it through a statistical parser.",
        "The log-likelihood score returned by the parser can be used to judge the grammaticality of a sentence and thus determine whether it is fake or real.",
        "The Charniak Parser (Charniak, 2001; Charniak, 2005) was used for assessing the grammaticality of the articles under test.",
        "Given an article containing sentences Si, S2,..., SN with lengths Li,L2,... ,LN, we compute the parser log-likelihood scores P (Si),P (S2),P (SN).",
        "The overall grammaticality score for an article is given p _J2jLi LiP(Si)",
        "The grammaticality score was normalized using the average and standard deviation over the entire training set.",
        "This feature gave small improvement in terms of classification accuracy.",
        "There may be several reasons for this: (1) Our training data consisted of spoken transcripts from a broadcast news corpus whereas the Charniak Parser was trained on a different domain (Wall Street Journal) and (2) The parser was trained on mixed case text where as the data we used was all upper case.",
        "Real articles contain sentences with correlated pairs of content-words and sentences that are correlated with each other.",
        "An article with such sentence/word correlations is said to be semantically coherent.",
        "Owing to the use of only the short term word history for computing the probability distribution of a language, a trigram model fails to model semantic coherence and we exploit this fact for the classification task.",
        "Specifically, we intend to model both intra-sentence and inter-sentence semantic coherence and use them as features for classification.",
        "Intra-sentence Coherence",
        "To model the intra-sentence word correlations, we use Yule's Q-statistic (Eneva et al., 2001).",
        "The word correlations are learned from the BNC corpus as well as the fake corpus.",
        "The coherence score for an article is defined as the sum of the correlations between pairs of content words present in the article.",
        "The coherence score for an article is normalized by the total number of content-word pairs found in the article.",
        "Since the trigram and quad-gram language model can capture short distance coherences well, coherences between distant words can be used to differentiate between real and fake articles.",
        "The Yule Q-statistic is calculated for every pair of content words, which are atleast 5 words apart within a sentence, both in the real and fake corpus.",
        "The articles are scored according to content word-pair correlations learned from the real as well as fake corpus.",
        "Each article is given two scores, one for the word-pair correlations from real articles and other for the word-pair correlations from fake articles.",
        "For a real article, the real word-pair correlation score would be relatively higher compared to the fake word-pair correlation score (and vice-versa for a fake article).",
        "Modeling Topical Redundancy (Inter-sentence Coherence)",
        "A characteristic of real articles is that they tend to be cohesive in terms of the topic under discussion.",
        "For example, a news-article about a particular event (topic) would have several direct or indirect references to the event.",
        "We interpret this as some sort of a redundancy in terms of the information content which we term as Topical Redundancy.",
        "The fake articles would not exhibit such a redundancy.",
        "If a real article is transformed to another representation space where some form of truncation is applied, on transformation back to the original space, the amount of information-loss may not be significant due to information redundancy.",
        "However, if the same process is applied on a fake article, the information-loss would be significant when transformed back to the original space.",
        "We intend to exploit this fact for our classification task.",
        "Let DW xN be an article represented in the form of a matrix, where W is the article vocabulary and N is the number of sentences in that article.",
        "Every term of this matrix represents the frequency of occurrence of a vocabulary word in a particular sentence.",
        "We construct a sentence-sentence matrix as follows:",
        "We now transform A into the Eigen-space using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) which gives",
        "Here, UN xN is the eigenvector matrix and SN xNis the diagonal eigenvalue matrix.",
        "If we retain only the top K eigenvalues from S , we get the truncated (lossy) form SKxK.",
        "Thus the truncated form of A i.e. A' is",
        "We believe that the information loss \\\\ A – A' \\\\will not be significant in the case of real articles since the topical redundancy is captured in a very compact manner by the eigen-representation.",
        "However, in the case of a fake article, the loss is considerable.",
        "For a real article, the matrix would be less sparse than a fake article and so is the case for the reconstructed matrix.",
        "Therefore, the statistics -mean, median, minimum and maximum computed from the reconstructed matrix have higher values for real articles than a fake articles.",
        "We use these statistics as features for classifying the article.",
        "Figure 2 show the histograms of the statistics computed from the reconstructed matrix for the training set.",
        "As can be seen, there is a good separation between the two classes fake and real in all the cases.",
        "Using these features increased the classification accuracy by a significant amount as shown later.",
        "From another perspective, these features model the inter-sentence semantic coherence (Deerwester et al., 1990) within an article and this is consistent with our notion of topical redundancy as explained previously.",
