        "2.1 Goal and Data Oriented Evaluation, Module Selection and Inter-operability",
        "There are standard evaluation metrics for NLP modules such as precision, recall and F-value.",
        "For basic tasks like sentence splitting, POS tagging, and named-entity recognition, these metrics can be estimated using existing gold-standard test sets.",
        "Conversely, accuracy measurements based on the standard test sets are sometimes deceptive, since its accuracy may change significantly in practice, depending on the types of text and the actual tasks at hand.",
        "Because these accuracy metrics do not take into account the importance of the different types of errors to any particular application, the practical utility of two systems with seemingly similar levels of accuracy may in fact differ significantly.",
        "To users and developers alike, a detailed examination of how systems perform (on the text they would like to process) is often more important than standard metrics and test sets.",
        "Naturally, far greater weight is placed in measuring the end-to-end performance of a composite system than in measuring the performance of the individual components.",
        "In reality, because the selection of modules usually affects the performance of the entire system, it is crucial to carefully select modules that are appropriate for a given task.",
        "This is the main reason for having a collection of interoperable",

        "We need to show how the ultimate performance will be affected by the selection of different modules and show the best combination of modules in terms of the performance of the whole aggregated system for the task at hand.",
        "Since the number of possible combinations of component modules is typically large, the system has to be able to enumerate and execute them semi-automatically.",
        "This requires a higher level of interoperability of individual modules than just wrapping them for UIMA.",
        "The UIMA framework uses the \"stand-off annotation\" style (Ferrucci et al., 2006).",
        "The raw text in a document is kept unchanged during the analysis process, and when the processing of the text is performed, the result is added as new standoff annotations with references to their positions in the raw text.",
        "A Common Analysis Structure (CAS) maintains a set of these annotations, which in itself are objects.",
        "The annotation objects in a CAS belong to types that are defined separately in a hierarchical type system.",
        "The features of an annotation2 object have values that are typed as well.",
        "Each UIMA Component has the capability property which describes what types of objects the component may take as the input and what types of objects it produces as the output.",
        "For example, a named entity recognizer detects named entities in the text and outputs annotation objects of the type NamedEntity.",
        "It is possible to deploy any UIMA component as a SOAP web service, so that we can combine a remote component on a web service with the local component freely inside a UIMA-based system."

        "Although UIMA provides a set of useful functionalities for an integration platform of TM/NLP tools, users still have to develop the actual platform by using these functionalities effectively.",
        "There are several decisions for the designer to make an integration platform.",
        "Determining how to use types in UIMA is a crucial decision.",
        "Our decision is to keep different type systems by individual groups as they are, if necessary; we require that individual type systems have to be related through a sharable type system, which our platform defines.",
        "Such a shared type system can bridge modules with different type systems, though the bridging module may lose some information during the translation process.",
        "Whether such a sharable type system can be defined or not is dependent on the nature of each problem.",

        "Figure 1 shows a part of our sharable type system.",

        "Secondly we should consider that the type system may be used to compare a similar sort of tools.",
        "Types should be defined in a distinct and hierarchical manner.",
        "For example, both tokenizers and POS taggers output an object of type Token, but their roles are different when we assume a cascaded pipeline.",
        "We defined Token as a supertvpe, POSToken as subtypes of Token.",
        "Each tool should have an individual type to make clear which tool generated which instance, because each tool may have a slightly different definition.",

        "If we can prepare two or more components for some type of the components in the workflow (e.g. two sentence detectors and three POS taggers), then we can make combinations of these tools to form a multiplied number of workflow patterns (2x3 = 6 patterns).",
        "See Table 1 for the details of UIMA components used in our experiments.",
        "We made a pattern expansion mechanism which generates possible workflow patterns automatically from a user-defined comparable workflow.",
        "A comparable workflow is a special workflow that explicitly specifies which set of components should be compared.",
        "Then, users just need to group comparable components (e.g. ABNER3 and MedT-NER as a comparable NER group) without making any modifications to the original UIMA components.",
        "This aggregation of comparable components is controlled by our custom workflow controller.",
        "In some cases, a single tool can play two or more roles (e.g. the GENIA Tagger performs tokenization, POS tagging, and NER; see Figure 4).",
        "It may be possible to decompose the original tool into single roles, but in most cases it is difficult and unnatural to decompose such a complex tool.",
        "We designed our comparator to detect possible input combinations automatically by the types of previously generated annotations, and the input capability of each posterior component.",
        "As described in the previous section, the component should have appropriate capabilities with proper types in order to permit this detection.",
        "When a component requires two or more input types (e.g. our PPI extractor requires outputs of a deep parser and a protein NER system), there could be different components used in the prior flow (e.g. OpenNLP and GENIA sentence detectors in Figure 5).",
