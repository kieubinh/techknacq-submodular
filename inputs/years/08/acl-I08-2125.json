        "Large Scale Diagnostic Code Classiication for Medical Patient Records",
        "Lucian Vlad Lita and Shipeng Yu and Stefan Niculescu and Jinbo Bi",
        "A critical, yet not very well studied problem in medical applications is the issue of accurately labeling patient records according to diagnoses and procedures that patients have undergone.",
        "This labeling problem, known as coding, consists of assigning standard medical codes (ICD9 and CPT) to patient records.",
        "Each patient record can have several corresponding labels/codes, many of which are correlated to specific diseases.",
        "The current, most frequent coding approach involves manual labeling, which requires considerable human effort and is cumbersome for large patient databases.",
        "In this paper we view medical coding as a multi-label classification problem, where we treat each code as a label for patient records.",
        "Due to government regulations concerning patient medical data, previous studies in automatic coding have been quite limited.",
        "In this paper, we compare two efficient algorithms for diagnosis coding on a large patient dataset."

        "In order to be reimbursed for services provided to patients, hospitals need to provide proof of the procedures that they performed.",
        "Currently, this is achieved by assigning a set of CPT (Current Procedural Terminology) codes to each patient visit to the hospital.",
        "Providing these codes is not enough for receiving reimbursement: in addition, hospitals need to justify why the corresponding procedures have been performed.",
        "In order to do that, each patient visit needs to be coded with the appropriate diagnosis that require the above procedures.",
        "There are several standardized systems for patient diagnosis coding, with ICD9 (International Classification of Diseases, (Organization, 1997)) being the official version.",
        "Usually a CPT code is represented by a five digit integer whereas an ICD9 code is a real number consisting of a 2-3 digit disease category followed by 1-2 decimal subcategory.",
        "For example, a CPT code of 93307 is used for an Echo Exam.",
        "An ICD9 code of 428 represents Heart Failure (HF) with subcategories 428.0 (Congestive HF, Unspecified), 428.1 (Left HF), 428.2 (Systolic HF), 428.3 (Diastolic HF), 428.4(Combined HF) and 428.9 (HF, Unspecified).",
        "The coding approach currently used in hospitals relies heavily on manual labeling performed by skilled and/or not so skilled personnel.",
        "This is a very time consuming process, where the person involved reads the patient chart and assigns the appropriate codes.",
        "Moreover, this approach is very error prone given the huge number of CPT and ICD9 codes.",
        "A recent study (Benesch et al., 1997) suggests that only 60%-80% of the assigned ICD9 codes reflect the exact patient medical diagnosis.",
        "This can be partly explained by the fact that coding is done by medical abstractors who often lack the medical expertise to properly reach a diagnosis.",
        "Two situations are prevalent: \"over-coding\" (assigning a code for a more serious condition than it is justified) and \"under-coding\" (missing codes for existing procedures/diagnoses).",
        "Both situations translate into sig-niicant inancial loses: for insurance companies in the irst case and for hospitals in the second case.",
        "Additionally, accurate coding is extremely important because ICD9 codes are widely used in determining patient eligibility for clinical trials as well as in quantifying hospital compliance with quality initiatives.",
        "Another recent study (Sonel et al., 2006) stresses the importance of developing automated methods for patient record information extraction by demonstrating how an automated system performed with 8% better accuracy than a human abstractor on a task of identifying guideline compliance for unstable angina patients.",
        "In the study, differences between the automated system and the human abstractor were adjudicated by an expert based on the evidence provided.",
        "In this paper we compare several data mining techniques for automated ICD9 diagnosis coding.",
        "Our methods are able to predict ICD9 codes by modeling this task as a classiication problem in the natural language processing framework.",
        "We demonstrate our algorithms in section 4 on a task of ICD9 coding of a large population of patients seen at a cardiac hospital."

        "Classiication under supervised learning setting has been a standard problem in machine learning or data mining area, which learns to construct inference models from data with known assignments, and then the models can be generalized to unseen data for code prediction.",
        "However, it has been rarely employed in the domain for automatic assignment of medical codes such as ICD9 codes to medical records.",
        "Part of the reason is that the data and labels are dif-icult to obtain.",
        "Hospitals are usually reluctant to share their patient data with research communities, and sensitive information (e.g. patient name, date of birth, home address, social security number) has to by anonymized to meet HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) (hip, ) standards.",
        "Another reason is that the code classiication task is itself very challenging.",
        "The patient records contain a lot of noise (misspellings, abbreviations, etc), and understanding the records correctly is very important to make correct code predictions.",
        "Most of the ICD9 code assignment systems work with a rule-based engine as, for instance, the one available online from the site http://www.icd9coding.com/, or the one described in (reb, ), which displays different ICD9 codes for a trained medical abstractor to look at and manually assign proper codes to patient records.",
        "A health care organization can signiicantly improve its performance by implementing an automated system that integrates patients documents, tests with standard medical coding system and billing systems.",
        "Such a system offers large health care organizations a means to eliminate costly and ineficient manual processing of code assignments, thereby improving productivity and accuracy.",
        "Early efforts dedicated to automatic or semi-automatic assignments of ICD9 codes (Larkey and Croft, 1995; Lovis et al., 1995) demonstrate that simple machine learning approaches such as k-nearest neighbor, relevance feedback, or Bayesian independence classiiers can be used to acquire knowledge from already-coded training documents.",
        "The identiied knowledge is then employed to optimize the means of selecting and ranking candidate codes for the test document.",
        "Often a combination of different classifiers produce better results than any single type of classiier.",
        "Occasionally, human interaction is still needed to enhance the code assignment accuracy (Lovis et al., 1995).",
        "Similar work was performed to automatically categorize patients documents according to meaningful groups and not necessarily in terms of medical codes (de Lima et al., 1998; Ruch, 2003; Freitas-Junior et al., 2006; Ribeiro-Neto et al., 2001).",
        "For instance, in (de Lima et al., 1998), classiiers were designed and evaluated using a hierarchical learning approach.",
        "Recent works (Halasz et al., 2006) also utilize NGram techniques to automatically create Chief Complaints classiiers based on ICD9 groupings.",
        "In (Rao et al., ), the authors present a small scale approach to assigning ICD9 codes of Diabetes and Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) on a small population of patients.",
        "Their approach is semi-automatic, consisting of association rules implemented by an expert, which are further combined in a probabilistic fashion.",
        "However, given the high degree of human interaction involved, their method will not be scalable to a large number of medical conditions.",
        "Moreover, the authors do not further classify the subtypes within Diabetes or AMI.",
        "Very recently, the Computation Medicine Center was sponsoring an international challenge task on this type of text classification problem.",
        "About 2,216 documents are carefully extracted (including training and testing), and 45 ICD9 labels (with 94 distinct combinations) are used for these documents.",
        "More than 40 groups submitted their results, and the best macro and micro F1 measures are 0.89 and 0.77, respectively.",
        "The competition is a worthy effort in the sense that it provides a test bed to compare different algorithms.",
        "Unfortunately, public datasets are to date much smaller than the patient records in even a small hospital.",
        "Moreover, many of the documents are very simple (one or two sentences).",
        "It is dificult to train good classiiers based on such a small data set (even the most common label 786.2 (for \"Cough\") has only 155 reports to train on), and the generalizability of the obtained classiiers is also problematic."

        "This section describes the two data mining algorithms used in section 4 for assigning ICD9 codes to patient visits as well as the real world dataset used in our experiments.",
        "We built a 1.3GB corpus using medical patient records extracted from a real single-institution patient database.",
        "This is important since most published previous work was performed on very small datasets.",
        "Due to privacy concerns, since the database contains identiied patient information, it cannot be made publicly available.",
        "Each document consists of a full hospital visit record for a particular patient.",
        "Each patient may have several hospital visits, some of which may not be documented if they choose to visit multiple hospitals.",
        "Our dataset consists of 96557 patient visits, each of them being labeled with a one or more ICD9 codes.",
        "We have encountered 2618 distinct ICD9 codes associated with these visits, with the top ive most frequent summarized in table 1.",
        "Given suficient patient records supporting a code, this paper investigates the performance of statistical classification techniques.",
        "This paper focuses on correct clas-siication of high-frequency diagnosis codes.",
        "Automatic prediction of the ICD9 codes is a challenging problem.",
        "During each hospital visit, a patient might be subjected to several tests, have different lab results and undergo various treatments.",
        "For the majority of these events, physicians and nurses generate free text data either by typing the information themselves or by using a local or remote speech-to-text engine.",
        "The input method also affects text quality and therefore could impact the performance of clas-siiers based on this data.",
        "In addition to these obstacles for the ICD9 classiication task, patient records often include medical history (i.e. past medical conditions, medications etc) and family history (i.e. parents' chronic diseases).",
        "By embedding unstructured medical information that does not directly describe a patient's state, the data becomes noisier.",
        "A signiicant difference between medical patient record classiication and general text classiication (e.g. news domain) is word distribution.",
        "Depending on the type of institution, department proile, and patient cohort, phrases such as \"discharge summary\", \"chest pain\", and \"ECG\" may be ubiquitous in corpus and thus not carry a great deal of information for a classiication task.",
        "Consider the phrase \"chest pain\": intuitively, it should correlate well with the ICD-9 code 786.50, which corresponds to the condition chest pain.",
        "However, through the nature of the corpus, this phrase appears in well over half of the documents, many of which do not belong to the 786.50 category.",
        "The irst classiication method consists of support vector machines (SVM), proven to perform well on textual data (Rogati and Yang, 2002).",
        "The experiments presented use the SVM Light toolkit (Joachims, 2002) with a linear kernel and a target positive-to-negative example ratio deined by the training data.",
        "We experiment with a cost function that assigns equal value to all classes, as well as with a target class cost equal to the ratio of negative to positive examples.",
        "The results shown in this paper correspond to SVM classiiers trained using the latter cost function.",
        "Note that better results may be obtained by tuning such parameters on a validation set.",
        "The second method we have tried on this problem is a probabilistic approach based on Gaussian processes.",
        "A Gaussian process (GP) is a stochastic process that deines a nonparametric prior over functions in Bayesian statistics (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006).",
        "In the linear case, i.e. the function has linear form f (x) = wTx, the GP prior on f is equivalent to a Gaussian prior on w, which takes the form w ~ N(/xw, Sw), with mean //tw and covariance Sw. Then the likelihood of labels y = [y\\,..., yn]T is with P(yi|wTxi) the probability that document xitakes label y .",
        "Table 1 : Statistics of the top five ICD-9 codes most frequent in the patient record database.",
        "Frequency of ICD-9 code in corpus and the corresponding coverage (i.e. fraction of documents in the corpus that were coded with the particular ICD-9 code).",
        "In general we fix aw = 0, and sw = I with I the identity matrix.",
        "Based on past experience we simply choose P(yi|wTxi) to be a Gaussian, yi ~ N(wTxi,CT), with <t a model parameter.",
        "Since everything is Gaussian here, the a posteriori distribution of w conditioned on the observed labels, P(w|y, <t), is also a Gaussian, with mean where X = [x1,..., xn]T is a n x d matrix.",
        "The only model parameter <r can also be optimized by maximizing the likelihood (1) with respect to <r. Finally for a test document x*, we predict its label as AWx* with the optimal <r. We can also estimate the variance of this prediction, but describing this is beyond the scope of this paper.",
        "This model is sometimes called the Bayesian ridge regression, since the log-likelihood (i.e., the logarithm of (1)) is the negation of the ridge regression cost up to a constant factor (see, e.g., (Tikhonov and Arsenin, 1977; Bishop, 1995)):",
        "with A = cr.",
        "One advantage of Bayesian ridge regression is that there is a systematic way of optimizing A from the data.",
        "Feature selection is done prior to calculation (2) to ensure the matrix inverse is feasible.",
        "Cholesky factorization is used to speed up calculation.",
        "Though the task here is classiication, we treat the classiication labels as regression labels and normalize them before learning (i.e., subtract the mean such that J]i yi = 0)."
