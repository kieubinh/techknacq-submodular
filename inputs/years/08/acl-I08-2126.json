        "The goal of this study has been to automatically extract a large set of hyponymy relations, which play a critical role in many NLP applications, such as Q&A systems (Fleischman et al., 2003).",
        "In this paper, hyponymy relation is defined as a relation between a hy-pernym and a hyponym when \"the hyponym is a (kind of) hypernym\".",
        "'This is a slightly modified definition of the one in (Miller et al., 1990).",
        "Linguistic literature, e.g. (A.Cruse, 1998), distinguishes hyponymy relations, such as \"national university\" and \"university\", and concept-instance relations, such as \"Tokyo University\" and \"university\".",
        "However, we regard concept-instance",
        "Currently, most useful sources of hyponymy relations are hand-crafted thesauri, such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "Such thesauri are highly reliable, but their coverage is not large and the costs of extension and maintenance is prohibitively high.",
        "To reduce these costs, many methods have been proposed for automatically building thesauri (Hearst, 1992; Et-zioni et al., 2005; Shinzato and Torisawa, 2004; Pan-tel and Pennacchiotti, 2006).",
        "But often these methods need a huge amount of documents and computational resources to obtain a reasonable number of hyponymy relations, and we still do not have a thesaurus with sufficient coverage.",
        "In this paper, we attempt to extract a large number of hyponymy relations without a large document collection or great computational power.",
        "The key idea is to focus on Wikipedia , which is much more consistently organized than normal documents.",
        "Actually, some studies have already attempted to extract hyponymy relations or semantic classifications from Wikipedia.",
        "Hyponymy relations were extracted from definition sentences (Herbelot and Copestake, 2006; Kazama and Torisawa, 2007).",
        "Disambiguation of named entities was also attempted (Bunescu and Pa≈üca, 2006).",
        "Category pages were used to extract semantic relations (Suchanek et al., 2007).",
        "Lexical patterns for semantic relations were learned (Ruiz-",
        "Casado et al., 2005).",
        "The difference between our work and these attempts is that we focus on the hierarchical layout of normal articles in Wikipedia.",
        "For instance, the article titled \"Penguin\" is shown in Fig. 1(b).",
        "This article has a quite consistently organized hierarchical structure.",
        "The whole article is divided into the sections \"Anatomy\", \"Mating habits\", \"Systematics and evolution\", \"Penguins in popular culture\" and so on.",
        "The section \"Systematics and evolution\" has the",
        "relations as a part of hyponymy relations in this paper because we think the distinction is not crucial for many NLP applications.",

        "In the article about \"Penguin\", relations such as the one between \"Aptenodytes\" and \"Emperor Penguin\" and the one between \"Book\" and \"Penguins of the World\" are valid hyponymy relations.",

        "For example, Fig. 1(b) is a result of interpreting the source code in Fig. 1(a).",

        "Definition lists are marked as \";title\" where title is a term.",
        "The basic hierarchical structure of a Wikipedia article is organized by a predetermined ordering among the above items.",
        "For instance, a bulleted list item is assumed to occupy a lower position in the hierarchy than a heading item.",
        "In general, items occupy a higher position in the order of headings, definition lists, bulleted lists, and ordered lists.",
        "In addition, recall that headings, bullet list and ordered list allowed the repetitions of symbols \"=\", \"*\" and \"#\".",

        "This section describes our method for extracting hyponymy relations from hierarchical structures in Wikipedia articles.",

        "Step 1 Extract hyponymy relation candidates from hierarchical structures in the Wikipedia.",
        "Step 2 Select proper hyponymy relations by applying simple patterns to the extracted candidates.",
        "Step 3 Select proper hyponymy relations from the candidates by using a machine learning technique.",
        "Each step is described below.",
        "The Step 1 procedure extracts the title of a marked-up item and a title of its (direct) subordinate marked-up item as a hyponymy relation for each marked-up item.",
        "For example, given the hierarchy in Fig. 1(c), the Step1 procedure extracted hyponymy relation candidates such as \"Aptenodytes/Emperor Penguin\"and \"Book/Penguins of the World\".",
        "(Note that we denote hyponymy relations or their candidates as \"hy-pernym/hyponym\" throughout this paper.)",
        "However, these relation candidates include many wrong hy-ponymy relations such as \"Penguins in popular culture/Book\".",
        "Steps 2 and 3 select proper relations from the output of the Step 1 procedure.",
        "Simple Patterns",
        "Step 2 selects plausible hyponymy relations by applying simple patterns to hyponymy relation candidates obtained in Step 1.",
        "This is based on our observation that if a hypernym candidate matches a particular pattern, it is likely to constitute a correct relation.",
        "For example, in Japanese, if a hy-pernym candidate is \" omona X (Popular or typical X)\", X is likely to be a correct hypernym of the hyponym candidates that followed it in the article.",
        "Fig.2 shows a Japanese Wikipedia article about a zoo that includes \"omona doubutsu (Popular animals)\", \" Mazeran Pengin (Magellanic Penguin)\", \"Raion (Lion)\" and so on.",
        "From this article, the Step 1 procedure extracts a hyponymy relation candidate \"Popular Animals/Magellanic Penguin\", and the Step 2 procedure extracts \"Animals/Magellanic Penguin\" after matching \"Popular\"",
        "daihyoutekinaX(typical X), daihyouX(typical X), syuyounaX(popular or typical X), omonaX(popular kihontekinaX(basic X), kihon(basic X), chomeinaX(notable X), ookinaX(large X), omonaX(popular or typical X), ta noX(other X), ichibuX(partial list of X)",
        "to the hypernym candidate and removing the string \"Popular\" from the candidate.",
        "Fig.",
        "3 lists all the patterns we used.",
        "Note that the non-variable part of the patterns is removed from the matched hypernym candidates.",
        "3.3 Step 3: Selecting Proper Hyponymy Relations by Machine Learning",
        "The Step 3 procedure selects proper hyponymy relations from the relation candidates that do not match the patterns in Step 2.",
        "We use Support Vector Machines (SVM) (Vapnik, 1998) for this task.",
        "For each hyponymy relation candidate, we firstly apply morphological analysis and obtain the following types of features for each hypernym candidate and hyponym candidate, and append them into a single feature vector, which is given to the classifier.",
        "POS We found that POS tags are useful clues for judging the validity of relations.",
        "For instance, if a hypernym includes proper nouns (and particularly to-ponyms), it is unlikely to constitute a proper relation.",
        "We assigned each POS tag a unique dimension in the feature space and if a hypernym/hyponym consists of a morpheme with a particular POS tag, then the corresponding element of the feature vector was set to one.",
        "When hypernyms/hyponyms are multiple morpheme expressions, the feature vectors for every morpheme were simply summed.",
        "(The obtained feature vector works as disjunction of each feature vector.)",
        "An important point is that, since the last morpheme of hypernyms/hyponyms works as strong evidence for the validity of relations, the POS tag of the last morpheme was mapped to the dimension that is different from the POS tags of the other morphemes.",
        "MORPH Morphemes themselves are also mapped to a dimension of the feature vectors.",
        "The last morphemes are also mapped to dimensions that are different from those of the other morphemes.",
        "This feature is used for recognizing particular morphemes that strongly suggest the validity of hy-ponymy relations.",
        "For instance, if the morpheme \"zoku (genus)\" comes in the end of the hyper-nym, the relation is likely to be valid, as exemplified by the relation \"koutei pengin zoku (Aptenodytes genus)/koutei pengin (Emperor Penguin)\".",
        "EXP Expressions of hypernym/hyponym candidates themselves also give a good clue for judging the validity of the relation.",
        "For instance, there are typical strings that can be the title of a marked-up item but cannot be a proper hypernym or a proper hyponym.",
        "Examples of these strings include \"Background\" and \"Note\".",
        "By mapping each expression to an element in a feature vector and setting the element to one, we can prevent the candidates containing such expressions from being selected by the classifier.",
        "ATTR We used this type of features according to our observation that if a relation candidate includes an attribute, it is a wrong relation.",
        "The attributes of an object can be defined as \"what we want to know about the object\".",
        "For instance, we regard \"Anatomy\" as attributes of creatures in general, and the relation such as \"Penguin/Anatomy\" cannot be regarded as proper hyponymy relations.",
        "To set up this type of features, we automatically created a set of attributes and the feature was set to one if the hypernym/hyponym is included in the set.",
        "The attribute set was created in the following manner.",
        "We collected all the titles of the marked-up items from all the articles, and counted the occurrences of each title.",
        "If a title appears more than one time, then it was added to the attribute set.",
        "Note that this method relies on the hypothesis that the same attribute is used in articles about more than one object (e.g., \"Penguin\" and \"Sparrow\" ) belonging to the same class (e.g., \"animal\").",
        "(Actually, in this counting of titles, we excluded the titles of items in the bulleted lists and the ordered lists in the bottom layer of the hierarchical structures.",
        "This is because these items are likely to constitute valid hyponymy relations.",
        "We also excluded that match the patterns in Fig. 3.)",
        "As a result, we obtained the set of 40,733 attributes and the precision of a set was 73% according to the characterization of attributes in (Tokunaga etal.,2005).",
        "LAYER We found that if a hyponymy relation is extracted from the bottom of the hierarchy, it tends to be a correct relation.",
        "For example, in Fig. 1(c), the hyponymy relation \"Penguin/Anatomy\" which is extracted from the top of hierarchy is wrong, but the hyponymy relation \"Aptenodytes/Emperor Penguin \" which is extracted from the bottom of the layer is correct.",
        "To capture this tendency, we added the mark that marks up a hypernym and a hyponym to the features.",
        "Each mark is mapped to a dimension in the feature vector, and the corresponding element was set to one if a hypernym/hyponym candidate appears with the mark.",
        "As the final output of our method, we merged the results of Steps 2 and 3."
