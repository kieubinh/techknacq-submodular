        "Researchers have proposed several approaches to abbreviation recognition for non-alphabetical languages.",
        "Hisamitsu and Niwa (2001) compared different statistical measures (e.g., % test, log likelihood ratio) to assess the co-occurrence strength between the inner and outer phrases of parenthetical expressions X (Y).",
        "Yamamoto (2002) utilized the similarity of local contexts to measure the paraphrase likelihood of two expressions based on the distributional hypothesis (Harris, 1954).",

        "Sasano et al.",
        "(2007) designed rules about letter types and occurrence frequency to collect lexical paraphrases used for coreference resolution.",
        "How are these approaches effective in recognizing Japanese abbreviation definitions?",
        "As a preliminary study, we examined abbreviations described in parenthetical expressions in Japanese newspaper articles.",
        "We used the 7,887 parenthetical expressions that occurred more than eight times in Japanese articles published by the Mainichi Newspapers and Yomiuri Shimbun in 1998-1999.",
        "Table 1 summarizes the usages of parenthetical expressions in four groups.",
        "The field 'para' indicates whether the inner and outer elements of parenthetical expressions are interchangeable.",
        "The first group acronym (I) reduces a full form to a shorter form by removing letters.",
        "In general, the process of acronym generation is easily interpreted: the left example in Table 1 consists of two Kanji letters taken from the heads of the two words, while the right example consists of the letters at the end of the 1st, 2nd, and 4th words in the full form.",
        "Since all letters in an acronym appear in its full form, previous approaches to English abbreviations are also applicable to Japanese acronyms.",
        "Unfortunately, in this survey the number of such 'authentic' acronyms amount to as few as 90 (1.2%).",
        "The second group acronym with translation (II) is characteristic of non-English languages.",
        "Full forms are imported from foreign terms (usually in English), but inherit the foreign abbreviations.",
        "The third group alias (III) presents generic paraphrases that cannot be interpreted as abbreviations.",
        "For example, Democratic People's Republic of Korea is known as its alias North Korea.",
        "Even though the formal name does not refer to the 'northern' part, the alias consists of Korea, and the locational modifier North.",
        "Although the second and third groups retain their interchangeability, computers cannot recognize abbreviations with their full forms based on letters.",
        "The last group (IV) does not introduce interchangeable expressions, but presents additional information for outer phrases.",
        "For example, a location usage of a parenthetical expression X (Y) describes an entity X, followed by its location Y.",
        "Inner and outer elements of parenthetical expressions are not interchangeable.",
        "We regret to find that as many as 81.9% of parenthetical expressions were described for this usage.",
        "Thus, this study regards acronyms (with and without translation) and alias as Japanese abbreviations in a broad sense, based on their in-terchangeabilities.",
