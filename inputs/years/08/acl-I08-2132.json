        "Semantic Role Labeling is a shallow semantic parsing technology and defined as a shared task in CoNLL-04.",
        "It aims at recognizing semantic roles (i.e. arguments) for each target verb in sentence and labeling them to the corresponding syntactic constituents.",
        "Many SRL research utilizes machine learning methods (Park, 2005; Pradhan, 2005; Cohn, 2005), in which the high performance reported was attributed to large tagged dataset (Carreras, 2005).",
        "But one of the main obstacles to supervised learning is the shortage of manually labeled data, which is even serious in SRL.",
        "It could bring about one question: whether these methods perform well when large mount of tagged data are not available?",
        "In this paper, we investigate Transductive SVM (Joachims, 1999), a semi-supervised learning method, for this question.",
        "The proposed method uses large untagged data in training with the support of the linguistic knowledge of semantic roles.",
        "Generally speaking, not all constituents in syntactic tree could act as argument candidates in SRL.",
        "Large redundant constituents lead to a high training cost and decrease the performance of statistical model especially when tagged data is small.",
        "In contrast to the pruning algorithms in Park (2005) and Xue (2004) which are based on syntax, some argument-specific heuristics, based on word semantic features of arguments, make semantic restrictions on constituent candidates to optimize dataset of statistical models.",
        "The experiment results on Chinese Propbank shows that TSVM outperforms regular statistical models in small tagged data, and after using argument-specific heuristics, it performs further better.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 gives the definition, method, and resources about SRL.",
        "Section 3 discusses how to apply TSVM for SRL.",
        "Some argument-specific heuristics are introduced in Section 4.",

        "• Classification: c^R.",
        "It is a multi-value function which assigns a role value to c, that is, labels a role to some candidate.",
        "Some typical systems, based on inductive learning, have been evaluated in CoNLL-05 (Carreras, 2005).",
        "It concluded that the performance of SRL depends on the combination of several factors including models, features, and results of syntactic parsing.",

        "The classical statistical models such as SVM, ME have been developed in this way.",
        "Since large mount of tagged data are usually acquired difficultly in practice, and the global models are hard to get when tagged training data are not enough to find the target function in the hypothesis space.",
        "In addition, this global model may be unnecessary sometimes when we only care for specific data.",

        "It is obvious that the more even the data set distribution is, the better the learning classifier will perform.",
        "Similar to most practical classification task, a serious uneven problem (Li, 2003) exists in SRL.",
        "For instance, the number of constituents labeled to arguments (positive instances) is much less than the number of the rest (negative instances).",

        "This paper chooses 10 features in classification because of two reasons: at first, they are the core features considered to have significance on the performance of SRL (Carreras, 2005); secondly, these features provide a standard to evaluate different methods of Chinese SRL.",

        "It should be mention that the result of SVM fluctuates slightly, which is due to different number of testing examples.",
        "On the other hand, TSVM and TSVM using argument-specific heuristics improve highly as the increase in untagged data size.",
        "The bigger the untagged data, the larger the performance gap between SVM and TSVM and the gap between TSVM and TSVM using argument-specific heuristics.",

        "Most machine learning methods such as SVM, ME have a strong dependence on tagged data, which lead to a poor generalization when large tagged data are not available.",
        "This paper introduces a novel semi-supervised method--TSVM for this problem.",
        "TSVM can effectively use clustering information from untagged data for training the model.",
        "The experiment demonstrated the TSVM achieve better performance than regular SVM when only very few tagged examples are available.",
        "Aiming at serious uneven problem in SRL, argument-specific heuristics are proposed correspond to six kinds of arguments.",
        "These heuristics are developed by extracting semantic features of arguments from HowNet.",
        "The experiment proves that these heuristics have much effect not only in the inductive inference (regular SVM) but also in transductive inference (TSVM), especially when the untagged data is large.",
        "The high performance of six heuristics demonstrated that semantic characteristics are significant on SRL, which encourages us to develop more semantic characteristics of more arguments in the future.",
