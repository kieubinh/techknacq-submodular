        "Our contributions are twofold.",
        "First, for new words that lack semantic transparency, such as person, location, or transliteration names, we calculate association metrics of adjacent character segments on unlabeled data and encode this information as features.",
        "Second, we construct an internal dictionary by using an initial model to extract words from both the unlabeled training and test set to maintain balanced coverage on the training and test set.",
        "In comparison to the baseline model which only uses n-gram features, our approach increases new word recall up to 6.0%.",
        "Additionally, our approaches reduce segmentation errors up to 32.3%.",
        "Our system achieves state-of-the-art performance for both the closed and open tasks of the 2006 SIGHAN bakeoff."

        "We mainly focus on improving new word identification (NWI) using unlabeled text.",
        "Words with high and low ST are discussed separately due to the disparity in their morphological characteristics.",
        "However, it is unnecessary for our system to classify words as high-or low-ST because our strategies for dealing with these two classes are employed synchronously.",
        "For a high-ST word, its meaning can be easily derived from those of its morphemes.",
        "A word's semantic meaning correlates to its tendency of being affixed to longer words.",
        "This behavior can be recorded by the baseline n-gram model.",
        "When the baseline model is used to segment a sentence containing a high-ST word, since this tendency is consistent with that is recorded in the baseline model, this word tends to be successfully segmented.",
        "For example, suppose rfaS ^ zhi-nan-che (compass chariot) is in the training set.",
        "The baseline n-gram model will record the tendency of ifa S zhi-nan (guide) that it tends to be a prefix of a longer word.",
        "When tagging a sentence that contains another high ST word also containing ifaS, such as rfaS if zhi-nan-zhen (compass), this word can be correctly identified.",
        "Using only n-gram features may prevent some occurrences of high-ST words from being identified due to the ambiguity of neighboring n-grams.",
        "To rectify this problem, we introduce the transductive dictionary (TD) feature, which is similar to the traditional dictionary feature that indicates if a sequence of characters in a sentence matches a word w in an existing dictionary.",
        "The difference is that the TD not only comprises words in the training set, but contains words extracted from the unlabeled test set.",
        "The transductive dictionary is so named because it is generated following general concepts of transductive learning.",
        "We believe adding TD features can boost recall of high-ST words.",
        "More details on the TD are found in Section 5.",
        "The",
        "TD features that identify high-ST words are detailed in Section 6.1.",
        "On the contrary, new words lack of ST, such as transliteration names, are more likely to be missed by the baseline n-gram model, because their morphemes' morphological tendencies are not guaranteed to be consistent with those recorded by n-gram features.",
        "For instance, suppose tian-ping (libra) only appears as individual words in the training set.",
        "The baseline model cannot identify M ^ P xiong-tian-ping (a singer's name) because M^cP is a low-ST word and the morphological tendency of ^ P is not consistent with the recorded one.",
        "In English, there is a similar phenomenon called multi-word expressions (MWEs).",
        "(Choueka, 1988) regarded MWE as connected collocations: a sequence of neighboring words \"whose exact meaning cannot be derived from the meaning or connotation of its components\", which means that MWEs also have low ST. As some pioneers provide MWE identification methods which are based on association metrics (AM), such as likelihood ratio (Dunning, 1993).",
        "The methods of identifying low-ST words can be divided into two: filtering and merging.",
        "The former uses AM to measure the likelihood that a candidate is actually a whole word that cannot be divided.",
        "Candidates with AMs lower than the threshold are filtered out.",
        "The latter strategy merges character segments in a bottom-up fashion.",
        "AMs are employed to suggest the next candidates for merging.",
        "Both methods suffer from two main drawbacks of AM: dependency on segment length and inability to use relational information between context and tags.",
        "In the first case, applying AMs to ranking character segment pairs, it is difficult to normalize the values calculated from pairs of character segments of various lengths.",
        "Secondly, AMs ignore the relationships among n-grams (or other contextual information) and labels, which are abundant in annotated corpora, and they only use annotation data to determine thresholds.",
        "In Section 6.2, we illustrate how encoding AMs as features can avoid the above weaknesses."

        "The simplest TD is composed of words in the training set and words extracted from the unla-beled test set.",
        "The main problem of such TD is the disparity in training and test set coverage.",
        "During training, since its coverage is 100%, the enabled dictionary features will be assigned very high weights while n-gram features will be assigned low weights.",
        "During testing, when coverage is approximately 80-90%, most tags are decided by dictionary features enabled by IV words, while n-gram features have little influence.",
        "As a result, it is likely that only IV words are correctly segmented, while OOV words are over-segmented.",
        "Loosely speaking, a dictionary's coverage of the training set is linked to the degree of reliance placed by the CRF model on the corresponding dictionary features.",
        "Therefore, the dictionary should be made more balanced in order to avoid the potential problem of overfitting.",
        "Here a dictionary is said to be more balanced if its coverage of the training set approximates its coverage of the test set while maximizing the latter.",
        "Afterward we name the TD composed of words from gold training set and tagged test set and as Naive TD (NTD) for its unbalanced coverage in training and test set.",
        "Our TD is constructed as follows.",
        "Given initial features, we use the model trained on the whole training set with these features to label the test set and add all words into our TD.",
        "The next step is to balance our TD's coverage of the training and test sets.",
        "Since coverage of the test set cannot reach 100%, the only way to achieve this goal is by slightly lowering the dictionary's coverage on the training set.",
        "We apply n-fold cross-tagging to label the training set data: Each fold that has 1/n of the training set is tagged by the model trained on the other n – 1 folds with initial features.",
        "All the words identified by this cross-tagging process are then added to our TD.",
        "The difference between the NTD and our TD is that the NTD extracts words from the gold training set, but our TD extracts words from the cross-tagged training set.",
        "Finally, our TD is used to generate dictionary features to train the final model.",
        "Since the TD constructed from cross-tagging training set and tagged test set exists more balanced coverage of the training and test set, we call such a TD \"balanced TD\", shorted as BTD."

        "In the following sections, we use D to denote the dictionary.",
        "This feature indicates if there is a sequence of neighboring characters around C0 that match a word in D. Features of this type are identified by their positions relative to Co and their lengths.",
        "Word match features are defined as:",

        "The word frequency distribution is the case: Zipf's law (Zipf, 1949) states that the word frequency is inversely proportional to its rank (Adamic and Huberman, 2002):",
        "where /(x) is x's frequency, z is its rank in the frequency table, and a is empirically found to be close to unity.",
        "Obviously this distribution is far from flat uniform.",
        "Hence the equal-frequency binning turns out to be our choice.",
        "Ideally, we would like each bin to have equal expected number of values rather than following empirical distribution.",
        "Therefore, we attempt to discretize according to their underlying Zip-fian distribution.",

        "Thus each bin has equal number of values within it if and only if b/a is a constant, which is in a log scale.",
        "This shows that our strategy to discretize the WMWF and WMNF features in a log scale is not only a conventional heuristic but also has theoretical support.",
        "In this section, we describe how to formulate the association metrics as features to avoid the weakness stated in Section 4.2.",
        "Our idea is to enumerate all possible character segment pairs before and after the segmentation point and treat their association metrics as feature values.",

        "The likelihood ratio test is applied as follows:",
        "where logl(P, K,M) = K x ln P + (M - K) x ln(1 -P), ki = freq(x,y); k2 = /(x, -y) = freq(x)-ki; ni = freq(y); n2 = N - ni; pi = p(x\\y) = ki/ni; P2 = p(x\\y) = k2/n2; p = p(x) = (ki + k2)/N; N is the number of words in corpus.",
        "An important property of likelihood ratio is that -2LR is asymptotically x\\ distributed.",
