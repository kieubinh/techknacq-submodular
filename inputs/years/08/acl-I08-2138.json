        "Grammar checking is one of the most widely used tools within natural language engineering applications.",
        "Most of the word processing systems available in the market incorporate spelling, grammar, and style-checking systems for English and other foreign languages, one such rule-based grammar checking system for English is discussed in (Naber, 2003).",
        "However, when it comes to the smaller languages, specifically the Indian languages, most of such advanced tools have been lacking.",
        "Spell checking has been addressed for most of the Indian languages but still grammar and style checking systems are lacking.",
        "In this article a grammar checking system for Punjabi, a member of the Modern Indo-Aryan family of languages, is provided.",
        "The grammar checker uses a rule-based system to detect grammatical errors in the text and if possible generates suggestions to correct those errors.",
        "To the best of our knowledge the grammar checking provided here will be the first such system for Indian languages.",
        "There is n-gram based grammar checking system for Bangla (Alam et al., 2006).",
        "The authors admit its accuracy is very low and there is no description about whether the system provides any suggestions to correct errors or not.",
        "It is mentioned that it was tested to identify correct sentences from the set of sentences provided as input but nothing is mentioned as far as correcting those errors is concerned.",
        "However, the system that we discuss here for Punjabi detects errors and suggests corrections as well.",
        "In doing so, provides enough information for the user to understand the error reason and supports the suggestions provided, if any."

      "heading": "2. System Overview",
      "text": [
        "The input Punjabi text is given to the preprocessing system that performs tokenization and detects any phrases etc.",
        "After that morphological analysis is performed, this returns possible tags for all the words in the given text, based on the full-form lexicon that it is using.",
        "Then a rule-based part of speech tagger is engaged to disambiguate the tags based on the context information.",
        "After that, the text is grouped into various phrases accordingly to the predefined phrase chunking rules.",
        "In the final phase, rules to check for various grammatical errors internal to phrases and agreement on the sentence level, are applied.",
        "If any error is found in a sentence then based on the context information corrections are suggested (generated) for that.",
        "For the purpose of morphological analysis we have divided the Punjabi words into 22 word classes like noun, adjective (inflected and uninflected), pronoun (personal, demonstrative, reflexive, interrogative, relative, and indefinite), verb (main verb, operator verb, and auxiliary verb), cardinals, ordinals, adverb, postposition, conjunction, interjection etc., depending on the grammatical information required for the words of these word classes.",
        "The information that is in the database depends upon the word class, like for noun and inflected adjective, it is gender, number, and case.",
        "For personal pronouns, person is also required.",
        "For main verbs gender, number, person, tense, phase, transitivity etc.",
        "is required.",
        "As mentioned earlier the lexicon of this morphological analyzer is full form based i.e. all the word forms of all the commonly used Punjabi words are kept in the lexicon along with their root and other grammatical information.",
        "For part of speech tagging, we have devised a tag set keeping into mind all the grammatical categories that can be helpful for agreement checking.",
        "At present, there are more than 600 tags in the tag set.",
        "In addition to this, some word-specific tags are also there.",
        "The tag set is very user friendly and while choosing tag names existing tag sets for English and other such languages were taken into consideration, like NNMSD -masculine, singular, and direct case noun, PNPMPOF - masculine, plural, oblique case, and first person personal pronoun.",
        "The approach followed for part of speech tagging is rule-based, as there is no tagged corpus for Punjabi available at present.",
        "As the text we are processing may have grammatical agreement errors, so the part of speech tagging rules are devised considering this.",
        "The rules are applied in sequential order with each rule having an attached priority to control its order in this sequence.",
        "For phrase chunking, again a rule-based approach was selected mainly due to the similar reasons as for part of speech tagging.",
        "The tag set that is being used for phrase chunking includes tags like NPD - noun phrase in direct case, NPNE - noun phrase followed by & ne etc.",
        "The rules for phrase chunking also take into account the potential errors in the text, like lack of agreement in words of a potential phrase.",
        "However, as would be expected there is no way to take the misplaced words of a phrase into account, like if words of a phrase are separated (having some other phrase in between) then that cannot be taken as a single phrase, even though this may be a potential error.",
        "In the last phase i.e. grammar checking, there are again manually designed error detection rules to detect potential errors in the text and provide corrections to resolve those errors.",
        "For example, rule to check modifier and noun agreement, will go through all the noun phrases in a sentence to check if the modifiers of those sentences agree with their respective head words (noun/pronoun) in terms of gender, number, and case or not.",
        "For this matching, the grammatical information from the tags of those words is used.",
        "In simple terms, it will compare the grammatical information (gender, number, and case) of modifier with the headword (noun/pronoun) and displays an error message if some grammatical information fails to match.",
        "To resolve this error, the grammar checking module will use morphological generator, to generate the correct form (based on headword's gender, number, and case) for that modifier from its root word.",
        "For example, consider the grammatically incorrect sentence wa°t' FFt?",
        "J sohne larka janda hai 'handsome boy goes'.",
        "In this sentence in the noun phrase, sohne larka 'handsome gender, plural number, and direct case, is not in accordance with the gender, number, case of its head word.",
        "It should be in singular number instead of plural.",
        "The grammar checking module will detect this as an error as 'number' for modifier and headword is not same, then it will use morphological generator to generate the 'singular number form' from its root word, which is same as root form i.e. 'ftjT£T sohna 'handsome' (masculine gender, singular number, and direct case).",
        "So, the input sentence will be corrected as ^JT£t ws^F rF^ jj sohna larka janda hai 'handsome boy goes'.",
        "The error detection rules in grammar checking module are again applied in sequential order with priority field to control the sequence.",
        "This is done to resolve phrase level errors before going on to the clause level errors, and then to sentence level agreement errors."
