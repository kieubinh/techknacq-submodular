        "Research in Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) has explored embedding ECAs in domain-specific Virtual Environments (VE) where users interact with them using different modalities, including Spoken Language.",
        "However, in order to support dialogic interaction in such environments, an important technical challenge is the synchronization of the ECA Spoken Interaction module with the ECA non-verbal actions in the VE.",
        "We propose an approach that uses a common high level representation which is broken down to simpler levels to generate the agents' verbal interaction and the agents' non-verbal actions synchronously for task-oriented applications that involve performing some actions to achieve a goal, while talking about the actions using natural language.",
        "In previous work, Bersot et al. (1998) present a conversational agent called Ulysses embedded in a collaborative VE which accepts spoken input from the user and enables him or her to navigate within the VE.",
        "They use a 'reference resolver' which maps the entities mentioned in utterances to geometric objects in the VE and to actions._",
        "Max, a VR based conversational agent by Kopp et al. (2003) allows multimodal conversational abilities for task-oriented dialogues in virtual construction tasks.",
        "It builds on a database of utterance templates which contain the verbal part, augmented with accompanying gestures and their cross-modal affiliation.",
        "In order to deal with the vagueness of language in specifying spatial relations in virtual space, the K2 system (Takenobu et al. 2003) proposed a bilateral symbolic and numeric representation of locations, to bridge the gap between language processing (a symbolic system), and animation generation (a continuous system).",
        "K2 extracts a user's goal from the utterance and translates it into animation data.",
        "The FearNot!",
        "demonstrator by Paiva et al. (2005) provides training to kids against bullying via virtual drama in which one virtual character plays the role of a bully and the other plays the role of victim, who asks the child for advice.",
        "FearNot!",
        "'s spoken interaction is template-based where the incoming text from the child is matched against a set of language templates.",
        "The information about the character's action is defined in a collection which contains the utterance to be spoken as well as the animation.",
        "Eichner et al. (2007) describe an application in which lifelike characters present MP3 players in a virtual showroom.",
        "An XML scripting language is used to define the content of the presentation as well as the animations of the agents.",
        "A more expressive agent, Greta, developed by Pelachaud et al. (Poggi et al., 2005) is capable of producing socially appropriate gestures and facial expressions, and used is in an evaluation of gesture and politeness as reported in Rehm and André (2007).",
        "Since these ECAs function in scenarios where they interact with the world, other agents, and the user, they must be 'socially intelligent' (Dauten-hahn, 2000) and exhibit social skills.",
        "Our work is based on the hypothesis that the relevant social skills include the ability to communicate appropriately, according to the social situation, by building on theories about the norms of human social behaviour.",
        "We believe that an integral part of such skills is the correct use of politeness (Brown & Levinson, 1987; Walker et al. 1997).",
        "For instance, note the difference in the effect of requesting the hearer to clean the floor by saying 'You must clean the spill on the floor now!'",
        "and 'I know I'm asking you for a big favour but could you kindly clean the spill on the floor?'",
        "According to Brown and Levinson (1987) (henceforth B&L), choices of these different forms are driven by sociological norms among human speakers.",
        "Walker et al. (1997) were the first to propose and implement B&L's theory in ECAs to provide interesting variations of character and personality in an interactive narrative application.",
        "Since then B&L's theory has been used in many conversational applications e.g. animated presentation teams (André et al. 2000; Rehm & André, 2007), real estate sales (Cassell & Bickmore, 2003), and tutorials (Johnson et al., 2004; Johnson et al., 2005; Porayska-Pomsta 2003; Wang et al. 2003).",
        "Rehm & André (2007) show that gestures are used consistently with verbal politeness strategies and specific gestures can be used to mitigate face threats.",
        "Work in literary analysis has also argued for the utility of B&L's theory, e.g. Culpeper (1996) argues that a notion of 'impoliteness' in dramatic narratives creates conflict by portraying verbal events that are inappropriate in real life.",
        "Thus impoliteness often serves as a key to move the plot forward in terms of its consequences.",
        "This demo presents our Conversational System POLLy which produces utterances with a socially appropriate level of politeness as per the theory of Brown and Levinson.",
        "We have implemented POLLy in a VE for the domain of teaching English as a second language (ESL).",
        "It is rendered in our VE RAVE at Sheffield University as well as on a normal computer screen, as explained in section 3.",
        "Figure 1 shows a user interacting with POLLy in RAVE.",
        "Since RAVE is not portable, we will demonstrate POLLy on the computer screen where the user will be able to verbally communicate with the agents and the agents will respond with computationally generated utterances with an appropriate level of politeness as per a given situation."

      "text": [
        "POLLy uses a shared representation for generating actions to be performed by the ECAs in the virtual domain on one hand, and on the other, for generating dialogues to communicate about the actions to be performed.",
        "It consists of three components: A Virtual Environment (VE), a Spoken Language Generation (SLG) system and a Shared AI Planning Representation for VE and SLG as illustrated in Figure 2.",
        "A classic STRIPS-style planner called GraphPlan (Blum & Furst, 1997) produces, given a goal e.g. cook pasta, a plan of the steps involved in doing so (Gupta et al., 2007).",
        "POLLy then allocates this plan to the Embodied Conversational Agents (ECA) in the VE as a shared collaborative plan to achieve the cooking task with goals to communicate about the plan via speech acts (SAs), needed to accomplish the plan collaboratively, such as Re quests, Offers, Informs, Acceptances and rejections (Grosz, 1990; Sidner, 1994; Walker, 1996).",
        "It also allocates this plan to the SLG which generates variations of the dialogue based on B&L's theory of politeness that realizes this collaborative plan as in (André et al.,2000;Walker et al., 1997).",

        "See Figure 2.",
        "The politeness strategies are implemented through a combination of content selection and utterance planning.",
        "The linguistic realizer RealPro is used for realization of the resulting utterance plan (La-voie & Rambow, 1997), which takes a dependency structure called the Deep-Syntactic Structure (DSyntS) as input and realizes it as a sentence string.",
        "The Content Planner interfaces to the AI Planner, selecting content from the preconditions, steps and effects of the plan.",
        "According to B&L, direct strategies are selected from the steps of the plan, while realizations of preconditions and negating the effects of actions are techniques for implementing indirect strategies.",
        "The content planner extracts the components of the utterances to be created, from the plan and assigns them their respective categories, for example, lexeme get/add under category verb, knife/oil under direct object etc and sends them as input to the Utterance Planner.",
        "The Utterance Planner then converts the utterance components to the lexemes of DSyntS nodes to create basic DsyntS for simple sentences, which are then transformed to create variations as per B&L's politeness strategies, with the 'politeness manipulator script'.",
        "For realizing these B&L strategies, transformations to add lexical items such as 'please', 'if you don't mind', and 'mate' were added to the DSyntS to make a sentence less or more polite.",
        "Some example dialogues are shown in section 3.",
        "In the VE, the human English language learner is able to interact with the Embodied Conversational Agent and plays the part of one of the agents in order to practice politeness real-time.",
        "B&L's theory states that speakers in conversation attempt to realize their speech acts (SAs) to avoid threats to one another's face, which consists of two components.",

        "by using friendly markers \"Friend, would you close the door?\"",
        "The Autonomy Strategy (Negative Politeness) is used for high face threats, when the speaker may be imposing on the hearer, intruding on their space or violating their freedom of action.",
