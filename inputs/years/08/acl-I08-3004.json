        "While computing has become ubiquitous in the developed regions, its spread in other areas such as Asia is more recent.",
        "However, despite the fact that Asia is a dense area in terms of linguistic diversity (or perhaps because of it), many Asian languages are inadequately supported on computers.",
        "Even basic NLP tools are not available for these languages.",
        "This also has a social cost.",
        "NLP or Computational Linguistics (CL) based technologies are now becoming important and future intelligent systems will use more of these techniques.",
        "Most of NLP/CL tools and technologies are tailored for English or European languages.",
        "Recently, there has been a rapid growth of IT industry in many Asian countries.",
        "This is now the perfect time to reduce the linguistic, computational and computational linguistics gap between the 'more privileged' and 'less privileged' languages.",
        "The IJCNLP workshop on NLP for Less Privileged Language is aimed at bridging this gap.",
        "Only when a basic infrastructure for supporting regional languages becomes available can we hope for a more equitable availability of opportunities made possible by the language technology.",
        "There have already been attempts in this direction and this workshop will hopefully take them further.",
        "Figure-1 shows one possible view of the computational infrastructure needed for language processing for a particular language, or more preferably, for a set of related languages.",
        "In this paper, we will first discuss various aspects of the problem.",
        "We will then look back at the work already done.",
        "After that, we will present some suggestion for future work.",

        "There can be a debate about the correct term for the languages on which this workshop focuses.",
        "There are at least four candidates: less studied (LS) languages, resource scarce (RS) languages, less computerized (LC) languages, and less privileged (LP) languages.",
        "Out of these, two (LS and RS) are too narrow for our purposes.",
        "LC is admittedly more objective, but it also is somewhat narrow in the sense that it does not cover the lack of resources for creating resources (finance) and the lack of linguistic study.",
        "We have used LP because it is more general and covers all the aspects of the problem.",
        "However, it might be preferable to use LC in many contexts.",
        "As the common element among all these terms is the adjective 'less' ('resoure scarce' can be paraphrased as 'with less resources'), perhaps we can avoid the terminological debate by calling the languages covered by any such terms as the L-languages.",

        "Not surprisingly, the terms mentioned in the previous section cover different aspects of the problems that restrict work on and for these languages.",
        "There is a lack ofsomething and each ofthose terms covers some part of what is lacking.",
        "The term LS languages indicates that these are not well studied linguistically.",
        "The sheer amount of linguistic analysis available for English is so huge that the linguistic work on even a language like Hindi, which is spoken or understood by a billion people, is simply not comparable.",
        "For languages (or dialects) like Santali or Manipuri, the situation is much worse.",
        "And there are a large number of languages which have been studied even less than Santali or Manipuri.",
        "There are dozens (more accurately, hundreds) of such languages in South Asia alone.",
        "It can be said that very little is known about the majority of languages of the world, many of which are facing extinction.",
        "Even those languages which have been studied to a good extent, e.g. Telugu, lack language resources, e.g. a large dictionary in machine readable form, let alone resources like WordNet or FrameNet, although efforts are being made to develop resources for some of these languages.",
        "The term RS covers this aspect of the problem.",
        "Computerization, in general, might include machine readable language resources and NLP tools etc., but here we will restrict the meaning of this term to the support for languages that is provided on computers, either as part of operating systems, or in the commonly used applications such as word processors.",
        "In the narrowest sense, computerization means language-encoding support.",
        "Even this level of support is currently not available (or is inadequate) for a large number of languages.",
        "Proper computerization (in the restricted sense) is a prerequisite to effective language processing.",
        "But even without adequate computerization, attempts are being made towards making language processing possible for the L-languages.",
        "However, language processing for the L-languages is still far behind that for English.",
        "For a large number of language it is, in fact, non-existent.",
        "This is true even for a language like Gujarati, which is the official language of the state of Gujarat in India and is recognized as a scheduled language by the government of India.",
        "And it is actually used as the first language by the people of Gujarat, which is one of the larger states in India.",
        "While adequate computerization may be easy to achieve in the near future, at least theoretically, language processing (and building language resources) is going to be much more difficult task.",

        "One of the major reasons why building language resources and providing language processing capabilities for the L-languages is going to be a very difficult task is the fact that these languages lack the privileges which make it possible to build language resources and NLP/CL tools.",
        "By 'privileges' we mean the availability of finance, equipment, human resources, and even political and social support for reducing the lack of computing and language processing support for the L-languages.",

        "As Figure-2 shows, the 'other privileges' dimension of the problem has to be a major element of the solution, but it is not something over which researchers and developers have much control.",
        "This means that we will have to find ways to work even with very little of these 'other privileges'.",
        "This is the key point that we want to make in this paper because it implies that the methods that have been used for English (a language with almost unlimited 'privileges') may not be applicable for the L-languages.",
        "Many of these methods assume the availability of certain things which simply cannot be assumed for the L-languages.",
        "For example, there is no reasonable ground to assume that there will be (in the near future) corpus even with shallow levels of annotation for Avadhi or Dogri or Konkani, let alone a treebank like resource.",
        "Therefore, we have to look for methods which can work with unanno-tated corpus.",
        "Moreover, these methods should also not require a lot of work from trained linguists because such linguists may not be available to work on these languages.",
        "There is one approach, however, that can still allow us to build resources and tools for these languages.",
        "This is the approach of adapting the resources of a linguistically close but more privileged language.",
        "It is this area which needs to be studied and explored more thoroughly because it seems to be the only practical way to make the kind of progress that is required urgently.",
        "The process of resource adaptation will have to studied from linguistic, computational, and other practical points of view.",
        "Since 'other privileges' are a major factor as discussed earlier, some ways of calculating the cost of adaptation have also to be found.",
        "Another very general but important point is that we will have to build multilingual systems as far as possible so that the cost per language is reduced.",
