        "The disorder of the information causes difficulties in the requirement of the systematic maintenance for retrieval, extraction, or even summarization from the stored information.",
        "To understand the intention of an article (or a solution), we not only rely on the trace or the history of editing, but we also constantly recall the background of our decision in producing the article (or the solution).",

        "Members can then participate in the chat group of the same desk.",
        "A desk functions as a meeting place for collaborative work that needs some discussion through the chat function, or allow a contributor to work individually by using the message slot to record each own opinion.",
        "The working space can be expanded by closing the unnecessary frames so that the contributor can concentrate on a particular task.",
        "All working topics can also be statistically viewed through the provided tabs.",
