        "This paper experimentally proved that the proposed predictive Sinhala input method has maximum user-friendliness, while maintaining high efficiency.",
        "This method can also be well applied to other languages with many characters but that lack well known 1-to-1 correspondences between the written characters and roman key sequences; these include Indic languages such as Sanskrit and Hindi.",
        "Our future work has two main thrusts: to broaden the applicability and to improve the prediction.",
        "We need to have a dictionary with better coverage to ensure better applicability.",
        "To do this, we will develop a systematic and automatic way to generate morpho-syntactically related derivational word forms, and store them efficiently in the dictionary.",
        "For example, our dictionary currently includes (coec( gasa : tree), coel(=gas : trees), CDe3Ö(=gasata : to tree), co@el(=gase : in tree), coess^gasat: tree also), (=gasut : trees also), (=gasen : from tree), ...} etc.",
        "However, we would like to generate these derivational forms from the root (=gasa : tree).",
        "On the other hand, to improve the accuracy of prediction, we will explore two dimensions: adaptation to an individual user and evaluation oflinguistic contexts (Hasselgren et al., 2003).",
        "We see that the first dimension would enable a prompt improvement and will seek a means to adjust the candidate ordering in the input variation table by looking at a user's natural preferences in the inputs.",
