        "The reduplicated part of the word could be a prefix or part of the stem or even a suffix.",
        "This copying is what makes reduplication an outstanding problem.",
        "Depending on the language, reduplication may be used to show plurality, iterativity, intensification or completeness (Kimenyi, 2004).",
        "Some of the notable examples of reduplication in computational morphology that have been reported include Kinande, Latin, Bam-bara (Roark and Sproat, 2007); Tagalog and Malay (Beesley and Karttunen, 2003; Antworth, 1990).",

        "Bounded reduplication is the kind that involves just repeating a given part of the word.",
        "Unbounded reduplication differs from bounded reduplication in that bounded reduplication involves copying of a fixed number of morphemes.",

        "Unbounded reduplication has received little attention from researchers no wonder it is yet to be fully solved (Roark and Sproat, 2007).",
        "In principle, finite state methods are capable of handling bounded reduplication, and here some solutions have been proposed.",

        "Since then the approach has been used to develop morphological analysers for very many languages around the world, including the Bantu language Swahili (Hurskainen, 1992).",
        "This formalism has been the major motivation force behind renewed interests in computational morphology since 1983.",
        "The two-level formalism is based on two-level rules which are applied to a lexicon to facilitate lexical to surface level mappings.",

        "The output from a two-level morphological analyser is never affected by the order of the rules.",
