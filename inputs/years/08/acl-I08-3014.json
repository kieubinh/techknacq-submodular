        "In written text, cohesion occurs when some elements in a discourse are dependent on others and that refer to items backward in the text, both in the spoken or written text (Halliday and Hassan, 1976).",
        "Consider the following example (1.1) Shah Rukh Khan is off to one of his favorite cities London, with his family.",
        "Now he is looking for another destination, not so much for holidaying though.",
        "(1.2) Bollywood actress Bipasha Basu has been signed for her new film Corporate.",
        "She is a single working woman, wants to get somewhere in life, on her own terms.",
        "Cohesion in examples 1.1 and 1.2 is introduced due to the terms he, his, her, she and interpretation of these references depends upon some preceding terms.",
        "These referring terms are called anaphors or anaphoric devices (ADs).",
        "Halliday and Hassan described anaphora as 'cohesion which points back to some previous items' (Halliday and Hassan, 1976).",
        "The 'pointing back' words or phrases are called the anaphors (Halliday and Hassan, 1976) and the entities to which these point are called antecedents and the procedure of determining the antecedents of anaphors and subsequent replacement in some particular discourse is called anaphora resolution.",
        "According to Halliday and Hassan when anaphors are replaced by their corresponding antecedents, cohesion no more exists.",
        "Personal anaphoric devices (ADs) are the most widely used variety of ADs in Urdu text.",

        "Prasad and Strube (2000) worked on anaphora resolution in Hindi.",
        "Their approach relies on the discourse salience factors and is primarily inspired by the central idea of Centering theory (Grosz, Aravind and Weinstein, 1995).",
        "Centering theory has also guided the development of pronoun resolution algorithms, such as the BFP algorithm (Brenan, Friedman and Pollard, 1987) and the S-list algorithm developed by Strube (Strube, 1998).",
        "Prasad and Strube (2000) applied these algorithms to the resolution of pronouns in Hindi texts.",
        "They showed that the BFP algorithm cannot be successfully implemented for pronoun resolution in Hindi.",
        "They argued that better results can be obtained with an algorithm that does not use the Centering notions of the backward-looking center and the centering transitions for the computation of pronominal antecedents, such as the S-list algorithm (Prasad and Strube, 2000).",
        "Prasad and Strube used well established approaches for Hindi anaphora resolution.",
        "Sobha (1998) used knowledge poor rule based approach for reference resolution in Hindi and Malayalam languages that stands on very limited syntactic information.",
        "In Urdu language very little work has been done on discourse level especially in the field of anaphora resolution.",
        "Although, most of the anaphoric devices in Urdu and Hindi are same but the style and organization of discourses are bit different that causes the difference in anaphora resolution.",
        "Kulsoom et al. worked on Urdu anaphora resolution but it appears to be the tip of an iceberg (Kalsoom and Rashida, 1993).",
        "Kulsoom et al. (1993) only considered the morphological and lexical filters for the resolution of anaphora in Urdu discourses.",
