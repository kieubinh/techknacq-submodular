        "A clear cut demarcation between morphology and syntax is not possible.",
        "In Manipuri, words are formed in three processes called affixation, derivation and compounding (Thoudam, 2006).",

        "Classification of words using the role of affix helps to implement the tagger for a resource poor language like Manipuri with high performance.",
        "There are many POS taggers developed using different techniques for many major languages such as transformation-based error-driven learning (Brill, 1995), decision trees (Black et al., 1992), Markov model (Cutting et al., 1992), maximum entropy methods (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) etc for English.",
        "Decision trees are used to estimate marginal probabilities in a maximum entropy model for predicting the parts-of-speech of a word given the context in which it appears (Black et al., 1992).",
        "The rules in a rule-based system are usually difficult to construct and typically are not very robust (Brill, 1992).",

        "In a stochastic tagger, tens of thousands of lines of statistical information are needed to capture the contextual information (Brill, 1992).",
        "For a tagger to function as a practical component in a language processing system, a tagger must be robust, efficient, accurate, tunable and reusable (Cutting, 1992)."
