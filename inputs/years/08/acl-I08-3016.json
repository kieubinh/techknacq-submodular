        "Back in 2004, ETV (Eenadu Television), Hyderabad, felt a need for a text editor to prepare news scripts for its regional news channels.",
        "A news production environment has its unique set of requirements including speed, efficiency, robustness etc.",
        "The software that was in use had various technical limitations including high CPU usage, lack of portability across the diverse set of platforms that were in use in ETV.",
        "Using unicode editors were unsuitable as the correctness of the output largely depended on the quality of the shaping engine in use and back then it produced inconsistent results.",
        "Apart from that ETV's real-time graphics engines had trouble shaping unicode text in Indic scripts.",
        "A multilingual editor for Indic scripts had been developed at IIT Madras.",
        "The team at IIT Madras favoured further development under an open source project.",
        "As a result an Open Source Project was started.",
        "The immediate aim of the project was to rewrite the editor, remove its limitations and redesign it for use in a News Production environment using modern design and development tools.",
        "Acharya is a multi-platform text editor that supports Asamiya, Bangla, Devanagari, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Oriya, Punjabi, Tamil and Telugu.",
        "In addition to these scripts, it can also display text in Braille and RomanTrans using transliteration.",
        "It achieves this functionality by storing Indic text in syllabic units instead of characters as most other editors do.",
        "Although it uses a custom encoding, the editor supports conversion of text to standard encodings like iscii (ISCII, 1993) and unicode (utf-8).",
        "It can export documents as rtf and pdf files.",
        "In the case of pdf documents the fonts are embedded within so that they can be exchanged freely without the need for local language fonts to be available on the viewing system.",
        "The editor supports editing multiple documents through a tabbed interface.",
        "It includes standard features like clipboard support, finding strings and interfacing with the platform's printing system.",
        "To assist text entry, it has a word completion mechanism based on a dynamic dictionary.",
        "Currently, it runs on all major platforms including Windows, Mac OS X and various Linux distributions.",
        "The editor consists of a small but extensible library for processing syllables, a text editing component and the rest of the user interface.",
        "Section of this paper describes the library.",
        "The syllabic encoding along with its features is described in section 2.1.",
        "Section 3 describes the text editing component.",
        "Conclusion is offered in section 4 along with some",
        "or Less Privileged Languages, pages 99-104, of Natural Language Processing",
        "information on related work-in-progress.",
        "2 Syllable Library",
        "The syllable library provides an implementation of the syllabic encoding (described in the Section 2.1) which allows text to be represented directly as syllables instead of as characters.",
        "The library implements the rules of syllable composition, provides input methods, and routines for conversion of syllables to/from other encodings like iscii and unicode.",
        "All of this functionality is exposed through opaque data types and a small API operating on them.",
        "As mentioned above, text is encoded directly as syllables.",
        "The encoding used is a modified version of the syllabic encoding scheme (Kalyanakrishnan, 1994) developed by Prof. R. Kalyana Krishnan at the Systems Development Lab, IIT Madras.",
        "This encoding tries to capture the syllabic nature of In-dic scripts.",
        "In this encoding, each syllable can be specified as",
        "Where C is the consonant and V is the vowel.",
        "This means that each syllable can be one of V, C, CV,",
        "CCV, CCCV and CCCCV combinations.",
        "The initial C is the base consonant and the subsequent Cs represent conjunct combinations.",
        "The memory representation of each syllable is a 16-bit value with the following bit distribution:",
        "With this arrangement, it is possible to have upto 64 consonants with 16 vowels each.",
        "The bits 4-9 indicated by the cnj field hold the index into the base consonant's conjunct table.",
        "This table holds the values of the constituent consonants OR'ed into a 32bit integer.",
        "For example:",
        "The syllable ndrA is stored in the following way.",
        "Comparing with figure 1, the vowel code is 1 which stands for the vowel aa.",
        "Similarly, the base consonant code is 20 and represents the consonant na.",
        "The conjunct code 25 is an index into the conjunct table of the consonant na.",
        "The value that will be stored at index 25 is shown in figure 3:",
        "Bits 0-7 contain the consonant code of the first level conjunct, bits 8-15 of the second level conjunct and bits 16-23 of the third level.",
        "Bits 23-31 are reserved for future expansion.",
        "In this case, there are 2 consonants in addition to the base consonant na.",
        "The values 18 and 30 represent the consonants da and ra respectively.",
        "These codes are specified in the files generic.vow, generic.con, generic.spl for vowels, consonants and special characters respectively.",
        "The conjunct combinations are specified in the file generic.cnj in this fashion:",
        "Here ra is the base consonant and the line defines three conjuncts namely rt(ra + ta), rtt(ra + ta + ta) and rtty(ra + ta + ta + ya).",
        "The last conjunct is an example of a conjunct where all the four levels are used ra + ta + ta + ya.",
        "It occurs for example in the Oriya word marttya.",
        "Each pair of parenthesis stands for a level of conjunct.",
        "More complex conjuncts can be added by nesting them within parentheses.",
        "However, the current implementation supports only up to three levels of nesting.",
        "The generic.cnj file as it stands now defines 1240 conjuncts.",
        "When the 16 vowels are taken into account, we get a total of 19840 syllables.",
        "An additional set of32 syllables for local language numbers, punctuation and other special characters increases the total number of valid syllables to 19872.",

        "0",
        "This scheme also accommodates English text in the ascii encoding by using a consonant code of 62 and the lower eight bits representing the ascii code.",
        "It also has a few special syllable codes for switching scripts to be embedded within the data stream although they are not used within the editor.",
        "The 16-bit syllable value stands on its own and does not correspond to unicode or iscii or any other encoding for that matter.",
        "One particular feature of this scheme is the compactness and the inherent compression.",
        "For example,",
        "the above word - marttya (m + r + halant + t + halant + t + halant + y), in unicode utf-16 encoding will be encoded as 8 16-bit values.",
        "utf-8 requires 26 bytes to encode the word.",
        "In iscii, it can be encoded in 8 bytes whereas in this encoding, the above word requires just 2 syllables of 16 bits each.",
        "One other aspect of this encoding is that there is a separation of content and its visual representation.",
        "On one hand, this means that text processing applications need not worry about dealing with display related issues like glyph reordering and proper placement of glyphs using the various zero width space characters as is the case with character based encoding schemes including unicode.",
        "On the other hand, this separation means that to display a syllable some kind of map is required between the syllable and its visual representation (glyphs).",
        "This mapping is font dependent when non standard fonts using the iso8859-1 encoding are used but unicode fonts can also be used.",
        "Currently static tables are used to provide a one to one mapping between the syllables and its corresponding glyphs.",
        "This is a trade-off where memory is traded for quick display of glyphs.",
        "There is no need for cluster identification as the information is already there in the form of syllables.",
        "This lookup is O(1) whereas in shaping engines like Pango, this operation is O(n).",
        "These static tables can also be useful in environments where shaping engines like Uniscribe and Pango are not available or cannot be used.",
        "The library provides routines for input methods which can be used in conjunction with the platform specific keyboard processing functions to support direct key-in of syllables.",
        "Currently, it includes input methods for inscript (ISCII, 1993) and Phonetic keyboards.",
        "However, the mechanism is general enough to add additional keyboard layouts including ones that work only with specific scripts.",
        "In the current implementation, the input methods load their respective data and delegate the bulk of the work to the syllable processing routine.",
        "unicode is the de-facto standard for storing and rendering text so conversion to/from unicode is essential for integration with other tools.",
        "unicode integration can be achieved either by having a static syllable-to-glyphs map with unicode fonts or a separate text codec to do the syllable to unicode conversion.",
        "In the current implementation, the text codec strategy is used to convert the syllables to its corresponding utf-8"

        "The most important data structure in a text editor is the one that stores text sequences.",
        "A poor choice will directly affect the performance of the editor as almost all editing operations work on these text sequences.",
        "A survey of popular data structures for text sequences is presented in (Crowley, 1998).",
        "The two most popular choices are gap buffer and piece table.",
        "A gap buffer is basically an array that has a gap which is moved to the point of edit so that the text that is entered is copied to the gap without further allocation of storage.",
        "The gap shrinks and expands on insertion and deletion of text respectively.",
        "Gap buffers have the advantages of being simple to implement and offer direct access to the text.",
        "The downside is they incur a copying overhead when the gap is not at the point of editing operations as text needs to be copied to either side of the gap.",
        "Also gap buffers are not suitable if the text has attributes and runs (run is a chunk of text that belongs to the same script) of text need to be stored.",
        "A multilingual text editor has both these requirements.",
        "To implement this in a gap buffer would require a parallel style or script buffer (Gillam, 2002) to track and demarcate the runs and its corresponding font changes.",
        "Whenever the gap is moved and text added or deleted, the style buffer would need to be updated as well.",
        "This can quickly get cumbersome when multiple scripts are used in the same document.",
        "A piece table is an alternative to the gap buffer that does not suffer from these problems.",
        "In a piece table, the text is immutable and is always appended to the sequence.",
        "However, the logical order that is shown in the view is maintained by a separate list of piece descriptors.",
        "A piece includes information such as the script, the start and end positions within the sequence etc.",
        "So, when the user copies/deletes the text, it is the piece descriptors that are moved around and not the actual text.",
        "By introducing this level of indirection, the piece table solves the problem of copying overhead when text is moved around.",
        "However, the drawback is that the text is no longer accessible directly.",
        "To locate a position in the text sequence the editor has to traverse the piece table and locate the piece which contains the position.",
        "Despite this drawback, the piece table data structure offers a number of advantages - it is a persistent data structure and because the original text is never destroyed operations like undo and redo lend to a straightforward implementation by restoring the links between the removed pieces from the undo and redo stacks respectively.",
        "The other advantage of piece tables is that there is a direct mapping from script runs to pieces.",
        "The piece table in this editor is implemented as a piece chain (Brown, 2006) - a circular linked list with a sentinel node.",
        "Since the piece chain is a linked list, the problem of linear addressing is pronounced (O(n)).",
        "To deal with this problem, the piece chain caches the last accessed (piece, position) pair to utilize the locality of reference (Wirth and Gutknecht, 1992).",
        "This small optimization has so far worked out well in practice as there is a strong locality of reference in text editing.",
        "To store the syllables itself, the deque class from the standard C++ library is used.",
        "It is a scalable data structure that guarantees efficient insertion of large amounts of text at the tail position.",
        "Another important issue is that of cursor movement.",
        "In the editor, syllables are displayed using a variable number of glyphs.",
        "Allowing the cursorto be positioned in the middle ofasyllable would make it possible to delete that particular syllable partially which would make the data inconsistent.",
        "Therefore all cursor related operations including selection should be limited to syllable boundaries.",
        "This is achieved by using a separate deque object for storing the width of each syllable where width is the number of glyphs that the syllable is represented by visually.",
        "This additional information is used when mapping the syllable position in the text storage to its corresponding glyph position in the view and vice-versa.",
        "As mentioned in section 2, the editor works in terms of syllables and not characters.",
        "While syllables can be stored to disk files directly, to retain compatibility with other Indian language applications, the editor stores the text to files in the 7-bit iscii encoding.",
        "7-bit iscii is a simple and efficient format where English text in ascii is stored as is and the text in Indic scripts are stored using code points from the upper half of the character set (128-255).",
        "Like the syllabic encoding and unlike unicode, iscii uses a uniform representation for all the Indic scripts.",
        "Each script run starts off with a code that identifies the language of the run.",
        "This makes run detection very simple to implement.",
        "When the editor saves a document, all the syllables are broken down to their constituent iscii characters and written to disk.",
        "Similarly, when a file is opened, the iscii data is converted to the syllabic representation using the iscii codec routines from the syllable library and from then on only the syllables are used.",
        "Because of the uniformity of the encoding all the supported scripts have a means of displaying the same set of syllables hence transliteration in this encoding is basically changing the script code for the user-selected piece of text and notifying the view that is displaying the text to re-render the selected text using the font of the target script.",
        "What this means is that transliteration as supported by this encoding will survive a round-trip conversion without any loss of data.",
        "An example to illustrate the last point:",
        "Supposing in a multilingual document, the user selects the character *T (ga in Hindi) and transliterates to RomanTrans, the editor will display ga. Internally, the ga syllable is stored in the following way:",
        "The text storage tracks the script code for every syllable.",
        "When the above syllable is converted to RomanTrans, the text storage object does not modify the syllable but changes only the script code to RomanTrans and notifies the view displaying the text.",
        "The view upon receiving the notification from the storage object then re-renders the ga syllable using RomanTrans's font map.",
        "Similarly, when the user once again changes to Tamil, the editor correctly displays <9S (ka in Tamil) this time using Tamil's font map which specifies that ga should be mapped to the same glyph as ka.",
        "If the user once again changes the script back to Hindi, the letter *T (ga in Hindi) is displayed correctly.",
        "The above scheme is possible because the text content is kept separate from the actual display of text and more importantly the text content itself is stored as syllables which are the fundamental units of transliteration.",
        "Word completion, also known as auto-completion under certain applications, is a handy feature to have specially for typing lengthy and frequently used words fast.",
        "In its current implementation, this editor does not automatically complete words.",
        "The user needs to trigger it explicitly.",
        "This is mainly to keep the editor less disruptive (in terms of the typing flow) and also to keep the implementation simple.",
        "When typing long words, the user after typing the first few characters can trigger the pop-up with possible completions by means of the designated keyboard shortcut.",
        "The list of words that appear in the completion box is obtained by doing a prefix search (of what the user had typed so far) on a dynamic dictionary.",
        "This dictionary is implemented using ternary search trees (Bentley and Sedgewick, 1998).",
        "A ternary search tree (henceforth TST) is a versatile data structure that combines the time efficiency of tries and the space efficiency of binary search trees.",
        "TSTs are generally faster than hashtables and offer much more functionality than simple key lookups because they maintain the ordering of the data stored within.",
        "When augmented with additional information, TSTs can also be used for implementing spell checking and by using a fixed edit distance, alternative word suggestions as well.",
        "A full description is beyond the scope of this short paper.",
        "However, (Bentley and Sedgewick, 1997) provide all the details."
