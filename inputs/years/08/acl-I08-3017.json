        "In this scenario the acceptance and usability of the information technology by the masses will be tremendously increased.",
        "Moreover 70% of the Indian population lives in rural areas so it becomes even more important for them to have speech enabled computer application built in their native language.",
        "Here we must mention that in the past time decades, the research has been done on continuous, large vocabulary speech processing systems for English and other European languages; Indian languages as Hindi and others were not being emphasized.",
        "For example for English language, the commercial speech recognition systems available in the market are IBM Via Voice and Scansoft Dragon system.",
        "These have mature ASR engines with high accuracy.",
        "No such system with this accuracy is available for Hindi (Kumar et al., 2004).",
        "India is passing through the phase of computer revolution.",
        "Therefore it is need of time that speech processing technology must be developed for Indian languages.",
        "Fortunately people have realized the great need of human machine interaction based on Indian languages.",
        "Researchers are striving hard currently to improve the accuracy of the speech processing techniques in these languages (Samudravijaya, 2000).",
        "Speech technology has made great progress with the development of better acoustic models, new feature extraction algorithms, better Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Digital Signal Processing (DSP) tools and significantly better hardware and software resources.",
        "Through this paper, we describe the development of ASR system for Indian languages.",

        "2.1 Preprocessing",
        "It covers mainly these tasks A/D conversion, Background noise filtering, Pre emphasis, Blocking and Windowing.",
        "In first task analog electrical signals are digitized, i.e. these are converted into a discrete-time, discrete-valued signal.",
        "This process of analog to digital conversion has two steps: sampling and quantization.",
        "A signal is sampled by measuring its amplitude at a particular time; the sampling rate is the number of samples taken per second.",
        "In general, a sampling rate between 8 and 20 kHz is used for speech recognition application (James Allen, 2005).",
        "As a point of reference, perceptual studies generally indicate that frequencies up to about 10 kHz (10,000 cycles per second) occur in speech, but speech remains intelligible within a considerably narrower range.",
        "The second important factor is the quantization factor, which determines what scale is used to represent the signal intensity.",
        "Generally, it appears that 11-bit numbers capture sufficient information, although by using a log scale, we can get by with 8-bit numbers.",
        "In fact, most current speech recognition systems end up classifying each segment of signal into only one of 256 distinct categories.",
        "So a typical representation of a speech signal is a stream of 8-bit numbers at the rate of 10,000 numbers per second clearly a large amount of data.",
        "The challenge for speech recognition system is to reduce this data to some manageable representation.",
        "Once signal conversion is complete, background noise is filtered to keep SNR high.",
        "While speech capturing, background noise and silence (absence of speech) will also be quantized with speech data.",
        "An important problem in speech processing is to detect the presence of speech in a background of noise and silence from our recording speech.",
        "This problem is often referred to as the endpoint detection problem (Rabiner and Bishnu, 1976).",
        "By accurately detecting the beginning and end of an utterance the amount of processing can be kept at minimum.",
        "According to literature (Reddy, 1976), accurate determination of end points is not very difficult if the signal-to-noise ratio is high, say greater than 60 dB.",
        "The next step is the pre-emphasis.",
        "The motivation behind it is to emphasize the important frequency components in the signal (i.e. amplify important areas of the spectrum) by spectrally flatten the signal.",
        "For example hearing is more sensitive in the 1 KHz-5 KHz region of the spectrum.",
        "It amplifies this area of spectrum, assisting the spectral analysis algorithm in modeling the most perceptually important aspects of the speech spectrum.",
        "The goal of feature extraction is to find a set of properties of an utterance that have acoustic correlations in the speech signal, that is parameters that can some how be computed or estimated through processing of the signal waveform.",
        "Such parameters are termed as features.",
        "Feature extraction is the parameterization of the speech signal.",
        "It includes the process of measuring some important characteristic of the signal such as energy or frequency response (i.e. signal measurement), augmenting these measurements with some perceptually meaningful derived measurements (i.e. signal parameterization), and statically conditioning these numbers to form observation vectors.",
        "There are several ways to extract features from speech signal as given below:",
        "• Linear Predictive Cepstral Coefficients (LPCC)",
        "• Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) (Skowronski et al., 2002)",
        "• Wavelet as feature extractor (Biem, 2001)",
        "In this subsystem, the connection between the acoustic information and phonetics is established.",
        "Speech unit is mapped to its acoustic counterpart using temporal models as speech is a temporal signal.",
        "There are many models for this purpose• Hidden Markov Model (HMM)",
        "ANN is a general pattern recognition model which found its use in ASR in the early years.",
        "Rabiner (1991), first suggested the HMM approach leading to substantial performance improvement.",
        "Current major ASR systems use HMM for acoustic modeling.",
        "Since then researchers have tried to optimize this model for memory and computation requirements.",
        "In the current state, it seems that",
        "HMM has given the best it could and now we need to find other models to go ahead in this domain.",
        "This leads to consideration of other models in which Dynamic Bayesian Network seems a promising direction",
        "Still our experiments and verification has been done on a HMM based system.",
        "The goal of language modeling is to produce accurate value of probability of a word W, Pr(w).",
        "A language model contains the structural constraints available in the language to generate the probabilities.",
        "Intuitively speaking, it determines the probability of a word occurring after a word sequence.",
        "It is easy to see that each language has its own constraints for validity.",
        "The method and complexity of modeling language would vary with the speech application.",
        "This leads to mainly two approaches for language modeling.",
        "Generally, small vocabulary constrained tasks like phone dialing can be modeled by grammar based approach where as large applications like broadcast news transcription require stochastic approach."

        "Speech signal is an analog signal at the recording time, which varies with time.",
        "To process the signal by digital means, it is necessary to sample the continuous-time signal into a discrete-time signal, and then convert the discrete-time continuous-valued signal into a discrete-time, discrete-valued (digital) signal.",
        "The properties of a signal change relatively slowly with time, so that we can divide the speech into a sequence of uncorrelated segments, or frames, and process the sequence as if each frame has fix properties.",
        "Under this assumption, we can extract the features of each frame based on the samples inside the frame only.",
        "And usually, the feature vector will replace the original signal in the further processing, which means the speech signal is converted from a time varying analog signal into a sequence of feature vectors.",
        "The process of converting sequences of speech samples to feature vectors representing events in the probability space is called Signal Modeling (Picone, 1993; Karanjanadecha and Zoharian, 1999).",
        "Signal Modeling can be divided into two basic steps: Preprocessing and Feature Extraction.",

        "How are these feature vectors turned into probabilities?",
        "There are two popular versions of continuous approach.",
        "The more widespread of the two is the use of Gaussian pdfs, in the simplest version of which each state has a single Gaussian function which maps the observation vector Otto a probability.",
        "An alternative approach is the use of neural networks or multilayer preceptons which can also be trained to assign a probability to a real valued feature vector.",
        "HMMs with Gaussian observation-probability-estimators are trained by a simple extension to the forward-backward algorithm.",
        "HMMs with neural-net observation-probability-estimators are trained by a completely different algorithm known as error back-propagation.",
        "Among the various acoustic models, HMM is so far the most widely used and most effective approach.",
        "Its popularity is due to an efficient algorithm for training and recognition and its performance superiority over the other modeling structures.",
        "An HMM is a statistical model for an ordered sequence of symbols, acting as a stochastic finite state machine which is assumed to be build up from a finite set of possible states, each of those states being associated with a specific probability distribution or probability density function.",

        "These problems are addressed by Forward Algorithm, Viterbi Algorithm and Baum-Welch Algorithm respectively.",
        "A detailed discussion of the same is available here (Rabiner, 1989).",
        "HMM-based recognition algorithms are classified into two acoustic models, i.e., phonemelevel model and word-level model.",
        "The phonemelevel HMM has been widely used in current speech recognition systems which permit large sized vocabularies.",
        "Whereas the word-level HMM has excellent performance at isolated word tasks and is capable of representing speech transitions between phonemes.",
        "However its application has remained a research-level and been constrained to small sized vocabularies because of extremely high computation cost which is proportional to the number of HMM models.",
        "Recognition performance in the word HMM is determined by the number of HMM states and dimensions of feature vectors.",
        "Although high numbers of the states and the dimensions are effective in improving recognition accuracy, the computation cost is proportional to these parameters (Yoshizawa et al., 2004).",
        "As conventional methods in high-speed computation of the output probability, Gaussian selection (Knill et al., 1996) and tree structured probability density function (Watanabe et al., 1994) are proposed in the phoneme-level HMM.",
        "These methods use the approximation to the output probability if exact probability values are not required.",
        "However in the word HMM, output probability values directly effects recognition accuracy and a straight forward calculation produces the most successful recognition results (Yoshizawa et al., 2004).",
        "To see how it can be applied to ASR, we are using a whole-word isolated word recognizer.",
