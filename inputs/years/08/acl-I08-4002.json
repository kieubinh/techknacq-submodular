        "Usually, a foreign word can be transliterated into various Chinese words, and sometimes this will lead to transliteration complexity.",
        "In addition, dozens of Chinese characters correspond to each pinyin which uses the Latin alphabet to represent sounds in Standard Mandarin.",
        "In order to solve these problems, Chinese government published the \"Names of the world's peoples\"[12] containing 630,000 entries in 1993, which took about 40 years.",
        "However, some new foreign names still cannot be found in the dictionary.",

        "Machine transliteration is classified into two types.",
        "One is automatic generation of transliterated word from the source language [6]; the other one is extracting transliteration pairs from bilingual texts [2].",
        "Generally, the generation process performs worse than the extraction process.",
        "Especially in Chinese, people do not always transliterate foreign words only by sound but also consider the meanings.",
        "For example, the word 'blog' is not transliterated into ' ^ 5j M' (Bu-LaoGe) which is phonetically equivalent to the source word, but transliterated into 'ff^'(BoKe) which means 'a lot of guests'.",
        "In this case, it is too difficult to automatically generate correct transliteration words.",
        "Therefore, our approach is based on the method of extracting transliteration pairs from bilingual texts.",
        "The type of extraction of transliteration pairs can also be further divided into two types.",
        "One is extracting transliteration candidates from each language respectively, and then comparing the phonetic similarities between those candidates of two languages [2, 8].",
        "The other one is only extracting transliteration candidates from the source language, and using the candidates to extract corresponding transliteration words from the target language [1].",
        "In Chinese, there is no space between two words and no special character set to represent foreign words such as Japanese; hence the candidate extraction is difficult and usually results in a low precision.",
        "Therefore, the method presented in [2] which extracted transliteration candidates from both English and Chinese result in a poor performance.",
        "Compared to other works, Lee[1] only extracts transliteration candidates from English, and finds equivalent Chinese transliteration words without extracting candidates from Chinese texts.",
        "The method works well, but the performance is required to be improved.",
        "In this paper we present a novel approaches to obtain a remarkable result in extracting transliteration word pairs from parallel texts.",

        "In this paper, we presented two novel approaches called dynamic window and tokenizer based on the statistical machine transliteration model.",
        "Our approaches achieved high precision without any postprocessing procedures.",
        "The dynamic window approach was based on a fundamental property, which more TUs aligned between correct transliteration pairs.",
        "Also, we reasonably estimated the range of correct transliteration's length to extract transliteration pairs in high precision.",
        "The token-izer method eliminated characters that have never been used in Chinese transliteration to separate a sentence into several parts.",
        "This resulted in a certain degree of improvement of precision and significantly reduction of processing time.",
        "These two methods are both based on common natures of all languages; thus our approaches can be readily port to other language pairs.",
        "In this paper, we only considered the English words that are to be transliterated into Chinese.",
        "Our work is ongoing, and in near future, we will extend our works to extract transliteration pairs from large scale comparable corpora.",
        "In comparable corpora, there are many uncertainties, for example, the extracted English word may be not transliterated into Chinese or there may be no correct transliteration in Chinese texts.",
        "However, with large comparable corpora, a word will appear several times, and we can use the frequency or entropy information to extract correct transliteration pairs based on the proposed perfect algorithm.",
