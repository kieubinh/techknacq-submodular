        "Chinese word segmentation has always been a difficult and challenging task in Chinese language processing.",
        "Several Chinese morphological analysis systems have been developed by different research groups and they all have quite good performance when doing segmentation of written Chinese.",
        "But there still remain some problems.",
        "The biggest one is that each research group has its own segmentation standard for their system, which means that there is no single segmentation standard for all tagged corpora which can be agreeable across different research groups.",
        "And we believe that this situation slows down the progress of Chinese NLP research.",
        "Among all the differences of segmentation standards, the segmentation method for Chinese synthetic words is the most controversial part because Chinese synthetic words have a quite complex structure and should be represented by several segmention levels according to the needs of upper applications such as MT, IR and IME.",
        "For instance, a long(upper level) segmentation unit may simplify syntactic analysis and IME application but a small(lower level) segmentation unit might be better for information retrieval or word-based statistical summarization.",
        "But for now, no Chinese morphological analysis system can do all kinds of these work with only one segmentation standard.",
        "Furthermore, although every segmentation system has good performance, in the analysis of real world text, there are still many out-of-vocabulary words which could not be easily recognized because of the flexibility of Chinese synthetic word construction, especially proper names that could always appear as synthetic words.",
        "In order to make our Chinese morphological analysis system to recognize more out-of-vocabulary words and to fit different kinds of NLP applications, we try to analyze the structure of the internal information of Chinese synthetic words, categorize them into semantic and syntactic types and store these information into a synthetic word dictionary by representing them with a kind of tree structure built on our system dictionary.",
        "In this paper, we first make the definition of Chinese synthetic words and classify them into several categories in Section 2.",
        "In Section 3, two previous researches on Chinese synthetic words will be introduced.",
        "Then we propose a tree-based method for analyzing Chinese synthetic words and make a survey focused on 3-character morphological derived words to get the features for future machine learning process.",
        "In Section 4, we do an experiment by using SVM classifier to annotate 3-character morphologically derived words.",
        "Finally, Section 5 shows how this method could benefit Chinese morphological analysis and our future work."

        "There has always been a common belief that Chinese 'doesn't have words', but instead has 'characters', or that Chinese 'has no morphology' and so is 'morphologically impoverished', because in Chinese a 'word' is by no means a clear and intuitive notion.",
        "But actually for native Chinese speakers, they know that words are those lexical entries which represent a complete concept and occur innately in the form of specific language rules based on the speaker's mental lexicon.",
        "Though there are a lot of ways to classify Chinese words, we believe that Chinese words should be first divided into single-morpheme words and synthetic words according to the way of construction of their internal parts.",
        "Single-morpheme words are those that could not be divided into smaller parts when representing as the whole concept.",
        "In other words, if we divide single morpheme words into characters or parts, the meaning of individual parts become independent and does not indicate any connection with the meaning of the original word.",
        "Following are the three different types of single-morpheme words:",
        "©one-character words: A [human], J% [horse], ^-[vehicle]",
        "©transliteration words: Ytff-[pizza], iHtJ^Kentucky]",
        "The first kind is obvious single words in that an ordinary character in Chinese stands for an independent morpheme with one or several senses.",
        "The second kind shows those words which are composed of several characters and always used as a whole.",
        "For the last kind, as can be seen from the above examples, if we divide [Kentucky] into '^[can]',",
        "[moral]' and 'Jt[base]', it definitely can not indicate the meaning of the well-known fried chicken restaurant chain from those three characters.",
        "So these three kinds of single-morpheme words should be segmented as one word in any morphological analysis systems.",
        "However, it becomes much more complicated when dealing with synthetic words.",
        "Generally, synthetic words are the type of words which are composed of single-morpheme words and represent a new entity or meaning which can be indicated from the internal constituents.",
        "According to this definition, if we divide synthetic words into smaller parts, we could still somehow guess the original meaning from the meaning of internal parts despite the fact that it may not be a very precise one.",
        "For example the word [driver].",
        "If we don't know the meaning of ' 5^', but we do know the meaning of' 5 ' is 'control' and the meaning of is 'machine'.",
        "Then we can guess the meaning of '5^' may be connected with control and machine , and actually the real meaning is the person who drives(controls) a car(machine).",
        "In Chinese language, according to the encoding standard of GB2312, there are about 6,763 commonly used characters.",
        "And in our own system dictionary which has about 129,440 word entries, the number of one-character words is only 6,188 (about 4.78%).",
        "From these figures, we know that most Chinese words belong to synthetic words and a deep analysis for synthetic words is necessary for Chinese language processing.",
        "The Synthetic words may be understood as the result or output of a word-formation rule in Chinese language.",
        "Classification of these Chinese synthetic words is a difficult task because the formation rule is not so obvious and sometimes even a native speaker can not determine which category a word should belong to.",
        "However, since it is quite important to understand the structure of Chinese words, there have been a lot of research on classification of Chinese synthetic words from both linguistic and computational points of view until now.",
        "Each of them has divided synthetic words into different categories according to their own criteria.",
        "In our research, based on our experience on Chinese morphological analysis and unknown word detection, we divide Chinese synthetic words into the categories as shown in Figure 1 to help us understand the inner constituents of them.",
        "Compound words, whose internal constituents have some syntactic relations with each other, can be divided into the following six kinds according to (Yuanjian He, 2004).",

        "• Noun-modification^i^'felE-^]",
        "Here we have made some compromises with these categories mentioned above based on the simplicity of machine learning process and our experience on tagging compund words.",
        "For example, we only define SV and VS as the subject-predicate type because it will make machine learning process much easier when it comes to those words with a structure like SVO or SVX.",
        "Futhermore, in the case that a word with an internal constituent which has both NN and VV parts of speech, even human annotators can not easily tell which type this word should be categarized into between noun-modification and verb-modification.",
        "So we tagged all these words to verb-modification when they have an internal part with both NN and VV parts of speech.",
        "Morphologically derived words are those which have specific word formation.",
        "It can be categoried into the following types:",

        "There are two main previous researches on the analysis ofChinese synthetic words.",
        "The first one is done by Microsoft (Andi Wu, 2003) by creating a customizable segmentation system of Chinese morphologically derived words.",
        "This system uses a parameter driven method which can divide synthetic words into different levels of word components based on some predefined rules, according to the needs of different NLP application.",
        "For instance, in machine translation, we will translate '^ffij&ii' into 'toaster' if our system dictionary has this kind of information.",
        "But if we do not have this entry in our dictionary, we have to split '^ffij&ii [toaster]' into lower level such as '^[bake] l [bread] l it [machine]', the translation of which will probably give us some information about the original meaning of the whole word.",
        "Although this system achieves higher score than other systems that do not have synthetic analysis, it only takes morphologically derived words into account, which means it does not contain information about internal syntactic relations.",
        "The second one (C. Huang, 1997) is actually a proposal of segmentation standard rather than a detailed synthetic word analysis research.",
        "It is first used by Sinica when doing the tagging task of Chinese word segmentation.",
        "If the tagging object is a synthetic word, one tag among w0, wl and w2, which stand for 'faithful', 'truthful' and 'graceful', will be selected for it.",

        "Again, this kind of method does not take word internal syntactic relations into account either.",
        "Furthermore, it even does not have the POS information of different levels of word, thus can not be used to construct a customizable system.",
        "3.2 Synthetic word analysis with tree-based structure information",

        "We assume that words which are already in our current system dictionary could be word components of other out-of-vocabulary synthetic words.",
        "So the first thing to do is to classify all synthetic words in our current dictionary into the categories defined in section 2.2.",
        "Because intuitively most 2-character words, though they could have internal syntactic relations, are often used as single words by native speakers and have already been registered as lexical entries in our Chinese dictionary, we can first classify all 3-character words into those categories and link their internal components to 1-character words and 2-character words which are already in our dictionary.",
        "After finishing the internal structure annotation for 3-character words, we can easily construct 4-character or 5-character words' structure by using 3-character and 2-character words' information and store these structure information into synthetic word dictionary.",
        "Finally, when we get a long synthetic word, we can build a tree structure recursively like in Figure 2 by using the constituent words' internal structures, which have already been stored in our synthetic word dictionary.",

        "Usually, in Chinese, 2-character words are thought and used as single words by native speakers.",
        "And words which have more than two characters are often synthetic words which can be categorized into compound words or morphologically derived words.",
        "So during our work of analyzing Chinese synthetic words, we first choose 3-character words as our main target in that starting from 3-character words will give us a good chain effect when analyzing words which have more than three characters.",
        "At first, there is no other resource at hand except for the morphological analysis system dictionary with 129440 entries.",
        "Because a standard set with all category information of Chinese synthetic words is needed in further research, we first extracted 1000 3-character words from our dictionary and annotated them by hand according to the categories introduced in section 2.",

        "Because we don't have any other useful resources except Chinese Gigaword(CGW), We first computed mutual information for all 3-character words in two ways by referencing the CGW.",

        "Since A, C, AB and BC are all independent words, if the result shows Mi-pre <Mi-suf, we could say that the relation between A and BC is more independent than the relation between AB and C, which means it is more possible that A and some other 2-character word XY cound form the word AXY.",
