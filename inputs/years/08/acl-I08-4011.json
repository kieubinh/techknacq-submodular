        "A part-of-speech tagger typically assigns a tag to each word in a sentence sequentially from left to right or in reverse order.",

        "And when words are tagged from right to left, only the tags of the words on the right side are available to the tagging of the current word.",
        "We expect the use of the tags of the words on both sides of the current word should improve the tagging of the current word.",

        "Both taggers assign tags to words from left to right.",
        "In tagging a new sentence, the first tagger is applied to the testing data, and then the second tagger is applied to the output of the first tagger to produce the final results.",

        "Maximum entropy model is a machine learning algorithm that has been applied to a range of natural language processing tasks, including part-of-speech tagging (Ratnaparkhi, 1996).",
        "Our Chinese part-of-speech taggers are based on the maximum entropy model.",
        "The conditional maximum entropy model (Berger, et.",
        "al., 1996) has the form p(y Ix)=ik exp(Z Akfk (x y)) where Z(x) = p(y | x)is a normalization factor, and Ak is a weight parameter associated with feature fk (x, y).",
        "In the context of part-of-speech tagging, y is the POS tag assigned to a word, and x represents the contextual information regarding the word in consideration, such as the surrounding words.",
        "A feature is a real-valued, typically binary, function.",
        "For example, we may define a binary feature which takes the value 1 if the current word of X is 'story' and its POS tag is 'NNS'; and 0 otherwise.",
        "Given a set of training examples, the log likelihood of the model with Gaussian prior (Chen and Rosenfeld, 1999) has the form",
        "Malouf (2002) compared iterative procedures such as Generalized Iterative Scaling (GIS) and Improved Iterative Scaling (IIS) with numerical optimization techniques like limited-memory BFGS (L-BFGS) for estimating the maximum entropy model parameters and found that L-BFGS outperforms the other methods.",
        "The use of L-BFGS requires the computation of the gradient of the log likelihood function.",
        "The first derivative with respect to parameter Xk is given by where the first term Epfk is the feature expectation with the empirical model, and the second term Epfk is the feature expectation with respect to the model.",
        "In our model training, we used L-BFGS to estimate the model parameters by maximizing L(A) on the training data.",
        "The feature templates used in our part-of-speech taggers are presented in Table 1 and Table 2.",
        "The features are grouped into four categories.",
        "The first category contains features involving word tokens only; the second category consists of features involving tags only; the third category has features involving both word tokens and tags.",
        "And the last category has four special features.",
        "In the feature templates, wi denotes the current word, wi-2 the second word to the left, wi-1 the previous word, wi+1 the next word, wi+2 the second word to the right of the current word, and ti denotes the part-of-speech tag assigned to the word wi.",
        "The FirstChar refers to the initial character of a word, and the LastChar the final character of a word.",
