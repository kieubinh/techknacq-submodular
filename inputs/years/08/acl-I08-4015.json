      "text": [
        "Since Chinese Word Segmentation was firstly treated as a character-based tagging task in (Xue and Converse, 2002), this method has been widely accepted and further developed by researchers (Peng et al., 2004), (Tseng et al., 2005), (Low et al., 2005), (Zhao et al., 2006).",
        "Thus, as a powerful sequence tagging model, CRF became the dominant method in the Bakeoff 2006 (Levow, 2006).",
        "In this paper, we improve basic segmenter under the CRF work frame in two aspects, namely IV and OOV identification respectively.",
        "We use the result from word-based segmentation to revise the CRF output so that we gain a higher IV word recall.",
        "For the OOV part a post-processing rule is proposed to find those OOV words which are wrongly segmented into several fractions.",
        "Our system performs well in the Fourth Bakeoff, achieving four second best and on the fifth in all the five corpora.",
        "In the following of this paper, we describe our method in more detail.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we first give a brief review to the basic CRF tagging approach and then we propose our methods to improve IV and OOV performance respectively.",
        "In Section 3 we give the experiment results on the fourth Bakeoff corpora to show that our method is effective to improve the performance of the segmenter.",
        "In Section 4, we conclude our work."

      "heading": "2. Our Word Segmentation System",
      "text": [
        "In this section, we describe our system in more detail.",
        "Our system includes three modules: a basic CRF tagger, a word-base segmenter to improve the IV recall and a post-processing rule to improve the OOV recall.",
        "In the following of this section, we introduce these three modules respectively.",
        "Sequence tagging approach treat Word Segmentation task as a labeling problem.",
        "Every character in input sentences will be given a label which indicates whether this character is a word boundary.",
        "Our basic CRF tagger is almost the same as the system described in (Zhao et al., 2006) except we add a feature to incorporate word information, which is learned from training corpus.",
        "Under the CRF tagging scheme, each character in one sentence will be given a label by CRF model to indicate which position this character occupies in a word.",
        "In our system, CRF tag set is proposed to distinguish different positions in the multi-character words when the word length is less than 6, namely 6-tag set {B, B2, B3, M, E, O}.",
        "Here, Tag B and E stand for the first and the last position in a multi-character word, respectively.",
        "S stands up a single-character word.",
        "B2 and B3 stand for the second and the third position in a multi-character word, whose length is larger than two-character or three-character.",
        "M stands for the fourth or more rear position in a multi-character word, whose length is larger than four-character.",
        "We add a new feature, which also used in maximum entropy model for word segmentation task by (Low et al., 2005), to the feature templates for CRF model while keep the other features same as (Zhao et al., 2006).",
        "The feature templates are defined in table 1.",
        "In the feature template, only the Word Flag feature needs an explanation.",
        "The binary function F0 = 1 if and only if C.i C0 form a IV word, else F0 = 0 and F} = 1 if and only if C0 C}form a IV word, else F} = 0.",
        "For the word-based word segmentation, we collect dictionary from training corpus first.",
        "Instead of Maximum Match, trigram language model trained on training corpus is employed for disambiguation.",
        "During the disambiguation procedure, a beam search decoder is used to seek the most possible segmentation.",
        "For detail, the decoder reads characters from the input sentence one at a time, and generates candidate segmentations incrementally.",
        "At each stage, the next incoming character is combined with an existing candidate in two different ways to generate new candidates: it is either appended to the last word in the candidate, or taken as the start of a new word.",
        "This method guarantees exhaustive generation of possible segmentations for any input sentence.",
        "However, the exponential time and space of the length of the input sentence are needed for such a search and it is always intractable in practice.",
        "Thus, we use the trigram language model to select top B (B is a constant predefined before search and in our experiment 3 is used) best candidates with highest probability at each stage so that the search algorithm can work in practice.",
        "Finally, when the whole sentence has been read, the best candidate with the highest probability will be selected as the segmentation result.",
        "After we get word-based segmentation result, we use it to revise the CRF tagging result similar to (Zhang et al., 2006).",
        "Since word-based segmentation result also corresponds to a tag sequence according to the 6-tag set, we now have two tags for each character, word-based tag (WT) and CRF tag (CT).",
        "Which tag will be kept as the final result depends on Marginal Probability (MP) of the CT.",
        "Here, we give a short explanation about what is the MP of the CT.",
        "Suppose there is a sentence C = c0cx...cM, where ci is the character this sentence containing.",
        "CRF model gives this sentence a optimal tag sequence T = t0t1...tM , where tiis the the MP of ti is defined as:",
        "Here, P(T | C) is the conditional probability given by CRF model.",
        "For more detail about how to calculate this conditional probability, please refer to (Lafferty et al., 2001).",
        "Assume that the tag assigned to the current character is CT by CRF and WT by word-based segmenter respectively.",
        "The rules under which we revise CRF result with word-based result is that if MP(CT) of a character is less than a predefined threshold and WT is not \"S\", the WT of this character will be kept as the final result, else the CT of the character will be kept as the final result.",

        "Besides CRF model is better at dealing with OOV word than our word-based segmentation.",
        "When WT is \"S\" it is possible that current word is an OOV word and segmented into single character wrongly by the word-based segmenter, so the CT of the character should be kept under such situation.",
        "For more detail about this analysis please refer to (Wang et al., 2008).",

        "OOV recall.",

        "In practice many OOV errors belong to such type.",
        "The rule is quite simple.",
        "When we read a sentence from the result we get by the last step, we also kept the last N sentences in memory, in our system we set N equals to 20.",
        "We do this because adjacent sentences are always relevant and some named entity likely occurs repeatedly in these sentences.",
        "Then, we scan these sentences to find all n-grams (n from 2 to 7) and count their occurrence.",
        "If certain n-gram appears more than a threshold and this n-gram never appears in training corpus, the n-gram will be selected as a word candidate.",
        "Then, we filter these word candidates according to the context entropy (Luo and Song, 2004).",

        "Here, C(ai, w) is the count of concurrence of ai and w .",

        "Now, we define Context Entropy (CE) of a word candidate w as min(LCE(w), RCE(w)) .",
        "The word candidates with CE larger than a predefined threshold will be bind as a whole word in test corpus no matter what tag sequence the segmenter giving it.",
        "If a shorter n-gram is contained in a longer n-gram and both of them satisfy the above condition, the shorter n-gram will be overlooked and the longer n-gram is bind as a whole word."
