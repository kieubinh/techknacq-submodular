        "In the preprocessing, the traditional Chinese characters, punctuation marks and other symbols are first identified.",
        "Instead of training all these symbols with the traditional Chinese characters in an agent-based system, an initial, but rough, segmentation points (SPr) are first inserted to distinguish the symbols and Chinese characters.",
        "For example, for the input sentence shown in Figure 1, segmentation points are first assumed in the sentence as shown in the Figure 2, where '/' indicates the presence of a segmentation point.",
        "This roughly segmented sentence is then subject to an agent-based learning algorithm to have the token identification.",
        "In this stage, a learning algorithm is first devised and implemented.",
        "The algorithm is based on an agent based model which is a computational model for simulating the actions and interactions of an orchestra of autonomous agents in the determination of the possible segmentation points (SPi) (Weiss, 1999; Wooldridge, 2002).",
        "Each agent will make its own decision, i.e., either true or false, for the insertion of \"/\" between the two characters.",
        "Moreover, associated with each decision, there is a vote that reflects the certainty of the decision.",
        "For each training corpus, we have trained more than 200 intelligent agents, each of which exhibits certain aspects of segmentation experience and language behaviors.",
        "In making the final verdict, the system will consult all the related agents by summing up their votes.",
        "For example, as shown in Table 1, the vote that supports there is a segmentation point between the characters fr£ and B is zero while 57.33 votes recommend that there should have no break point.",
        "All these votes are logged for the further post-processing.",
        "agents and the ND of the cor-point.",
        "In our experience, our system is most likely to generate over-segmented sentences.",
        "Several techniques have implemented in our post-processing to merge several tokens into ones.",
        "As shown in the previous steps, we have introduced two main types of segmentation points, SPr and SPt.",
        "In the type SPr, segmentation points are pre-inserted between symbol and Chinese characters.",
        "For example, the token 6Brf will become 6/ Brf in the early beginning.",
        "Obviously, this kind of errors should be identified and the segmentation points should be removed.",
        "Similarly, in SP;, segmentation points are decided by the votes.",
        "Our post-processing is to identify the weak segmentation points which are having tie-break votes.",
        "A normalized difference (ND) is defined for the certainty of the segmentation.",
        "\\Voter – Votef,",
        "The smaller the value of the ND, the lesser the certainty of the segmentation point.",
        "We define the segmentation point as weak if the value of ND is smaller than a threshold.",
        "For a weak segmentation point, the system will consult a dictionary and search for the presence of the token in the dictionary.",
        "The segmentation point will be removed if found.",
        "Otherwise, the system will leave as it is.",
        "As shown in the Table 1, almost all segmentation points with the ND value equal to 1.",
        "This shows that all the votes from the agents support the same decision.",
        "However, it seems that not all agents have the same decision to the last characters pair \" – $!!",
        "\", with ND equal to 0.4.",
        "If the threshold is set to be 0.4, the segmentation point will be re-examined in our post-processing.",
        "Our dictionary is constructed by tokens from the training corpus and the local context of the text that is being segmented.",
        "That is to say, besides the corpus, the tokens from the previous segmented text will also contribute to the construction of the dictionary.",
        "On the other hand, Chinese idiom should be in one token as found in most dictionaries.",
        "However, idiom sometimes would be identified as a short phrase and segmented into several pieces.",
        "In this case, we tend to merge these small fragments into one long token.",
        "On the other hand, different training sources may produce different segmentation rules and, thus, produce different segmentation results.",
        "In the open tracks, some handlers are tailor-made for different testing data.",
        "These include handlers for English characters, date, time, organization.",
