        "Chinese word segmentation and NER are two of the most fundamental problems in Chinese information processing and have attracted more and more attentions.",
        "Many methods have been presented, of which, machine learning methods have obviously competitive advantage in such problems.",
        "Maximum Entropy (Ng and Low, 2005) and CRFs (Hai Zhao et al.",
        "2006, Zhou Junsheng et al.",
        "2006) come to good performance in the former SIGHAN Bakeoff.",
        "We consider both tasks as sequence labeling problem, and a character-based Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) model is applied in this Bakeoff.",
        "Our system used CRF++ package Version 0.49 implemented by Taku Kudo from sourceforge."

      "heading": "2. System Description",
      "text": [
        "The system is mainly based on CRFs, while different strategies are introduced in word segmentation task and NER task.",
        "CRFs are undirected graphical models which are particularly well suited to sequence labeling tasks, such as NER & word segmentation.",
        "In these cases, CRFs are often referred to as linear chain CRFs.",
        "CRFs are criminative models, which allow a richer feature representation and provide more natural modeling.",
        "CRFs define the conditional probability of a state sequence given an input sequence as",
        "Where F is a feature function set over its arguments, is a learned weight for each feature function, and Z is the partition function, which ensures that p is appropriately normalized.",
        "Similar to (Ng and Low, 2005), a Chinese character comes into four different tags, as in Table 1.",
        "Character that begins a multi-character word Character that continues a multi-character word Character that ends a multi-character word",
        "First, the character-window is reduced to (-1, 0, 1) in (a).",
        "Second, feature template (d) is not used.",
        "Instead, original sentences are split into clauses ended with punctuations \" > \", \" Â° \", \" : \" ?",
        "\", \" ; \" and \" !",
        "\".",
        "There are two advantages of this processing: (1) the template is simplified but little performance is lost; (2) shorter sentences make CRFs training quicker.",
        "Third, template (e) is separate it to three items: T(C-1), T(C0) and T(C1), in which five types of the characters are considered: N stands for numbers, D for dates, E for English letters, S for punctuations and C for other characters.",
        "Besides, this feature template does not always contribute to the segmentation result in our experiments, so it will be a tradeoff whether to use it or not according to experiments.",
        "Finally, we use the following feature templates:",
        "We only took part in word segmentation closed track, so no additional corpora, dictionary or linguistic resources are introduced.",
        "Many Chinese NER researches are based on word segmentation and even Part-Of-Speech (POS) tagging.",
        "In fact these steps are not necessary.",
        "The relationship of them is described in Figure 1.",
        "In order to find the effect of different features on the result, some experiments are conducted on these templates, with 90% of the training data provided by The SIGHAN Bakeoff 2007 for training, leaving 10% for testing.",
        "Based on our results, some templates are adjusted as follows.",

        "Character that occurs as a",
        "single-character word",
        "Character",
        "Segmentation",
        "Recognition",
        "In closed track of both MSRA and CITYU, a character-based CRFs model is used in our system.",
        "There two reasons as follows:",
        "First, no word-level information is provided in training data of NER tasks in closed track, so it's hard to perform word segmentation with good accuracy.",
        "Second, we had done some experiments on Chinese NER, and found that character-based method outperformed word segmentation and word segmentation + POS, if only character sequence is given.",
        "Table 2 shows the comparison results.",
        "Feature Level Integrated F-measure",
        "In our NER system, a Chinese character can be labeled as one of four different tags, as in Table 3.",
        "Character not in a NE",
        "It's similar to the standard of The SIGHAN Bakeoff 2007 NER track except for an additional tag \"E\".",
        "Unlike the tag set used in word segmentation task, there is no \"S\" tag for single-character NEs.",
        "This kind of entities is usually surname of a Chinese person.",
        "In this case, the tag \"B\" will handle it as well.",
        "There are actually 3 types of NEs in MSRA and",
        "CITYU corpora: PER, LOC and ORG, so the tag set is further divided into 10 sub tags: B-PER, I-PER, E-PER, BLOC, I-LOC, E-LOC, BORG, I-ORG, E-ORG and O.",
        "The feature template is similar to the one used in word segmentation task except that here a character-window of (-2,-1, 0, 1,2) is applied:",
        "For CRFs, the precision is usually high while recall is low.",
        "To solve this problem, a set of feature templates (only differ in window size, or punctuations) are used to train several different models, and finally achieve a group of results.",
        "Merge them as in Table 4 (for the same Chinese character string in result A and B).",

        "E",
        "Last character of a NE except a",
        "single-character one",
        "With a slight loss of precision, an improvement is achieved on recall rate.",
        "In open track of MSRA, an additional segmentation system is used on the corpora and some NEs are retrieved based on several predefined rules.",
        "It was merged with closed track result to form open track result."
