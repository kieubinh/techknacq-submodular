        "Several promising methods are proposed by previous researchers.",
        "In tradition, the Chinese word segmentation technologies can be categorized into three types, rule-based, machine learning, and hybrid.",
        "Among them, the machine learning-based techniques showed excellent performance in many research studies (Peng et al., 2004; Zhou et al., 2005; Gao et al., 2004).",
        "This method treats the word segmentation problem as a sequence of word classification.",
        "The classifier online assigns either \"boundary\" or \"non-boundary\" label to each word by learning from the large annotated corpora.",
        "Machine learning-based word segmentation method is adopted in the word sequence inference techniques, such as part-of-speech (POS) tagging, phrases chunking (Wu et al., 2006a) and named entity recognition (Wu et al., 2006b).",
        "But there are some cost problems in such machine learning problems, and sometimes choose between word-based and character based is also a dilemma.",
        "In our system, we present a hybrid model for Chinese word segmentation, POS tagging and named entity recognition based on HMM and CRF model.",
        "The core of the model is a directed segmentation graph based on the maximum matching and second-maximum matching model.",
        "In the directed graph, the HMM model and CRF model are combined, the HMM model is used to process the known words (words in system dictionary); CRF model is adopted to process the unknown word, the cost problem can be solved.",
        "Meanwhile, for the CRF model, the character-based CRF model and word-based model are integrated under the framework of the directed segmentation graph, so the integrative CRF model can be more flexible to recognize both the simple and complex Chinese Named Entity with high precision.",

        "The directed graph is composed by the known words from the system dictionary, which are regarded as the candidate word of the segmentation result.",
        "Then some candidate Chinese Named Entity Recognition automata search the directed graph, and find out the candidate Chinese Named Entities into the directed graph based on some generation rules.",
        "Then the CRF is applied to the candidate Chinese Named Entities to determine if they are real Chinese Named Entities that should be added into the directed graph.",
        "During this procedure, the character-based CRF and word-based CRF are respectively applied to the simple and complex Chinese Named Entities recognition.",
        "In the following section, the Chinese word segmentation, POS tagging and Chinese named entity recognition in open track will be mainly discussed.",
        "The maximum matching and second-maximum matching(MMSM) model, which is a segmentation method that keeps the maximum and second-maximum segmentation result from a certain position in a sentence, and store the candidate segmentation results in a directed graph, then some decoding algorithm is adopted to find the best path in the directed graph.",
        "With the MMSM model, almost all the possible segmentation paths and most lexical information can be reserved for further use; little space cost is guaranteed by using the directed graph to store the segmentation paths; the context spaces are extended from single-dimension to multi-dimension.",
        "Conditional random field (CRF) was an extension of both Maximum Entropy Model (MEMs) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) that was firstly introduced by (Lafferty et al., 2001).",
        "CRF defined conditional probability distribution P(Y\\X) of given sequence given input sentence where Y is the \"class label\" sequence and X denotes as the observation word sequence.",
        "A CRF on (X,Y) is specified by a feature vector F of local context and the corresponding feature weight X.",
        "The F can be treated as the combination of state transition and observation value in conventional HMM.",
        "To determine the optimal label sequence, the CRF uses the following equation to estimate the most probability.",
        "Conditional random fields (CRFs) are undirected graphical models trained to maximize a conditional probability (Lafferty et al., 2001).",
        "A linear-chain CRF with parameters A = [A1,z^,--} defines a conditional probability for a state sequence y – y1... yT , given that and input sequence x – Xi.",
        "* • Xt is",
        "Where Zx is the normalization factor that makes the probability of all state sequences sum to one; fk (yt-1, yt, x, t) is ofen a binary-valued feature function and lk is its weight.",
        "The feature functions can measure any aspect of a state transition, yt-1 – » yt, and the entire observation sequence, x, centered at the current time step, t. For example, one feature function might have the value 1 when yt-1 is the state B, yt is the state /, and xt is some Chinese character.",
        "First, we will introduce our Chinese Named Entity Recognition part for the Open track.",
        "Several NER automata are adopted to find out all the candidate NEs in the directed graph, then the CRF model is applied to filter the candidate NEs to check if the specified NE should be added into the graph.",

        "Maximum Entropy can combine different kinds of text information, and solve the problem of the recognition of the more complex former words of the Chinese organization name, so the Maximum Entropy is adopted to confirm the former boundary of ORG.",
        "During the NEs recognition and filtering the word and POS tag as main features and adopt a context window of five words.",
        "Because of the complex construction of the Chinese Named Entity, one single statistical model can not solve simple and complex NER simultaneously, such as the character-based CRF model makes lower recognition accuracy for complex NERs, meanwhile, the word-based CRF model will lose many useful features in processing simple NERs.",

        "At the top of system, word-based CRF is used to recognize the nested LOCs and ORGs.",
        "The character-based model and word based model are integrated into one framework to recognition the NEs with different complexions simultaneously.",
        "The identification results of the bottom-level provide decision support for the highlevel, the limitations of the separated character-based model and word-based model are avoided, and improves recognition accuracy of the system.",
