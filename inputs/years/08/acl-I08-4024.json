        "In this bakeoff, our basic model is based on the framework described in the work of Ratnaparkhi (1996) which was applied for English POS tagging.",
        "The conditional probability model of the framework is called maximum entropy (Jaynes, 1957).",
        "Maximum entropy model is a feature-based, probability model which can include arbitrary number of features that other generative models like N-gram model, hidden Markov model (HMM) (Rabiner, 1989) cannot do.",
        "The probability model can be defined over X * Y, where X is the set of possible histories and Y is the set of allowable futures or classes.",
        "The conditional probability of the model of a history x and a class y is defined as",
        "p,(y|x) = 1Jl .",
        "where X is a parameter which acts as a weight for the feature in the particular history.",
        "The equation (1) states that the conditional probability of the class given the history is the product of the weightings of all features which are active under the consideration of (x, y) pair, normalized over the sum of the products of all the classes.",
        "The normalization constant is determined by the requirement that",
        "Zp*(y I x) = for aU x.",
        "To find the optimized parameters X of the conditional probability is one of the important processes in building the model.",
        "This can be done through a training process.",
        "The parameter estimation algorithm used for training is Improved Iterative Scaling (IIS) (Pietra et al., 1997) in our case.",
        "In training the models for this bakeoff, the training data is given in the form of a sequence of characters (for the tasks of word segmentation and NER) or words (POS tagging) and their classes (tags), the parameters X can be chosen to maximize the likelihood of the training data using p:",
        "But of course, the success of the model depends heavily on the selection of features for a particular task.",
        "This will be described in Section 5.",
        "Chinese Word Segmenter",
        "We concentrated on the word segmentation task in this bakeoff.",
        "For the Chinese word segmenter, it is based on the work that treats Chinese word segmentation as tagging (Xue and Shen, 2003; Ng and Low, 2004).",
        "Given a Chinese sentence, it assigns a so-called boundary tag to each Chinese character in the sentence.",
        "There are four possible boundary tags: S for a character which is a single-character word, B for a character that is the first character of a multi-character word, E for a character that is the last character of a multi-character word and M for a character that is neither the first nor last of a multi-character word.",
        "With these boundary tags, the word segmentation becomes a tagging problem where each character in Chinese sentences is given one of the boundary tags which is the most probable one according to the conditional probability calculated by the model.",
        "And then sequences of characters are converted into sequences of words according to the tags."

        "For the POS tagging task, the tagger is built based on the work of Ratnaparkhi (1996) which was applied for English POS tagging.",
        "Because of the time limitation, we could only try to port our implemented maximum entropy model to this POS tagging task by using the similar feature set (discussed in Section 5) for a word-based POS tagger as in the work of Ng and Low (2004).",
        "By the way, besides porting the model to the POS tagging task, it was even tried in the NER task by using the same feature set (discussed in Section 5) as used for the word segmentation in order to test the performance of the implemented model.",
        "The tagging algorithm for these two tasks is basically the same as used in word segmentation.",
        "Given a word or a character, the model will try to assign the most probable POS or NE tag for the word or character respectively.",
        "Features",
        "To achieve a successful model for any task by using the maximum entropy model, an important step is to select a set of useful features for the task.",
        "In the following, the feature sets used in the tasks of the bakeoff are discussed.",
        "The feature set used in this task is discussed in our previous work (Leong et al., 2007) which is currently the best in our implemented model.",
        "They are the unigram features: C-2, C-1, C0, C1 and C2, bigram features: C_2C_1, C-1C0, CCi, C1C2 and C-1C1where C0 is the current character, Cn (Cn) is the character at the nth position to the right (left) of the current character.",
        "For example, given the character sequence \"tt#^Ll3lii\" (Victoria Harbour), while taking the character \"^IJ\" as Co, then C_2 = \"It\", C id = etc.",
        "The boundary tag (S, B, M or E) feature T-1 is also applied, i.e., the boundary tag assigned to the previous character of C0.",
        "And the last feature WC0: This feature captures the word context in which the current character is found.",
        "It has the format \"W_C0\".",
        "For example, the character \"jflj\" is a character of the word \"it#^J55ll\".",
        "Then this will give the feature WC0 = \"tÂ£##Ji5li",
        "_M\".",
        "For this task, because of the time limitation as mentioned in the previous section, we could only port our implemented model by using a part of the feature set which was used in the word-based tagger discussed in the work of Ng and Low (2004).",
        "The feature set includes: Wn (n = 2 to 2), WnWn+1(n = -2, -1, 0, 1), W.jWi, POS(Wj), POS(Wii), POS(W_2)POS(W_1) where Wrefers to a word, POS refers to the POS assigned to the word and n refers to the position of the current word being considered.",
        "For example, while considering this sentence taken from the POS tagged corpus of CITYU: \"Sli/Ng TOJ/Ac fTKM/Nc E^/Dc mi /Vt\" (Hong Kong S.A.R.",
        "is established), taking \"ff BM\" as W0, then W 2 = \"Si\", WW = E +t\", POS(W.2) = \"Ng\", POS(W_2)POS(W_i) = \"Ac Dc\", etc.",
        "For the NER task, we directly used the same feature set as for the word segmentation basically.",
        "However, because the original NE tagged corpus is presented in two-column format, where the first column consists of the character and the second is a tag, a transformation which is to transform the original corpus to a sentence per line format before collecting the features or other training data is needed.",
        "This transformation actually continues to read the lines from the original corpus, whenever a blank line is found, a sentence of characters with NE tags can be formed.",
        "After that, the features collected are the unigram features: C 2, C i, C0, Ci and C2, bigram features: C 2C i, C iC0, C0Ci, CiC2 and C iCi, NE tag features: T-i, WC0 (this feature captures the NE context in which the current character is found) where Tj refers to the NE tag assigned to the previous character of C0, W refers to the named entity.",
        "So similar to the explanation of features of word segmentation, for example, given the sequence from the NER tagged corpus of CITYU: \" â /N fH/N /B-LOC H /I-LOC A/N\" (One Chinese), while taking the character \"cf\" as C0, then C _2 = \" â \", C _",
        "iCi = \"HUH\", WC0 = \"^H_* \", etc.",
        "For all the experiments conducted, training was done with a feature cutoff of 1."

      "heading": "6. Testing",
      "text": [
        "For word segmentation task, during testing, given a character sequence Ci ... Cn, the trained model will try to assign a boundary tag to each character in the sequence based on the probability of the boundary tag calculated.",
        "Then the sequence of characters is converted into sequence of words according to the tag sequence ti ... tn.",
        "But if each character was just assigned the boundary tag with the highest probability, invalid boundary tag sequences would be produced and wrong word segmentation results would be obtained.",
        "In particular, known words that are in the dictionary of the training corpus are segmented wrongly because of these invalid tag sequences.",
        "In order to correct these, the invalid boundary tag sequences are collected, such as for two-character words, they are \"B B\", \"B S\", \"M S\", \"E E\", etc., for three-character words, they are \"B E S\", \"B M S\", etc., and for four-character words, invalid boundary tag sequences, some post correction to the word segmentation result can be tried.",
        "That is after the model tagger has done the tagging for a Chinese sentence every time, the invalid boundary tag sequences will be searched within the preliminary result given by the tagger.",
        "When the invalid boundary tag sequence is found, the characters corresponding to that invalid boundary tag sequence will be obtained.",
        "After, the word formed by these characters is looked up to see if it is indeed a word in the dictionary, if it is, then the correction is carried out.",
        "Another kind of post correction to the word segmentation result is to make some guessed correction for some invalid boundary tag sequences such as \"B S\", \"S E\", \"B B\", \"E E\", \"B M S\", etc.",
        "That is, whenever those tag sequences are met within the preliminary result given by the model tagger, they will be corrected no matter if there is word in the dictionary formed by the characters corresponding to the invalid boundary tag sequence.",
        "We believe that similar post correction can be applied to the NER task.",
        "For example, if such NE tag sequences \"B-PER N\", \"N I-PER N\", etc.",
        "occur in the result, then the characters corresponding to the invalid NE tag sequence can be obtained again and looked up in the named entity dictionary to see if they really form a named entity.",
        "However, we did not have enough time to adapt this for the NER task finally.",
        "Therefore, no such post correction was applied for the NER task in this bakeoff finally."

        "The run (a) applied only the post correction to the known words that are in the dictionary of the training corpus but are segmented wrongly because of the invalid boundary tag sequences.",
        "The run (b) applied also the guessed post correction for some invalid boundary tag sequences in the results as mentioned in Section 6.",

        "The run (a) used the paramters set which was observed to be the optimal ones for the model in the training phase.",
