        "Among 24 closed and open tracks in this bakeoff, we participated in 23 tracks, except the open NER track of MSRA.",
        "Our systems are ranked 1st in 6 tracks, and get close to the top level in several other tracks.",
        "Recently, Maximum Entropy model(ME) and CRFs (Low et al., 2005)(Tseng et al., 2005) (Hai Zhao et al., 2006) turned out to be promising in natural language processing tracks, and obtain excellent performances on most of the test corpora of Bakeoff 2005 and Bakeoff 2006.",
        "Compared to the generative models, like HMM, the primary advantage of CRFs is that it relaxes the independence assumptions, which makes it able to handle multiple interacting features between observation elements (Wallach et al., 2004).",
        "However, the ME and CRFs emphasize the relation of the basic units of sequence, like the Chinese characters in these tracks.",
        "While, the higher level information, like the relationship of the words is ignored.",
        "From this point of view, the n-gram language model is incorporated in our CRFs based systems in order to cover the word level language information.",
        "Based on several pilot-experimental results, we found that the tagging errors always follow some patterns.",
        "In order to find those error patterns and correct the similar errors, we integrated the TBL postprocessor in our systems.",
        "In addition, extra training data, which is transformed from People Daily Corpus (Shiwen Yu et al., 2000) with some auto-extracted transition rules, is used in each corpus for the open tracks of WS.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "The scheme of our three developed systems are described in section 2, 3 and 4, respectively.",
        "In section 5, evaluation results based on these systems are enumerated and discussed.",

        "To label a Chinese character, we need to define the label tags.",

        "tag = {BUB2,B3,I,E,S} \"Bi,B2,B3,I,E\" represent the first, second, third, continue, and end character positions in a multicharacter word, and \"S\" is the single-character word tag.",

        "In order to integrate multi-model information, we use a log-linear model(Och et al., 2002) to compute the posterior probability:",
        "Pr (W\\C )= paM (W\\C) = exp[J2M=i amhm(W,C)}Â£w> exp[ZM=i amhm(W>,C)} Where W is the word sequence, and C is the character sequence.",

        "The unigram of an OOV word is estimated as:",
        "where p is the minimal value of unigram scores in the language model; l is the length of the OOV word, which is used as a punishment factor to avoid overemphasizing the long OOV words (Xinhao Wang et al., 2006).",
