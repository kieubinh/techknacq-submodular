        "Named Entity Recognition (NER) is one of the most important tasks in NLP, and acts as a critical role in some language processing applications, such as Information Extraction and Integration, Text Classification etc.",
        "Many efforts have been paid to improve the performance of NER.",
        "NER task in Chinese has some differences from in English as follows.",
        "1) There is no space between Chinese characters, which make boundary recognition more difficult.",
        "2) In English, a capitalized letter at the beginning position of a word implies that the word is a part of a named entity.",
        "However, this kind of characteristic does not exist in Chinese.",
        "In the paper, we will focus on two kinds of problems.",
        "1) How to improve the performance of Chinese NER in one corpus, which contains boosting precision rate, recall rate and F-measure rate.",
        "2) How to enhance the adaptability of a Chinese NER system, which means that a system can get a good performance on a testing set which has many differences from the training set.",
        "To solve the first problem, we should select a good model and adjust parameters carefully.",
        "But there is no framework that can solve the second problem completely.",
        "Our goal is to find a way to solve these two problems.",
        "We select a language model to recognize Person names, and two CRFs models are used to recognize Location and Organization separately.",
        "We also try to incorporate a large-scale named entity list into the statistical model, where a heuristic searching method is developed to match the entities in the list quickly and efficiently."

        "Named entities have flexible internal styles and external environments.",
        "Building a good model to describe the condition precisely will have many troubles.",
        "The statistical models we commonly used have some shortcomings, especially when they are adapted to a corpus of new domains or styles.",
        "We try to use an improved searching method to make up the relatively poor adaptability of the statistical models.",
        "The heuristic searching method is more flexible especially in the following two aspects.",
        "1) Abbreviation can be matched.",
        "2) Suffix in location and organization is universal, but it should not be taken in count when we search named entities.",
        "The framework of the algorithm can be briefly described as follows:",
        "1) Building an inverse index using Chinese characters as key term;",
        "2) Using the text as a query to search for entities;",
        "3) When comes terminal condition, a heuristic function is invoked to determine whether the character sequence is an entity;",
        "4) When comes creation condition, a heuristic function is invoked to judge whether a new entity is created;",
        "5) The labeled sequence is output._",
        "One advantage of heuristic searching method is that the heuristic function can be set to fit a special corpus.",
        "The heuristic searching method we used in Bakeoff-4 is as follows:",
        "• Ignoring the suffix key word in Location and Organization names.",
        "For example \"r§]y57Tongfang -^-h]/Corporation\" and \"I^Tj/Tongfang\" will get same score under this heuristic rule.",
        "• Ignoring the Location name as a prefix in an Organization name.",
        "For example, \"US/American IftM/General Motors \" and \"ffiM/General Motors\" will get same score under this heuristic rule",

        "It is easy to be expanded to a corpus of new domain or style.",
        "We only need to add the entities in the new domain into list",
        "Searching method will improve the recall performance remarkably",
        "But the precision will be reduced for the ambiguities, i.e. whether a sequence that matches an entity in the list really constructs an entity in the text.",
        "We will disambiguate it using statistical models.",
        "Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) is an undirected graphical model that encodes a conditional probability distribution using a given set of features.",
        "Currently it is widely used as a discriminate model for sequence labeling:",
        "CRFs is considered to be a very effective model to resolve the issue of sequence labeling for the following characteristics:",
        "Because it uses a non-greedy whole sentence joint labeling method, high accuracy rate can be guaranteed and bias labeling can be avoided.",
        "Any types of features can be integrated in the model flexibly.",
        "Over-fitting can be avoided to some extent by integrating a priori with training data.",

        "1) There may be some key words as suffix, such as: \"TtJ/Shi, tt/Zheng, $J/Hu, Lll/Shan\" etc.",
        "2) Other parts of Location names are always OOV words, such as \"^ftjtt/Dagang Village, ^^PlS/Fuzi Temple\".",
