        "After analyzing the results presented in the first and second Bakeoffs, (Sproat and Emerson, 2003) and (Emerson, 2005), we created a new Chinese word segmentation system named as \"Achilles\" that consists of four modules mainly: Regular expression extractor, dictionary-based Ngram segmentation, CRF-based subword tagging (Zhang et al., 2006), and confidence-based segmentation.",

        "The rule-based regular expression is not shown in the figure because this module interweaves with the other modules.",

        "The function of this module is to recognize numerical, temporal expression and others like product number, telephone number, credit number or alphabets.",
        "For example, 3i rF\"(35,000)\",",
        "\"AH(August)\", \"0774731301\", \"George Bush\".",
        "Dictionary-based N-gram word segmentation is an important module for Achilles.",
        "This module can achieve a very high R-iv, but no OOV detection.",
        "We combined with it the N-gram language model (LM) to solve segmentation ambiguities.",
        "For a given Chinese character sequence, C = coc1c2... cN, the problem of word segmentation can be formalized as finding a word sequence, W = wt0Wt1 wt2... wtM, which satisfies such that",
        "We applied Bayes' law in the above derivation.",
        "Because the word sequence must keep consistent with the character sequence, P(C |W) is expanded to be a multiplication of a Kronecker delta function series, b(u, v), equal to 1 if both arguments are the same and o otherwise.",
        "Equation 1 indicates the process of dictionary-based word segmentation.",
        "We looked up the lexicon to find all the IVs, and evaluated the word sequences with the LMs.",
        "If dictionary-based module recognizes IVs successfully, the subword-based IOB tagging can recognize OOVs.",
        "Before the subword-based tagging, the character-based \"IOB\" tagging approach has been widely used in Chinese word segmentation recently (Xue and Shen, 2003; Peng and McCal-lum, 2004; Tseng et al., 2005).",
        "Under the scheme, each character of a word is labeled as 'B' if it is the first character of a multiple-character word, or 'O' if the character functions as an independent word, or 'I' otherwise.\"",
        "For example, \"^(whole) T|T(Beijing city)\" is labeled as \"£(whole)/O ib(north)/B M(capital)/I T(city)/I\".",
        "We proposed the subword-based tagging (Zhang et al., 2006) to improve the existing character-based tagging.",
        "The subword-based IOB tagging assigns tags to a predefined lexicon subset consisting of the most frequent multiple-character words in addition to single Chinese characters.",
        "If only Chinese characters are used, the subword-based IOB tagging is downgraded into a character-based one.",
        "Taking the same example mentioned above, \"^(whole) ii MTT(Beijing city)\" is labeled as \"£(whole)/O ii jK(Beijing)/B TT(city)/I\" in the subword-based tagging, where \"it jjC(Beijing)/B\" is labeled as one unit.",
        "We used the CRFs approach to train the IOB tagger (Lafferty et al., 2001) on the training data.",
        "We downloaded and used the package \"CRF++\" from the site \"http://www.chasen.org/taku/software.\"",

        "T=totl tM",
        "where we call fk(ti-1, ti, W) bigram feature functions because the features trigger the previous observation ti_1 and current observation ti simultaneously; gk(ti, W), the unigram feature functions because they trigger only current observation ti.",
        "Ak and \\ik are the model parameters corresponding to feature functions fk and gk respectively.",
        "The model parameters were trained by maximizing the log-likelihood of the training data using L-BFGS gradient descent optimization method.",
        "In order to overcome overfitting, a gaussian prior was imposed in the training.",
        "The types of unigram features used in our experiments included the following types:",
        "where W stands for word.",
        "The subscripts are position indicators.",
        "o means the current word; _1, _2, the first or second word to the left; 1, 2, the first or second word to the right.",
        "For the bigram features, we only used the previous and the current observations, t_1to.",
        "As to feature selection, we simply used absolute counts for each feature in the training data.",
        "We defined a cutoff value for each feature type and selected the features with occurrence counts over the cutoff.",
        "A forward-backward algorithm was used in the training and viterbi algorithm was used in the decoding.",
        "Before moving to this step in Figure 1, we produced two segmentation results: the one by the dictionary-based approach and the one by the IOB tagging.",
        "However, neither was perfect.",
        "The dictionary-based segmentation produced results with higher R-ivs but lower R-oovs while the IOB tagging yielded the contrary results.",
        "In this section we introduce a confidence measure approach to combine the two results.",
        "We define a confidence measure, CM(tiob|w), to measure the confidence of the results produced by the IOB tagging by using the results from the dictionary-based segmentation.",
        "The confidence measure comes from two sources: IOB tagging and dictionary-based word segmentation.",
        "Its calculation is defined as:",
        "where tiob is the word w's IOB tag assigned by the IOB tagging; tW, a prior IOB tag determined by the results of the dictionary-based segmentation.",
        "After the dictionary-based word segmentation, the words are re-segmented into subwords by FMM before being fed to IOB tagging.",
        "Each subword is given a prior IOB tag, tw.",
        "CMiob(t|w), a confidence probability derived in the process of IOB tagging, is defined as CMiob(t\\Wi) where the numerator is a sum of all the observation sequences with word wi labeled as t.",
