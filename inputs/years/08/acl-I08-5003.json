        "One of the motivations for organizing a workshop (NERSSEAL-08) focused on named entities (NEs) was that they have a special status in Natural Language Processing (NLP) because they have some properties which other elements of human languages do not have, e.g. they refer to specific things or concepts in the world and are not listed in the grammars or the lexicons.",
        "Identifying and classifying them automatically can help us in processing text because they form a significant portion of the types and tokens occurring in a corpus.",
        "Also, because of their very nature, machine learning techniques have been found to be very useful in identifying them.",
        "In order to use these machine learning techniques, we need corpus annotated with named entities.",
        "In this paper we describe such a corpus developed for five South Asian languages.",
        "These languages are Hindi, Bengali, Oriya, Telugu and Urdu.",
        "This paper also presents an overview of the work done for the IJCNLP workshop on NER for SSEA languages.",
        "The workshop included two tracks.",
        "The first track was for regular research papers, while the second was organized on the lines of a shared task.",
        "Fairly mature named entity recognition systems are now available for European languages (Sang, 2002; Sang and De Meulder, 2003), especially English, and even for East Asian languages (Sassano and Utsuro, 2000).",
        "However, for South and South East Asian languages, the problem of NER is still far from being solved.",
        "Even though we can gain much insight from the methods used for English, there are many issues which make the nature of the problem different for SSEA languages.",
        "For example, these languages do not have capitalization, which is a major feature used by NER systems for European languages.",
        "Another characteristic of these languages is that most of them use scripts of Brahmi origin, which have highly phonetic characteristics that could be utilized for multilingual NER.",
        "For some languages, there are additional issues like word segmentation (e.g. for Thai).",
        "Large gazetteers are not available for most of these languages.",
        "There is also the problem of lack of standardization and spelling variation.",
        "The number of frequently used words (common nouns) which can also be used as names (proper nouns) is very large for, unlike for European languages where a larger proportion of the first names are not used as common words.",
        "For example, 'Smith', 'John', 'Thomas' and 'George' etc.",
        "are almost always used as person names, but 'Anand', 'Vijay', 'Kiran' and even 'Manmohan' can be (more than often) used as common nouns.",
        "And the frequency with which they can be used as common nouns as against person names is more or less unpredictable.",
        "The context might help in disambiguating, but this issue does make the problem much harder than for English.",
        "Among other problems, one example is that ofthe various ways of representing abbreviations.",
        "Because of the alpha-syllabic nature of the SSEA scripts, abbreviation can be expressed through a sequence of letters or syllables.",
        "In the latter case, the syllables are often combined together to form a pseudo-word, e.g. BAjapA (bhaajapaa) for Bharatiya Janata Party or BJP.",
        "But most importantly, there is a serious lack of labeled data for machine learning.",
        "As part of this workshop, we have tried to prepare some data but we will need much more data for really accurate NER systems.",
        "Since most of the South and South East Asian languages are scarce in resources as well as tools, it is very important that good systems for NER be available, because many problems in information extraction and machine translation (among others) are dependent on accurate NER.",
        "The need for a workshop specifically for SSEA languages was felt because the South and South East Asian region has many major and numerous minor languages.",
        "In terms of the number of speakers there are at least four in any list of top ten languages of the world.",
        "For practical reasons, we focus only on the major languages in the workshop (and in this paper).",
        "Most of the major languages belong to two families: Indo-European and Dravidian.",
        "There are a lot of differences among these languages, but there are a lot of similarities too, even across families (Emeneau, 1956; Emeneau, 1980).",
        "For the reasons mentioned above, NER is perhaps more difficult for SSEA languages than for European languages.",
        "For better or for worse, there too many languages and too few resources.",
        "Moreover, these languages are also comparatively less studied by researchers.",
        "However, we can benefit from the similarities across these languages to build multilingual systems so as to reduce the overall cost and effort required.",
        "All the issues mentioned above show that we might need different methods for solving the NER problem for SSEA languages.",
        "However, for comparing the results ofthese different methods, we will need a reasonably good baseline.",
        "A mature system tuned for English but trained on SSEA language data can become such a baseline.",
        "We will describe such a baseline in a later section.",
        "This baseline system has been tested on the data provided for the shared task.",
        "We present the results for all five languages under the settings required for the shared task."

        "For example, the CoNLL 2003 shared taskhad only four tags: persons, locations, organizations and miscellaneous.",
        "On the other hand, MUC-6 has a near ontology for information extraction purposes.",
        "In this (MUC-6) tagset, there are three main kinds of NEs: ENAMEX (persons, locations and organizations), TIMES (time expressions) and NUMEX (number expresssions).",
        "There has been some previous work on NER for SSEA languages (McCallum and Li, 2003; Cucerzan and Yarowsky, 1999), but most ofthe time such work was an offshoot of the work done for European languages.",

        "The annotation guidelines were of two kinds.",
        "One was meant for preparing training data through manual annotation.",
        "The other one was meant for preparing reference data as well as for automatic annotation.",
        "The main guidelines for preparing the training data are as follows:",
        "• Specificity: The most important criterion while deciding whether some expression is a named entity or not is to see whether that expression specifies something definite and identifiable as if by a name or not.",
        "This decision will have to be based on the context.",
        "For example, 'aanand' (in South Asian languages, where there is no capitalization) is not a named entity in 'saba aanand hii aanand hai' ('There is bliss everywhere').",
        "But it is a named entity in 'aanand kaa yaha aakhiri saala hai' ('Anand is in the last year (of his studies)').",
        "Number, Measure and Term may be seen as exceptions (see below).",
        "• Maximal Entity: Only the maximal entities have to be annotated for training data.",
        "Structure of entities will not be annotated by the annotators, even though it has to be learnt by the NER systems.",
        "For example, 'One Hundred Years of Solitude' has to be annotated as one entity.",
        "'One Hundred' is not to be marked as a Number here, nor is 'One Hundred Years' to be made marked as a Measure in this case.",
        "The purpose of this guideline is to make the task of annotation for several languages feasible, given the constraints.",
        "• Ambiguity: In cases where an entity can have two valid tags, the more appropriate one is to be used.",
        "The annotator has to make the decision in such cases.",
        "It is recommended that the annotation be validated by another person, or even more preferably, two different annotators have to work on the same data independently and inconsistencies have to be resolved by an adjudicator.",
        "Abbreviation is an exception to the Ambiguity guideline (see below).",
        "Some other guidelines for specific tags are listed below:",
        "• Abbreviations: All abbreviations have to be marked as Abbreviations, Even though every abbreviation is also some other kind of named entity.",
        "For example, APJ is an Abbreviation, but also a Person.",
        "IBM is also an Organization.",
        "Such ambiguity cannot be resolved from the context because it is due to the (wrong?)",
        "assumption that a named entity can have only one tag.",
        "Multiple annotations were not allowed.",
        "This is an exception to the third guideline above.",
        "• Designation and Title-Person: An entity is a Designation if it represents something formal and official status with certain responsibilities.",
        "If it is just something honorary, then it is a Title-Object.",
        "For example, 'Event Coordinator' or 'Research Assistant' is a Designation, but 'Chakravarti' or 'Mahatma' are Titles.",
        "• Organization and Brand: The distinction between these two has to be made based on the context.",
        "For example, 'Pepsi' could mean an Organization, but it is more likely to mean a Brand.",
        "• Time and Location: Whether something is to be marked as Time or Location or not is to be decided based on the Specificity guideline and the context.",
        "• Number, Measure and Term: These three may not be strictly named entities in the way a person name is.",
        "However, we have included them because they are different from other words of the language.",
        "For problems like machine translation, they can be treated like named entities.",
        "For example, a Term is a word which can be directly translated into some language if we have a dictionary of technical terms.",
        "Once we know a word is a Term, there is likely to be less ambiguity about the intended sense of the word, unlike for other normal words.",
        "The second set of guidelines are different from the first set mainly in one respect: the corpus has to be annotated with not just the maximal NEs, but with all levels of NEs, i.e., nested NEs also have to be marked.",
        "Nested entities were introduced because one of the requirements was that the corpus be useful for building systems which can become parts of a machine translation (MT) system.",
        "Nested entities can be useful for MT systems because, quite often, parts of the entities can need to be translated, while the others can just be transliterated.",
        "An example of a nested named entity is 'Mahatma Gandhi International Hindi University'.",
        "This would be translated in Hindi as mahaatmaa gaandhii antarraashtriya hindii vishvavidyaalaya.",
        "Only 'International' and 'University' are to be translated, while the other words are to be transliterated.",
