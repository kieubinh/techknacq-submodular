        "are location suffixes.",
        "We used binary features corresponding to the lists - whether a given word has a suffix from a particular list.",

        "We have made rule-based identification for 'number', 'measure' and 'time' classes; the accuracies of these classes proves that the rules need to be modified to achieve better accuracy for these classes.",
        "Also the accuracy of the 'organization' class is not high, because amount of organization entities is not sufficient in the training corpus.",
