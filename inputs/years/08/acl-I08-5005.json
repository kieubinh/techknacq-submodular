        "The linguistic methods generally use rules manually written by linguists.",
        "There are several rule based NER systems, containing mainly lexi-calized grammar, gazetteer lists, and list of trigger words, which are capable of providing upto 92% f-measure accuracy for English (McDonald, 1996; Wakao et al., 1996).",
        "Linguistic approach uses hand-crafted rules which need skilled linguistics.",
        "The chief disadvantage of these rule-based techniques is that they require huge experience and grammatical knowledge of the particular language or domain and these systems are not transferable to other languages or domains.",
        "However, given the closer nature of many Indian languages, the cost of adaptation of a resource from one language to another could be quite less (Singh and Surana, 2007).",
        "Various machine learning techniques have also been successfully used for the NER task.",
        "Generally hidden markov model (Bikel et al.,1997), maximum entropy (Borthwick, 1999), conditional random field (Li and Mccallum, 2004) are more popular machine learning techniques used for the purpose of NER.",
        "Hybrid systems have been generally more effective at the task of NER.",
        "Given lesser data and more complex NE classes which were present in NERSSEAL shared task, hybrid systems make more sense.",
        "Srihari et al.",
        "(2000) combines MaxEnt, hidden markov model (HMM) and handcrafted rules to build an NER system.",
        "Though not much work has been done for other South Asian languages, some previous work focuses on NER for Hindi.",

        "They ran their experiment with 5 different languages.",

        "Some of the SSEA languages have agglutinative properties.",
        "For example, a Dravidian language like Telugu has a number of postpositions attached to a stem to form a single word.",
        "An example is:",
        "guruvAraMwo = guruvAraM + wo up to Wednesday = Wednesday + up to",
        "Most of the NERs are suffixed with several different postpositions, which increase the number of distinct words in the corpus.",
        "This in turn affects the machine learning process.",
        "All the five languages have scripts without graphical cues like capitalization, which could act as an important indicator for NER.",
        "For a language like English, the NER system can exploit this feature to its advantage.",
        "One of the properties of the named entities in these languages is the high overlap between common names and proper names.",
        "For instance Kamal (in Hindi) can mean 'lotus', which is not a named entity, but it can also be a person's name, in which case, it is a named entity.",
        "Among the named entities themselves, there is ambiguity between a location name Bangalore ek badzA shaher heI (Bangalore is a big city) or a person's surname 'M.",
        "Bangalore shikshak heT (M. Bangalore is a teacher).",
        "For English, the available tools like POS (Part of Speech) tagger can be used to provide features for machine learning.",
        "This is not very helpful for SSEA languages because the accuracy for noun and proper noun tags is quite low (PVS and G., 2006) Hence, features based on POS tags cannot be used for NER for these languages.",
        "To illustrate this difficulty, we conducted the following experiment.",
        "A POS tagger (described in PVS & G.,2006) was run on the Hindi test data.",
        "The data had 544 tokens with NEL, NEP, NEO tags.",
        "The POS tagger should have given the NNP (proper noun) tag for all those named entities.",
        "However the tagger was able to tag only 80 tokens accurately.",
        "This meant that only 14.7% of the named entities were correctly recognized.",
        "One other important language related issue is the variation in the spellings of proper names.",
        "For instance the same name Shri Ram Dixit can be written as Sri.",
        "Ram Dixit, Shree Ram Dixit, Sh.",
        "R. Dixit and so on.",
        "This increases the number of tokens to be learnt by the machine and would perhaps also require a higher level task like co-reference resolution.",
        "Named entities of Location (NEL) or Person (NEP) will share certain common suffixes, which can be exploited by the learning algorthm.",
        "For instance, in Hindi, -pur (Rampur, Manipur) or -giri (Devgiri) are suffixes that will appear in the named entities for Location.",
        "Similarly, there are suffixes like -swamy (Ramaswamy, Krishnaswamy) or -deva (Vasudeva, Mahadeva) which can be commonly found in named entities for person.",
        "These suffixes are cues for some of the named entities in the SSEA languages.",
        "A NER system can be rule-based, statistical or hybrid.",
        "A rule-based NER system uses handwritten rules to tag a corpus with named entities.",
        "A statistical NER system learns the probabilities of named entities using training data, whereas hybrid systems use both.",
        "Developing rule-based taggers for NER can be cumbersome as it is a language specific process.",
        "Statistical taggers require large amount of annotated data (the more the merrier) to train.",
        "Our system is a hybrid NER tagger which first uses Conditional Random Fields (CRF) as a machine learning technique followed by some rule based postprocessing.",
        "We treat the named entity recognition problem as a sequential token-based tagging problem.",
        "According to Lafferty et.",

        "We can observe from the results that the maximal F-measure for Telugu is very low when compared to lexical F-measure and nested F-measure.",
        "The reason is that the test data of Telugu contains a large number of long named entities (around 6 words), which in turn contain around 4 - 5 nested named entities.",
        "Our system was able to tag nested named entities correctly unlike maximal named entity.",
        "We can also observe that the maximal F-measure for Telugu is very low when compared to other languages.",
        "This is because Telugu test data has very few known words.",
        "Urdu results are comparatively low chiefly because gazetteers for numbers and measures were unavailable.",
        "The amount of annotated corpus available for Hindi was substantially more.",
        "This should have ideally resulted in better results for Hindi with the machine learning approach.",
        "But, the results were only marginally better than other languages.",
        "A major reason for this was that a very high percentage (44%) of tags in Hindi were NETE.",
        "The tagset gives examples like 'Horticulture', 'Conditional Random Fields' for the tag NETE.",
        "It has also been mentioned that even manual annotation is harder for NETE as it is domain specific.",
        "This affected the overall results for Hindi because the performance for NETE was low (Table 3).",
        "Also, the F-measures of NEN, NETI, and NEM could have been higher because they are relatively closed classes.",
        "However, certain NEN can be ambiguous (Example: eka is a NEN for 'one' in Hindi, but in a different context it can be a non-number.",
        "For instance eka-doosra is Hindi for 'each other').",
        "In a language like Telugu, NENs will appear as inflected words.",
        "For example 2001lo, guru-vaaramto."
