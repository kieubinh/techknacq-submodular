        "NER can be treated as a two step process Challenges in named entity recognition.• identification of proper nouns.",
        "• classification of these identified proper nouns.",
        "Many named entities (NEs) occur rarely in corpus if at all.",
        "Ambiguity of NEs.",
        "Ex Washington can be a person's name or location.",
        "There are many ways of mentioning the same NE.",
        "Ex: Mahatma Gandhi, M.K.Gandhi, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, Gandhi all refer to the same person.",
        "New Jersey, NJ both refer to the same location.",
        "In English, the problem of identifying NEs is solved to some extent by using the capitalization feature.",
        "Most of the named entities begin with a capital letter which is a discriminating feature for classifying a token as named entity.",
        "In addition to the above challenges, the complexity of Indian Languages pose few more problems.",
        "In case of Indian languages there is no concept of capitalization.",
        "Ex: The person name Y.S.R (in english) is represented as ysr in the Indian Languages.",
        "Agglutinative property of the Indian Languages makes the identification more difficult.",
        "For example: hyderabad, hyderabad ki, hyderabadki, hyder-abadlo, hyderabad ni, hyderabad ko etc .. all refer to the place Hyderabad.",
        "where lo, ki, ni are all postpostion markers in Telugu and ko is a postposition marker in Hindi.",
        "There are many ways of representing acronyms.",
        "The letters in acronyms could be the English alphabet or the native alphabet.",
        "Ex: B.J.P and BaJaPa both are acronyms of Bharatiya Janata Party.",
        "Indian Languages lack particular standard for forming acronyms.",
        "Due to these wide variations and the agglutinative nature of Indian languages, probabilistic graphical models result in very less recall.",
        "If we are able to identify the presence of a named entity with a fairly good amount of accuracy, classification then can be done efficiently.",
        "But, when the machine fails to identify the presence of named entities, there is no chance of entity classification because we miss many of the named entities (less recall which results in less F-measure,F^=1).",
        "So we focus mainly on the ways to improve the recall of the system.",
        "Also, Indian Languages have a relatively free word order, i.e. the words (named entities) can occupy any place in the sentence.",
        "This change in the word position is compensated using case markers."

        "The general label sequence l1n has the highest probability of occuring for the word sequence W1n among all possible label sequences, that is",
        "We followed the IOB tagging scheme (Ramshaw and Marcus, 995) for all the three languages (English, Hindi and Telugu).",
        "In this scheme each line contains a word at the beginning followed by its tag.",
        "The tag encodes the type of named entity and whether the word is in the beginning or inside the NE.",

        "Words tagged with O are outside of named entities and the I-XXX tag is used for words inside a named entity of type XXX.",

        "English can be built with less amount of data when we use character based models and for high entropy languages large amount of training data is necessary to build a considerably good NER.",
        "We are able to achieve an F-measure (49.62 for Telugu and 45.07 for Hindi) even without any extra features like regular expressions and gazetteer information.",
        "The character based n-gram models have worked well even with the discriminative models.",

        "We have not used any of the language dependent resources and any binary features.",
        "To improve the efficiency of the system we plan to experiment with language specific resources like Part Of Speech (POS) Taggers, Chun-kers, Morphological analyzers.. etc and also include some regular expressions and gazetteer information.",
