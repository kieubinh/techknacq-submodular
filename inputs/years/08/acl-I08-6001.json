        "We explore the effects of language relatedness within a multilingual information retrieval (IR) framework which can be deployed to virtually any language, focusing specifically on Indo-European versus Semitic languages.",
        "The Semitic languages present unique challenges to IR for a number of reasons, so we set out to answer the question of whether cross-language IR for Semitic languages can be boosted by manipulation of the training data (which, in our framework, includes multilingual parallel text, some of which is morphologically analyzed).",
        "We attempted three measures to achieve this: first, the inclusion of genetically related (i.e., other Semitic) languages in the training data; second, the inclusion of non-related languages sharing the same script, and third, the inclusion of morphological analysis for Semitic languages.",
        "We find that language relatedness is a definite factor in boosting IR precision; script similarity can probably be ruled out as a factor; and morphological analysis can be helpful, but - perhaps paradoxically - not necessarily to the languages which are subjected to morphological analysis."

        "In this paper, we consider how related languages fit into a general framework developed for multilingual cross-language information retrieval (CLIR).",
        "Although this framework can deal with virtually any language, there are some special considerations which make related languages more interesting for exploration.",
        "Taking one example, Semitic languages are distinguished by their complex morphology, a characteristic which presents challenges to an information retrieval model in which terms (usually, separated by white space or punctuation) are implicitly treated as individual units of meaning.",
        "We consider three possible methods for investigating the phenomena.",
        "In all cases, we keep the overall framework the same but simply make changes to the training data.",
        "One method we consider is to augment the training data with text from related languages; we compare results obtained from using Semitic languages with those obtained when non-Semitic languages are used.",
        "The other two relate to morphological analysis: the second is to replace inflected forms (in just one language, Arabic) with just the root in the training data; and the third is to remove vowels (again in just one language, Hebrew).",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes our general framework, which is a standard one used for CLIR.",
        "At a high level, section 3 outlines some of the challenges Semitic languages present within the context of our approach.",
        "In section 4, we compare results from using a number of different combinations of training data with the same test data.",

      "heading": "2. The Framework 2.1 General description",
      "text": [
        "The framework that we use for IR is multilingual Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) as described by Berry et al.",
        "(1994:21, and used by Landauer and Littman (1990) and Young (1994).",
        "A number of different approaches to CLIR have been proposed; generally, they rely either on the use of a parallel corpus for training, or translation of the IR query.",
        "Either or both of these methods can be based on the use of dictionaries, although that is not the approach that we use.",
        "In the standard multilingual LSA framework, a term-by-document matrix is formed from a parallel aligned corpus.",
        "Each 'document' consists of the concatenation of all the languages, so terms from all languages will appear in any given document.",
        "Thus, if there are K languages, N documents (each of which is translated into each of the K languages), and T distinct linguistic terms across all languages, then the term-by-document matrix is of dimensions T by N. Each cell in the matrix represents a weighted frequency of a particular term t (in any language) in a particular document n. The weighting scheme we use is a standard log-entropy scheme in which the weighted frequency xtn of a particular term t in a particular document n is given where F is the raw frequency of t in n, and Ht is a measure of the entropy of the term across all documents.",
        "The last term in the expression above, log2 (N), is the maximum entropy that any term can have in the corpus, and therefore (1 + Ht / log2(N)) is 1 for the most distinctive terms in the corpus, 0 for those which are least distinctive.",
        "The log-entropy weighting scheme has been shown to outperform other schemes such as tf-idf in LSA-based retrieval (see for example Dumais 1991).",
        "The sparse term-by-document matrix is subjected to singular value decomposition (SVD), and a reduced non-sparse matrix is output.",
        "Generally, we used the output corresponding to the top 300 singular values in our experiments.",
        "To evaluate the similarity of unseen queries or documents (those not in the training set) to one another, these documents are tokenized, the weighted frequencies are calculated in the same way as they were for the training set, and the results are multiplied by the matrices output by the SVD to project the unseen queries/documents into a 'semantic space', assigning (in our case) 300-dimensional vectors to each document.",
        "Again, our approach to measuring the similarity of one document to another is a standard one: we calculate the cosine between the respective vectors.",
        "For CLIR, the main advantages of an approach like LSA are that it is by now quite wellunderstood; the underlying algorithms remain constant regardless of which languages are being compared; and there is wide scope to use different sets of training data, providing they exist in parallel corpora.",
        "LSA is thus a highly generic approach to CLIR: since it relies only on the ability to tokenize text at the boundaries between words, or more generally semantic units, it can be generalized to virtually all languages.",
        "For our experiments, the training and test data were taken from the Bible and Quran respectively.",
        "As training data, the Bible lends itself extremely well to multilingual LSA.",
        "It is highly available in multiple languages1(over 80 parallel translations in 50 languages, mostly public-domain, are available from a single website, www.unboundbible.org); and a very fine-grained alignment is possible (by verse) (Resnik et al. 1999, Chew and Abdelali 2007).",
        "Many purpose-built parallel corpora are biased towards particular language groups (for example, the European Union funds work in CLIR, but it tends to be biased towards European languages - for example, see Peters 2001).",
        "This is not as true of the Bible, and the fact that it covers a wider range of languages is a reflection of the reasons it was translated in the first place.",
        "The question which is most commonly raised about use of the Bible in this way is whether its coverage of vocabulary from other domains is sufficient to allow it to be used as training data for most applications.",
        "Based on a variety of experiments we have carried out (see for example Chew et al.",
        "forthcoming), we believe this need not always be a drawback - it depends largely on the intended application.",
        "However, it is beyond our scope to address this in detail here; it is sufficient to note that for the experiments we describe in this paper, we were able to achieve perfectly respectable CLIR results using the Bible as the training data.",
        "As test data, we used the 114 suras (chapters) of the Quran, which has also been translated into a wide variety of languages.",
        "Clearly, both training and test data have to be available in multiple languages to allow the effectiveness of CLIR to be measured in a meaningful way.",
        "For the experiments reported in this paper, we limited the testing languages to Arabic, English, French, Russian and Spanish (the respective abbreviations AR, EN, FR, RU and ES are used hereafter).",
        "The test data thus amounted to 570 (114 x 5) documents: a relatively small set, but large enough to achieve statistically significant results for our purposes, as will be shown.",
        "In all tests described in this paper, we use the same test set: thus, although the test documents all come from a single domain, it is reasonable to suppose that the comparative results can be generalized to other domains.",
        "The complete list of languages used for both testing and training is given in Table 1.",
        "We tokenized each of the 570 test documents, applying the weighting scheme described above to obtain a vector of weighted frequencies of each term in the document, then multiplying that vector by U x S-1, also as described above.",
        "The result was a set of projected document vectors in the 300-dimensional LSA space.",
        "For some of our experiments, we used a light stemmer for Arabic (Darwish 2002) to replace inflected forms in the training data with citation forms.",
        "It is commonly accepted that morphology improves IR (Abdou et al.",
        "2005, Lavie et al.",
        "2004, Larkey et al.",
        "2002, Oard and Gey 2002), and it will be seen that our results generally confirm this.",
        "For Hebrew, we used the Westminster Leningrad Codex in the training data.",
        "Since this is available for download either with vowels or without vowels, no morphological preprocessing was required in this case; we simply substituted one version for the other in the training data when necessary.",
        "Various measurements are used for evaluating IR systems performance (Van Rijsbergen 1979).",
        "However, since the aim of our experiments is to assess whether we could identify the correct translation for a given document among a set of possibilities in another language (i.e., given the language of the query and the language of the results), we selected 'precision at 1 document' as our preferred metric.",
        "This metric represents the proportion of cases, on average, where the translation was retrieved first.",
        "Challenges of Semitic languages",
        "The features which make Semitic languages challenging for information retrieval are generally fairly well understood: it is probably fair to say that chief among them is their complex morphology (for example, ambiguity resulting from diacri-tization, root-and-pattern alternations, and the use of infix morphemes as described in Habash 2004).",

        "• clarifying what effect morphological analysis of the training data has on CLIR precision;",
        "• highlighting the effect on CLIR precision of adding more languages in training;",
        "• illustrating what the impact is of adding a partial translation (text in one language which is",
        "only partially parallel with the texts in the other languages) We choose Arabic as the language of focus in our experiment; specifically for these experiments, we intended to reveal the effect of adding languages from the same group (Semitic) compared with that of adding languages of different groups.",
        "First, we present results in Table 3 which confirm that morphological analysis of the training data improves CLIR performance.__",
        "An important point to note first is that CLIR precision is generally much lower for pairs including Arabic than it is elsewhere, lending support to our assertion above that Arabic and other Semitic languages present special challenges in information retrieval.",
        "It also emerges from Table 3 that when morphological analysis of Arabic was added, the overall average precisions increased from 0.677 to 0.707, a highly significant increase (p= 6.7 X 10-8).",

        "However, it is interesting that the net benefit of adding morphological analysis - and just to Arabic within the training data - was more or less confined to pairs of non-Semitic languages.",

        "Average precision for pairs including Arabic increased from 0.476 to 0.528, an increase which was significant (p « 7.33 X 10-4), but for other pairs the change was insignificant.",
        "Since the Arabic text in training did not include vowels, we believe that the exclusion of vowels from Hebrew placed the two languages on a more common footing, allowing LSA, for example, to make associations between Hebrew and Arabic roots which otherwise might not have been made.",
        "Although Hebrew and Arabic do not always share common stems, it can be seen from Table 2 that the type/token statistics of Hebrew (without vowels) and Arabic are very similar.",

        "Generally, these results confirm the finding of Chew and Abdelali (2007) about adding more languages; doing so enhances the ability to identify translations across language boundaries.",
        "Across the board (for Arabic and other languages), the increase in precision gained by adding Afrikaans, Czech, Danish, Dutch and Hungarian is highly significant (compared to the part of Table 5 which deals with Japanese, overall average precision increased from 0.680 to 0.739, with p « 1.17 X 10-11; for cross-language-group retrieval, from 0.485 to 0.537, with p « 9.31 X 10-4; for pairs within IE, from 0.789 to 0.853 with p « 2.81 X 10-11).",

        "Based on our results, it appears that although clear genetic relationships exist between certain languages in our training data, it was less possible than we had anticipated to leverage this to our advantage.",
        "We had expected, for example, that by including multiple Semitic languages in the training data within an LSA framework, we would have been able to improve cross-language information retrieval results specifically for Arabic.",
        "Perhaps surprisingly, the greatest benefit of including additional Semitic languages in the training data is most consistently to non-Semitic languages.",
        "A clear observation is that any additional languages in training are generally beneficial, and the benefit of additional languages can be considerably greater than the benefits of linguistic preprocessing (such as morphological analysis).",
        "Secondly, it is not necessarily the case that cross-language retrieval with Arabic is helped most by including other Semitic languages, despite the genetic relationship.",
        "Finally, as we expected, we were able to rule out script similarity (e.g. between Persian and Arabic) as a factor which might improve precision.",
        "Our results appear to demonstrate clearly that language relatedness is much more important in the training data than use of the same script.",
        "Finally, to improve cross-language retrieval with Arabic - the most difficult case in the languages we tested - we attempted to 'prime' the training data by including Arabic morphological analysis.",
        "This did lead to a statistically significant improvement overall in CLIR, but - perhaps paradoxically - the improvement specifically for cross-language retrieval with Arabic was negligible in most cases.",
        "The only two measures which were successful in boosting precision for Arabic significantly were (1) the inclusion of Modern Hebrew in the training data; and (2) the elimination of vowels in the Ancient Hebrew training data - both measures which would have placed the training data for the two Semitic languages (Arabic and Hebrew) on a more common statistical footing.",
        "These results appear to confirm our hypothesis that there is value, within the current framework, of 'pairing' genetically related languages in the training data.",
        "In short, language relatedness does matter in cross-language information retrieval."
