        "Parallel Named Entity (NE) pairs are important resources in several NLP tasks, from supporting Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval (CLIR) systems, to improving Machine Translation (MT) systems.",
        "In addition, such pairs may also be used for developing transliteration systems, if they are transliterations of each other.",
        "Transliteration of a name, for the purpose of this work, is defined as its transcription in a different language, preserving the phonetics, perhaps in a different orthography [Knight and Graehl, 1997].",
        "While traditional transliteration systems have relied on hand-crafted linguistic rules, more recently, statistical machine learning techniques have been shown to be effective in transliteration tasks [Jung et al., 2000] [Ab-dulJaleel and Larkey, 2003] [Virga and Kudhan-pur , 2003] [Haizhou et al., 2004].",
        "However, such data-driven approaches require significant amounts of training data, namely pairs of names in two different languages, possibly in different orthography, referred to as transliteration pairs, which are not readily available in many resource-poor languages.",
        "It is important to note at this point, that NEs are found typically in news corpora in any given language.",
        "In addition, news articles covering the same event in two different languages may reasonably be expected to contain the same NEs in the respective languages.",
        "The perpetual availability of news corpora in the world's languages, points to the promise of mining transliteration pairs endlessly, provided an effective identification of such NEs in specific languages and pairing them appropriately, could be devised.",
        "Recently, [Klementiev and Roth, 2006] outlined an approach by leveraging the availability of article-aligned news corpora between English and Russian, and tools in English, for discovering transliteration pairs between the two languages, and progressively refining the discovery process.",
        "In this paper, we adopt their basic methodology, but we focus on 3 different issues:",
        "1. mining comparable corpora for NE pairs, leveraging a well trained classifier,",
        "2. calibrating the performance of this mining framework, systematically under different parameters for mining, and,",
        "3. uncovering further research issues in mining NE pairs between English and an Indian language, Tamil.",

        "They present a methodology to automatically discover parallel NE transliteration pairs between English and Russian, leveraging the availability of a good-quality Named Entity Recognizer (NER) in English, and article-aligned bilingual comparable corpora, in English and Russian.",
        "The key idea of their approach is to extract all NEs in English, and identify a set of potential transliteration pairs in Russian for these NEs using a simple classifier trained on a small seed corpus, and re-ranking the identified pairs using the similarity between the frequency distributions of the NEs in the comparable corpora.",
        "Once re-ranked, the candidate pairs, whose scores are above a threshold are used to retrain the classifier, and the process is repeated to make the discovery process more effective.",
        "To discriminate transliteration pairs from other content words, a simple perceptron-based linear classifier, which is trained on n-gram features extracted from a small seed list of NE pairs, is employed leveraging the fact that transliteration relies on approximately monotonic alignment between the names in two languages.",
        "The potential transliteration pairs identified by this classifier are subsequently re-ranked using a Discrete Fourier Transform based similarity metric, computed based on the frequency of words of the candidate pair, found in the article-aligned comparable corpora.",
        "For the frequency analysis, equivalence classes of the words are formed, using a common prefix of 5 characters, to account for the rich morphology of Russian language.",
        "The representative prefix of each of the classes are used for classification.",
        "Finally, the high scoring pairs of words are used to retrain the perceptron-based linear classifier, to improve the quality of the subsequent rounds.",

        "We adopt the basic methodology presented in [Klementiev and Roth, 2006], but we focus on three specific issues described in the introduction.",
        "We start with comparable corpora in English and Tamil, similar in size to that used in [Klementiev and Roth, 2006], and using the English side of this corpora, first, we extract all the NEs that occur more than a given threshold parameter, Fe, using a standard NER tool.",
        "The higher the threshold is, the more will be the evidence for legitimate transliteration pairs, in the comparable corpora, which may be captured by the mining methodology.",
        "The extracted list of NEs provides the set of NEs in English, for which we mine for transliteration pairs from the Tamil side of the comparable corpora.",
        "We need to identify all NEs in the Tamil side of the corpora, in order to appropriately pair-up with English NEs.",
        "However, given that there is no publicly available NER tool in Tamil (as the case may be in many resource-poor languages) we start with an assumption that all words found in the Tamil corpus are potentially NEs.",
        "However, since Tamil is a highly morphologically inflected language, the same NE may occur in its various inflected forms in the Tamil side of the corpora; hence, we collect those words with the same prefix (of fixed size) into a single bucket, called equivalence class, and consider a representative prefix, referred to as signature of the collection for comparison.",
        "The assumption here is that the common prefix would stand for a Tamil NE, and all the members of the equivalence class are the various inflected forms of the NE.",
        "We use such a signature to classify a Tamil word as potential transliteration of an English word.",
        "Again, we consider only those signatures that have occurred more than a threshold parameter, Ft, in the Tamil side of the comparable corpora, in order to strengthen support for a meaningful similarity in their frequency of occurrence.",
        "We used a linear Support Vector Machine classifier (details given in a later section) trained on a sizable seed corpus of transliterations between English and Tamil, and use it to identify potential Tamil signatures with any of the NEs extracted from the English side.",
        "We try to match each of the NEs extracted from the English side, to every signature from the Tamil side, and produce an ordered list of Tamil signatures that may be potential transliterations for a given English NE.",
        "Every Tamil signature, thus, would get a score, which is used to rank the signatures in the decreasing order of similarity.",
        "Subsequently, we consider only those above a certain threshold for analysis, and in addition, consider only the top-n candidates.",
        "Since a number of such transliteration candidates are culled from the Tamil corpus for a given NE in English, we further cull out unlikely candidates, by re-ranking them using frequency cues from the aligned comparable corpora.",
        "For this, we start with the hypothesis, that the NEs will have similar normalized frequency distributions with respect to time, in the two corpora.",
        "Given that the news corpora are expected to contain same names in similar time periods in the two different languages, the frequency distribution of words in the two languages provides a strong clue about possible transliteration pairs; however, such potential pairs might also include other content words, such as,",
        "Gfffrm^isiSlfflfDil (soshaliSt), «aj«n-Drr« (kavanamaa-",
        "ka), GffiLu^ (keetpathu), etc., which are common nouns, adjectives or even adverbs and verbs.",
        "On the other hand, function words are expected to be uniformly distributed in the corpus, and hence may not have high variability like content words.",
        "Note that the NEs in English are not usually inflected.",
        "Since Tamil NEs usually have inflections, the frequency of occurrence of a NE in Tamil must be normalized across all forms, to make it reasonably comparable to the frequency of the corresponding English NE.",
        "This was taken care of by considering the signature and its equivalence class.",
        "Hence the frequency of occurrence of a NE (i.e., its signature) in Tamil is the sum of frequencies of all members in its equivalence class.",
        "For identifying the names between the languages, we first create a frequency distribution of every word in English and Tamil, by creating temporal bins of specific duration, covering the entire timeline of the corpus.",
        "The frequency is calculated as the number of occurrences of each signature in the bin interval.",
        "Once the frequency distributions are formed, they are normalized for every signature.",
        "Given the normalized frequencies, two words are considered to have same (or, similar) pattern of occurrence in the corpus, if the normalized frequency vectors of the two words are the same (or, close within a threshold).",
        "Figure 1 shows the frequency of the word Abishek, and its Tamil version, ^dlGa^a (apishek) as a frequency plot, where a high correlation between the frequencies can be observed.",
        "Hence, to refine the quality of the classifier output, we re-rank the list of candidates, using the distance between the frequency vectors of the English NE, and the Tamil candidate signature.",
        "This step moves up those signatures that have similar patterns of occurrence, and moves down those that do not.",
        "It is likely that such frequency cues from the comparable corpora will make the quality of matched transliteration pairs better, yielding better mined data."

        "In this section, we present the experimental setup and the data that we used for mining transliteration pairs from comparable corpora in two languages: English and the Indian language, Tamil.",
        "We evaluate and present the effectiveness of the methodology in extracting NE pairs, between these languages, under various parameters.",
        "We used a set of news articles from the New Indian Express (in English) and Dinamani (in Tamil) roughly covering similar events in English and Tamil respective, and covering a period of about 8 months, between January and August of 2007.",
        "The articles were verified to contain similar set of NEs, though only a fraction of them are expected to be legitimate transliteration pairs.",
        "Others related NEs could be translations, for example, chief minister in English vs (ipps06iirr (muthalvar) in Tamil, abbreviation which are not usually transliterated but spelled out , for example, ICC in English, and (aicici) in Tamil, or co-references , for example, New Delhi in English, and 606\\51 (puthu thilli) in Tamil.",
        "While the number of articles used were roughly the same (~2,400), the number of words in Tamil were only about 70% of that in English.",
        "This is partially due to the fact Tamil is a highly agglutinative language, where various affixes (prefixes and suffixes of other content words) stand for function words and prepositions in English, thus do not contribute to the word count.",
        "Further, since our focus is on mining names, we expect the same NEs to be covered in both the corpora, and hence we do not expect a severe impact on mining.",
        "From the above corpora, we first extracted all the NEs from the English side, using the Stanford NER tool [Finkel et al., 2005].",
        "No multiword expressions were considered for this experiment.",
        "Also, only those NEs that have a frequency count of more than a threshold value of FE were considered, in order to avoid unusual names that are hard to identify in the comparable corpora.",
        "Thus, we extracted from the above corpora, only a subset of NEs found in the English side to be matched with their potential transliteration pairs; for example, for a parameter setting of FE to 10, we extract only 274 legitimate NEs.",
        "From the Tamil side of the corpora, we extracted all words, and grouped them in to equivalence classes, by considering a prefix of 5 characters.",
        "That is, all words that share the same 5 characters were considered to be morphological variations of the same root word or NE in Tamil.",
        "After they were grouped, the longest common prefix of the group is extracted, and is used as the signature of the equivalence class.",
        "It should be noted here that though the number of unique words in the corpus is about 46,503, the number of equivalence classes to be considered changes depending on the filtering threshold that we use in the Tamil side.",
        "For example, at a threshold (FT) value of 1, the number of equivalence classes is 14,101.",
        "It changes to 4,612 at a threshold (FT) value of 5, to 2,888 at a threshold (FT) value of 10 and to 1779 at a threshold (FT) value of 20.",
        "However, their signature (i.e., longest common prefix) sizes ranged from 5 to 13 characters.",

        "After the classifier is trained on the seed corpus of hand crafted transliteration pairs, during the mining phase, it compares every English NE extracted from the English corpus, to every signature from the Tamil corpus.",
        "While classifier provided ranked list of all the signatures from Tamil side, we consider only the top-30 signatures (and the words in the equivalence classes) for subsequent steps of our methodology.",
        "We hand-verified a random sample of about 100 NEs from English side, and report in Table 5, the fraction of the English NEs for which we found at least one legitimate transliteration in the top-30 candidates (for example, the recall of the classifier is 0.56, in identifying a right signature in the top-30 candidates, when the threshold Fe is 10 & FT is1).",
        "It is interesting to note that as the two threshold factors are increased, the number of NEs extracted from the English side decreases (as expected), and the average number of positive classifications per English NE reduces (as shown in Table 2), considering all NEs.",
        "This makes sense as the classifier for identifying potential transliterations is trained with sizable corpora and is hence accurate; but, as the thresholds increase, it has less data to work with, and possibly a fraction of legitimate transliterations also gets filtered with noise.",

        "First, it should be noted that the recalls are the same for both the steps, since Frequency Analysis step merely rearranges the output of the Classification step.",
        "Second, the recall figures drop, as more filtering is applied to the NEs on both sides.",
        "This trend makes sense, since the classifier gets less data to work with, as more legitimate words are filtered out with noise.",
        "Third, as can be expected, MRRpure is less than the MRRfuzzy at every step of the mining process.",
        "Fourth, we see that the MRRpure and the MRRfuzzy improve between the two mining steps, indicating that the time-series analysis has, in general, made the output better.",
        "Finally, we find that the MRRpure and the MRRfuzzy keep dropping with increased filtering of English NEs and Tamil signatures based on their frequency, in both the classification and frequency analysis steps.",
        "The fall of the MRRs after the classification steps is due to the fact that the classifier has less and less data with the increasing threshold, and hence some legitimate transliterations may be filtered out as noise.",
        "However, the frequency analysis step critically depends on availability of sufficient words from the Tamil side for similarity testing.",
        "In frequency analysis step, the fall of MRRs from threshold 5 to 10 is 0.0134 on MRRfuzzyand 0.0035 on MRRpure.",
        "This fall is comparatively less to the fall of MRRs from threshold 10 to 20 which is 0.074 on MRRfuzzy and 0.0715 on MRRpure.",
        "This may be due to the fact that the number of legitimate transliterations filtered out from threshold 5 to 10 is less when compared to the number of legitimate transliterations filtered out from threshold 10 to 20.",
        "These results show that with less number of words filtered, it can get reasonable recall and MRR values.",
        "More profiling experiments may be needed to validate this claim.",
        "In this paper, we outline our experience in mining parallel NEs between English and Tamil, in an approach similar to the one discussed in [Klemen-tiev and Roth, 2006].",
        "Over and above, we made parameter choices, and some procedural modifications to bridge the underspecified methodology given in the above work.",
        "While the results are promising, we find several issues that need further research.",
        "We outline some of them below:",
        "Table 7 shows a signature that offers little help in distinguishing a set of words.",
        "Both the words, 03=657-63)657- (cennai) and morphological variations of (Slaw (cen), share the same 5-character signature, namely, Q^otot (cenna), affecting the frequency distribution of the signature adversely.",
        "Table 8 shows a set of abbreviations, that are not identified well in our NE pair mining.",
        "Between the two languages, the abbreviations may be either expanded, as BJP expanded to (the equivalent translation for Bharatiya Janatha Party in Tamil), or spelled out, as in BSNL referred to as i_Sl 5T6r057W5r5b (pieSenel).",
        "The last example is very interesting, as each W in English is written out as i_i_Sl 5iriy, (tapiLyuu).",

        "Our experiment results are inline with those reported by [Klementiev and Roth, 2006].",
        "Given that the NE pairs are an important resource for several NLP tasks, we hope that such a methodology to mine the comparable corpora may be fruitful, as comparable corpora may be freely available in perpetuity in several of the world's languages."
