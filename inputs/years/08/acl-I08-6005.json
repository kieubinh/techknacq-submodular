        "Various approaches to translation have been explored at evaluation workshops such as TREC, CLEF and NTCIR.",
        "Experiments at these workshops have been based on laboratory collections consisting of news articles or technical reports with \"TREC\" style queries with a minimum length of a full sentence.",
        "Test collection design at these workshops often ensures that there are a reasonable number of relevant documents available for each query.",
        "In such cases general purpose translation resources based on bilingual dictionaries and standard machine translation (MT) have been shown to be effective for translation in CLIA.",
        "However, this is less likely to be the case when translating the very short queries typically entered by general users of search engines, particularly when they are seeking information in a specific domain.",
        "Online cultural heritage (CH) content is currently appearing in many countries produced by organisations such as national libraries, museums, galleries and audiovisual archives.",
        "Additionally, there are increasing amounts of CH relevant content available more generally on the World Wide Web.",
        "While some of this material concerns national or regional content only of local interest, much material relates to items involving multiple nations and languages, for example concerning events or groups encompassing large areas of Europe or Asia.",
        "In order to gain a full understanding of such things, including details contained in different collections and exploring different cultural perspectives, often requires effective multilingual search technologies.",
        "CH content encompasses various different media, including of course text documents, but also images, videos, and audio recordings which may only be described by very limited metadata labels.",
        "Such metadata may include simple factual details such as date of creation, but also descriptive details relating to the contents of the item and interpretation and contextualization of the content.",
        "Multilingual searching using metadata content requires that either the metadata be translated into a language with which the user is able to search or that the search query be translated into the language of the metadata.",
        "This alternative of document or query translation is a well rehearsed argument in CLIA, which has generally concerned itself with full text document searching.",
        "However, the features of metadata require a more careful analysis.",
        "Metadata is typically dense in search terms, while lacking the linguistic structure and information redundancy of full text documents.",
        "The absence of linguistic structure makes precise translation of content problematic, while the lack of redundancy means that accurate translation of individual words and phrases between the query and document is vital to minimize mismatch between query and document terms.",
        "Developing reliable and robust approaches to translation for metadata search is thus an important component of search for many CH archives.",
        "The EU FP6 MultiMatch project is concerned with information access for multimedia and multilingual content for a range of European languages.",
        "In this paper we report on the MultiMatch query translation methods we are developing to deal with domain-specific language in the CH domain.",
        "We demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques using example query logs from CH sites in English, Spanish and Italian.",
        "We translate the queries and examine the quality of these translations using human annotation.",
        "We show how a domain-specific phrase dictionary can be used to augment traditional general MT systems to improve the coverage and reliability of translation of these queries.",
        "We also show how retrieval performance on CH image metadata is improved with the use of these improved, domain-specific translations.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the translation resources used for this study, Section 3 describes our experimental setup and results, Section 4 summarizes our conclusions, and Section 5 gives details of our ongoing work."

        "The MT approach to query translation for CLIA uses an existing MT system to provide automatic translation.",
        "Using MT systems for query translation is widely used in CLIA when such a system is available for the particular language pair under consideration.",
        "Results reported at the standard retrieval evaluation workshops have often shown it to be competitive with other translation methods.",
        "However, while MT systems can provide reasonable translations for general language expressions, they are often not sufficient for domain-specific phrases that contain personal names, place names, technical terms, titles of artworks, etc.",
        "In addition, certain words and phrases hold special meanings in a specific domain.",
        "For example, the Spanish phrase \"Canto general\" is translated into English as \"general song\", which is arguably correct.",
        "However, in the CH domain, \"Canto general\" refers to a book title from Pablo Neruda's book of poems and should be translated directly into English as the phrase \"Canto general\".",
        "Multiple-word phrases are more information-bearing and more unambiguously represented than single words.",
        "They are often domain-specific and typically absent from static lexicons.",
        "Effective translation of such phrases is therefore particularly critical for short queries that are typically entered by non-expert users of search engines.",
        "The focus of the research reported in this paper is a method to improve translation effectiveness of phrases previously untranslated or inappropriately translated by a standard MT system.",

        "in particular, wikipedia page titles in one language are often linked to a multilingual database of corresponding terms.",
        "Unlike the web, most hyperlinks in wikipedia have a more consistent pattern and meaningful interpretation.",
        "For example, the English wikipedia page http://en.wikipedia.org/",

        "Three methods of multiple-word phrase identification have been commonly used: lexical rule-based (Ballesteros and Croft, 1997; Hull and Grefenstette, 1996), statistical (Coenen et al., 2007; Gao et al., 2001), and syntactical methods (Sharma and Raman, 2003; Gel-bukh et al., 2004; Van de Cruys and Villada Moiron, 2007).",

        "The query is sequentially scanned to match the phrase dictionary.",
        "The longest matched subsequence is taken as a phrase and translated via a domain-specific dictionary lookup.",
        "This process is recursively invoked on the remaining part of the query until no matches are found.",
        "The performance of this approach depends strongly on the completeness of the coverage of the adopted dictionary.",
