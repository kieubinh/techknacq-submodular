        "Web Search engines generally produce query dependent snippets for each result which help users to explore further.",
        "An automated query focused multi-document summarizer, which will generate a query based short summary of web pages will be very useful to get a glimpse over the complete story.",
        "Automated multi-document summarization has drawn much attention in recent years.",
        "Most multi-document summarizers are query independent, which produce majority of information content from multiple documents using much less lengthy text.",
        "Each of the systems fall into two different categories: either they are sentence extraction based where they just extract relevant sentences and concatenate them to produce summary or they fuse information from multiple sources to produce a coherent summary.",
        "In this paper, we propose a query focused multi-document summarizer, based on paragraph extraction scheme.",
        "Unlike traditional extraction based summarizers which do not take into consideration the inherent structure of the document, our system will add structure to documents in the form of graph.",
        "During initial preprocessing, text fragments are identified from the documents which constitute the nodes of the graph.",
        "Edges are defined as the correlation measure between nodes of the graph.",
        "We define our text fragments as paragraph rather than sentence with the view that generally a paragraph contains more correlated information whereas sentence level extraction might lead to loss of some coherent information.",
        "Since the system produces multi-document summary based on user's query, the response time of the system should be minimal for practical purpose.",
        "With this goal, our system takes following steps: First, during preprocessing stage (offline) it performs some query independent tasks like identifying seed summary nodes and constructing graph over them.",
        "Then at query time (online), given a set of keywords, it expands the initial graph and performs keyword search over the graph to find a spanning tree identifying relevant nodes (paragraphs) satisfying the keywords.",
        "The performance of the system depends much on the identification of the initial query independent nodes (seed nodes).",
        "Although, we have presented all the examples in the current discussion for English language only, we argue that our system can be adapted to work in multilingual environment (i.e. Hindi, Bengali, Japanese etc.)",

        "Both are very important aspects of such system, and we will show how these aspects are taken care of in our system.",
        "Runtime of such system greatly depends on how well the query independent graph is constructed.",

        "On the other hand, it is possible to select query specific nodes at runtime and to create a graph over those nodes.",

        "At query time, the precomputed graph is processed to extract the best multi-document summary.",
        "We have tested our algorithm with news articles from different domains.",
        "The experimental results suggest that our algorithm is effective.",
        "Although we experimented with pair of articles, the proposed algorithm can be improved to handle more than two articles simultaneously.",
        "The important aspect of our system is that it can be modified to compute query independent summary which consists of topic nodes, generated during preprocessing stage.",
        "The paragraph ordering module can be used to define ordering among those topic paragraphs.",
        "Another important aspect is that our system can be tuned to generate summary with custom size specified by users.",
        "The spanning tree generation algorithm can be so modified that it produces not only total spanning tree but also takes care of the size requirement of user.",
        "Lastly, it is shown that our system can generate summary for other non-English documents also if some language dependent tools are available.",
        "The performance of our algorithm greatly depends on quality of selection of topic nodes.",
        "So if we can improve the identification of topic paragraphs and shared topics among multiple documents it would surely enhance the quality of our system."
