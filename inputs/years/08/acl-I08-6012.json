        "This paper describes our first participation in the Indian language subtask of the main Adhoc monolingual and bilingual track in CLEF competition.",
        "In this track, the task is to retrieve relevant documents from an English corpus in response to a query expressed in different Indian languages including Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Bengali and Marathi.",
        "Groups participating in this track are required to submit a English to English monolingual run and a Hindi to English bilingual run with optional runs in rest of the languages.",
        "We had submitted a monolingual English run and a Hindi to English cross-lingual run.",
        "We used a word alignment table that was learnt by a Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) system trained on aligned parallel sentences, to map a query in source language into an equivalent query in the language of the target document collection.",
        "The relevant documents are then retrieved using a Language Modeling based retrieval algorithm.",
        "On CLEF 2007 data set, our official cross-lingual performance was 54.4% of the monolingual performance and in the post submission experiments we found that it can be significantly improved up to 73.4%."
