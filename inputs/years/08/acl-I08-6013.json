        "We used a variant of TFIDF algorithm in combination with a bilingual lexicon for query translation.",
        "We also explored the role of a document summary in fielded queries and two different boolean formulations of query translations.",
        "We find that a hybrid boolean formulation using a combination of boolean AND and boolean OR operators improves ranking of documents.",
        "We also find that simple disjunctive combination of translated query keywords results in maximum recall."
