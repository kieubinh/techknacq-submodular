        "The web walked into the ACL meetings started in 1999.",
        "The use of the web as a corpus for teaching and research on language technology has been proposed a number of times (Rundel, 2000; Fletcher, 2001; Robb, 2003; Fletcher, 2003).",
        "There is a long history of creating a standard for western language resources.",
        "The human language technology (HLT) society in Europe has been particularly zealous for the standardization, making a series of attempts such as EAGLES, PROLE/SIMPLE (Lenci et al., 2000), ISLE/MILE (Calzolari et al., 2003; Bertagna et al., 2004) and more recently multilingual lexical database generation from parallel texts in 20 European languages (Giguet and Luquet, 2006).",
        "On the other hand, in spite of having great linguistic and cultural diversities, Asian language resources have received much less attention than their western counterparts.",
        "A new project (Takenobou et al., 2006) has been started to create a common standard for Asian language resources.",

        "(Bharati et al., 2001) reports on efforts to create lexical resources such as transfer lexicon and grammar from English to several Indian languages and dependency tree bank of annotated corpora for several Indian languages.",
        "Corpus development work from web can be found in (Ek-bal and Bandyopadhyay, 2007d) for Bengali.",
        "Named Entity Recognition (NER) is one of the core components in most Information Extraction (IE) and Text Mining systems.",
        "During the last few years, the probabilistic machine learning methods have become state of the art for NER (Bikel et al., 1999; Chieu and Ng, 2002) and for field extraction (McCallum et al., 2000).",
        "Most prominently, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) have been used for the information extraction task (Bikel et al., 1999).",
        "Beside HMM, there are other systems based on Support Vector Machine (Sun et al., 2003) and Na√Øve Bayes (De Sitter and Daelemans, 2003).",

        "The HTML file is scanned from the beginning to look for tags like <fontFACE=BENGALI_FONT_NAME>...<font>, where the BENGALI_FONT_NAME is the name",
        "The 6th Workshop on Asian Languae Resources, 2008",
        "of one of the Bengali font faces as defined in the news archive.",
        "The Bengali text enclosed within font tags are retrieved and stored in the database after appropriate tagging.",
        "Pictures, captions and tables may exist anywhere within the actual news.",
        "Tables are integral part of the news item.",
        "The pictures, its captions and other HTML tags that are not relevant to our text processing tasks are discarded during the file cleaning.",
        "The Bengali news corpus has been developed in both ISCII and UTF-8 codes.",
        "The tagged news corpus contains 108,305 number of news documents with about five (5) years (2001-2005) of news data collection.",
        "Some statistics about the tagged news corpus are presented in Table 1.",
        "The Bengali news corpus collected from the web is annotated using a tagset that includes the type and subtype of the news, title, date, reporter or agency name, news location and the body of the news.",
        "A part of this corpus is then tagged with a tagset, consisting of sixteen NE tags and one non-NE tag.",
        "Also, a part of the corpus has been tagged with a tagest of twelve NE tags, defined for the IJCNLP-08 NER Shared Task for South and South East Asian Languages.",
        "A news corpus, whether in Bengali or in any other language, has different parts like title, date, reporter, location, body etc.",
        "To identify these parts in a news corpus the tagset, described in Table 2, has been defined.",
        "The reporter, agency, location, date, bd, day anded tags help to recognize the person name, organization name, location name and the various date expressions that appear in the fixed places of the newspaper.",
        "These tags are not able to recognize the various NEs that appear within the actual news body.",
        "In order to identify NEs within the actual news body, we have defined a tagset consisting of seventeen tags.",
        "We have considered the major four NE classes, namely 'Person name', 'Location name', 'Organization name' and 'Miscellaneous name'.",
        "Miscellaneous names include the date, time, number, percentage and monetary expressions.",
        "The four major NE classes are further divided in order to properly denote each component of the multiword NEs.",
        "The NE tagset is shown in Table 3 with the appropriate examples.",
        "We have also tagged a portion of the corpus as part of the IJCNLP-08 NER Shared Task for South and South East Asian Languages.",
        "This tagset has twelve different tags.",
        "The underlying reason for adopting these tags was the necessity of a slightly finer tagset for various natural language processing (NLP) applications and particularly for machine translation.",
        "The IJCNLP-08 NER shared task tagset is shown in Table 4.",
        "One important aspect of IJCNLP-08 NER shared task was to annotate only the maximal NEs and not the structures of the entities.",
        "For example, mahatma gandhi road is annotated as location and assigned the tag 'NEL' even if mahatma and gandhi are NE title person and person name, respectively, according to the IJCNLP-08 shared task tagset.",
        "These internal structures of the entities need to be identified during testing.",
        "So, mahatma gandhi road will be tagged as mahatma/NETP gan-dhi/NEP road/NEL.",
