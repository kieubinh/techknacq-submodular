        "To make the generalization we have dropped the left most and right most tokens one by one and checked the pattern quality.",
        "If for a initial pattern, several patterns presents with 100% precision then we have selected those patterns for which no subset of those is a good pattern.",
        "By this way we have prepared a list of good patterns for a particular gazetteer type.",
        "In time of 'good' pattern selection we have made some interesting observations.",
        "• There are some patterns which satisfy the 100% precision criteria but the coverage is very poor in terms of new entity extraction.",
        "For example, \"mAsTara blAsTara CRIC ko\" is a pattern with 100% precision.",
        "The pattern has 24 instances in the 'part' corpus, but all the extracted entities are 'sachina tedulkara'.",
        "We have also examined the pattern in the total raw corpus.",

        "So in spite of fulfilling all the criteria the pattern is not a 'good' pattern.",

        "the context of the 'part' corpus, but when used in the total raw corpus, it extracts non-relevant entities.",
        "For example \"mere vichAra se CRIC ko Takkara\" is a 'good' pattern so it should extract the names of the cricketers.",
        "But when this is used in the total raw corpus it extracts non-cricketer entities (e.g. tennis players, chess players) also.",
        "To make such patterns useful we have extracted all the cricket related sentences in the similar way which was used for selecting the 'part' corpus and then the patterns are used to extract entities from these sentences.",
        "• There present are patterns with very high coverage but precision is just below 100%.",
        "We have analyzed these patterns and manually identified the wrongly extracted entities.",
        "If the wrong entities can be grouped together and are having some specific properties then we have added these entities in a 'pattern exception list'.",
        "Then the pattern is used as a 'good' pattern and the exception list is used to detect the wrong identifications.",
        "In the following we have given some example of 'good' patterns which are useful in identification of the names of the cricket players.",
        "• ballebAja CRIC ko Tima ke",

        "• CRIC kA arddhashataka",
        "The extracted 'good' patterns are capable of identifying NEs from a raw corpus.",
        "These patterns are then used to prepare the gazetteers.",
        "The seeds form the initial gazetteer list for a particular gazetteer type.",
        "The 'good' patterns are used to extract entities from the total raw corpus.",
        "The entities identified by the patterns are added to the corresponding gazetteer list.",
        "In that way we can add more entities in our first phase gazetteer list.",
        "These new entities are taken as seeds for the next phase.",
        "Then the same procedure is followed repeatedly to develop a large gazetteer.",
        "We have already mentioned that we have worked with a sports domain corpus and prepared some gazetteers.",
        "This gazetteers are prepared just to prove the efficiency of our approach.",
        "By using only 3 seed entities we become able to prepare a gazetteer which contains 412 names of the cricketers.",
        "Even using this approach only one seed 'Sachin Tendualkar' extracts 297 names after the second iteration.",
