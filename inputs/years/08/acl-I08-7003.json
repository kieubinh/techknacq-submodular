        "Ontology construction has two main issues including the acquisition of domain concepts and the acquisition of appropriate taxonomies of these concepts.",
        "These concepts are labeled by the terms used in the domain which are described by different attributes.",
        "Since domain specific terms (terminology) are labels of concepts among other things, terminology extraction is the first and the foremost important step of domain concept acquisition.",
        "Most of the existing algorithms in Chinese terminology extraction only produce a list of terms without much linguistic information or classification information (Yun Li and Qiangjun Wang, 2001; Yan He et al., 2006; Feng Zhang et al., 2006).",
        "This fact makes it difficult in ontology construction as the fundamental features of these terms are missing.",
        "The acquisition of taxonomies is in fact the process of organizing domain specific concepts.",
        "These concepts in an ontology should be defined using a subclass hierarchy by assigning and defining properties and by defining relationship between concepts etc.",
        "(Van Rees, R., 2003).",
        "These methods are all concept descriptions.",
        "The linguistic information associated with domain terms such as PoS tags and semantic classification information of terms can also make up for the concept related features which are associated with concept labels.",
        "Terms with different PoS tags usually carry different semantic information.",
        "For example, a noun is usually a word naming a thing or an object.",
        "A verb is usually a word denoting an action, occurrence or state of existence, which are all associated with a time and a place.",
        "Thus in ontology construction, noun nodes and verb nodes should be described using different attributes with different discriminating characters.",
        "With this information, extracted terms can then be classified",
        "The 6th Workshop on Asian Languae Resources, 2008",
        "accordingly to help in ontology construction and retrieval work.",
        "Thus PoS tags can help identify the different features needed for concept representation in domain ontology construction.",
        "It should be pointed out that Term PoS (TPoS) tagging is different from the general PoS tagging tasks.",
        "It is designed to do PoS tagging for a given list of terms extracted from some terminology extraction algorithms such as those presented in (Luning Ji et al., 2007).",
        "The granularity of general PoS tagging is smaller than what is targeted in this paper because terms representing domain specific concepts are more likely to be compound words and sometimes even phrases, such as \"jtfrHfS",
        "\"(file manager), \"^H^OE\"(description of concurrency), etc..",
        "Even though current general word segmentation and PoS tagging can achieve precision of 99.6% and 97.58%, respectively (Huaping Zhang et al., 2003), its performance for domain specific corpus is much less satisfactory (Luning Ji et al., 2007), which is why terminology extraction algorithms need to be developed.",
        "In this paper, a very simple but effective method is proposed for TPoS tagging which needs no training process or even context information.",
        "This method is based on the assumption that every term has a headword.",
        "For a given list of domain specific terms which are segmented and each word in the term already has a PoS tag, the TPoS tagging algorithm then identifies the position of the headword and take the tag of the headword as the tag of the term.",
        "Experiments show that this method is quite effective in giving good precision and minimal computing time.",

        "Although TPoS tagging is different from general PoS tagging, the general POS tagging methods are worthy of referencing.",
        "There are a lot of existing POS tagging researches which can be classified into following categories in general.",
        "Natural ideas of solving this problem were to make use of the information from the words themselves.",
        "A number of features based on prefixes and suffixes and spelling cues like capitalization were adopted in these researches (Mikheev, A, 1997; Brants, Thorsten, 2000; Mikheev, A, 1996).",
        "Mikheev presented a technique for automatically acquiring rules to guess possible POS tags for unknown words using their starting and ending segments (Mikheev, A, 1997).",
        "Through an unsupervised process of rule acquisition, three complementary sets of word-guessing rules would be induced from a general purpose lexicon and a raw corpus: prefix morphological rules, suffix morphological rules and ending-guessing rules (Mikheev, A, 1996).",
        "Brants used the linear interpolation of fixed length suffix model for word handling in his POS tagger, named TnT.",
        "For example, an English word ending in the suffix able was very likely to be an adjective (Brants, Thorsten, 2000).",
        "Some existing methods are based on the analysis of word morphology.",
        "They exploited more features besides morphology or took morphology as supplementary means (Toutanova et al., 2003; Huihsin Tseng et al., 2005; Samuelsson, Christer, 1993).",
        "Toutanova et al.",
        "demonstrated the use of both preceding and following tag contexts via a dependency network representation and made use of some additional features such as lexical features including jointly conditioning on multiple consecutive words and other fine-grained modeling of word features (Toutanova et al., 2003).",
        "Huihisin et al.",
        "proposed a variety of morphological word features, such as the tag sequence features from both left and right side of the current word for POS tagging and implemented them in a Maximum Entropy Markov model (Huihsin Tseng et al., 2005).",
        "Samuelsson used n-grams of letter sequences ending and starting each word as word features.",
        "The main goal of using Bayesian inference was to investigate the influence of various information sources, and ways of combining them, on the ability to assign lexical categories to words.",
        "The Bayesian inference was used to find the tag assignment T with highest probability P(T|M, S) given morphology M (word form) and syntactic context S (neighboring tags) (Samuelsson, Christer, 1993).",
        "Other researchers inclined to regard this POS tagging work as a multi-class classification problem.",
        "Many methods used in machine learning, such",
        "The 6th Workshop on Asian Languae Resources, 2008",
        "as Decision Tree, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and k-Nearest-Neighbors (k-NN), were used for guessing possible POS tags of words (G. Orphanos",
        "Maosong Sun et al., 2000).",
        "Orphanos and Christo-doulakis presented a POS tagger for Modern Greek and focused on a data-driven approach for the induction of decision trees used as disambiguation or guessing devices (G. Orphanos and D. Christodou-lakis, 1999).",
        "The system was based on a high-coverage lexicon and a tagged corpus capable of showing off the behavior of all POS ambiguity schemes and characteristics of words.",
        "Support Vector Machine is a widely used (or effective) classification approach for solving two-class pattern recognition problems.",
        "Selecting appropriate features and training effective classifiers are the main points of SVM method.",
        "Nakagawa et al.",
        "used substrings and surrounding context as features and achieve high accuracy in POS tag prediction (Na-kagawa T, 2001).",
        "Furthermore, Sun et al. presented a POS identification algorithm based on k-nearest-neighbors (k-NN) strategy for Chinese word POS tagging.",

        "As pointed out earlier, TPoS tagging is different from the general PoS tagging tasks.",
        "In this paper, it is assumed that a terminology extraction algorithm has already obtained the PoS tags of individual words.",
        "For example, in the segmented and tagged sentence \"if»/n ffl^/n ^/v +/f > /w ^#/n M/d B/v ^OlB/a N&/n */f ° /w\"(In computer graphics, objects are usually represented as polygonal meshes.",
        "), the term \" i&Oiy&NW (polygonal meshes) has been segmented into two individual words and tagged as \" ^-iO /a\" (polygonal /a) and \" Nflr/n\" (meshes /n).",
        "The terminology extraction algorithm would identify these two words \"^iO^/a\" and \"N^/n\" as a single term in a specific domain.",
        "The proposed algorithm is to determine the PoS of this single term \"^OWNW\" (polygonal meshes), thus the algorithm is referred to as TPoS tagging.",
        "It can be seen that the general purpose PoS tagging and term PoS tagging assign tags at different granularity.",
        "In principle, the context information of terms can help TPoS tagging and the individual PoS tags may be good choices as classification features.",
        "The proposed TPoS tagging algorithm consists of two modules.",
        "The first module is a terminology extraction preprocessing module.",
        "The second module carries out the TPoS tag assignment.",
        "In the terminology extraction module, if the result of terminology extraction algorithm is a list of terms without PoS tags, a general purpose segmenter called ICTCLAS will be used to give PoS tags to all individual words.",
        "ICTCLAS is developed by Chinese Academy of Science, the precision of which is 97.58% on tagging general words (Huaping Zhang et al., 2003).",
        "Then the output of this module is a list of terms, referred to as Term-List, using algorithms such as the method described in (Luning Ji et al., 2007).",
        "In this paper, two simple schemes for the term PoS tag assignment module are proposed.",
        "The first scheme is called the blind assignment scheme.",
        "It simply assigns the noun tag to every term in the TermList.",
        "This is based on the assumption that most of the terms in a specific domain represent certain concepts that are most likely to be nouns.",
        "Result from this blind assignment scheme can be considered as the baseline or the worse case scenario.",
        "Even in general domain, it is observed that nouns are in the majority of Chinese words with more than 50% among all different PoS tags (Hui",
        "Wang, 2006).",
        "The second scheme is called head-word-driven assignment scheme.",
        "Theoretically, it will take the tag of the head word of one term as the tag of the whole term.",
        "But here it simply takes the tag of the last word in a term.",
        "This is based on the assumption that each term has a headword which in most cases is the last word in a term (Hui Wang, 2006).",
        "One additional experiment has been done to verify this assumption.",
        "A manually annotated Chinese shallow Treebank in general domain is used for the statistic work (Ruifeng Xu et al., 2005).",
        "There are 9 different structures of Chinese phrases, (Yunfang Wu et al., 2003), but only 3 of them do not have their head words in the tail, which are about 6.56% from all phrases.",
        "Following the examples earlier,",
        "The 6th Workshop on Asian Languae Resources, 2008",
        "the term \"^OzTf/a Nf#/n\" (polygonal /a meshes /n) will be assigned the tag \"/n\" because the last word is labeled \"/n\".",
        "There are a lot of semanteme tags at the end of a term.",
        "For example, \"/ng\" presents single character postfix of a noun.",
        "But it would be improper if a term is tagged as \"/ng\".",
        "For example, the term jftitil\" (decision-making machine) contains two segments as listed with two components \"^jft/n\" and \"IfH/ng\".",
        "It is obvious that \"^jftitl/ng\" is inappropriate.",
        "Thus the head-word-driven assignment scheme also includes some rules to correct this kind of problems.",

        "To verify the validity of the proposed method to different domains, a term list containing 366 legal terms obtained from Google searching results for \" ft t^/Rip'^v^ \"(complete dictionary of legal terms) is selected for comparison, which is named TermList3.",
        "The first experiment is designed to examine the proportion of nouns in TermList1 and TermList3, to validate of the assumption of the blind assignment scheme.",
        "In first part of this experiment, all the 3,343 terms in TermList1 are tagged as nouns.",
        "The result shows that the precision of the blind assignment scheme is between 78.79% and 84.77%.",
        "The reason for the range is that there are about 200 terms in TermList1 which can be considered either as nouns, gerunds, or even verbs without reference to context.",
        "For example, the term \"^MNi&SVj N\" (\"remote access of local area network\" or \"remote access to local area network\") and the term \"SH-b\" (polarization or polarize), can be considered either as nouns if they are regarded as courses of events or as verbs if they refer to the actions for completing certain work.",
        "The specific type is dependent on the context which is not provided without the use of a corpus.",
        "However, the experiment result does show that in a specific domain, there is a much higher percentage of terms that are nouns than other tags in general (Hui Wang, 2006).",
        "As to TermList3, the precision of blind assignment is between 65.57% and 70.77% (19 mixed ones).",
        "TermList2 is the result of a terminology extraction algorithm and there are non-term items in the extraction result, so the blind assignment scheme is not applied on TermList2.",
        "The blue colored bars (lighter color) in Figure 1 shows the result of TermList1 and TermList3 using the blind assignment scheme which gives the two worst result compared to our proposed approach to be discussed in Section 4.2",
        "The experiment in this section was designed to validate the proposed head-word-driven assignment scheme.",
        "The same experiment is conducted on the three term lists respectively, as shown in Figure 1 in purple color (darker color).",
        "The precision for assigning TPoS tags to TermList1 is 93.45%.",
        "By taking the result from a terminology extraction algorithm without regards to its potential error propagations, the precision of the head-word-driven assignment scheme for TermList2 is 94.32%.",

        "By comparing to the blind assignment scheme, this algorithm has reasonably good performance for all three term list with precision of over 90%.",
        "It also gives 8.7% and 19.9% improvement for TermList1 and TermList3, respectively, as compared to the blind assignment",
        "The 6th Workshop on Asian Languae Resources, 2008",
        "scheme, a reasonably good improvement without a heavy cost.",
        "However, there are some abnormalities in these results.",
        "Supposedly, TermListl is a hand verified term list in the IT domain and thus its result should have less noise and thus should perform better than TermList2, which is not the case as shown in Figure 1.",
        "Figure 1 Performance of the Two Assignment",
        "Schemes on the Three Term Lists",
        "By further analyzing the error result, for example for TermListl, among these 3,343 terms, about 219 were given improper tags, such as the term \"ffl (Graphics).",
        "In this example, two individual words, \"ffl^/n\" and \"^/v\", form a term.",
        "So the output was \"S^^/v\" for taking the tag of the last segment.",
        "It was a wrong tag because the whole term was a noun.",
        "In fact, the error is caused by the general word PoS tagging algorithm because without context, the most likely tagging of a semanteme, is a verb.",
        "This kind of errors in semanteme tagging appeared in the results of all three term lists with 169 from TermListl, 29 from TermList2 and l2 from TermList3, respectively.",
        "This was a kind of errors which can be corrected by applying some simple induction rules.",
        "For example, for all semantemes with multiple tags (including noun as in the example), the rule can be \"tagging terms with noun suffixes as nouns\".",
        "For example, terms \" 5jr3fc/n J|j/q\" (reform-through-labor camp) and \"iff#l/n ffl^/n ^/v\" (computer graphics) were given different tags using the head-word-driven assignment scheme.",
        "They were assigned as: \"5?M/q\" and \"iffft/lffl^/v\" which can be corrected by this rule.",
        "Another kind of mistake is related to the suffix tags such as \"/ng\" (noun suffix) and \"/vg\"(verb suffix).",
        "For examples, \"£niR/n rWn E/ng\" (intellectual property tribunal) and \"fS[$!i/n ft/vg\" (data set) will be tagged as \" £ni/RrfeE/ng\" and \" ItffiÄ/vg\", respectively, which are obviously wrong.",
        "So, the simple rule of \"tagging terms with \"/ng\" and \"/vg\" to \"/n\" is applied.",

        "Table 1 Influence of Induction Rules on Different Term Lists",
        "It is obvious that with the use of fine tuning using induction rules, the results are much better.",
        "In fact the result for TermListl reached 97.03% which is quite close to PoS tagging of general domain data.",
        "The abnormality also disappeared as the performance of TermListl has the best result.",
        "The improvement to TermList2 (1.16%) is not as obvious as that for TermListl and TermList3, which are 3.83% and 3.62%, respectively.",
        "This, however, is reasonable as TermList2 is produced directly from a terminology extraction algorithm using a corpus, thus, the results are noisier.",
        "Further analysis is then conducted on the result of TermList2 to examine the influence of non-term items to this term list.",
