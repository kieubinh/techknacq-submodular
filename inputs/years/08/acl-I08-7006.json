        "Since words are not uniformly delimited by spaces in Myanmar script, segmenting sentences into words is an important task for Myanmar NLP.",
        "In this paper we have described the need and possible techniques for segmentation in Myanmar script.",
        "In particular, we have used a combination of stored lists, suffix removal, morphological analysis and syllable level n-grams to hypothesize valid words with about 99% accuracy.",
        "Necessary scripts have been written in Perl.",
        "Over the last few years, we have collected monolingual text corpora totalling to about 2,141,496 sentences and English-Myanmar parallel corpora amounting to about 80,000 sentences and sentence fragments, aligned at sentence and word levels.",
        "We have also built a list of 1216 stop words, 4550 syllables and 800,000 words from a variety of sources including our own corpora.",
        "We have used fairly simple and intuitive methods not requiring deep linguistic insights or sophisticated statistical inference.",
        "With this initial work, we now plan to apply a variety of machine learning techniques.",
        "We hope this work will help to accelerate work in Myanmar language and larger lexical resources will be developed soon.",
