        "The World Wide Web contains interlinked documents, called web pages, navigable by hyperlinks.",
        "Since its creation, it has grown to contain billions of web pages and several billion hyperlinks.",
        "These web pages are created by millions of people from all parts of the world.",
        "Each web page contains a large amount of information that can be shared and disseminated to people with Internet access.",
        "Authors and creators of a web page come from different backgrounds, different cultures, and different languages.",
        "Thus, a web page is a resource of multilingual content, and a fertile source for sociolinguistic analysis.",
        "While search-engines are important means of accessing the web for most users, automated systems of retrieving information from the web have been developed.",
        "These systems are called web crawlers, where a software agent is given a list of pages to visit.",
        "As the crawler visits these pages, it follows their outgoing links and adds these to the list of pages to visit.",
        "Each page is visited recursively according to some sets of policies (e.g. the type of pages to retrieve, direction, the maximum depth from the URL (uniform resource locator), etc.).",
        "The result of this crawl is a vast amount of data, most of which may be irrelevant to certain individuals.",
        "Thus, a focused-crawling approach was implemented by some systems to limit the search to only a subset of the web.",
        "Focused crawlers rely on classifiers to work effectively.",
        "Language-specific crawlers, for example, need a very good language identification module that properly identifies the language of the web pages.",
        "General crawlers can be extended to include focused-crawling capabilities by incorporating the classifiers.",
        "Another important requirement to efficiently crawl the desired domain is the list of initial web pages, called seed URLs.",
        "Each of these URLs will be enqueued into a list.",
        "The agent visits each URL in the list.",
        "Since the crawler recursively visits",
        "The 6th Workshop on Asian Languae Resources, 2008",
        "the outgoing links of each URL, it is possible that the seed URL is an outgoing link of another seed URL, or an outgoing link of an outgoing link of another seed URL.",
        "Listing these URLs as seed URLs will just waste the crawler's time in visiting them, when they have already been visited.",
        "If several URLs can be reached from just one URL, the seed URL list size will decrease and the crawler will be more efficient.",
        "However, the maximum distance between these web pages must also be considered, since the crawler can have a policy to stop the crawling after reaching a certain depth.",
        "A graph consists of a set of nodes, denoted by V and a set of edges, denoted by E. Each edge is a pair of nodes (u, v) representing a connection between u and v. A path between two nodes is a sequence of edges that is passed through from one node to reach the other node.",
        "In a directed graph, each edge is an ordered pair of nodes.",
        "A path from u to v does not imply a path from v to u.",
        "The distance between any two nodes is the number of edges in a shortest path connecting them.",
        "The diameter of the graph is the maximum distance between any two nodes.",
        "In an undirected graph, each edge is an unordered pair of nodes.",
        "There is an edge between u and v if there is a link between u and v, regardless of which node is the source of the link.",
        "A strongly-connected component (SCC) of a directed graph is a set of nodes such that for any pair of nodes u and v in the set, there is a path from u to v. The strongly-connected components of a graph consist of disjoint sets of nodes.",
        "A subgraph is a graph whose nodes and edges are subsets of another graph.",
        "With the interlinked nature of the web, it can be represented as a graph, with the web pages as the nodes and the edges as the hyperlinks between the pages.",
        "Languages are expressions of individuals and groups of individuals, essential to all form of communication.",
        "It is a fundamental medium of expressing one's self whether in spoken or written form.",
        "Ehtnologue (2005) lists 6,912 known living languages in the world.",
        "Only a small portion of these languages can be found in the web today.",
        "A language community in the web is the group of web pages written in a language.",
        "Major language communities discovered in each country indicates the dominant language of the country's web space.",
        "How one language community is related to another language community can be shown by analyzing the hyperlinks between them.",

        "The vastness and multilingual content of the web makes it a rich source of culturally-diversified information.",
        "Since web pages are connected by hyperlinks, information can be readily accesses by jumping from one page to another via the hyperlinks.",
        "For each country domain, the web pages written in the same language form a language community.",
        "The link structure between language communities shows how connected a language community is with another language community.",
        "It can be assumed that the close links between two language communities on the web imply the existence of multilingual speakers of the two languages.",
        "Otherwise linked pages will not be visited.",
        "In this context, the language graph analysis demonstrated in this study gives an effective tool to understand the linguistic scenes of the country.",
        "If the same analysis is performed for the secondary level domain data, further insight into the sociolinguistic status of each language can be drawn.",
        "Secondary domain corresponds to different social area of language activities, such as \"ac\" or \"edu\" for academic and education arena, \"go\" or \"gov\" for government or public arena, and \"co\" or \"com\" for commercial business and occupational arena.",
        "Although this study does not extend its scope to the secondary level domain analysis, the effectiveness of the approach was demonstrated.",
        "Another implication drawn from this study is that the language graph analysis can identify intermediary languages in the multilingual communities.",
        "In the real world, some languages are acting as a medium of communications among the different language speakers.",
        "In most cases, such lingua franca are international languages such as English, French, Arabic, etc.",
        "But it's difficult to identify which language is acting as such in detail.",
        "But on the web link structure among languages, the language graph can give us a clue to identify this.",
        "As shown in this paper, there are a number of languages acting as intermediary between two languages having only a few hyperlinks between them.",
        "Although the result of this category is doubtful because of misidentification of language, some cases show the expected result.",
        "The second objective of the study is to give a microscopic level structure of the web communities for much more practical and technical reasons, such as how to design more effective crawling strategy, and how to prepare starting URLs with minimal efforts.",
        "The key issue in this context is to reveal the connectedness of the web.",
        "To show the connectedness of language communities, several",
        "The 6th Workshop on Asian Languae Resources, 2008",
        "graph theory metrics, the size and numbers of strongly-connected components and the diameters are calculated and visual presentations of language communities are also given.",
        "This information can aid in defining parameters used for crawling, particularly language-specific crawling.",
        "As a summary, the link structure analysis of language graphs can be a useful tool for various spectrums of sociolinguistic and technical research purposes."
