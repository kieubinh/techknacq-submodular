        "It includes multiple genres, such as novels, short stories, newspaper columns, biographies, memoirs, etc.",
        "annotated topographically, i.e., for paragraph boundaries, author, publication date, and the source of the text.",
        "A small part of the MTC, called the METU-Sabanci TreeBank (5600 sentences) has been annotated with morphological features and dependency relationships (e.g., modifier-of, subject-of, object-of, etc.).",
        "The result is a set of dependency trees.",
        "The MTC as a whole provides a large-scale resource on Turkish discourse and is being used in research on Turkish.",
        "To date, there have been 81 requests for permission to use the MTC and 31 requests to use the TreeBank subcorpus.",
        "Most of the users are linguists, computer or cognitive scientists working on Turkish, or graduate students of similar disciplines.",
        "Some users have expressed a desire for the MTC to be extended by annotations at the discourse level, which provides further impetus for the present project.",
        "The result of annotating discourse connectives will be a clearly defined level of discourse structure on the MTC.",
        "Annotation of text from the multiple genres present in the MTC will allow us to compare the distribution of connectives and their arguments across genres.",
        "The annotation will help researchers understand Turkish discourse by enabling them to give concise, clear descriptions of the issues concerning discourse structure and semantics, and support a rigorous empirical",

      "text": [
        "From a semantic perspective, a discourse connective is a predicate that takes as its arguments, abstract objects (propositions, facts, events, descriptions, situations, and eventualities).",
        "The primary linguistic unit in which abstract objects (AOs) are realized in Turkish is the clause, either tensed or untensed.",
        "Discourse connectives themselves may be realized explicitly or implicitly.",
        "An explicit connective is realized in the form of a lexical item or a group of lexical items, while an implicit connective can be inferred from adjacent text spans that realise AOs and whose AOs are taken to be related.",
        "To constrain the amount of text selected for arguments, a minimality principle can be imposed, limiting arguments to the minimum amount of information needed to complete the interpretation of the discourse relation.",
        "The project will initially focus on annotating explicit connectives, integrating implicit ones at a later stage.",
        "One of the most challenging issues so far has been determining the set of explicit discourse connectives in Turkish (i.e., the various linguistic elements that can be interpreted as predicates on AO arguments) and the syntactic classes they are identified with.",
        "In the Penn Discourse TreeBank (PDTB), the explicit discourse connectives were taken to comprise (1) coordinating conjunctions, (2) subordinating conjunctions, and (3) discourse adverbials (Forbes-Riley et al., 2006).",
        "But coordinating and subordinating conjunctions are not classes in Turkish per se.",
        "Moreover, most of the existing grammars of Turkish describe clausal adjuncts and adverbs in semantic (e.g., temporal, additive, resultative, etc.)",
        "rather than syntactic terms.",
        "We therefore made a rough classification first and determined the broad syntactic classes by considering the morpho-syntactic properties shared by elements of the initial classification.",
        "As a result of this process, we have come to identify explicit discourse connectives in Turkish with three grammatical types, forming five classes:",
        "(a) Coordinating conjunctions such as single lexical items çtinkti 'because', ama 'but,' ve 'and', and the particle dA.",
        "(N.B., dA can also function as a subordinated.)",
        "(b) Paired coordinating conjunctions such as hem .. hem 'both and,' ne .. ne 'neither nor' which link two clauses, with one element of the pair associated with each clause in the discourse relation.",
        "(c) Simplex subordinators (also termed as converbs), i.e., suffixes forming non-finite adverbial clauses, e.g. -(y)kAn, 'while', -(y)ArAk 'by means of'.",
        "(d) Complex subordinators, i.e., connectives which have two parts, usually a postposition (ragmen 'despite', için 'for', gibi 'as well as') and an accompanying suffix on the (non-finite) verb of the subordinate clause.",
        "(e) Anaphoric connectives such as ne var ki 'however', tistelik 'what is more', ayrica 'apart from this', ilk olarak 'firstly', etc.",
        "In the PDTB, non-finite clauses have not been annotated as arguments.",
        "However, since all non-finite clauses are marked with a suffix in Turkish (see sections 4.1 and 4.2 below) and encode a relation between AOs, we would have missed an important property of the language if we had not identified them as discourse connectives (cf. Prasad et al., 2008).",
        "All the discourse connectives above have exactly two arguments.",
        "So as in English, while verbs in Turkish can vary in the number of arguments they take, Turkish discourse connectives take two and only two arguments.",
        "These can conveniently be called ARG1 and ARG2.",
        "It remains an open question whether there is any language in which discourse connectives take more than two arguments.",
        "In the following, we give representative examples of each of the above five classes of discourse connectives and discuss the assignment of the argument labels, linear order of arguments and types of arguments.",
        "By convention, we label",
        "The 6th Workshop on Asian Languae Resources, 2008",
        "the argument containing (or with an affinity for) the connective as ARG2 (presented in boldface) and the other argument as ARG1 (presented in italics).",

        "Section 6), it shows an affinity with the second clause.",
