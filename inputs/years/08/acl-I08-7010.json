        "discourse level annotations will enrich the sentence-level.",
        "In the rest of this section, we discuss the representation of the different types of connectives at the sentence level, and discuss how the discourse annotation will add to the information present in the dependency structures.",
        "Subordinating Conjunctions Subordinating conjunctions are lexically represented in the dependency tree, taking the subordinating clause as their dependents while themselves attaching to the main verb (the root of the tree).",
        "Figure 2 shows the dependency tree for Example (4) containing the subordinating conjunction '@tfffk'.",
        "Note that the edge between the connective and the main verb gives us the causal relation between the two clauses, the relation label being 'rh' (relation hetu 'cause').",
        "Thus, the discourse level can be taken to be completely represented at the sentence-level.",
        "Paired Subordinating Conjunctions Unlike Example (4), however, the analysis for the paired connective in Example (5), given in Figure 3, is insufficient.",
        "Despite the lexical representation of the connective in the tree, the correct interpretation of the paired conjunction and the clauses which it relates is only possible at the discourse level.",
        "In particular, the dependencies don't show that '@ffik' and '[sr#e' are two parts of the same connective, expressing a single relation and taking the same two arguments.",
        "Thus, the discourse annotation will be able to provide the appropriate argument structure and semantics for these paired connectives.",
        "Subordinators As mentioned earlier, Hindi nonfinite subordinate clauses almost always appear with overt marking.",
        "But unlike the subordinating conjunctions, subordinators are not lexically represented in the dependency trees.",
        "Figure 4 gives the dependency representation for Example (11) containing a postposition subordinator 'k kirV, which relates the main and subordinate clauses causally.",
        "As the figure shows, while the causal relation label ('rh') appears on the edge between the main and subordinate verbs, the subordinator itself is not lexically represented as the mediator of this relation.",
        "The lexically grounded annotation at the discourse level will thus provide the textual anchors of such relations, enriching the dependency representation.",
        "Furthermore, while many of the subordinators in Table 1 are fully specified in the dependency trees for the semantic relation they denote (e.g., 'pr' and 'if' marked as the 'k7t' (location in time) relation, and 'k kirV and 'ST' marked as the 'rh' (cause/reason) relation), others, like the particle 'he' are underspecified for their semantics, being marked only as 'vmod' (verbal modifier).",
        "The discourse-level annotation will thus be the source for the semantics of these subordinators.",
        "Coordinating Conjunctions Coordinating conjunctions at the sentence level anchor the root of the dependency tree.",
        "Figure 5 shows the",
        "The 6th Workshop on Asian Languae Resources, 2008",
        "dependency representation of Example (16) containing a coordinating conjunction.",

        "While the sentence-level dependency analysis here is similar to the one we get at the discourse level, the semantics of these conjunctions are again underspecified, being all marked as 'ccof', and can be obtained from the discourse level.",
        "Discourse Adverbials Like subordinating conjunctions, discourse adverbials are represented lexically in the dependency tree.",
        "They are attached to the verb of their clause as its child node and their denoted semantic relation is specified clearly.",
        "This can be seen with the temporal adverb 'tBt' ('then-only') and its semantic label 'k7t' in Figure 5.",
        "At the same time, since the Arg1 discourse argument of adverbials is most often in the prior context, the discourse annotation will enrich the semantics of these connectives by providing the Arg1 argument.",
        "Summary and Future Work",
        "In this paper, we have described our study of discourse connectives in a small corpus of Hindi texts in an effort towards developing an annotated corpus of discourse relations in Hindi.",
        "Adopting the lexically grounded approach of the Penn Discourse Treebank, we have identified a wide range of connectives, analyzing their types and distributions, and discussing some of the issues involved in the annotation.",
        "We also described the representation of the connectives in the sentence-level dependency annotation being carried out independently for Hindi, and discussed how the discourse annotations can enrich the information provided at the sentence level.",
        "While we focused on explicit connectives in this paper, future work will investigate the annotation of implicit connectives, the semantic classification of connectives, and the attribution of connectives and their arguments."
