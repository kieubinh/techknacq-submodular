        "In addition, Yami traditonal songs reflect Yami values, such as love and honoring hard work (e.g. fishing or farm work), and cultural events, such as completion of hard work and special festivals.",
        "Thus, we would like to build an ontology using Yami traditional songs, adapting the taxonomies in WordNet and SUMO, which can serve as a point of departure for further mapping of other Yami ontologies.",

        "The concept of \"reached the harbor\" is categorized into Input space I, and \"holding a ceremony celebrating the completion of a workhouse\" is categorized into Input space II.",
        "Both Inputs have certain similarities as well as distinct features.",
        "From Input Space I, \"fisherman,\" \"boat,\" \"fish,\" \"harbor,\" and \"to share his achievements and honor with his friends and relatives\" are respectively mapped into \"host/builder,\" \"new workhouse,\" \"taro,\" \"yard,\" and \"to share his achievements and honor with his friends and relatives,\" in Input Space II.",
        "The Inputs might share some cross-mapping properties, which can be listed in the Generic space.",
        "The structure from the two input mental spaces is projected into the Blend space.",
        "Essentially, which elements from Input space II should be selected and projected onto the blend space are determined by the contents of the lyric.",
        "Thus, in the blend space, all elements remain separate from their corresponding counterparts, but the relations among the features in Input space I determines the relations between corresponding counterparts.",
        "That is to say, the running structure in the blend space partially projected from Input space I determines the existing relations among the elements in the blend.",
        "In Input space I, a \"fisherman\" needs a \"boat\" to fish in the ocean, so the relation between \"fisherman\" and \"boat\" is a kind of \"earning a living.\"",
        "In addition, what a \"fisherman\" works for is \"fish.\"",
        "After the fisherman finishes his work, he has to go back to the harbor.",
        "Such relations also operate among those elements projected from Input space II.",
        "As a result, \"the host of the completion ceremony of a workhouse\" is the \"fisherman\" of the \"workhouse ceremony;\" the relation between \"the host\" and the \"workhouse ceremony\" is that of \"finishing a time-consuming job.\"",

        "Yami verbs subsume dynamic verbs and stative verbs (Rau and Dong, 2006).",
        "Based on the notions from WordNet, we further divided verbs into Bodily Function and Care Verbs, Change Verbs, Communication Verbs, Competition Verbs, Consumption Verbs, Contact Verbs, Cognition Verbs, Creation Verbs, Motion Verbs, Emotion or Psych Verbs, Stative Verbs, Perception Verbs, Possession Verbs, Social Interaction Verbs, and Weather Verbs.",
        "Since Yami does not possess a distinctive adjective word class, both descriptive and relational adjectives are in this study classified under stative verbs in WordNet.",
        "Descriptive adjectives subsume antonymy, gradation, markedness, polysemy and selectional preferences, reference-modifying adjectives, color adjectives, quantifiers, and participial adjectives.",
        "Relational adjectives include two domains, \"pertaining\" or \"relating to\" (Fellbaum 1999: 63).",
        "The coding of adjectives in this file is different from that of descriptive adjectives.",
        "Rather than being part of a cluster, each synset is entered individually, so that the interface will present the adjective with its related noun and information about the sense of the noun.",
        "For the aspect of Yami Nouns, we categorized the nouns into 10 basic noun categories following WordNet (Fellbaum, 1999: 30), including entity, abstraction, psycho-feature, natural phenomena, activity, event, group, location, possession, and state.",
        "The following example illustrates how we extracted the metaphorical words of \"fishing\" from the lyric and classfied them into their domains.",
        "Firstly, minangyid \"reached the harbor,\" avavangi \"row, sail something\" and voaz \"row something,\" were classified as Motion Verbs.",
        "Secondly, Jicamongan \"a place name of deep water,\" kalagarawan \"a place where fingerling fish swim\" and paneneneban \"shallow place,\" were categorized under the main section Location and",

        "To classify Yami metaphor, we made links (equivalent classes) between the literal meaning and the metaphorical meaning using Protégé.",
        "Since Input space I usually works as the source domain and Input space II as the target domain, we found that, at least in this case, this is a one-sided network of metaphor mapping.",
        "We thus employed the property \"mappings\" to define the relationship between \"reached the harbor\" and \"to hold a new workhouse celebration.\"",
        "Moreover, in order to set up the restrictions for searching words, we added the property \"hasConceptOf\".",
        "We then named the class expression of \"reached the harbor\" with the following restriction:",
        "has_concept_of some3 (harbor and4 fish and fisherman and boat and share) Similarly, we also provided the phrase \"to hold a new workhouse celebration\" with the following restriction:",
        "has_concept_of some (host and builder and workhouse and share and taro and yard)",
        "Finally, for the sake of correctly linking meanings of each word, the ontology builder can check the ontology with the DL Query Tab in Protégé.",
        "In summary, the connection between the two items minangyid, \"reached the harbor\" and \"to hold a new workhouse celebration,\" shown in shadow in Figure 4, is solely based on the structure of the inputs, since each of them are from a different domain of verbs.",
        "This structure is in harmony with Yami custom and contextual structure."
