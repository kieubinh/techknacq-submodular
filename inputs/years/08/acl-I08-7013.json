        "Research in Parts-of-Speech (POS) tagset design for European and East Asian languages started with a mere listing of important morphosyntactic features in one language and has matured in later years towards hierarchical tagsets, decomposable tags, common framework for multiple languages (EAGLES) etc.",

        "A POS tagset design should take into consideration all possible morphosyntactic categories that can occur in a particular language or group of languages (Hardie, 2004).",
        "Some effort has been made in the past, including the EAGLES guidelines for morphosyntactic annotation (Leech and Wilson, 1996) to define guidelines for a common tagset across multiple languages with an aim to capture more detailed morphosyntactic features of these languages.",
        "However, most of the tagsets for ILs are language specific and cannot be used for tagging data in other language.",
        "This disparity in tagsets hinders interoperability and reusability of annotated corpora.",
        "This further affects NLP research in resource poor ILs where non-availability of data, especially tagged data, remains a critical issue for researchers.",
        "Moreover, these tagsets capture the morphosyntac-tic features only at a shallow level and miss out the richer information that is characteristic of these languages.",
        "The work presented in this paper focuses on designing a common tagset framework for Indian languages using the EAGLES guidelines as a model.",
        "Though Indian languages belong to (mainly) four distinct families, the two largest being Indo-Aryan and Dravidian, as languages that have been in contact for a long period of time, they share significant similarities in morphology and syntax.",
        "This makes it desirable to design a common tagset framework that can exploit this similarity to facilitate the mapping of different tagsets to each other.",
        "This would not only allow corpora tagged with different tagsets for the same language to be reused but also achieve cross-linguistic compatibility between different language corpora.",
        "Most importantly, it will ensure that common categories of different languages are annotated in the same way.",
        "In the next section we will discuss the importance of a common standard vis-Ã -vis the currently available tagsets for Indian languages.",
        "Section 3 will provide the details of the design principles",

        "Some of the earlier POS tagsets were designed for English (Greene and Rubin, 1981; Garside, 1987; Santorini, 1990) in the broader context of automatic parsing of English text.",
        "These tagsets popular even today, though designed for the same language differ significantly from each other making the corpora tagged by one incompatible with the other.",
        "Moreover, as these are highly language specific tagsets they cannot be reused for any other language without substantial changes this requires standardization of POS tagsets (Hardie 2004).",
        "Leech and Wilson (1999) put forth a strong argument for the need to standardize POS tagset for reusability of annotated corpora and interoperability across corpora in different languages.",
        "EAGLES guidelines (Leech and Wilson 1996) were a result of such an initiative to create standards that are common across languages that share morphosyntactic features.",
        "Several POS tagsets have been designed by a number of research groups working on Indian Languages though very few are available publicly (IIIT-tagset, Tamil tagset).",
        "However, as each of these tagsets have been motivated by specific research agenda, they differ considerably in terms of morphosyntactic categories and features, tag definitions, level of granularity, annotation guidelines etc.",
        "Moreover, some of the tagsets (Tamil tagset) are language specific and do not scale across other Indian languages.",
        "This has led to a situation where despite strong commonalities between the languages addressed resources cannot be shared due to incompatibility of tasgets.",
        "This is detrimental to the development of language technology for Indian languages which already suffer from a lack of adequate resources in terms of data and tools.",
        "In this paper, we present a common framework for all Indian languages where an attempt is made to treat equivalent morphosyntactic phenomena consistently across all languages.",
        "The hierarchical design, discussed in detail in the next section, also allows for a systematic method to annotate language particular categories without disregarding the shared traits of the Indian languages."

        "Whilst several large projects have been concerned with tagset development very few have touched upon the design principles behind them.",
        "Leech some important examples presenting universal principles for tagset design.",
        "In this section we restrict the discussion to the principles behind our tagset framework.",
        "Importantly, we diverge from some of the universal principles but broadly follow them in a consistent way.",
        "Tagset structure: Flat tagsets just list down the categories applicable for a particular language without any provision for modularity or feature reusability.",
        "Hierarchical tagsets on the other hand are structured relative to one another and offer a well-defined mechanism for creating a common tagset framework for multiple languages while providing flexibility for customization according to the language and/ or application.",
        "Decomposability in a tagset allows different features to be encoded in a tag by separate sub-stings.",
        "Decomposable tags help in better corpus analysis (Leech 1997) by allowing to search with an underspecified search string.",
        "In our present framework, we have adopted the hierarchical layout as well as decomposable tags for designing the tagset.",
        "The framework will have three levels in the hierarchy with categories, types (subcategories) and features occupying the top, medium and the bottom layers.",
        "What to encode?",
        "One thumb rule for the POS tagging is to consider only the aspects of morpho-syntax for annotation and not that of syntax, semantics or discourse.",
        "We follow this throughout and focus only on the morphosyntactic aspects of the ILs for encoding in the framework.",
        "Morphology and Granularity: Indian languages have complex morphology with varying degree of richness.",
        "Some of the languages such as those of the Dravidian family also display agglutination as an important characteristic.",
        "This entails that morphological analysis is a desirable pre-process for the POS tagging to achieve better results in automatic tagging.",
        "We encode all possible morphosyn-tactic features in our framework assuming the exis-",
        "The 6th Workshop on Asian Languae Resources, 2008",
        "tence of morphological analysers and leave the choice of granularity to users.",
        "As pointed out by Leech (1997) some of the linguistically desirable distinctions may not be feasible computationally.",
        "Therefore, we ignore certain features that may not be computationally feasible at POS tagging level.",
        "Multi-words: We treat the constituents of Multi-word expressions (MWEs) like Indian Space Research Organization as individual words and tag them separately rather than giving a single tag to the entire word sequence.",
        "This is done because: Firstly, this is in accordance with the standard practice followed in earlier tagsets.",
        "Secondly, grouping MWEs into a single unit should ideally be handled in chunking.",
        "Form vs. function: We try to adopt a balance between form and function in a systematic and consistent way through deep analysis.",
        "Based on our analysis we propose to consider the form in normal circumstances and the function for words that are derived from other words.",
        "More details on this will be provided in the framework document (Baskaran et al. 2007)",
        "Theoretical neutrality: As Leech (1997) points out the annotation scheme should be theoretically neutral to make it clearly understandable to a larger group and for wider applicability.",
        "Diverse Language families: As mentioned earlier, we consider eight languages coming from two major language families of India, viz. Indo-Aryan and Dravidian.",
        "Despite the distinct characteristics of these two families, it is however striking to note the typological parallels between them, especially in syntax.",
        "For example, both families follow SOV pattern.",
        "Also, several Indo-Aryan languages such as Marathi, Bangla etc.",
        "exhibit some agglutination, though not to the same extent of Dravidian.",
        "Given the strong commonalities between the two families we decided to use a single framework for them"
