        "Mongolian researchers quite recently have begun to be involved in the research area of Natural Language Processing.",
        "All necessary linguistic resources, which are required for Mongolian language processing, have to be built from scratch, and then they should be shared in public research for the rapid development of Mongolian language processing.",
        "This ongoing research aims to build a tagged and parsed 5 million words corpus for Mongolian by developing a spell-checker, tagger, sentence-parser and others (see Figure 1 and 2).",
        "Also, we needed to develop a tagset for the corpus because there was not any tagset for Mongolian and the traditional words categories are not appropriate to it.",
        "Thus, we designed a high level tagset, which consists of 20 tags, and are further classifying them.",
        "Currently, we have collected and populated 500 thousand words, 50 thousand of which have been manually tagged, into the corpus (see Figure 1).",

      "text": [
        "We are building the corpus as sub-corpora, which are a raw corpus, a cleaned corpus, a tagged corpus and a parsed corpus, separately for various kinds of studying and use on Mongolian language (Figure 2).",
        "At first, we are collecting the editorial articles of Unen newspaper (Unen publish), which is one of",
        "The 6th Workshop on Asian Languae Resources, 2008",
        "the best written newspapers in Mongolia, by using OCR application.",
        "We will also collect laws, school book, and literary text (see Figure 3).",
        "Literary 1 million",
        "The corpus annotation follows TEI XML standard.",
        "According to the work scope, the annotating part is divided into two parts that are structural annotation such as paragraphs, sentences, and so on, and POS tagging.",
        "The structure of the text annotation is presented in Figure 4.",

        "<fileDesc/ > </teiHeader>",
        "For annotating two parts, once a manual corpus builder, called MCBuilder, were planned to develop, we have developed the first version and used to annotating 500 thousand word texts and tagging 50 of them (see Figure 5).",
        "MCBuilder has three main windows that are (1) manipulating and organizing the corpus, (2) annotating sample texts and (3) manipulating tagset as shown in Figure 5."

      "text": [
        "Mongolian language has hardly studied by computer, and its traditional rules such as inflectional, derivational, part of speech, sentence constituents, etc are extremely difficult to computerize.",
        "Our research works in the last few years showed it (Purev, 2006).",
        "Therefore, we are revising them by creating a corpus for computer processing.",
        "The proposals of this ongoing research are the first Mongolian 5 million words corpus, and tools that are spell-checker, tagger and parser.",
        "Currently, we have done followings:",
        "• Defined the corpus design, XML structure of the corpus text, and the high level tagset",
        "• Collected and annotated 500 thousand words text",
        "• Tagged 50 thousand words",
        "• Released the first version of a Mongolian corpus building tool called MCBuilder",
        "• First versions of Syllable-parser and Morph-analyzer for Mongolian",
        "We are planning to complete the corpus in the next two years."
