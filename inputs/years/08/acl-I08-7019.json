        "Moreover, all over the world, there have been a lot of test collections in many different languages, especially in English such as the Reuters-21578, the RCV1 and the 20NewsGroup1.",

        "Researchers usually use documents collected from e-newspapers because these documents are preprocessed and less ambiguous.",
        "Then an auto system tags documents in the XML (or SGML) formatting specification.",
        "After being coded, documents are manual edited by editors.",
        "The editors would assign the categories they felt applicable.",
        "They also edit specification tags of formatted documents in order to completely and more precisely describe attributes of documents.",
        "Lastly, to assess the accuracy of the test collection, we use some famous categorization algorithms such as SVM, k-NN, etc.",
        "Performing the test and correction several times, we will gradually obtain a finer and more precise test collection.",

        "Categories are organized in a hierarchical structure of 10 main classifications and 37 sub-classes.",
        "Documents are marked up with XML tags and given unique ID numbers.",
        "The XML specification of a document in the BKTexts test collection is described in Figure 2.",
        "Building a successful Vietnamese test collection for text categorization has a significant meaning.",
        "It will be a useful material for any study on text categorization and Vietnamese processing in the future because it reduces a lot of manual work and time, as well as increases the accuracy of experimental results."
