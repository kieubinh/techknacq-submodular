        "Statistical approaches to machine translation have been studied actively, after the formalism of statistical machine translation (SMT) is proposed by Brown et al.",
        "(1993).",
        "Although many approaches of them were effective, there are still lots of problems to solve.",
        "Among others, we have an interest in the problems occurring with long sentence decoding.",
        "Various problems occur when we try to translate long input sentences because a longer sentence contains more possibilities of selecting translation options and reordering phrases.",
        "However, reordering models in traditional phrase-based systems are not sufficient to treat such complex cases when we translate long sentences (Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "Some methods which can offer powerful reordering policies have been proposed like syntax based machine translation (Yamada and Knight, 2001) and Inversion Transduction Grammar (Wu, 1997).",
        "Although these approaches are effective, decoding long sentences is still difficult due to their computational complexity.",
        "As the length of an input sentence becomes longer, the analysis and decoding become more complex.",
        "The complexity causes approximations and errors inevitable during the decoding search.",
        "In order to reduce this kind of difficulty caused by the complexity, a long sentence can be paraphrased by several shorter sentences with the same meaning.",
        "Generally, however, decomposing a complex sentence into sub-sentences requires information of the sentence structures which can be obtained by syntactic or semantic analysis.",
        "Unfortunately, the high level syntactic and semantic analysis can be erroneous and costs as expensive as SMT itself.",
        "So, we don't want to fully analyze the sentences to get a series of sub-sentences, and our approach to this problem considers splitting only compound sentences.",
        "In the past years, many research works were concerned with sentence splitting methods to improve machine translation quality.",
        "This idea had been used in speech translation (Furuse et al., 1998) and example based machine translation (Doi and Sumita, 2004).",
        "These research works achieved meaningful results in terms of machine translation quality.",
        "Unfortunately, however, the method of Doi and Sumita using n-gram is not available if the source language is Korean.",
        "In Korean language, most of sentences have special form of ending morphemes at the end.",
        "For that reason, we should determine not only the splitting position but also the ending morphemes that we should replace instead of connecting morphemes.",
        "And the Furuse et al's method involves parsing which requires heavy cost.",
        "In this paper we propose a transformation based splitting method to improve machine translation quality which can be applied to the translation tasks with Korean as a source language."

      "text": [
        "Our task is splitting a long compound sentence into short sub-sentences to improve the performance of phrase-based statistical machine translation system.",
        "We use a transformation based approach to accomplish our goal.",
        "The transformation based learning (TBL) is a kind of rule learning methods.",
        "The formalism of TBL is introduced by Brill (1995).",
        "In past years, the TBL approach was used to solve various problems in natural language processing such as part of speech (POS) tagging and parsing (Brill, 1993).",
        "A transformation consists of two parts: a triggering environment and a rewriting rule.",
        "And the rewriting rule consists of a source pattern and a target pattern.",
        "Our consideration is how to get the right transformations and apply them to split the long sentences.",
        "A transformation works in the following manner; some portion of the input is changed by the rewriting rule if the input meets a condition specified in the triggering environment.",
        "The rewriting rule finds the source pattern in the input and replaces it with the target pattern.",
        "For example, suppose that a transformation which have a triggering environment A, source pattern B and target pattern C. We can describe this transformation as a sentence: if a condition A is satisfied by an input sentence, then replace pattern B in the input sentence with pattern C.",
        "Normally, we have two choices when there are two or more transformations available for an input pattern at the same time.",
        "The first choice is applying the transformation one by one, and the second choice is applying them simultaneously.",
        "The choice is up to the characteristics of the problem that we want to solve.",
        "In our problem, we choose the former strategy which is applying the transformations one by one, because it gives direct intuition about the process of splitting sentences.",
        "By choosing this strategy, we can design splitting process as a recursive algorithm.",
        "At first, we try to split an input sentence into two sub-sentences.",
        "If the sentence has been split by some transformation, the result involves exactly two sub-sentences.",
        "And then we try to split each sub-sentence again.",
        "We repeat this process in recursive manner until no sub-sentences are split.",
        "In the above process, a sentence is split into at most two sub-sentences through a single trial.",
        "In a single trial, a transformation works in the following manner: If an input sentence satisfies the environment, we substitute the source pattern into the target pattern.",
        "That is, replace the connecting morphemes with the proper ending morphemes.",
        "And then we split the sentence with predefined position in the transformation.",
        "And finally, we insert the junction word that is also predefined in the transformation between the split sentences after the sub sentences are translated independently.",
        "From the above process, we can notice easily that a transformation for sentence splitting consists of the four components: a triggering environment, a rewriting rule, a splitting position and a junction type.",
        "The contents of each component are as follows.",
        "(1) A triggering environment contains a sequence of morphemes with their POS tags.",
        "(2) A rewriting consists of a pair of sequences of POS tagged morphemes.",
        "(3) A junction type can have one of four types: 'and', 'or', 'but' and 'NULL'.",
        "(4) A splitting position is a non-negative integer that means the position of starting word of second sub-sentence.",
        "At the training phase, TBL process determines the order of application (or rank) of the transformations to minimize the error-rate defined by a specific measure.",
        "The order is determined by choosing the best rule for a given situation and applying the best rule for each situation iteratively.",
        "In the sentence splitting task, we maximize the machine translation quality with BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2001) instead of minimizing the error of sentence splitting.",
        "During the training phase, we determine the order of applying transformation after we build a set of transformations.",
        "To build the set of transformations, we need manually split examples to learn the transformations.",
        "Building a transformation starts from extracting a rewriting rule by calculating edit-distance matrix between an original sentence and its split form from the corpus.",
        "We can easily extract the different parts from the matrix.",
        "BaseBLEU := BLEU score of the baseline system",
        "S := Split example sentence",
        "T := Extracted initial transformation for each te T for each seS while true try to split s with t if mis-splitting is occurred",
        "Expand environment else exit while loop if environment cannot be expanded exit while loop S' := apply t to S Decode S'",

        "Window 1 Morpheme; POS taa; Botmdaiy Sub-sentence Sub-sentence Re-H'iiting Rule : Change A to ending in oiphew e followed by a Junction.",
        "From the difference pattern, we can make the source pattern of a rewriting rule by taking the different parts of the original sentence side.",
        "Similarly, the target pattern can be obtained from the different parts of split form.",
        "And the junction type and splitting position are directly obtained from the difference pattern.",
        "Finally, the transformation is completed by setting the triggering environment as same to the source pattern.",
        "The set of initial transformations is obtained by repeating this process on all the examples.",
        "The Transformations for sentence splitting are built from the initial transformations through expanding process.",
        "In the expanding process, each rule is applied to the split examples.",
        "We expand the triggering environment with some heuristics (in section 2.4), if a sentence is a mis-split.",
        "And finally, in order to determine the rank of each transformation, we sorted the extracted transformations by decreasing order of resulted BLEU scores after applying the transformation to each training sentence.",
        "And some transformations are discarded if they decrease the BLEU score.",
        "This process is different from original TBL.",
        "The modified TBL learning process is described in figure 1.",
        "Expanding environment should be treated very carefully.",
        "If the environment is too specific, the transformation cannot be used in real situation.",
        "On the other hand, if it is too general, then the transformation becomes erroneous.",
        "Our main strategy for expanding the environment is to increase context window size of the triggering environment one by one until it causes no error on the training sentences.",
        "In this manner, we can get minimal error-free transformations on the sentence splitting corpus.",
        "We use two different windows to define a triggering environment: one for morpheme and another for its part of speech (POS) tag.",
        "Figure 2 shows this concept of two windows.",
        "The circles correspond to sequences of morphemes and POS tags in a splitting example.",
        "Window 1 represents a morpheme context and window 2 represents a POS tag context.",
        "The windows are independently expanded from the initial environment which consists of a morpheme 'A' and its POS tag.",
        "In the figure, window 1 is expanded to one forward morpheme and one backward morpheme while window 2 is expanded to two backward POS tags.",
        "In order to control these windows, we defined some heuristics by specifying the following three policies of expanding windows: no expansion, forward only and forward and backward.",
        "From those three polices, we have 9 combinations of heuristics because we have two windows.",
        "By observing the behavior of these heuristics, we can estimate what kind of information is most important to determine the triggering environment.",
        "We have at most 4 choices for a single step of the expanding procedure: forward morpheme, backward morpheme, forward POS tag, and backward POS tag.",
        "We choose one of them in a fixed order: forward POS tag, forward morpheme, backward POS tag and backward morpheme.",
        "These choices can be limited by 9 heuristics.",
        "For example, suppose that we use a heuristic with forward policy on morpheme context window and no expansion policy for POS tag context window.",
        "In this case we have only one choice: forward morpheme."
