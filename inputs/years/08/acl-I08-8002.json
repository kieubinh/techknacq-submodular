        "Thai ASR research focused on two major topics.",
        "The first topic aimed to practice ASR in real environments, whereas the second topic moved towards large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) in rather spontaneous styles such as news broadcasting and telephone conversation.",
        "Following subsections give more details.",
        "To tackle the problem of noisy environments, acoustic model selection was adopted in our system.",
        "A tree structure was constructed with each leaf node containing speaker-, noise-, and/or SNR-specific acoustic model.",
        "The structure allowed efficient searching over a variety of speech environments.",
        "Similar to many robust ASR systems, the selected acoustic model was enhanced by adapting by the input speech using any adaptation algorithm such as MLLR or MAP.",
        "In our model, however, simulated-data adaptation was proposed (That-phithakkul et al., 2006).",
        "The method synthesized an adaptation set by adding noise extracted from the input speech to a pre-recorded set of clean speech.",
        "A speech/non-speech detection module determined in the input speech the silence portions, which were assumed to be the environmental noise.",
        "This approach solved the problem of incorrect transcription in unsupervised adaptation and enhanced the adaptation performance by increasing the size of adaptation data.",
        "During the last few years, researches on continuous speech recognition were based mainly on two databases, the NECTEC-ATR (Kasuriya et al., 2003a) and the LOTUS (Kasuriya et al., 2003b).",
        "The former corpus was for general purposes, whereas the latter corpus was well designed for research on acoustic phonetics as well as research on 5,000-word dictation systems.",
        "A number of research works were reported, starting by optimizing the Thai phoneme inventory (Kanokphara, 2003).",
        "Recently, research has moved closer to real and spontaneous speech.",
        "The first task collaborated with a Thai telephone service provider was to build a telephone conversation corpus (Cotsomrong et al., 2007).",
        "To accelerate the corpus development, Thatphithakkul et al.",
        "(2007) developed a speaker segmentation model which helped separating speech from two speakers being conversed.",
        "The model was based on the simple Hidden Markov model (HMM), which achieved over 70% accuracy.",
        "Another ongoing task is a collection of broadcast news video.",
        "The aim of the task is to explore the possibility to use the existing read-speech model to boot broadcast news transcription.",

        "The task is much more difficult than the original English-to-Thai translation since the Thai word segmentation, sentence breaking, and grammar parser are all not complete.",
        "Coding rules for parsing Thai is not trivial and the existing approach used to translate English to Thai cannot be applied counter wise.",
        "Last year, a novel rule-based approach appropriate for Thai was proposed (Boonkwan and Supnithi, 2007).",
        "The approach, called memory-inductive categorical grammar (MICG), was derived from the categorical grammar (CG).",
        "The MICG introduced memorization and induction symbols to solve problems of analytic languages such as Thai as well as many spoken languages.",
        "In parsing Thai, there are two major problems, coordination with gapping and verb serialization.",
        "Figure 1 shows examples of the two problems with the MICG solution, where the square symbol denotes the chunk to be memorized and the diamond symbol denotes the chunk to be induced.",
        "A missing text chunk can be induced by seeking for its associated memorized text chunk.",
        "In order to improve the performance of our translation service, we have adopted a translation memory (TM) module in which translation results corrected by users are stored and reused.",

        "Statistical machine translation (SMT) has played an important role on modeling translation given a large amount of parallel text.",
        "In NECTEC, we also realize the benefit of SMT especially on its adaptability and naturalness of translation results.",
        "However, a drawback of SMT compared to RBMT is that it works quite well on a limited domain, i.e. translating in a specific domain.",
        "This is actually suitable to the S2S engine which has been designed to work in only a travel domain.",
        "Therefore, in parallel to RBMT, SMT is being explored for limited domains.",

        "Scalability and adaptability of such huge database become a critical issue.",
        "We then need the most compact speech corpus that still provides acceptable speech quality.",
        "An efficient way to reduce the size of corpus was recently proposed (Wutiwiwatchai et al., 2007).",
        "The method incorporated Thai phonetics knowledge in the design of phoneme/diphone inventory.",
        "Two assumptions on diphone characteristics were proved and used in the new design.",
        "One was to remove from the inventory the diphone whose coarticulation strength between adjacent phonemes was very weak.",
        "Normally, the corpus was designed to cover all tonal diphones in Thai.",
        "The second strategy to reduce the corpus was to ignore tonal levels of unvoiced phonemes.",
        "Experiments showed approximately 30% reduction of the speech corpus with the quality of synthesized speech remained.",
        "The baseline TTS system selected speech units by considering only phoneme and tone context.",
        "In the past few years, analyses and modeling Thai prosodic features useful for TTS have been extensively explored.",
        "The first issue was to detect phrasal units given an input text.",
        "After several experiments (Tesprasit et al., 2003; Hansakunbun-theung et al., 2005), we decided to develop a classification and decision tree (CART) for phrase break detection.",
