        "The title of this column, Last Words, reminds me of an occasion in 2005, when I had the privilege of attending the award ceremony for the prestigious Benjamin Franklin Medal, given annually to a fewscientists who have made outstanding lifetime contributions to science.",
        "This time, a computational linguist, Aravind Joshi, was among them, so several past, present, and future presidents and officers of the ACL joined the Great and the Good at the ceremony at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia.",
        "The eight medal recipients were each represented by a short video presentation, which mostly consisted of voice-over by a narrator, interspersed with sound-bites from the recipients about their life and work, in the last of which they had clearly been asked to deliver as their last words a brief take-home message.",
        "I couldn't help noticing that the warmest applause was reserved for the physicist, a distinguished pioneer of string theory.",
        "I was initially puzzled by the enthusiasm on the part of a mostly lay audience for such theoretical work, which for all its elegance and beauty, could not (as far as I could see) be expected to have nearly as much impact on their everyday lives as that of some of the other recipients, who that year included not only Aravind, but another computer scientist whose impact on information processing will be obvious to the members of ACL, Andrew Viterbi.",
        "But then I recalled that the physicist's take-home message had had nothing to do with string theory.",
        "This admirable man's last words to us had been the following: Everything is made of particles.",
        "So physics is very important."

        "I realized then that what we were applauding was not a physicist, or the beauty of string theory, but physics itself.",
        "I was reminded that physicists are looked on as public intellectuals who can be relied on to deliver Truth, and who are generally assumed to be doing A Good Job, even when they say that the universe must really be ten-dimensional, except that exactly six of the dimensions are curled up so tightly that there is no conceivable way of detecting them, nor any prospect of bringing to bear the huge energies that would be required to straighten them out a bit so we could take a look at them.",
        "(As many of you will know, I Am Not Making This Up.)",

        "E-mail: steedman@inf.ed.ac.uk.",
        "These remarks are excerpted from the author's Presidential Address to the 45th Annual Meeting of the ACL, Prague, June 2007.",
        "I'm grateful to that audience; to Mona Diab, Julia Hockenmaier, Miles Osborne, and Bonnie Webber for comments and advice; and to Franz Och for Google Language Tools.",
        "Howdifferent this public image is from that of computational linguistics, or of artificial intelligence, and even core computer science.",
        "To the extent that the public thinks at all about what we do, they think of us as producing gadgets, such as amusing newsorts of telephone.",
        "Only the other day, a colleague was called up by someone in a neighboring department asking if we could mend his PC for him.",
        "(\"Don't you have a Little Man?",
        "You used to have a Little Man.\")",
        "As a result, computer science is continually subjected to governmental reviews seeking assurance that we know what we are doing, and are doing enough for the economy.",
        "Many of these reviews draw very negative conclusions – the 1966 report of the Automatic Language Processing Advisory Committee (ALPAC) of the US National Academy of Sciences effectively shut down research in machine translation for over a decade, and was the main reason for ACL changing its name in 1968 from the Association for Machine Translation and Computational Linguistics (AMTCL).",
        "The 1973 report of Sir James Lighthill (a fluid dynamicist known for his foundational work in the field of aeroacoustics) to the UK Science Research Council (SRC) closed down artificial intelligence and NLP research for a decade, until the Alvey report decided that British industry had fallen behind in this area, and opened it up again.",
        "There have been many similar examples since then, though fewas catastrophic.",
        "Nobody goes around telling physicists what not to work on, or setting up commissions chaired by complete outsiders (roboticists or computational linguists, perhaps?)",
        "to decide whether physicists are earning their keep.",
        "The physicists tell the goverment what they think it is right to do, and the government either funds it or it doesn't.",
        "Even when it doesn't, as in the case of the superconducting supercollider, it's because they can't afford it, or lack the political power, not because of lowesteem.",
        "Howdo the physicists",
        "Of course, as Duke Ellington said when asked how he kept his band together through the Beatles' era, you have to have a gimmick.",
        "The physicists gave us atomic energy and the bomb, so no one can ever suggest again that they do not deliver Bang for the Buck, even when they actually don't, as may well turn out to be the case for the past twenty years or so of research in string theory and supersymmetry.",
        "However, it is far more important that physics consists of a body of great empirically proven laws that all scientists recognize, from the laws of thermodynamics to the special and general theories of relativity and quantum theory.",
        "This body of knowledge lends both authority, and a breadth of vision that transcends any individual physicist's work and any individual theory, even if parts of it can be temporarily ignored when convenient.",
        "But we too have awesome devices.",
        "Search engines have arguably changed people's lives at least as profoundly as atomic energy.",
        "The statistical machine translation tools that Google launched around May 2006 with Arabic for all the world to freely betatest, and which have since been extended to Chinese, Russian, Japanese, and Korean, imperfect as they are, may well have an even bigger impact.",
        "Our colleagues in AI rejoice in beating international chess Grand Masters with Deep Blue, and boast of robots on Mars and autonomous vehicles charging around the Mojave desert.",
        "Computer science has the Internet itself to showoff.",
        "We too have discovered great truths – Zipf's Law, Information Theory, the power of statistically approximate language models, the only-just-trans-context-free automata-theoretic level of natural languages, the surface-compositionality of natural language",
        "1 For a recent reviewof this question, see Smolin 2006.",
        "semantics, and have dreams of a grand unified head dependency-driven Theory of Everything that that will one day make probabilistic and deterministic components work together to yield Meaning.",
        "How come we don't get respect?",
        "The answer, I'm afraid, is that we haven't yet managed to form ourselves into a discipline, within which those important truths are respected and held beyond reasonable doubt, in whose name we stand united in the eyes of the world.",
        "Instead, our history has been sectarian, with dominant factions seeking to suppress proposals that diverge too much from the current orthodoxy, until they too are overthrown.",
        "This tendency is very evident in computer science peer reviewof proposals to funding agencies, which are notably harsher than in other sciences, and which have the effect of making the agencies assume a shortage of good science in the field, so that they reduce funding accordingly.",
        "Worse still, when we have theoretical disagreements, we play them out in public.",
        "(The split between connectionists and the rest of AI/NLP is a case in point.",
        "It is sad to note that similar internal dissension seems to have played a role in the adverse conclusions reached in both the ALPAC and Lighthill reports.)",
        "The physicists don't do this.",
        "When they reviewproposals, they rate them excellent at around twice the rate in CS, even if it means not getting funded themselves in the current round.",
        "The funding agencies conclude that there is a surplus of good science there, and seek or allocate further funding for the next round.",
        "When there are disagreements – as there seem to be currently about string theory – they are argued out behind closed doors, until a consensus can be reached and be presented to the general public.",
        "The biologists behaved similarly over a recent disagreement concerning methods for sequencing the genome.",
        "One measure of our own fisiparous tendencies is that, while from the 1950s to the 1980s, the information theoreticians and statistical modelers among us used to make common cause with the linguists, we have subsequently drifted apart.",
        "We have come to believe that the linguists have forgotten Zipf's law, which says that most of the variance in language behavior can be captured by a small part of the system.",
        "The linguists, on the other hand, think that it is we who have forgotten Zipf's law, which also says that most of the information about the language system as a whole is in the Long Tail.",
        "It is we who are at fault here, because the machine learning techniques that we rely on are actually very bad at inducing systems for which the crucial information is in rare events – like physics, for example.",
        "There is a grave danger here for the future of our putative discipline.",
        "One day, either because of the demise of Moore's law, or simply because we have done all the easy stuff, the Long Tail will come back to haunt us.",
        "For example, consider the current state of our former nemesis MT."

        "Machine translation (MT) was one of the earliest applications envisaged for computing machinery.",
        "Weaver (1949) identified the extreme ambiguity of natural language as the central problem of MT, and outlined as possible solutions not only the \"noisy channel\" model of SMT and its basis in n-gram language models, investigated with Claude Shannon (Shannon and Weaver 1949), but also the notion of parsing as logical deduction, and the interlingua-based syntax-driven approach to MT, which he based on the linguists' notion of Universal Grammar.",
        "(No sectarianism there,atleast.)",
        "It is interesting that, in that bright dawn, MT seemed likely to prove one of the easier cognitive tasks to mimic by machine.",
        "There seemed to be a real possibility that there might be ways to bypass understanding altogether using simple purely syntactic and probabilistic devices.",
        "Over the next few years, there was a gradual disillusion with this expectation, for at least three reasons.",
        "First, Chomsky (1957) showed beyond a reasonable doubt that natural languages not only fell outside the class that could be completely recognized using finite-state machines of the class implicit in Shannon's models, but also fell outside the class that could be adequately represented by context-free grammars.",
        "It wasn't immediately clear howto translate such grammars into computational terms, and they appeared to break the unity of grammar and probabilistic model that had been one of the attractions of the information-theoretic approach (although Chomsky was careful to acknowledge the possibility of statistically approximating such grammars with Markov processes for the purpose of reducing ambiguity).",
        "Second, it became clear that the grammars that were needed for real texts, even within narrow genres like newspaper text or scientific papers, were very large indeed.",
        "The lack of computational transparency of grammar formalisms tended to give the hand-built grammars of this period the character of unstructured programs, with no apparent prospect of inducing them automatically.",
        "Third, the problem of ambiguity for grammars of this size was much worse than anyone had expected.",
        "As a result, opinion changed, and MT became seen as one of the hardest cognitive problems, requiring deep understanding of semantics and knowledge of the world, as well as full syntactic processing.",
        "There is an often-repeated story about these days (one which has all the hallmarks of a myth) concerning a demonstration of an early Russian dictionary-based MT system using back-translation from English to Russian and back again.",
        "According to legend, the demonstrators were disconcerted to find that the sentence Time flies like an arrow returned as Time flies enjoy arrows, revealing a syntactic analysis of the sentence that would have been appropriate for the sentence Fruit flies like a banana.",
        "Of course we nowknowthat the problem of the 1950s and 1960s was the lack of language models, of a kind that is nowcommonplace, thanks to Moore's lawand HMMs, together with a method for learning such models and integrating them with structural rules.",
        "Some real progress has been made, and MT is once again thought of as an \"easy\" problem, that can be at least partly solved with relatively low-level methods."

        "2 There are many variants of this apocryphal story, involving other examples, all of which are likely to have their origin in much older jests about human dictionary-based translation (Hutchins 1995).",
        "On the basis of the result of the back-translation, this looks OK, give or take a bit of morphology, but of course end-to-end back-translation is a very weak test, where you can just get lucky.",
        "Readers of Arabic will notice that the translation of like is indeed a comparative, not a verb meaning enjoy, as in the legend.",
        "However, they will also notice that flies translates as the noun, rather than the verb, just as the story foretold.",
        "If we try the same test on Fruit flies like a banana, the flies are still insects, but like is still comparative, rather than a verb.",

        "We have one theory for talking about phenomena on a large scale, just as they have the General Theory of Relativity, and another theory for talking about the very small scale, just as they have Quantum Theory.",
        "Like the physicists, we have difficulty in reconciling those theoretical levels.",
        "Like them, some of us think it's fine to have two theories, whereas others of us think it's intolerable.",

        "Nevertheless, to the other kind of computational linguist, it sounds depressingly like getting better and better at recalling what is already well-known, and understanding what has often been said before.",
        "They point out that, in the long run, finite state methods alone may simply not work.",
        "Accuracy in most areas (WER in ASR, BLEU score in SMT, Eval-b for parsers) is at best linear in the logarithm of the amount of training data.",

        "2007).",
        "Moreover, the more of the local stuff we get right, the more users will come to trust the software, and hence the more noticeable long range dependencies will become, and the more upset people will get if they are deceived by a wrong analysis.",
        "What this should tell us is that the Long Tail is not mocked.",
        "Long-range dependencies of the kind investigated above are semantically crucial.",
        "Ignoring them disrupts all the other dependencies in those examples.",
        "(They are also more frequent in genres like questions.)",
        "So we need to remember – and above all, teach our students – what our discipline tells us the problem is, even when it's not doing much for our BLEU score.",
        "In this connection, it is encouraging to see that many of the MT papers in the 2007 ACL explicitly invoked syntax-level representations.",
        "But we need to do more than this.",
        "To get respect, and avoid the risk of yet another AI/NLP Winter, we will need to pull ourselves together as a discipline, lift our eyes above our rivalries, and take a longer view of where we are going (and where we have come from) than seems to be the current style.",
        "This will probably require a gradual move to a more considered and authoritative style of publication, with journal articles taking the place of hastily written and reviewed conference papers, as another author of this column recently suggested.",
        "It will mean speaking with one voice, as the physicists and biologists do, and supporting a diversity of views that transcends fashion and funding, wherever the science is good.",
        "It also means telling the public in honest terms howto think about what we do, what can be relied on and what the really hard problems are, in good times and bad.",
        "This should not be too difficult if we keep reminding them and ourselves of the following:",
