        "The PropBank project (Kingsbury and Palmer 2002; Palmer, Gildea, and Kingsbury 2005), which provides a large human-annotated corpus of verb predicates and their arguments, has enabled researchers to apply machine learning techniques to develop SRL systems (Gildea and Palmer 2002; Chen and Rambow 2003; Gildea and Hockenmaier 2003; Pradhan et al.",

        "Therefore, the overall performance of the system is largely determined by the quality of the automatic syntactic parsers of which the state of the art (Collins 1999; Charniak 2001) is still far from perfect.",
        "Alternatively, shallow syntactic parsers (i.e., chunkers and clausers), although they do not provide as much information as a full syntactic parser, have been shown to be more robust in their specific tasks (Li and Roth 2001).",
        "This raises the very natural and interesting question of quantifying the importance of full parsing information to semantic parsing and whether it is possible to use only shallow syntactic information to build an outstanding SRL system.",
        "Although PropBank is built by adding semantic annotations to the constituents in the Penn Treebank syntactic parse trees, it is not clear how important syntactic parsing is for an SRL system.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this problem was first addressed by Gildea and Palmer (2002).",
        "In their attempt to use limited syntactic information, the parser they used was very shallow – clauses were not available and only chunks were used.",
        "Moreover, the pruning stage there was very strict – only chunks were considered as argument candidates.",
        "This results in over 60% of the actual arguments being ignored.",
        "Consequently, the overall recall in their approach was very low.",
        "The use of only shallow parsing information in an SRL system has largely been ignored until the recent CoNLL-2004 shared task competition (Carreras and Marquez 2004).",
        "In that competition, participants were restricted to using only shallow parsing information, which included part-of-speech tags, chunks, and clauses (the definitions of chunks and clauses can be found in Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz [2000] and Carreras et al.",
        "[2002], respectively).",
        "As a result, the performance of the best shallow parsing-based system (Hacioglu et al.",
        "2004) in the competition is about 10 points in F1 below the best system that uses full parsing information (Koomen et al.",
        "2005).",
        "However, this is not the outcome of a true and fair quantitative comparison.",
        "The CoNLL-2004 shared task used only a subset of the data for training, which potentially makes the problem harder.",
        "Furthermore, an SRL system is usually complicated and consists of several stages.",
        "It was still unclear how much syntactic information helps and precisely where it helps the most.",
        "The goal of this paper is threefold.",
        "First, we describe an architecture for an SRL system that incorporates a level of global inference on top of the relatively common processing steps.",
        "This inference step allows us to incorporate structural and linguistic constraints over the possible outcomes of the argument classifier in an easy way.",
        "The inference procedure is formalized via an Integer Linear Programming framework and is shown to yield state-of-the-art results on this task.",
        "Second, we provide a fair comparison between SRL systems that use full parse trees and systems that only use shallow syntactic information.",
        "As with our full syntactic parse-based SRL system (Koomen et al.",
        "2005), our shallow parsing-based SRL system is based on the system that achieves very competitive results and was one of the top systems in the CoNLL-2004 shared task competition (Carreras and Marquez 2004).",
        "This comparison brings forward a careful analysis of the significance of full parsing information in the SRL task, and provides an understanding of the stages in the process in which this information makes the most difference.",
        "Finally, to relieve the dependency of the SRL system on the quality of",
        "Importance of Parsing and Inference in SRL",
        "automatic parsers, we suggest a way to improve semantic role labeling significantly by developing a global inference algorithm, which is used to combine several SRL systems based on different state-of-the-art full parsers.",
        "The combination process is done through a joint inference stage, which takes the output of each individual system as input and generates the best predictions, subject to various structural and linguistic constraints.",
        "The underlying system architecture can largely affect the outcome of our study.",
        "Therefore, to make the conclusions of our experimental study as applicable as possible to general SRL systems, the architecture of our SRL system follows the most widely used two-step design.",
        "In the first step, the system is trained to identify argument candidates for a given verb predicate.",
        "In the second step, the system classifies the argument candidates into their types.",
        "In addition, it is also a simple procedure to prune obvious non-candidates before the first step, and to use post-processing inference to fix inconsistent predictions after the second step.",
        "These two additional steps are also employed by our system.",
        "Our study of shallow and full syntactic information-based SRL systems was done by comparing their impact at each stage of the process.",
        "Specifically, our goal is to investigate at what stage full parsing information is most helpful relative to a shallow parsing-based system.",
        "Therefore, our experiments were designed so that the compared systems are as similar as possible, and the addition of the full parse tree-based features is the only difference.",
        "The most interesting result of this comparison is that although each step of the shallow parsing information-based system exhibits very good performance, the overall performance is significantly inferior to the system that uses full parsing information.",
        "Our explanation is that chaining multiple processing stages to produce the final SRL analysis is crucial to understanding this analysis.",
        "Specifically, the quality of the information passed from one stage to the other is a decisive issue, and it is not necessarily judged simply by considering the F-measure.",
        "We conclude that, for the system architecture used in our study, the significance of full parsing information comes into play mostly at the pruning stage, where the candidates to be processed later are determined.",
        "In addition, we produce a state-of-the-art SRL system by combining different SRL systems based on two automatic full parsers (Collins 1999; Charniak 2001), which achieves the best result in the CoNLL-2005 shared task (Carreras and Marquez 2005).",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 introduces the task of semantic role labeling in more detail.",
        "Section 3 describes the four-stage architecture of our SRL system, which includes pruning, argument identification, argument classification, and inference.",
        "The features used for building the classifiers and the learning algorithm applied are also explained there.",
        "Section 4 explains why and where full parsing information contributes to SRL by conducting a series of carefully designed experiments.",
        "Inspired by the result, we examine the effect of inference in a single system and propose an approach that combines different SRL systems based on joint inference in Section 5.",
        "Section 6 presents the empirical evaluation of our system in the CoNLL-2005 shared task competition.",

        "In addition, there are also 13 types of adjuncts labeled as AM-adj where adj specifies the adjunct type.",
        "For simplicity in our presentation, we will also refer to these adjuncts as arguments.",

In other words, this objective function reflects the expected number of correct argument predictions, subject to the constraints.",

        "That led to the conclusion that full parsing information is necessary to solving the SRL problem, especially at the stage of argument identification – a finding that is quite similar to ours in this article.",
        "However, their chunk-based approach was very weak – only chunks were considered as possible candidates; hence, it is not very surprising that the boundaries of the arguments could not be reliably found.",
        "In contrast, our shallow parse-based system does not have these restrictions on the argument boundaries and therefore performs much better at this stage, providing a more fair comparison.",
        "A related comparison can be found also in the work by Pradhan, Hacioglu, Krugler et al.",
        "(2005) (their earlier version appeared in Pradhan et al.",
        "[2003]), which reported the performance on several systems using different information sources and system architectures.",
        "Their shallow parse-based system is modeled as a sequence tagging problem while the full system is a constituent-by-constituent based two-stage system.",
        "Due to technical difficulties, though, they reported the results of the chunk-based systems only on a subset of the full data set.",
        "Their shallow parse-based system achieved 60.4% precision and 51.4% recall and their full system achieved 80.6% precision and 67.1% recall on the same data set (but 84% precision and 75% recall with the full data set).",
        "Therefore, due to the use of different architectures and data set sizes, the questions of \"how much one can gain from full parsing over shallow parsing when using the full PropBank data set\" and \"what are the sources of the performance gain\" were left open.",
        "Similarly, in the CoNLL-2004 shared task (Carreras and Marquez 2004), participants were asked to develop SRL systems with the restriction that only shallow parsing information (i.e., chunks and clauses) were allowed.",
        "The performance of the best system was at 72.43% precision and 66.77% recall, which was about 10 points in F1 lower than the best system based on full parsing in the literature.",
        "However, the training examples were derived from only 5 sections and not all the 19 sections usually used in the standard setting.",
        "Hence, the question was not yet fully answered.",
        "Our experimental study, on the other hand, is done with a consistent architecture, by considering each stage in a controlled manner, and using the full data set, allowing one to draw direct conclusions regarding the impact of this information source."

        "This paper studies the important task of semantic role labeling.",
        "We presented an approach to SRL and a principled and general approach to incorporating global information in natural language decisions.",
        "Beyond presenting this approach which leads to a state-of-the-art SRL system, we focused on investigating the significance of using full parse tree information as input to an SRL system adhering to the most common system architecture, and the stages in the process where this information has the most impact.",
        "We performed a detailed and fair experimental comparison between shallow and full parsing information and concluded that, indeed, full syntactic information can improve the performance of an SRL system.",
        "In particular, we have shown that this information is most crucial in the pruning stage of the system, and relatively less important in the following stages.",
        "Importance of Parsing and Inference in SRL",
        "In addition, we showed the importance of global inference to good performance in this task, characterized by rich structural and linguistic constraints among the predicted labels of the arguments.",
        "Our integer linear programming-based inference procedure is a powerful and flexible optimization strategy that finds the best solution subject to these constraints.",
        "As we have shown, it can be used to resolve conflicting argument predictions in an individual system but can also serve as an effective and simple approach to combining different SRL systems, resulting in a significant improvement in performance.",
        "In the future, we plan to extend our work in several directions.",
        "By adding more constraints to the inference procedure, an SRL system may be further improved.",
        "Currently, the constraints are provided by human experts in advance.",
        "Learning both hard and statistical constraints from the data will be our top priority.",
        "Some work on combining statistical and declarative constraints has already started and is reported in Roth and Yih (2005).",
        "Another issue we want to address is domain adaptation.",
        "It has been clearly shown in the CoNLL-2005 shared task that the performance of current SRL systems degrades significantly when tested on a corpus different from the one used in training.",
        "This may be due to the underlying components, especially the syntactic parsers which are very sensitive to changes in data genre.",
        "Developing a better model that more robustly combines these components could be a promising direction.",
        "In addition, although the shallow parsing-based system was shown here to be inferior, shallow parsers were shown to be more robust than full parsers (Li and Roth 2001).",
        "Therefore, combining these two systems may bring forward both of their advantages.",
