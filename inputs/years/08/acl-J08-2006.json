        "This variation in senses in Brown is probably the reason that adding sense information helps more for the Brown test set.",

        "Therefore, data sparseness is another potential reason that the importance of the predicate sense feature does not reflect in the performance numbers.",

For the combined task, the gap between the performance for conditions B and C is about 10 F-score points apart (59.1 vs. 69.8).",

        "When ASSERT is trained on Brown using a syntactic parser also trained on Brown, we get a quite similar classification performance, which is again about 5 points lower than what we get using all WSJ data.",
        "Finally, looking at conditions C and D we find that the difference in performance on the combined task of identification and classification using the Brown corpus for training ASSERT is very close (69.8 vs. 68.9) even though the syntactic parser used in C has a performance that is about 3.2 points worse than that used in D. This indicates that better parse structure is less important than lexical semantic coverage for obtaining better performance on the Brown corpus."

        "In this article, we have presented results from a state-of-the-art Semantic Role Labeling system trained on PropBank WSJ data and then used to label test sets from both the WSJ corpus and the Brown corpus.",
        "The system's performance on the Brown test set exhibited a large drop compared to the WSJ test set.",
        "An analysis of these results revealed that the subtask of Identification, determining which constituents of a syntax tree are arguments of a predicate, is responsible for only a relatively small part of the drop in performance.",
        "The Classification task, assigning labels to constituents known to be arguments, is where the major performance loss occurs.",
        "Several possible factors were examined to determine their effect on this performance difference:",
        "• The syntactic parser was trained on WSJ.",
        "It was shown that errors in the syntactic parse are not a large factor in the overall performance difference.",
        "The syntactic parser does not show a large degradation in performance when run on Brown.",
        "Even more telling, there is still a large drop in performance when training and testing using Treebank parses.",
        "When the system was trained and tested on Brown, the performance was still significantly worse than training and testing on WSJ, even when the amount of training data is controlled for.",
        "Training and testing on Brown showed performance intermediate between training and testing on WSJ and training on WSJ and testing on Brown.",
        "This leads to our final hypothesis.",
        "• The Brown corpus is in some sense fundamentally more difficult for this problem.",
        "The most obvious reason for this is that it represents a more heterogeneous source than the WSJ.",
        "Among the likely manifestations of this is that predicates tend to have a single dominating sense in WSJ and are more polysemous in Brown.",
        "Data was presented using gold-standard word sense information for the predicates for training and testing Brown.",
        "Adding predicate sense information has a large effect for some predicates, but over the whole Brown test set has only a small effect.",
        "Fewer predicates and headwords could allow very specific modeling of high frequency predicates, and predicate-headword relations do have a large effect on overall performance.",
        "The initial experiment is a case of training on homogeneous data and testing on different data.",
        "The more homogeneous training data allows the system to rely heavily on specific features and relations in the data.",
        "It is usually the case that training on a more heterogeneous data set does not give quite as high performance on test data from the same corpus as more homogeneous data, but the heterogeneous data ports better to other corpora.",
        "This is seen when training on Brown compared to WSJ.",
        "The observation that the Identification task ports well while the classification task does not is consistent with this explanation.",
        "For the Identification task, structural features such as path and partial path tend to be the most salient while the Classification task relies more heavily on lexical/semantic features such as specific predicate-head word combinations.",
        "The question now is what to do about this.",
        "Two possibilities are:",
        "• Less homogeneous corpora – Rather than using many examples drawn from one source, fewer examples could be drawn from many sources.",
        "This would reduce the likelihood of learning idiosyncratic senses and argument structures for predicates.",
        "• Less specific features – Features, and the values they take on, should be designed to reduce the likelihood of learning idiosyncratic aspects of the training domain.",
        "Examples of this might include the use of more general named entity classes, and the use of abstractions over specific headwords and predicates rather than the words themselves.",
        "Both of these manipulations would, in all likelihood, reduce performance on both the training data and on test sets of the same genre as the training data.",
        "But they would be more likely to lead to better generalization across genres.",
        "Training on very homogeneous training sets and testing on similar test sets gives a misleading impression of the performance of a system.",
