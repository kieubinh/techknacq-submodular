        "To our knowledge, the first work on the twin-candidate model for anaphora resolution was proposed by Connolly, Burger, and Day (1997).",
        "Their work relied on a set of features that included lexical type, grammatical role, recency, and number/gender/semantic agreement, and employed a simple linear search scheme to choose the most preferred candidate.",
        "Their system produced a relatively low accuracy rate for pronoun resolution (55.3%) and definite NP resolution (37.4%) on a set of selected news articles.",

        "(2003) used the twin-candidate model (called the tournament model in their work) to perform Japanese zero-anaphora resolution.",
        "They utilized the same linear scheme to search for antecedents.",
        "Compared with Connolly, Burger, and Day (1997), they adopted richer features in which centering information was incorporated to capture contextual knowledge.",
        "Their system achieved an accuracy of around 70% on a data set drawn from a corpus of newspaper articles.",
        "Both of these studies were carried out on uncommon data sets, which makes it difficult to compare their results with other baseline systems.",
        "In contrast to the previous work, we will explore the twin-candidate model comprehensively by describing the model in more detail, trying more effective resolution schemes, deploying the model in the more complicated coreference resolution task, performing more extensive experiments, and evaluating the model in more depth.",
        "Denis and Baldridge (2007) proposed a pronoun resolution system that directly used a ranking learning algorithm (based on Maximal Entropy) to train a preference classifier for antecedent selection.",
        "They reported an accuracy of around 72-76% for the different domains in the ACE data set.",
        "In our study, we will also investigate the solution of using a general ranking learner (e.g., Ranking-SVM).",
        "By comparison, the twin-candidate model is applicable to any discriminative learning algorithm, no matter whether it is capable of ranking learning or not.",
        "Moreover, as the model is trained and tested on pairwise candidates, it can effectively capture various relationships between candidates for better preference learning and determination.",
        "Ng (2005) presented a ranking model for coreference resolution.",
        "The model focused on the preference between the potential partitions of NPs, instead of the potential antecedents of an NP as in our work.",
        "Given an input document, the model first employed n preselected coreference resolution systems to generate n candidate partitions of NPs.",
        "The model learned a preference classifier (trained using Ranking-SVM) that could distinguish good and bad partitions during testing.",

        "However, many others are \"preferential,\" giving more preference to certain candidates over others; examples include:",
        "• Sentence-based factors: Pronouns in one clause prefer to refer to the NP that is the subject of the previous clause (Crawley, Stevenson, and Kleinman 1990).",
        "Also, the NP that is the first-mentioned expression is preferred regardless of the syntactic and semantic role played by the referring expression (Gernsbacher and Hargreaves 1988).",
        "• Stylistic factors: Pronouns preferentially take parallel antecedents that play the same role as the anaphor in their respective clauses (Grober, Beardsley, and Caramazza 1978; Stevenson, Nelson, and Stenning 1995).",
        "• Discourse-based factors: Items currently in focus are the prime candidates for providing antecedents for anaphoric expressions.",
        "According to centering theory (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1995), each utterance has a set of forward-looking centers that have higher preference to be referred to in later utterances.",
        "The forward-looking centers can be ranked based",
        "on grammatical roles or other factors.",
        "• Distance-based factors: Pronouns prefer candidates in the previous sentence compared with those two or more sentences back (Clark",
        "and Sengul 1979).",
        "As a matter of fact, \"eliminating\" factors could also be considered \"preferential\" if we think of the act of eliminating candidates as giving them low preference.",
        "Preference-based strategies are also widely seen in earlier manual approaches to pronominal anaphora resolution.",
        "For example, the SHRDLU system by Winograd (1972) prefers antecedent candidates in the subject position over those in the object position.",
        "The system by Wilks (1973) prefers candidates that satisfy selectional restrictions with the anaphor.",
        "Hobbs's algorithm (Hobbs 1978) prefers candidates that are closer to the anaphor in the syntax tree, and the RAP algorithm (Lappin and Leass 1994) prefers candidates that have a high salience value computed by aggregating the weights of different factors.",
        "During resolution, the single-candidate model does select an antecedent based on preference by using classification confidence for candidates; that is, the higher confidence value the classifier returns, the more likely the candidate is preferred as the antecedent.",
        "Nevertheless, as the model considers only one candidate at a time during training, it cannot effectively capture the preference between candidates for classifier learning.",
        "For example, consider an anaphor and a candidate Q.",
        "If there are no \"better\" candidates in the candidate set, Q is the antecedent and forms a positive instance.",
        "Otherwise, Ci is not selected as the antecedent and thus forms a negative instance.",
        "Simply looking at a candidate alone cannot explain this, and may possibly result in inconsistent training instances (i.e., the same feature vector but different class labels).",
        "Consequently, the confidence values returned by the learned classifier cannot reliably reflect the preference relationship between candidates.",
        "To address the problem with the single-candidate model, we propose a twin-candidate model to handle anaphora resolution.",
        "As opposed to the single-candidate model, the model explicitly learns a preference classifier to determine the preference relationship between candidates.",

        "To do this, we learn a classifier that, given any two candidates of a given anaphor, can determine which one is preferred to be the antecedent of the anaphor.",
        "The final antecedent is identified based on the classified preference relationships among the candidates.",
        "This is the main idea of the twin-candidate model.",

        "The difference is that a feature for the single candidate, candLX, has to be replaced by a pair of features for the twin candidates, candilX and candilX.",

        "The single-candidate-based system obtains F-measures of 58.3%, 61.5%, and 62.2% for the NWire, NPaper, and BNews domains.",
        "By comparison, the twin-candidate-based system (Round Robin scheme) can achieve F-measures of 59.2%, 63.3%, and 63.0% for the three domains.",
        "The improvement over the single-candidate model in F-measure (0.9%, 1.8%, and 0.8%) is larger than that for non-pronoun resolution (0.4%, 1.4%, and 0.6% as shown in Table 18), owing to the higher gains obtained from pronoun resolution.",
        "For the systems trained using C5 and SVM, similar patterns of performance improvement may be observed."

        "In this article, we have presented a twin-candidate model for learning-based anaphora resolution.",
        "The traditional single-candidate model considers candidates in isolation, and thus cannot accurately capture the preference relationships between competing candidates to provide reliable resolution.",
        "To deal with this problem, our proposed twin-candidate model recasts anaphora resolution as a preference classification problem.",
        "It learns a classifier that can explicitly determine the preference between competing candidates, and then during resolution, choose the antecedent of an anaphor based on the ranking of the candidates.",
        "23 The results are comparable to the baseline system by Ng (2005), which also uses the single-candidate model and is capable of F-measures of 50.1%, 62.1%, and 57.5% for the three domains, respectively.",
        "We have introduced in detail the framework of the twin-candidate model for anaphora resolution, including instance representation, training procedure, and the antecedent identification scheme.",
        "The efficacy of the twin-candidate model for pronominal anaphora resolution has been evaluated in different domains, using ACE data sets.",
        "The experimental results show that the model yields statistically significantly higher accuracy rates than the traditional single-candidate model (up to 4.2% in average accuracy rate), suggesting that the twin-candidate model is superior to the latter for pronominal anaphora resolution.",
        "We have further investigated the deployment of the twin-candidate model in the more complicated coreference resolution task, where not all the encountered NPs are anaphoric.",
        "We have modified the model to make it directly applicable for coreference resolution.",
        "The experimental results for non-pronoun resolution indicate that the twin-candidate-based system performs equally well, and, in some domains, statistically significantly better than the single-candidate based systems.",
        "When combined with the results for pronoun resolution, the twin-candidate based system achieves further improvement against the single-candidate-based systems in all the domains.",
        "A number of further contributions can be made by extending this work in new directions.",
        "Currently, we only adopt simple domain-independent features for learning.",
        "Our recent work (Yang, Su, and Tan 2005) suggests that more complicated features, such as statistics-based semantic compatibility, can be effectively incorporated in the twin-candidate model for pronoun resolution.",
        "In future work, we intend to provide a more in-depth investigation into the various kinds of knowledge that are suitable for the twin-candidate model.",
        "Furthermore, in our current work for coreference resolution, all the NPs preceding an anaphor are used as antecedent candidates, and all encountered non-anaphors in texts are incorporated without filtering into training instance creation.",
        "For more balanced training data and better classifier learning, we intend to explore some instance-sampling techniques, such as those proposed by Ng and Cardie (2002a), to remove in advance low-confidence candidates and the less informative non-anaphors.",
        "We hope that these efforts can further improve the performance of the twin-candidate model in both anaphora resolution and coreference resolution."
