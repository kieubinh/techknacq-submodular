        "Robust syntactic parsing of natural language is an area in which we have seen tremendous development during the last 10 to 15 years, mainly on the basis of data-driven methods but sometimes in combination with grammar-based approaches.",
        "Despite this, most of the approaches in this field have only been tested on a relatively small set of languages, mostly English but to some extent also languages like Chinese, Czech, Japanese, and German.",
        "An important issue in this context is to what extent our models and algorithms are tailored to properties of specific languages or language groups.",
        "This issue is especially pertinent for data-driven approaches, where one of the claimed advantages is portability to new languages.",
        "The results so far mainly come from studies where a parser originally developed for English, such as the Collins parser (Collins 1997, 1999), is applied to a new language, which often leads to a significant decrease in the measured accuracy (Collins et al.",
        "1999; Bikel and Chiang 2000; Dubey and Keller 2003; Levy and Manning 2003; Corazza et al.",
        "2004).",
        "However, it is often quite difficult to tease apart the influence of different features of the parsing methodology in the observed degradation of performance.",
        "A related issue concerns the suitability of different kinds of syntactic representation for different types of languages.",
        "Whereas most of the work on English has been based on constituency-based representations, partly influenced by the availability of data resources such as the Penn Treebank (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993), it has been argued that free constituent order languages can be analyzed more adequately using dependency-based representations, which is also the kind of annotation found, for example, in the Prague Dependency Treebank of Czech (Hajic et al.",
        "2001).",
        "Recently, dependency-based parsing has been applied to 13 different languages in the shared task of the 2006 Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL) (Buchholz and Marsi 2006).",
        "In this article, we focus on dependency-based parsing of Turkish, a language that is characterized by rich agglutinative morphology, free constituent order, and predominantly head-final syntactic constructions.",
        "Thus, Turkish can be viewed as the representative of a class of languages that are very different from English and most other languages that have been studied in the parsing literature.",
        "Using data from the recently released Turkish Treebank (Oflazer et al.",
        "2003), we investigate the impact of different design choices in developing data-driven parsers.",
        "There are essentially three sets of issues that are addressed in these experiments.",
        "• The first set includes issues relating to the treatment of morphology in syntactic parsing, which becomes crucial when dealing with languages where the most important clues to syntactic functions are often found in the morphology rather than in word order patterns.",
        "Thus, for Turkish, it has previously been shown that parsing accuracy can be improved by taking morphologically defined units rather than word forms as the basic units of syntactic structure (Eryigit and Oflazer 2006).",
        "In this article, we corroborate this claim showing that it holds in both approaches we explore.",
        "We also study the impact of different morphological feature representations on parsing accuracy.",
        "• The second set of issues concerns lexicalization, a topic that has been very prominent in the parsing literature lately.",
        "Whereas the best performing parsers for English all make use of lexical information, the real benefits of lexicalization for English as well as other languages remains controversial",
        "(Dubey and Keller, 2003; Klein and Manning 2003; Arun and Keller 2005).",
        "• The third set concerns the basic parsing methodology, including both parsing algorithms and learning algorithms.",
        "We first introduce a statistical parser using a conditional probabilistic model which is very sensitive to the selected representational features and thus clearly exposes the ones",
        "with crucial importance for parsing Turkish.",
        "We then implement our models on a deterministic classifier-based parser using discriminative learning, which is one of the best performing dependency parsers evaluated on a wide range of different languages.",
        "Additionally we address the following issues:",
        "• We investigate learning curves and provide an error analysis for the best performing parser.",
        "• For most of our experiments we use as input the gold-standard tags from the treebank.",
        "However, in our last experiments we evaluate the impact of automatic statistical morphological disambiguation on the performance of our best performing parser.",
        "The rest of the article is structured as follows.",
        "Section 2 gives a very brief introduction to Turkish morphology and syntax and discusses the representation of morphological information and syntactic dependency relations in the Turkish Treebank.",
        "Section 3 is devoted to methodological issues, in particular the data sets and evaluation metrics used in experiments.",
        "The following two sections present two different dependency parsers trained and evaluated on the Turkish Treebank: a probabilistic parser (Section 4) and a classifier-based parser (Section 5).",
        "Section 6 investigates the impact of lexicalization and morphological information on the two parsers, and Section 7 examines their learning curves.",
        "Section 8 presents an error analysis for the best performing parser, and Section 9 analyzes the degradation in parsing performance when using automatic morphological disambiguation.",
        "Section 10 discusses related work, and Section 11 summarizes the main conclusions from our study."

        "Turkish has a very rich agglutinative morphological structure.",
        "Nouns can give rise to about 100 inflected forms and verbs to many more.",
        "Furthermore, Turkish words may be formed through very productive derivations, increasing substantially the number of possible word forms that can be generated from a root word.",
        "It is not uncommon to find up to four or five derivations in a single word.",
        "Previous work on Turkish (Hakkani-Tur, Oflazer, and Tiir 2002; Oflazer 2003; Oflazer et al. 2003; Eryigit and Oflazer 2006) has represented the morphological structure of Turkish words by splitting them into inflectional groups (IGs).",
        "The root and derivational elements of a word are represented by different IGs, separated from each other by derivational boundaries (DB).",
        "1 We, however, do not necessarily suggest that the morphological sublexical representation that we use for Turkish later in this article is applicable to these languages.",
        "Each IG is then annotated with its own part of speech and any inflectional features as illustrated in the following example:",
        "In this example, the root of the word arabanizdaydi is araba ('car') and its part of speech is noun.",
        "From this, a verb is derived in a separate IG.",
        "So, the word is composed of two IGs where the first one, arabanizda ('in your car'), is a noun in locative case and in second plural possessive form, and the second one is a verbal derivation from this noun in past tense and third person singular form.",
        "Because most syntactic information is mediated by morphology, it is not sufficient for the parser to only find dependency relations between orthographic words; the correct IGs involved in the relations should also be identified.",
        "We can motivate this with the following very simple example: In the phrase spor arabanizdaydi ('it was in your sports car'), the adjective spor ('sports') should be connected to the first IG of the second word.",
        "It is the word araba ('car') which is modified by the adjective, not the derived verb form arabanizdaydi ( it was in your car').",
        "So a parser should not just say that the first word is a dependent of the second but also state that the syntactic relation is between the last IG of the first word and the first IG of the second word, as shown:",
        "In Figure 1 we see a complete dependency tree for a Turkish sentence laid on top of the words segmented along IG boundaries.",
        "The rounded rectangles show the words and IGs within words are marked with dashed rounded rectangles.",
        "The first thing to note in this figure is that the dependency links always emanate from the last IG of a word, because that IG determines the role of that word as a dependent.",

        "The average number of IGs per word is 1.26 in running text, but the figure is higher for open class words and 1 for high frequency function words which do not inflect.",

        "This corresponds to a relatively short average sentence length in the treebank of about 8.6 words, which is mainly due to the richness of the morphological structure, because often one word in Turkish may correspond to a whole sentence in another language."

        "The observation that 95% of the dependencies in the Turkish treebank are head-final dependencies motivated us to employ the backward beam search dependency parsing algorithm by Sekine, Uchimoto, and Isahara (2000) (originally designed for Japanese, another head-final language), adapted to our morphological representation with IGs.",
        "This algorithm parses a sentence starting from the end moving towards the beginning, trying at each step to link the dependents to a unit to the right.",
        "It uses a beam which keeps track of the most probable dependency structures for the partially processed sentence.",

        "This representation, however, raises the following question: If we use the words as the parsing units and find the dependencies between these, how can we translate these to the dependencies between the IGs, since our goal is to find dependencies between IGs?",
        "9 We also tried other distance functions, for example, the number of IGs between dependent and head units, but this choice fared better than the alternatives.",
        "10 We tried many other different interpolation and backoff models where we tried to remove the neighbors one by one or the inflectional features.",

        "This approach has some advantages over the probabilistic parser, in that it can process both left-to-right and right-to-left dependencies due to its parsing algorithm, it assigns dependency labels simultaneously with dependencies and can use these as features in the history-based model, and it does not necessarily require expert knowledge about the choice of linguistically relevant features to use in the representations because SVM training involves implicit feature selection.",

        "The reason is that, in this parser, we do not make the assumption that the head is always on the right side of the dependent, but also try to find head-initial dependencies, and the parser does not know at a given stage if a unit is a candidate head or dependent.",

        "The role of morphological disambiguators for highly inflectional languages is far more complex than assigning a single main POS category (e.g., Noun, Verb, Adj) to a word, and also involves assigning the correct morphological information which is crucial for higher level applications.",
        "The complexity of morphological disambiguation in an agglutinative language like Turkish is due to the large number of morphological feature tag combinations that can be assigned to words.",
        "The number of potential morphological tag combinations in Turkish for all practical purposes is very large due to productively derived forms.",

        "The lower accuracy of the morphological disambiguator on the treebank can be due to different selections in the annotation process of the morphological disambiguator training data (Yiiret and Ture 2006), which is totally different from the treebank data.",

        "But when evaluating with the ASU and ASL scores for the IG-based model, one problem that may appear is that the disambiguator may have assigned a totally different IG structure to the head word, compared to the gold standard (cf. the three analyses of the word asmadan).",
        "In this case, we accept a dependency link to be correct if the dependent is connected to the correct head word and the head IG has the same POS category as the gold-standard.",
        "This is reasonable because we know that some of the errors in inflectional features do not affect the type of dependency very much.",
        "For example, if we put the adjective kUgilk ( 'small')",
        "29 We noted that 39% of the words were ambiguous and 17% had more than two distinct morphological analyses.",
        "30 The words not recognized by the morphological analyzer are generally proper nouns, numbers, and some combined words that are created in the development stage of the treebank and constitute 6.2% of the whole treebank.",
        "If these words are excluded, the accuracy of the tagger is 84.6%.",
        "31 For this model, we added LEX features for 00, T0, T1 to the feature model of our word-based model in Table 4.",
        "Impact of morphological disambiguation on unlabeled and labeled attachment scores and word-to-word scores.",
        "in front of the example given previously {kilgilk kalemi), then the choice of morphological analysis of the noun has no impact on the fact that the adjective should be connected to the noun with dependency type \"MODIFIER\".",
        "Moreover, most of the errors in POS categories will actually prevent the parser from finding the correct head word, which can be observed from the drop in WWU accuracy.",
        "Table 8 shows that the IG-based model and the word-based model are equally affected by the tagging errors and have a drop in accuracy within similar ranges.",
        "(It can also be seen that, even with automatically tagged data, the IG-based model gives better accuracy than the word-based model.)",
        "We can say that the use of an automatic morphological analyzer and disambiguator causes a drop in the range of 3 percentage points for unlabeled accuracy and 4 percentage points for labeled accuracy (for both word-based and IG-based models)."

        "The Turkish Treebank has recently been parsed by 17 research groups in the CoNLL-X shared task on multilingual dependency parsing (Buchholz and Marsi 2006), where it was seen as the most difficult language by the organizers and most of the groups.",
        "The following quote is taken from Buchholz and Marsi (page 161): \"The most difficult data set is clearly the Turkish one.",
        "It is rather small, and in contrast to Arabic and Slovene, which are equally small or smaller, it covers 8 genres, which results in a high percentage of new FORM and LEMMA values in the test set.\"",

        "Our classifier-based parser obtained the best results for Turkish (with ASU=75.8 and ASL=65.7) and also for Japanese, which is the only agglutinative and head-final language in the shared task other than Turkish (Nivre et al.",

        "We can also see that a common property of the parsers which fall below the average (ASrj=55.4) is that they do not make use of inflectional features, which is crucial for Turkish.",
        "Another recent study that has promising results is Cakici and Baldridge (2006), where the authors use the MSTParser (McDonald, Lerman, and Pereira 2006), also used in the CoNLL-X shared task (line 3 in Table 9).",

        "Similar to one of the models (\"INF as a single feature\") in Eryigit, Nivre, and Oflazer (2006), where the feature names of the suffixes provided by the morphological analyzer are concatenated and used as a feature to the classifier, they use the surface forms of the suffixes as a whole.",
        "We can say that the models in this article cover this approach in that each suffix is used as a single feature name (which is shown to perform better than using them concatenated to each other in Eryigit, Nivre, and Oflazer [2006]).",
        "Because in Turkish, the same suffixes take different forms under vowel harmony and the surface forms of some different suffixes are structurally ambiguous, using them with their feature names is actually more meaningful.",

        "In this article, we have investigated a number of issues in data-driven dependency parsing of Turkish.",

        "This result holds regardless of whether we evaluate accuracy on the word level or on the IG level; it holds regardless of whether we use the probabilistic parser or the classifier-based parser; and it holds even if we take into account the problem caused by errors in automatic morphological analysis and disambiguation.",
        "Another important conclusion is that the use of morphological information can increase parsing accuracy substantially.",
        "Again, this result has been obtained both for the probabilistic and the classifier-based parser, although the probabilistic parser requires careful manual selection of relevant features to counter the effect of data sparseness.",
        "A similar result has been obtained with respect to lexicalization, although in this case an improvement has only been demonstrated for the classifier-based parser, which is probably due to its greater resilience to data sparseness.",
        "By combining the deterministic classifier-based parsing approach with an adequate use of IG-based representations, morphological information, and lexicalization, we have been able to achieve the highest reported accuracy for parsing the Turkish Treebank."
