        "For readers of traditional textbooks such as that of Partee, ter Meulen, and Wall (1990), the term 'mathematical linguistics' denotes a rather narrowly circumscribed set of issues including automata theory, set theory, and lambda calculus, with maybe a little formal language theory thrown in.",
        "Kornai's contribution is refreshingly different in that he treats, in this relatively compact volume, practically all areas of linguistics, phonetics, and speech and language processing.",
        "Kornai's motivation for writing this book is to present \"a single entry point to the central methods and concepts of linguistics that are made largely inaccessible to the mathematician, computer scientist, or engineer by the surprisingly adversarial style of argumentation ...and the proliferation of unmotivated notation and formalism ...all too often encountered in research papers and monographs in the humanities\" (page viii).",
        "There is no question that much of what passes for rigor (mathematical and scientific) in linguistics is a joke and that there is clearly a need for any work that can place the field on a more solid footing.",
        "It also seems likely that Kornai is the only person who could have written this book.",
        "The book is divided into ten chapters, including a short introductory chapter, which lays the groundwork and identifies the potential audience, and a concluding chapter where Kornai reveals his own views on what is important in the field, which in the interests of balance he has largely suppressed throughout the book.",
        "Chapter 2 is also introductory in that it presents basic concepts of generation (via a ruleset), axioms, and string rewriting.",
        "The main chapters (3-9) deal with a variety of topic areas relating to language and speech, starting with phonology in Chapter 3.",
        "This chapter introduces the notion of phonemes, distinctive features, autosegmental phonology, and computation using finite automata.",
        "Kornai offers many details that are of course lacking in most linguistic treatments, such as a proof that the number of well-formed association lines between two tiers of length n is asymptotically (6 + 4v/2)n.",
        "Chapter 4 deals with morphology, which for Kornai includes not only word formation, but also prosody (including stress assignment and moraic structure), as well as Optimality Theory and Zipf's law.",
        "The fifth chapter treats syntax, including categorial grammar, phrase structure, dependency frameworks, valency, and weighted models of grammar, ending with a discussion of weighted finite automata and hidden Markov models.",
        "In the context of weighted models, Kornai implies that Chomsky's original notion of degree of grammaticality fits naturally as an instance of a weighted model with a particular semiring; of course, exactly what the ® and <g> operators of that semiring map to remain to be seen insofar as the notion \"degree of grammaticality\" has never been rigorously defined.",
        "Chapter 6, on Semantics, starts with a discussion of various standard paradoxes such as the Liar, and then moves on to an overview of Montague's theory, type theory, and grammatical semantics.",
        "Throughout the discussion, Kornai underscores the fundamental limitations of theories of semantics that are based purely upon evaluation of truth conditions for artificial fragments, an important point for anyone who wants to go beyond theoretical philosophically inspired models and consider semantic interpretation in the real world.",
        "Complexity is the topic of Chapter 7.",
        "This is not the Chomsky-hierarchy notion of complexity, but rather deals with information theory, in particular entropy, Kolmogorov complexity, and a short section on learning, including identification in the limit and PAC learning.",
        "Pattern recognition is divided across two chapters, with Chapter 8 laying the essential groundwork of linguistic pattern recognition, and Chapter 9 presenting details on speech processing and handwriting recognition.",
        "This includes feature extraction: In the case of speech recognition, Kornai reviews the frequency representation of speech signals, and defines the cepstrum.",
        "Discussion of acoustic models leads us to phonemes as hidden units, with a slight detour into the fine-grained distinctions between different levels of phonemic analysis in the once popular but now largely discredited theory of Lexical Phonology.",
        "Each chapter ends with a section entitled \"Further Reading,\" and the texts referred to are generally quite useful as material for readers who wish to explore the issues further.",
        "According to Wikipedia, Kornai is a \"well-known mathematical linguist\" whose Erdos number is 2.",
        "Unfortunately, neither of us can claim Kornai's mathematical sophistication or stature, but on the other hand this makes us good judges of the book's potential audience; and herein lies a problem.",
        "Kornai's target is \"anyone with sufficient general mathematical maturity\" with \"[n]o prior knowledge of linguistics or languages ...assumed on the part of the reader\" (page viii).",
        "This suggests that the book is not primarily aimed at linguists, and certainly the mathematical maturity assumed puts this book well beyond the reach of most linguists, so that it could not easily be used in an introductory course on mathematical linguistics in a linguistics program.",
        "It is probably beyond the reach of many computer science students as well.",
        "What about those who do have the mathematical maturity, but know nothing about linguistics?",
        "The problem here is that in many cases Kornai does not give enough background (or any background) to appreciate the significance of the particular issues being discussed.",
        "For example, on page 77 Kornai gives weak crossover and heavy NP shift as examples of phenomena that have 'weak' effects on grammaticality, and resumptive pronouns as examples of phenomena that are marginal in some languages (such as English).",
        "But nowhere does he explain what these terms denote, which means that these are throwaway comments for anyone who does not already know.",
        "Section 3.2 introduces phonological features and feature geometry and sketches some of the mathematical properties of systems with features; but very little background is given on what features are supposed to represent.",
        "The short discussion of Optimality Theory (pages 67-69) hardly gives enough background to give a feel for the main points of that approach.",
        "In other cases, topics are introduced but their importance to surrounding topics is hard to fathom.",
        "For example, in Section 6.1.3 a discussion of the Berry paradox leads into a digression on how to implement digit-sequence-to-number-name mappings as finite-state transducers.",
        "Apart from giving Kornai an opportunity to emphasize that this is trivial to do (something that is true in principle, but less true in practice, depending upon the language), it is not clear what purpose this digression serves.",
        "There are also a number of places where issues are presented in a non-standard way, which might make sense from some points of view, but not if you are trying to introduce someone to the way the field is practiced.",
        "It is odd, for instance, that prosody is introduced not in the chapter on phonology but in the one on morphology.",
        "It is also somewhat odd that Zipf's law gets introduced in the morphology chapter.",
        "(And why is it that nowhere does Kornai cite Baayen's excellent book on word-frequency distributions (Baayen 2001), which would be a very useful source of further information on this topic to any reader of Kornai's book?)",
        "Some material presented is puzzling or simply wrong.",
        "It is not explained in what sense German has a \"pure SVO construction\" (page 103) in contradistinction to the normal assumption that German is verb-second.",
        "The Cypriot syllabary does not date from the 15th century BCE (page 54); Latin does not have two locative cases (page 90) – indeed, it does not even have one locative case, so-called; the basic Hangul letter shapes (introduced on page 31 to make a point about phonetic features) are, with two exceptions, completely incorrect – probably it would have been better to use a real Korean font rather than trying to imitate the jamo with LTeX math symbols.",
        "There are of course a great many places where the discussion is useful and informative, but there are enough examples of the kinds we have outlined that the uninitiated reader should be careful.",
        "As far as we can see, the most likely readership of this book consists of (computational) linguists and others who already know the linguistic issues, have a fairly strong formal and mathematical background, and could benefit from the more-precise and more-rigorous mathematical expositions that Kornai provides.",
        "Throughout the book, Kornai pauses occasionally to present exercises to the reader.",
        "These range from relatively simple to major research projects.",
        "As with other aspects of this book, the distribution of topics for the exercises is somewhat erratic.",
        "Thus, on page 184, in the chapter on complexity, we are offered exercises 7.6 and 7.7 in close proximity:",
        "Exercise 7.6 Prove that a regular language is prefix-free iff it is accepted by a DFSA with no transitions out of accepting states.",
        "Is a prefix-free language context-free iff it is accepted by a DPDA with the same restriction on its control?",
        "Exercise 7.7 Research the role of the ascii codes 0x02 (STX), 0x03 (ETX), and 0x16 (SYN).",
        "But variety is, after all, what keeps things interesting."
