        "Information extraction (IE) involves the process of automatically identifying instances of certain relations of interest, e.g., produce(<company>, <product>, <location>), in some document collection and the construction of a database with information about each individual instance (e.g., the participants of a meeting, the date and time of the meeting).",
        "Currently, IE systems are usually domain-dependent and adapting the system to a new domain requires a high amount of manual labour, such as specifying and implementing relation-specific extraction patterns manually (cf.",
        "Fig.",
        "1) or annotating large amounts of training corpora (cf.",
        "Fig.",
        "2).",
        "These adaptations have to be made offline, i.e., before the specific IE system is actually made.",
        "Consequently, current IE technology is highly statical and inflexible with respect to a timely adaptation to new requirements in the form of new topics.",
        "Figure 1: A hand-coded rule-based IE-system (schematically): A topic expert implements manually task-specific extraction rules on the basis of her manual analysis of a representative corpus.",

        "Figure 2: A data-oriented IE system (schematically): The task-specific extraction rules are automatically acquired by means of Machine Learning algorithms, which are using a sufficiently large enough corpus of topic-relevant documents.",
        "These documents have to be collected and costly annotated by a topic-expert.",
        "IE system automatically for a given topic.",
        "Here, the pre-knowledge about the information request is given by a user online to the IE core system (called IDEX) in the form of a topic description (cf.",
        "Fig.",
        "3).",
        "This initial information source is used to retrieve relevant documents and extract and cluster relations in an unsupervised way.",
        "In this way, IDEX is able to adapt much better to the dynamic information space, in particular because no predefined patterns of relevant relations have to be specified, but relevant patterns are determined online.",
        "Our system consists of a front-end, which provides the user with a GUI for interactively inspecting information extracted from topic-related web documents, and a back-end, which contains the relation extraction and clustering component.",

        "These tables are presented to the user (who is assumed to be the topic-expert), who will analyse the data further for her information research.",

        "One of the challenges for the risk analysis of mega construction projects is the efficient exploration of the possibly relevant search space.",
        "Developing manually an IE system is often not possible because of the timely need of the information, and, more importantly, is probably not useful, because the needed (hidden) information is actually not known.",

        "For this topic, documents are automatically retrieved from the web using the Google search engine.",
        "HTML and PDF documents are converted into plain text files.",
        "As the tools used for linguistic processing (NE recognition, parsing, etc.)",
        "are language-specific, we use the Google language filter option when downloading the documents.",
        "However, this does not prevent some documents written in a language other than our target language (English) from entering our corpus.",
        "In addition, some web sites contain text written in several languages.",
        "In order to restrict the processing to sentences written in English, we apply a language guesser tool, lc4j (Lc4j, 2007) and remove sentences not classified as written in English.",
        "This reduces errors on the following levels of processing.",
        "We also remove sentences that only contain non-alphanumeric characters.",
        "To all remaining sentences, we apply LingPipe (Ling-Pipe, 2007) for sentence boundary detection, named entity recognition (NER) and coreference resolution.",
        "As a result of this step database tables are created, containing references to the original document, sentences and detected named entities (NEs).",
        "Relation extraction is done on the basis of parsing potentially relevant sentences.",
        "We define a sentence to be of potential relevance if it at least contains two NEs.",
        "In the first step, so-called skeletons (simplified dependency trees) are extracted.",
        "To build the skeletons, the Stanford parser (Stanford Parser, 2007) is used to generate dependency trees for the potentially relevant sentences.",
        "For each NE pair in a sentence, the common root element in the corresponding tree is identified and the elements from each of the NEs to the root are collected.",
        "An example of a skeleton is shown in Figure 5.",
        "In the second step, information based on dependency types is extracted for the potentially relevant sentences.",
        "Focusing on verb relations (this can be extended to other types of relations), we collect for each verb its subject(s), object(s), preposition(s) with arguments and auxiliary verb(s).",
        "We can now extract verb relations using a simple algorithm: We define a verb relation to be a verb together with its arguments (subject(s), object(s) and prepositional phrases) and consider only those relations to be of interest where at least the subject or the object is an NE.",

        "Standard ML clustering algorithms such as k-means and EM (as provided by the Weka toolbox (Witten and Frank, 2005)) have been tested for clustering the relations at hand but were not able to deal with the large number of features and instances required for an adequate representation of our dataset.",
