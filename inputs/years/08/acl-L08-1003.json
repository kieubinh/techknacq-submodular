        "Compared with traditional media such as online news and enterprise websites, weblogs have several unique characteristics, e.g., containing abundant life experiences and public opinions toward different topics, highly sensitive to the events occurring in the real world, and associated with the personal information of bloggers.",
        "Some works have been proposed to leverage these characteristics, e.g., the study of the relationship between the content and bloggers' profiles (Adamic & Glance, 2005; Burger & Henderson, 2006; Teng & Chen, 2006), and content and real events (Glance, Hurst & Tornkiyo, 2004; Kim, 2005; Thelwall, 2006; Thompson, 2003).",
        "In this paper, we will use temporal collocation to model the term-to-term association over time.",
        "In the past, some useful collocation models (Manning & Schütze, 1999) have been proposed such as mean and variance, hypothesis test, mutual information, etc.",
        "Some works analyze the weblogs from the aspect of time like the dynamics of weblogs in time and location (Mei, et al., 2006), the weblog posting behavior (Doran, Griffith & Henderson, 2006; Hurst, 2006), the topic extraction (Oka, Abe & Kato, 2006), etc.",
        "The impacts of events on social media are also discussed, e.g., the change of weblogs after London attack (Thelwall, 2006), the relationship between the warblog and weblogs (Kim, 2005; Thompson, 2003), etc.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 defines temporal collocation to model the strength of term-to-term associations over time.",
        "Section 3 introduces an event detection algorithm to detect the events in weblogs, and an event summarization algorithm to extract the description of an event in a specific time with temporal collocations.",
        "Section 4 shows and discusses the experimental results.",
        "Section 5 concludes the remarks."
