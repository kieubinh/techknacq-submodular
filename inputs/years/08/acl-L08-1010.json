        "All supervised machine-learning methods rely on quality and extent of training data - in the area of Computation Linguistics and Natural Language Processing often in a form of a manually annotated corpus.",
        "While the amount of data is usually only an issue of time and costs, the quality assurance is a non-trivial process.",
        "Each annotated corpus should be provided with information regarding its annotation quality, such as inter-annotator agreement or kappa measure (cf. (Artstein and Poesio, 2007)).",
        "Absence of such a measure leads to insufficient performance evaluation of employed machine-learning methods - performance of any method should be never reported without mentioning how difficult the task is, for example for a human.",
        "Quality of corpus annotation is affected mainly by following two factors: annotator's errors and imperfect specification of annotation guidelines.",
        "The errors can be detected by multiple annotation of the same data and combining the results e.g. by voting - it is unlikely that more annotators make the same mistake at the same place.",
        "The latter, however, is a real problem.",
        "Too vague or too detailed specification of the annotation guidelines can lead to a situation when different decisions of multiple annotators are equally correct.",
        "Frequency estimation of these two cases in a corpus is essential for estimating possible room for improvement of employed methods."

      "text": [
        "Part-of-Speech tagging is a process of assigning particular part-of-speech tag to the words in a text.",
        "Czech as a language with very rich morphology distinguishes up to 12 different morphological categories for each word (Part of speech, Detailed part of speech, Gender, Number, Case, Possessor's gender, Possessor's number, Person, Tense, Degree of comparison, Negation, and Voice) creating quite detailed and complex morphological tags with more than 4200 possible values (the size of tagset) (Hajic, 2004).",
        "The process of tagging consists of three steps: 1) during morphological analysis each word form in a text is assigned a list of all possible tags from a morphological dictionary, 2) if the word form does not appear in the dictionary the guesser attempts to assign (\"guess\") possible tags based on the word ending, 3) for each word form the tagger selects the most likely tag from the list.",
        "Evaluating tagger means, in fact, evaluating quality of all the steps including the dictionary, guesser, and tagger.",
        "The Prague Dependency Treebank version 2 (PDT2) contains a large amount of Czech texts with morphological, syntactic, and semantic annotation (Hajic et al., 2006).",
        "Almost two million words annotated on the morphological level is split into three parts: train for training purposes, dtest for development purposes, and etest for evaluation (Table 1 shows exact number of tokens).",
        "The morphological annotation of PDT version 1 was originally performed by multiple annotators and subsequently combined into one reference annotation (Hajic et al., 2006).",
        "Some additional semi-manual corrections were also performed prior the release of version 2 by several other annotators (Stepanek, 2006).",
        "As a consequence of this process, no exact details of the annotation quality are known.",
        "Current Czech state-of-the-art taggers developed and trained on the Prague Dependency Treebank version 2 include the Feature-based tagger by Hajic (Hajic, 2004), HMM-based tagger by Krbec (Krbec, 2005), and Morce tagger (Votrubec, 2006) based on averaged perceptron.",
        "They achieve accuracy around 95% (details shown in Table 2) and practically no significant gain in performance was achieved in last years.",
        "This poses a question whether the taggers already reached their limits and the data quality prevents their further improvement or not.",

        "Also, we introduce another component P(t* | t*+1 , t*+2) based on a reduced tagset T* that contains positions POS, GENDER, NUMBER and CASE only (chosen on linguistic grounds).",
        "We upgrade all trigrams to fourgrams; the smoothing mechanism for fourgrams is history-based bucketing (Krbec, 2005).",
        "The final fine-tuned HMM tagger thus uses all the enhancements and every component contains its scaling factor which has been computed using held-out data.",
        "The total error rate reduction is 13.98 % relative on development data, measured against the baseline HMM tagger.",
        "The Morce tagger assumes some of the HMM properties at runtime, namely those that allow the Viterbi algorithm to be used to find the best tag sequence for a given text.",
        "However, the transition weights are not probabilities.",
        "They are estimated by an Averaged Perceptron described in (Collins, 2002).",
        "Averaged Perceptron works with features which describe the current tag and its context.",
        "Features can be derived from any information we already have about the text.",
        "Every feature can be true or false in a given context, so we can regard current true features as a description of the current tag context.",
        "For every feature, the Averaged Perceptron stores its weight coefficient, which is typically an integer number.",
        "The whole task of Averaged Perceptron is to sum all the coefficients of true features in a given context.",
        "The result is passed to the Viterbi algorithm as a transition weight for a given tag.",
        "Mathematically, we can rewrite it as:",
        "where w(C, T) is the transition weight for tag T in context C, n is number of features, ai is the weight coefficient of ith feature and </>(C, T)i is evaluation of ith feature for context C and tag T. Weight coefficients (a) are estimated on training data, cf. (Votrubec, 2006).",
        "The training algorithm is very simple, therefore it can be quickly retrained and it gives a possibility to test many different sets of features (Votrubec, 2005).",
        "As a result, Morce gives the best accuracy from the standalone taggers.",
        "The Feature-based tagger, taken also from the PDT (Hajic et al., 2006) distribution used in our experiments uses a general log-linear model in its basic formulation:",
        "where fi (y, x) is a binary-valued feature of the event value being predicted and its context, Ai is a weight ofthe feature fi, andthe Z(x) is the naturalnormalizationfactor.",
        "The weights Ai are approximated by Maximum Likelihood (using the feature counts relative to all feature contexts found), reducing the model essentially to Naive Bayes.",
        "The approximation is necessary due to the millions of the possible features which make the usual entropy maximization infeasible.",

        "A quite straightforward way how to validate quality of a corpus annotation and find annotation errors is an independent re-annotation of the entire data (a new annotator, the same guidelines).",
        "Performing more than one re-annotation brings in the possibility of combining the results to detect potential errors of new annotators and avoid them by voting.",
        "Parallel annotation of the whole data is obviously a time consuming and very expensive process.",
        "We can, ofcourse, reduce the cost of the new annotation by processing only a random sample of the data and use the inter-annotator agreement on this sample as an estimation ofthe quality of the whole corpus.",
        "However, this method has two disadvantages.",
        "First, it detects only a limited subset of incorrectly annotated words - the smaller the sample, the less incorrectly annotated words we detect (and eventually can correct).",
        "Second, it does not distinguish between disagreement caused by the annotator's keying mistakes or by imperfect annotation guidelines.",
        "To solve the task of validating and correcting the annotation, keeping minimal costs and avoiding the problems mentioned above, we propose the following procedure how to carefully select the data for re-annotation.",
        "First, we identify all trivial data - the tokens with only one possible tag that can be excluded from any further analysis.",
        "Second, we apply several (at least three) state-of-the-art automatic systems (taggers) based on different methods on the entire corpus (except the evaluation data of course) and select the tokens that were assigned a correct tag congruently by all systems (all taggers agreed on the reference tag).",
        "We call this selection easy data and assume that these cases are annotated correctly - they do not mean any problem for the current systems and are solved easily.",
        "The remaining subset comprises all problematic data - these are the positions causing troubles for at least one system, which we interpret as a sign of their eventual incorrect annotation and a reason for the in depth analysis.",
        "The subset of corpus data for the re-annotation will consist only of shuffled random sample of the easy and problematic data.",
        "A smaller sample of the easy data will be used to assure the quality of annotators' work (we can expect 100% agreement between annotators themselves as well as between annotators and the reference data).",
        "The main an-notators' effort will be focused on a larger sample of the problematic data in order to estimate the inter-annotator agreement and analyze potential room for systems' performance improvement."
