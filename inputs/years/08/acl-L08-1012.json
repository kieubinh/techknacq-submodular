        "We evaluate the extent to which the distinction between semantically core and non-core dependents as used in the FrameNet corpus corresponds to the traditional distinction between syntactic complements and modifiers of a verb, for the purposes of harvesting a wide-coverage verb lexicon from FrameNet for use in deep linguistic processing applications.",

        "The distinction between complements and modifiers is important for parsing and language interpretation, since it impacts upon both syntactic and semantic decisions.",
        "On the syntactic level, the distinction relates to questions such as whether a particular sentence is syntactically correct if a given dependent is not realised.",
        "On the semantic level, the complement-modifier distinction raises important issues such as whether a semantic representation is 'complete', with nothing needing to be inferred from context, and whether a particular preposition denotes an independent predicate, as opposed to being a contentless argument marker.",
        "The answers to these questions may significantly impact the quality of parsing and semantic interpretation.",
        "As noted by Meyers et al.",
        "(1996), incorrectly classifying a complement as a modifier may cause a syntactic parser to miss a parse, whilst incorrestly classifying a modifier as a complement may cause a parser to add a spurious parse.",
        "This would be a relevant distinction to make in a (deep) syntactic parser.",
        "In addition, in an accurate representation of predicate argument structure, syntactic phrase heads predicate of their complements, but modifiers predicate of the syntactic phrase heads.",
        "This distinction is therefore relevant for both deep parsers that combine syntax and semantics, and shallow semantic parsers that attempt to induce a predicate structure based on semantic role labelling.",
        "Unfortunately, the precise boundary between complements and modifiers is notoriously difficult to define.",
        "Existing lexical semantic resources, for example PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005), FrameNet (Johnson and Fillmore, 2000), Verb-Net (Kipper et al., 2000) and OntoNotes (Hovy et al., 2006) , do include information related to the complement-modifier distinction, but each applies slightly different criteria, depending on whether the emphasis is syntactic or semantic.",
        "A number of recent projects have attempted to merge information from different resources (Kwon and Hovy, 2006; Crabbe et al., 2006) and use them in parsing (Shi and Mihalcea, 2005; McConville and Dzikovska, 2007) .",
        "For such applications it is important to be able to understand and evaluate to what extent the different approaches to making complement-modifier distinctions are compatible, and which approach is the most appropriate for a given application.",
        "In this paper, we investigate whether the semantic criteria for distinguishing complements and modifiers used by the creators of the FrameNet corpus (i.e. 'core' versus 'non-core' semantic roles) correspond to syntactic intuitions, in particular to the (primarily) syntactic criteria used in the VerbNet lexicon, which only lists syntactic arguments of the verbs, based on whether they can participate in a number of syntactic alternations.",
        "We show that while there is a reasonably good correlation (0.85 agreement) between the semantic 'coreness' of FrameNet verb dependents and the complements listed in VerbNet, these notions do not align perfectly, and discuss the implications for using FrameNet as a source of syntactic information for parsing.",
        "We argue that for deep parsers concerned with both syntactic and semantic representations, it may be beneficial to separate the semantic and syntactic aspects of complement/modifier distinction into separate features.",
        "This paper proceeds as follows: section 2 presents some necessary background, including an introduction to both FrameNet and VerbNet, as well as our lexical harvesting project; section 3 discusses the methodology used in our investigation, in particular the way in which we combined use of VerbNet with our own linguistic intuitions in making a decision about complement-hood; section 4 presents the results; and section 5 discusses the implications for deep parsing."

      "text": [
        "FrameNet (Johnson and Fillmore, 2000) is a corpus of 140,000 English sentences (mainly drawn from the BNC), each annotated with both syntactic and semantic information.",
        "Underlying the corpus is an ontology of 800 'frames' (or semantic types), each of which is associated with a set of 'frame elements' (or semantic roles).",
        "Take for example the following sentence from the corpus:",
        "(1) Overshadowed by Grigorovich, Kokonin nonetheless apparently eclipsed him in power in recent months.",
        "In this example, the verb eclipse is associated with the Surpassing frame, which denotes situations where one entity is conceptualised as being superior to another in some way.",
        "This frame includes the following frame elements, among others:",
        "• Attribute - a property that invokes a scale (e.g. 'power', 'wealth')",
        "• Item - the entity located closest to the end of the scale (i.e. the 'surpassor')",
        "• Standard - the entity located farthest from the end of the scale (i.e. 'the surpassed')",
        "• Time - the time when the Item is higher on the scale",
        "Other verbs which are listed in the FrameNet ontology as 'evoking' the Surpassing frame include surpass, better, outdo and outshine.",
        "The FrameNet annotation process then runs as follows, assuming the example sentence in (1):",
        "1. identify a target word for the annotation, for example the main verb eclipsed",
        "2. identify the semantic frame which is evoked by the target word in the sentence - in this case the relevant frame is Surpassing",
        "3. identify the sentential constituents which realise each frame element associated with the frame, i.e. Overshadowed by Grigorovich, [Kokonin] Itemnonetheless apparently eclipsed [him]Standard [in power]Attribute [in recent months]Time.",
        "Finally, some basic syntactic information about the target word and the constituents realising the various frame elements is also added:",
        "• the part-of-speech of the target word (i.e. V, N, A or",
        "• the syntactic category of each constituent realising a frame element (e.g. NP, PP, VPto, Sfin)",
        "• the syntactic role, with respect to the target word, of each constituent realising a frame element (for example Ext (subject), Obj (object) or Dep (other dependent))",
        "Thus, each sentence in the corpus can be seen to be annotated on at least three independent 'layers', as exemplified in Figure 1.",
        "The FrameNet corpus has proved to be a useful linguistic resource for a number of computational linguistics applications, for example semantic role labelling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), information extraction (Sur-deanu et al., 2003), and question answering (Kaisser and Webber, 2007).",
        "McConville and Dzikovska (2007) present a procedure for harvesting a wide-coverage verb lexicon, for use with a deep semantic parser, from the FrameNet corpus.",
        "The technique used was to read off lexical entries from annotated sentences, and subsequently filter out spurious sub-categorisation frames.",
        "We took each sentence which had been annotated with respect to some target verb and converted it into a lexical entry whose subcategorisation frame contained the various annotated syntacto-semantic dependents.",
        "For example, the annotated sentence from Figure 1 was converted into the verb entry in Figure 2.This simple approach to deriving a verb lexicon gave rise to a number of spurious subcategorisation frames, involving non-canonical verbal constructions and alternations (e.g. passives, imperatives, middles), which we then had to filter out.",
        "After the filtering process, the harvested lexicon had been reduced in size from 30,000 distinct verb/subcategorisation frame pairs to just 9,000.",
        "These were distributed across 2,600 verb senses, giving a ratio of 3.4 subcategorisation frames per verb sense.",
        "The process of filtering out spurious subcategorisation frames added value to the original FrameNet verb lexicon, making it more suitable for hooking up to a deep parser where non-canonical constructions are generally handled in the rule component (e.g. using lexical rules).",
        "One of the main issues we encountered in filtering the FrameNet verb lexicon involved distinguishing between those Dep dependents which are true complements of the verb and those which are generic modifiers, and filtering out the latter.",
        "To return to the example sentence in (1), the prepositional phrase in power is a complement of the target verb eclipse, since:",
        "• although it is optional, it defines an argument specific to this class of verb, hence its existence cannot be predicted from more general principles of grammar",
        "• the preposition in is the only preposition which can be used to introduce the Attribute role of the verb",
        "On the other hand, the prepositional phrase in recent months is a modifier of the target verb, since:",
        "• it can be used with much the same meaning with almost all classes of verb, hence its existence (and optionality) can be predicted from more general principles of grammar",
        "• the preposition in is not the only preposition which can be used to introduce the Time role – Kokonin eclipsed Grigorovich {at the weekend, over three years, after a few days, on Saturday,... }",
        "Thus, these two prepositional phrases need to be treated differently in parsing and construction of logical forms, as discussed in the introduction.",

        "In order to do this simply and straightforwardly, we availed ourselves of one of the features built in to the FrameNet ontology – the 'coreness' feature on frame elements.",
        "In the ontology, the frame elements associated with each frame have been partitioned into two main groups, Core and non-Core, a distinction which (according to the annotation guidelines) is meant to cover the 'semantic spirit' of the distinction between complements and modifiers.",
        "Thus, for example, obligatory complements are always Core, as are:",
        "• those which, when omitted, receive a definite interpretation, e.g. the Goal argument of the verb arrive (cf. John arrived)",
        "• those whose semantics cannot be predicted from their form, e.g. the Intermediary argument of the verb relies as in John relies [on Mary] – the preposition on does not encode the Intermediary role with any other class of verbs outwith the Reliance frame",
        "Non-Core frame elements are themselves partitioned into two classes:",
        "Peripheral frame elements which do not introduce additional or distinct events from the main reported event, i.e. Time, Manner, Place, Degree, etc.",

        "Frequency,",
        "Containing_event, Beneficiary, etc.",
        "To go back to the example sentence in Figure 1 involving the verb eclipse from the Surpassing frame, the FrameNet ontology classes the Item, Standard and Attribute roles as Core, and the Time role as Peripheral.",
        "This appears to correspond exactly with linguistic intuitions about which dependents are complements and which are modifiers of the verb.",
        "For this reason, when it came to filtering out spurious subcategorisation frames from the verb lexicon we had harvested from the FrameNet corpus, we decided on the simple expedient of deleting all and only those Dep dependents which evoke a non-Core frame element.",
        "This process resulted in the elimination of many spurious subcategorisation frames – the number of verb/subcategorisation frame pairs in the harvested lexicon was cut by 45%, from 16,000 down to 9,000.",
        "However, it was clear from the start that the correlation between the semantic 'coreness' and syntactic complement-hood is far from perfect.",
        "For instance, it was not difficult to find examples where syntactic complements evoked semantically non-Core frame elements.",
        "A number of constituents in the FrameNet corpus have been marked as direct objects, despite invoking non-Core frame elements, as in:",
        "(2) [John]Agent ripped [the top^ubregion [from his packet of cigarettes]Patient",
        "In this instance, the verb rip has been assigned by the annotators to the frame Damaging, where the Subregion frame element is marked as being Peripheral, based on examples like John ripped his trousers [below the knee].",
        "In this particular case, the problem was probably caused by annotators not being careful enough when assigning verbs with different subcategorisation alternations to frames – it would have been better to have assigned the verb rip as used in (2) to the Removing frame, where the direct object invokes a Core frame element (i.e. Theme).",
        "Thus, the decision to retain all senses of the verb rip within the same frame has led to a situation where semantic and syntactic coreness have become dislocated.",
        "The aim of the project reported here was to investigate the extent to which this kind of problem impacts upon the effectiveness of the expedient we chose to distinguish complements from modifiers in the verb lexicon we harvested from the FrameNet corpus.",

        "In order to help us in deciding whether a given verb dependent is really a complement, we decided to make use of the VerbNet verb lexicon (Kipper et al., 2000) as a syntactic gold standard.",
        "VerbNet is a lexicon of around 5,000 English verb senses, partitioned into 237 top-level classes.",

        "In order to use VerbNet as our gold standard for making distinctions between complements and modifiers, we assumed that verb dependents which are listed in the relevant class are definitely complements.",
        "However, we were unable to assume straightforwardly that any verb dependents which are not so listed are modifiers, since VerbNet is an incomplete resource, not being strictly corpus-based.",
        "We thus report two sets of results: those where we assume that VerbNet is a literal gold standard (i.e. pretend that it is complete), and those where we allow ourselves to make use of other criteria in deciding whether a dependent which is not listed in VerbNet is a complement or modifier.",
        "In addition to VerbNet, we considered ComLex (Grishman et al., 1994) and PropBank as possible sources of syntactic information.",
        "We decided that ComLex unsuitable because it is a purely syntactic resource and does not specify semantic roles for the complements listed in its subcategorisation frames, thus making it impossible to decide in many cases whether a given FrameNet dependent is listed ot not.",

        "We took the lexicon we had harvested from the FrameNet corpus, and extracted all and only those entries (incorporating an orthographic base form, a semantic type, and a subcategorisation frame) which specify at least one PP dependent.",
        "Along with the information about annotated dependents, each entry was also associated with the corpus sentence which it had been harvested from.",
        "A total of 17,000 verb entries were extracted in this way.",
        "The next step was to select a random sample of these for manual checking.",
        "Unfortunately, this proved to be somewhat more problematic than just picking a random subset.",
        "The FrameNet project's approach to annotation has proceeded on a 'frame-by-frame' basis rather than focusing on fully annotating running text, meaning that each frame in turn is fully annotated with respect to its lexical units, before moving on to the next identified frame.",
        "As a result, some frames contain many more lexical units than others, and thus are associated with many more annotated instances.",
        "Thus, of the 261 FrameNet frames implicated in our set of extracted verb entries, the most common 10% account for 65% of the total number of entries.",
        "In particular, just the one frame (Self .motion) accounts for a quarter of all the extracted entries.",
        "We attempted to counteract this bias by limiting each frame to a maximum of two entries, and moreover restricting each verb in a frame to a maximum of one entry.",
        "We were thus left with 593 verb entries in our sample, involving a total of 432 subcategorised Core PP dependents and 204 non-Core ones.",
        "The annotation task involved going through each PP dependent in turn and deciding whether or not VerbNet classifies it as a complement of the target verb.",
        "The relevant decision tree runs as follows:",
        "1.",
        "If the verb is listed in VerbNet with the appropriate sense:",
        "• if the VerbNet class lists the relevant subcategorisation frame, including the PP dependent in question, then mark the dependent as a 'complement'",
        "• if the VerbNet entry does not list the relevant subcate-gorisation frame, including the PP dependent in question:",
        "- if you think that a more complete VerbNet entry for the relevant verb would list the relevant sub-categorisation frame, including the PP dependent in question, then mark the dependent as a 'complement'",
        "- if not, then mark the dependent as a 'non-complement' 2.",
        "If the verb is not listed in VerbNet with the appropriate sense:",
        "• if you think that a more complete VerbNet which did contain an entry for the relevant verb would list the appropriate subcategorisation frame, including the PP dependent in question, then mark the dependent as a 'complement'",

        "Thus, we first of all determined whether the relevant sense of the target verb was included in VerbNet.",
        "If so, and if a matching subcategorisation frame including the dependent as a complement was listed, then it was deemed to be a complement PP.",
        "In cases where either the relevant sense does not exist in VerbNet, or where the relevant verb sense does exist but a matching subcategorisation frame is not listed, things become a little more complicated, due to the incomplete nature of VerbNet as a resource.",

        "In other words, there are a significant number of cases where either a non-Core semantic dependent is realised by a verbal complement or a Core semantic dependent is realised by a verbal modifier.",
        "Although many of these mismatches can be put down to either annotation errors (generally failing to assign a particular use of some verb to the optimal frame) or questionable annotation policy (e.g. annotating as semantic dependents phrases which are definitely not syntactic dependents of the target verb), there remain a large number of such mismatches which are simply a result of the incompatibility of semantic and syntactic notions of 'coreness'.",
        "The fact that the complement-modifier distinction is so difficult to pin down has important implications for parsing and semantic interpretation.",

        "In (4c), the on-PP is syntactically and semantically optional, and it is definitely not a complement, since the location of the event is in no way unique to the sleep predicate.",
        "Unless the parser has access to this kind of information, then it will not be able to judge, for example, that the second sentence has two distinct interpretations, whereas the other two only have one interpretation each.",
        "In addition, note that there is an important contrast between the on-PP complements of rely and fall.",
        "In the former, the preposition on does not contribute any meaning to the sentence, other than to make clear what role its NP complement plays in the situation (i.e. it is basically a case-marker, cf. John trusted the map).",
        "The intrinsic meaning",
        "Table 2: Possible semantic representations using FrameNet roles for utterances in example (4), and their relation to the complement/modifier distinction of the preposition on, involving some object being in contact with the top horizontal surface of some other object, plays no role in the predicate argument structure of this sentence, which can best be represented as something like relyjjn(John,map).",
        "Furthermore, on is the only preposition which can be used here to encode the relevant semantic role (apart from its stylistic variant upon).",
        "In the second sentence, on the other hand, the preposition does contribute its intrinsic meaning to the predicate argument structure – as the place where the trajectory of the fall ends.",
        "Thus, the predicate argument structure of this sentence is more like fall(John,to(on(table))), with the inference that, at the culmination of the event of falling, John is in fact 'on the table'.",
        "Also, a number of other prepositions can be used here to realise the relevant semantic role, e.g. off, under, over, through, etc.",
        "The contrast between argument-marker and predicative uses of prepositions is important both for applications connecting language to reasoning, and for applications using shallow semantic representations.",
        "For example, Kaisser and Webber (2007) describe the use of FrameNet in question answering where questions are paraphrased using verbs in the same frame.",
        "If we consider the paraphrases that apply in our cases, an appropriate paraphrase for (4a) would be John trusted the map, leaving out the preposition on, while an appropriate paraphrase for (4b) would be John dropped on the table, where the preposition is retained, since it is crucial for the meaning.",
        "With this in mind, we decided to investigate how different parsers handle the distinction between predicative and non-predicative uses of prepositions.",
        "We considered: (a) shallow semantic parsers that output FrameNet frames (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002); (b) the LinGO English Resource Grammar (Copestake and Flickinger, 2000), a deep HPSG grammar that produces semantic representations using first-order logic,; and (c) the TRIPS parser Allen et al.",
        "(2007), a unification based parser for dialogue systems.",
        "These systems represent several different ways of using logical forms: semantic parsers are used for question answering (Kaisser and Webber, 2007) and information retrieval (Surdeanu et al., 2003); the LinGO ERG has been used for translating spoken dialogue (Kay et al., 1994); and the TRIPS parser produces semantic representations that are easy to map into representations used by domain specific reasoners common in dialogue systems.",
        "It turns out that these three parsers have all taken different approaches to the distinction between predicative and non-predicative prepositions.",
        "Shallow semantic parsers output frame representations that identify frame element names, but not their specific meanings.",
        "So for (4a), they will identify on the map as a Intermediary, and in 4(b) treat on the table as Goal, leaving open the question whether it is the table alone, or the whole PP, that fills the appropriate slot.",
        "The LinGO ERG parser represents some prepositions as argument markers, but not always consistently, e.g. on in (4a) will be represented as a case marker, but for in John left for Boston will be represented as a regular preposition, as will on in (4b).",
        "In contrast, the TRIPS dialogue parser makes strictly semantic decisions, and marks all PPs where the preposition is not clearly an argument marker as complements (thus ensuring that the the preposition predicates are included in the logical form), but at the expense of being unable to rule out certain syntactically anomalous utterances, such as *John put it.",

        "These differences in approach are not surprising, given that the various syntactic and semantic criteria for identifying complements may not align, as we have shown in this paper, and therefore creating a lexicon that accurately identifies such distinctions is a difficult task.",
        "We are currently working on methods to better represent this distinction in our lexicon.",

        "Is some (optional) prepositional or adjectival phrase a possible dependent of a given verb?",
        "And does a particular preposition correspond to an independent predicate (regardless of whether the dependent can be classified as a complement)?",
        "The method adopted by VerbNet of defining syntactic frames based on alternations is a good approach to defining syntactic complements.",
        "It also takes the first step towards identifying those prepositions that may contribute meaning towards the predicate vs. those which do not, by defining classes of equivalent prepositions (such as location and direction) which may appear in the same PP.",
        "However, since VerbNet is incomplete, we are currently developing a corpus-based approach to answer these questions.",
        "We are particularly interested in the answer to the third question, whether a preposition in a given PP dependent is an argument marker, or contributes meaning to the logical form.",
        "This information is, to our knowledge, not coded in any existing resources.",
        "Adding it would provide essential information for building semantic representations, and therefore make such representations more usable in interpretation tasks."

        "In this paper, we have attempted to evaluate the extent to which the distinction between semantically Core and non-Core dependents, as used in the FrameNet corpus, corresponds to the traditional distinction between syntactic complements and modifiers of a verb.",
        "We used the VerbNet verb database as our gold standard for making judgements about complement-hood, in conjunction with our own intuitions in cases where we considered VerbNet to be incomplete.",
        "We concluded that there is enough agreement between the two notions (0.85) to make practical the simple expedient of equating core PP dependents in FrameNet with PP complements in the wide-coverage verb lexicon we harvested from FrameNet.",
        "Doing so means that we lose around 13% of PP complements, whilst around 9% of the PP dependents left in the lexicon are not complements.",
        "We then discussed the implications of this result for deep parsing, suggesting that for parsers concerned with both syntactic and semantic representations, it may be beneficial to separate the semantic and syntactic aspects of complement/modifier distinction into separate features"
