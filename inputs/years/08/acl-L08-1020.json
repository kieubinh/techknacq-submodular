        "Recently the focus on temporal information in NLP applications has increased (Mani et al., 2005), because this kind of information is useful in question-answering, information extraction or information retrieval, topic detection and tracking, machine translation, linguistic investigation, summarization, and discourse processing.",
        "The temporal elements explicitly present in NL are:",
        "- temporal expressions - references to a calendar or clock system, expressed by NPs, PPs, or AdvPs",
        "- events - syntactically realized through sentences (their syntactic head - the main verb), noun phrases, adjectives, predicative clauses or prepositional phrases.",
        "Implicitly these temporal elements are linked so that the events can be positioned in time, either relatively with respect to other events or on an absolute time axis.",
        "The main objective of our study was to decide how well general temporal theories, developed mainly for English, can be applied to other languages - with emphasis on Romanian.",
        "Therefore we used the TimeBank 1.2. corpus (Pustejovsky et al., 2006), an English news corpus manually annotated and widely used in the temporal community together with TimeML the annotation standard (Sauri et al., 2006).",
        "These LRs are briefly described in section 2.",
        "Because the existing Romanian LRs do not support temporal annotation (Cristea & Forascu, 2006) and the manual temporal annotation is very time consuming, expensive (Pustejovsky et al., 2002) and error-prone, including for Romanian (Forascu & Solomon, 2004), we decided to translate the English TimeBank and then to use the help or backup from the same annotation applied to a parallel text.",
        "The translation, preprocessing and alignment of the corpus are presented in section 3.",
        "In order to have linguistic evidence of how temporal information is really used in Romanian, as source of evidence to inform and substantiate the theory, we automatically imported the temporal annotation from",
        "English to Romanian.",
        "Together with an evaluation of this import, we identified cases of English temporal elements not marked in the corpus, situation in line with the current status of the TimeBank corpus (Boguraev & Ando, 2006).",
        "These activities are described in section 4.",
        "The high success rate of the automatic import and the evaluation study shows that the import is a solution if the temporal information has to be studied based on linguistic evidence.",

        "The two translators worked separately, sharing the original English corpus; hence an inter-translator agreement could not be estimated.",
        "Some basic translation principles are the followings:",
        "• The sentences are translated in a 1:1 correspondence, whenever the language permits it, so that the sentence-alignment is directly obtained through translation.",
        "• The translation equivalents have as much as possible the same part-of-speech; when the English word has a Romanian cognate, this is used in translation, and not its Romanian paraphrase.",
        "• All words are translated and stylistic variations are avoided, so as not to introduce words or expressions without an English equivalent.",
        "• The tense of verbs is mapped onto its corresponding Romanian one, the modifications being accepted only on linguistic grounds, but not stylistic.",
        "• The format of the dates, moments of day and numbers conforms to the norms of written Romanian.",
        "The sentence alignment of the corpus was obtained as a direct output of the translation.",
        "A first automatic import showed that the translation needed more improvements.",
        "Therefore a manual check performed on the parallel corpus allowed us to detect and correct also some other lacks and inconsistencies in the way the translators worked.",
        "In the 4715 sentences (translation units) of the current version of the Romanian corpus there are 65375 lexical tokens, including punctuation marks, representing 12640 lexical types.",
        "The English and Romanian raw texts were preprocessed in order to obtain the corpus in the format required by the lexical aligner.",
        "Using the TTL module (Ion, 2007), the texts were tokenized - based on the MtSeg model, POS-tagged - using an adaptation of the TnT tagger, lemmatized - based on a lexicon, and chunked - using regular expressions.",

        "• construct a list E of pairs of English text fragments with sequences of English indexes from Sen and Ten.",
        "Due to the fact that the tokenization of Sen is different from that of Ten, the list E is needed in order to map English text fragments from Ten with sequences of indexes from Sen so as to be able to use the Romanian lexical alignments which exist relative to these indexes..",
        "• add to every element of E the XML context in which that text fragment appeared.",

        "A more detailed statistic, on all tags, is illustrated in Table 1.",
        "The 3.47 % of non-transferred tags are due to missing translations (though the Romanian translation was a good and natural one), non-lexicalisations in Romanian, or missing alignments.",

        "• the transfer can not be performed; (Impossible).",
        "For the statistics in table 2, summarizing the four situations encountered during the temporal annotation import, we will not refer to the offline markups, because they are automatically imported only if the elements they are linked to are present in the text.",
        "The situations encountered in our study for the EVENT tag are the followings:",
        "• The amendments needed to be done in the automatic import are due mainly to the TimeML rule stating that in cases of phrases, the EVENT tag should mark only the head of the construction.",
        "This is the case for Romanian reflexive verbs (the reflexive pronoun was marked inside the tag), Romanian verbal collocations, and compound verb phrases.",
        "• The intercalation of an adverb/conjunction between the verbs forming a verb phrase was the only Language Specific phenomenon that occurred in the files we used in our study; these 0.36% cases, when the EVENT tags were automatically imported also on the auxiliary Romanian verb, were corrected for the EVENTs included in our study.",
        "• The 0.48% Impossible transfers, due to missing translations, non-lexicalisations in Romanian, or missing alignments, were also corrected.",
        "The 8.33% situations when amendments were needed for the transfer of the TIMEX3 tag are due to missing alignments or the wrong markings of the Romanian prepositions as part of TIMEX3.",
        "The 12.12% situations of impossible transfer of a SIGNAL tag are due to non-lexicalisation in Romanian.",
        "Even if the main objective of our study was to detect the types and situations encountered during the automatic annotation import, the study permitted, as a side-effect, to identify and mark temporal elements not (yet) marked in the English TimeBank 1.2.",
        "We modified and marked only new tags of type EVENT, TIMEX3 and SIGNAL using the Callisto annotation tool for both the Romanian and English parts of the parallel corpus, with the Tango TimeML Importer.",
        "In the snapshot illustrated in Figure 1, one can see that there were some problems with missing spaces between words and the Romanian diacritics.",
        "For the EVENTs we classified as such another 104 elements: 70 OCCURENCEs (nouns: missions, training, fight, (mediation) effort, demarcation, move, as well as verbs: supervising, leading, include), 5 of the",
        "REPORTING class (say, said), 21 belonging to the STATE class (belongs, look, ceiling, staying, war, policies), 1 event of type I ACTION (include), and 7 from the I STATE class (like, think, (have the) power).",
        "The rationale behind these modifications is that each sentence expresses an event, even if not so well temporally-anchored.",
        "We have marked two new temporal expressions (TIMEX3 tag) for which the value is PASTREF - meaning that the expressions do not have a specific value, but they can be normalised according to the extended ISO 8601 standard used in TimeML: once, not that long ago.",
        "The 19 new SIGNALs are most probably due to inevitable manual annotation mistakes: several, when, meanwhile, time and again, after, on.",
        "As we mentioned before, some of these signals are not lexicalized in Romanian, hence we marked them only in the English corpus.",
        "Moreover, the absence of some SIGNALs didn't permit to identify multiple instantiations for some EVENTs.",

        "The most important conclusion is that, as the manual annotation of the temporal expressions, events and their links is very time-consuming and expensive, the automatic transfer of annotations represents a solution, provided a parallel corpus involving the target language exists, the source language displays temporal annotation, the target language has similar temporal conceptualizations, and adequate processing tools are available.",
