        "In the context of Natural Language Processing, annotation is about recovering implicit information that is useful for natural language applications.",
        "In this paper we describe a \"tense\" annotation task for Chinese, a language that does not have grammatical tense, that is designed to infer the temporal location of a situation in relation to the temporal deixis, the moment of speech.",
        "If successful, this would be a highly rewarding endeavor as it has application in many natural language systems.",
        "Our preliminary experiments show that while this is a very challenging annotation task for which high annotation consistency is very difficult but not impossible to achieve.",

        "The notion of tense is a subject of lively debate in recent theoretical Chinese linguistics literature.",
        "Much of the controversy surrounds the question of whether tense is a useful theoretical construct.",
        "Huang (1984) and Li (1990) suggest there is a finite-nonfinite distinction in Chinese syntax which implies the existence of a phonologically empty tense category in the syntactic representation of a clause.",
        "Other researchers (Hu et al., 2001; Lin, 2003; Lin, 2006; Smith and Erbaugh, 2005) contend that such an abstract notion of tense is not justified for Chinese.",
        "In spite of this controversy, there is a general agreement that Chinese does not have grammatical tense.",
        "That is, Chinese does not have tense morphemes that are dedicated to mark the temporal location of situations, like English.",
        "However, Chinese speakers, like speakers of other world languages, use the moment of speech as the temporal deixis to temporally locate situations in their communication.",
        "One piece of evidence for this is that temporal adverbials like 4A (\"today\"), sji A (\"tomorrow\") and t A (\"yesterday\") all assume a temporal deixis that is the moment ofspeech.",
        "Corpus annotation provides a new perspective from which we can look into how Chinese speakers interpret situations temporally.",
        "Through linguistic annotation, we can determine whether Chinese speakers consistently identify the temporal locations of situations.",
        "To the extent that they do, this information would be highly useful for natural language processing systems that can learn from the human interpretations through statistical and machine learning approaches.",
        "For example, this information would be highly valuable to Machine Translation.",
        "To translate a language like Chinese into a language like English in which tense is grammatically marked with inflectional morphemes, an MT system will have to infer the necessary temporal information to determine the correct tense for verbs.",
        "Statistical MT systems, the currently dominant research paradigm, typically do not address this issue directly.",
        "As a result, when evaluated for tense, current MT systems often perform miserably.",
        "For example, when a simple sentence like \"Whe BJf A/tomorrow HL ® /return _L ^/Shanghai\" is given to",
        "Google's state-of-the-art Machine Translation system, it produces the output \"He returned to Shanghai tomorrow\", instead of the correct \"he will return to Shanghai tomorrow\".",
        "The past tense on the verb \"returned\" contradicts the temporal expression \"tomorrow\".",
        "Ye et al. (2006), for example, reported that the best MT systems only get the tense correct 47% of the time, worse than the 69.5% when the most frequent tense (which is the past tense) is assigned.",
        "In this paper we report a preliminary study in which we ask Chinese native speakers to temporally locate situations denoted by verbs in naturally occurring text and assign a label that indicates their temporal relations to the document creation time."

      "text": [
        "The three temporal points, Speech Time, Reference Time and Situation Time are generally accepted as important to temporal interpretation since Reichenbach (1947) first proposed them.",
        "Speech Time and Reference Time are important to the interpretation of tense.",
        "Speech Time is the moment of speech, and Reference time is the temporal perspective from which the speaker invites his audience to consider a situation, and Situation Time is the time at which the situation actually occurs.",
        "In the \"tense\" annotation study we report here, we annotate the relation between Speech Time and Situation Time instead of the relation between Speech Time and Reference time, which in our judgment is too subtle to be annotated consistently.",
        "In determining the different values of tense, one important question to ask is whether one should use the tense taxonomy of a particular language like English, or use a tag set that abstracts away from the language-specific properties.",
        "In a previous pilot tense annotation study motivated by Chinese-English machine translation, Ye (2007) used a tagset that is a direct reflection of the English tense system.",
        "She used a set of 11 tags that represent different combinations of the three tenses (present, past and future) and aspect (perfect, progressive).",
        "However, there are reasons for not borrowing the English tense taxonomy directly.",
        "First, the English system does not consistently encode the relation between Speech time and Situation time.",
        "For example, in \"He will call me after he gets here\", while his \"getting here\" happens at a time in the future, it is assigned the present tense because it is in a clause introduced by \"after\".",
        "The annotation of the Chinese tense should not be bound by such English idiosyncrasies.",
        "Instead it should annotate temporal notions that are more universal.",
        "Similarly, in English one can either use an infinitive marker or the future tense to indicate that the temporal location of a situation is in the future.",
        "For example, in \"He hopes to leave\", one can infer that leaving is something in the future, much like the leaving in \"he hopes that she will leave\", where the future tense is explicitly marked.",
        "In a language like Chinese that lacks overt tense markers, if the task is to annotate tense as it is used in English, the choice will be indeterminate in such situations.",
        "It makes more sense to annotate the abstract relation between Speech Time and Situation Time which is more deterministic.",
        "Adopting the English tense taxonomy also limits the pool of potential annotators, who would have to be proficient in both Chinese and English.",
        "Such annotators are generally hard to find.",
        "In written text, which is the primary source of data that we are dealing with, the temporal deixis is the document creation time.",
        "All situations are temporally related to this document creation time except in direct quotations, where the temporal location is relative to the moment of speech of the speaker who is quoted.",
        "For example, in (1), there are several verbs involved.",
        "The temporal location of ft (\"say\") assumes that the temporal deixis is the document creation time, while .JL (\"be\"), M k (\"want\") are inside the direct quotations of ^ JJ, the speaker, and their temporal location is relative to the time when he performed that speech act.",
        "Suokang once to he DE mother say : \" he be I DE property , I want BA he roll into ball , put in pocket \"Suokang once said to his mother: 'He is my property.",
        "If I want to roll him into a ball and put it in my pocket,",
        "Tenses that relate the situation time to the document creation time or the moment of speech are considered to be absolute tenses, even though the moment of speech is variable and constantly changes.",
        "The term situation covers events and states in the broad sense of those terms and they are generally signaled by the presence of a verb.",
        "In other cases, the temporal location of a situation cannot be defined in relation to the moment of speech, at least not directly.",
        "For example in (2), The temporal location of ^ (\"intend\") cannot be determined independently of the temporal location of if Jt(\"reveal\").",
        "The temporal location of ^ k is simultaneous with if 3J.",
        "If the temporal location of if JJ is in the past, then the temporal location of ^ k is also in the past.",
        "If the temporal location of if JJ is in the future, then the temporal location of ^kis also in the future.",
        "In this specific case, the situation denoted by the matrix verb if J is in the past.",
        "Therefore the situation denoted by ^ k is also located in the past.",
        "he also reveal Russia intend in next ten years within.",
        "to Iran provide weapons .",
        "\"He also revealed that Russia intended to provide weapons to Iran within the next ten years.\"",
        "In our Chinese \"tense\" annotation task, we annotate both absolute and relative tenses.",
        "By \"tense\", we mean the temporal relation between the temporal deixis and the situation (in the case of absolute tense) and between situations (in the case of relative tense).",
        "The situation time can be anterior to (in the past), simultaneous with (in the present), or posterior to (in the future) the moment of speech.",
        "Since there is no grammatical tense that can be directly observed in Chinese text, the tense annotation as defined here is a temporal inference exercise.",
        "The \"situations\" that we are interested in are expressed as clauses centered around a verb, and for the sake of convenience we mark the \"tense\" on the verb itself instead of the entire clause.",
        "However, when inferring the temporal location of the situation, we have to take into consideration the entire clause, because the arguments and modifiers of a verb are just as important as the verb itself when determining the temporal location of the situation.",
        "For example, in the absence of additional information such as temporal adverbials, the default temporal location of (3 a) is the present while the default temporal location of (3b) is the past, even though the verb is the same in these two clauses.",
        "(3a) describes a habitual situation where the person described sleeps a lot repeatedly, even though he is not in a perpetual state of sleep.",
