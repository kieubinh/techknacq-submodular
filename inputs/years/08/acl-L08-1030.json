        "We present a new corpus for computational stylometry, more specifically authorship attribution and the prediction of author personality from text.",
        "Because of the large number of authors (145), the corpus will allow previously impossible studies of variation in features considered predictive for writing style.",
        "The innovative meta-information (personality profiles of the authors) associated with these texts allows the study of personality prediction, a not yet very well researched aspect of style.",
        "In this paper, we describe the contents of the corpus and show its use in both authorship attribution and personality prediction.",
        "We focus on features that have been proven useful in the field of author recognition.",
        "Syntactic features like part-of-speech n-grams are generally accepted as not being under the author's conscious control and therefore providing good clues for predicting gender or authorship.",
        "We want to test whether these features are helpful for personality prediction and authorship attribution on a large set of authors.",
        "Both tasks are approached as text categorization tasks.",
        "First a document representation is constructed based on feature selection from the linguistically analyzed corpus (using the Memory-Based Shallow Parser (MBSP)).",
        "These are associated with each of the 145 authors or each of the four components of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (Introverted-Extraverted, Sensing-iNtuitive, Thinking-Feeling, Judging-Perceiving).",

        "The style in which a text is written reflects an array of metainformation concerning the text (e.g. topic, register and genre) and its author (e.g. gender, region, age and personality).",
        "The field of computational stylometry addresses these aspects of style.",
        "We approach stylometry as an automatic text categorization task that labels documents according to a set of predefined categories (Sebastiani, 2002).",
        "Like most text categorization systems, it takes a two-stage approach which (i) achieves automatic selection of features that have high predictive value for the categories to be learned, and (ii) uses machine learning algorithms to learn to categorize new documents by using the features selected in the first stage.",
        "To allow the selection of linguistic features rather than (n-grams of) terms, robust and accurate text analysis tools such as lemmatizers, part of speech taggers, chun-kers etc., are necessary.",
        "Recently, language technology has progressed to a state of the art in which this has become feasible.",
        "This enables the systematic study of the variation of these linguistic properties in texts by different authors (Baayen et al., 1996), time periods, genres or registers (Argamon et al., 2003a), regiolects, and even genders (Argamon et al., 2003a).",
        "In this paper, we focus on personality prediction and authorship attribution.",
        "A lot of the research in authorship attribution is performed on a small set of authors, which is an artificial situation.",
        "Trying to classify an unseen text as being written by one of two or a few authors is a relatively simple task, which in most cases can be solved with high reliability and accuracies over 95%.",
        "Hardly any corpora - except for some based on blogs (Koppel et al., 2006) or Usenet newsgroups (Argamon et al., 2003b) - have more than ten candidate authors.",
        "Forensic experts typically use stylometry to indicate which of a small number of suspects is the most likely to have written a short text, without being able to rule out the fact that there might be other people in play.",
        "Many studies in stylometry overestimate the importance of linguistic features in experiments discriminating between only two or a small number of authors.",
        "We developed the Personae corpus to investigate this phenomenon.",
        "Documents written by 145 authors allow us to investigate the performance of authorship attribution on a large set of authors.",
        "The corpus is also used for the prediction of the author's personality, a not yet very well researched aspect of style.",
        "Our aim is to test whether personality traits such as extraversion are reflected in writing style.",
        "Studies in language psychology show that there is a direct correlation between personality and language: personality is projected linguistically and can be perceived through language (Gill, 2003; Gill and Oberlander, 2002; Campbell and Pennebaker, 2003).",
        "These studies are however not in a prediction context, but in a descriptive statistics context.",
        "The main focus is on extraversion and neuroticism, two of \"the most salient and visible personality traits\" (Gill, 2003).",
        "We want to take the study of personality in text further in three ways:",
        "i.",
        "By collecting texts on a non-personality related topic, in this case artificial life.",
        "A number of studies in personality prediction and language psychology rely on stream-of-consciousness essays or deep self-analysis (Argamon et al., 2005; Mairesse et al., 2007), and even texts about traumatic experiences (Campbell and Pennebaker, 2003).",
        "We also did no extensive cleaning-up of the corpus, in contrast to Nowson and Oberlander (2007).",
        "ii.",
        "By collecting a corpus of Dutch written language for the prediction of personality, while other studies focus on English.",
        "Nevertheless, we believe our techniques to be transferable to other languages.",

        "By testing whether we can automatically predict personality based on writing.",
        "Only a few studies we know of combine the fields of stylometry and language psychology in a prediction context (Argamon et al., 2005; Nowson and Oberlander, 2007; Mairesse et al., 2007).",
        "iv.",
        "By extending the task to eight discrimination tasks and four binary classification tasks.",

        "The central question in authorship attribution is Which of the candidate authors wrote a particular document?",

        "On the basis of those linguistic patterns and markers (e.g., part-of-speech tags), the author of a document can be identified.",
        "Most traditional studies use small sets of authors.",
        "Frequencies of rewrite rules (Baayen et al., 1996), n-grams of syntactic labels from partial parsing (Hirst and Feiguina, 2007), n-grams of parts-of-speech (Diederich et al., 2000), function words (Miranda Garcia and Calle Martin, 2007), and functional lexical features (Argamon et al., 2007) have been shown to be reliable markers of style.",
        "New metrics have been proposed for calculating the distance between authors, like the Delta measure (Burrows, 2002) and a measure for intertextual distance suggested by Labbe and Labbe (2006).",
        "The field of authorship attribution is however dominated by studies overestimating the importance of these predictive features in experiments discriminating between only two or a few authors.",
        "Taking into account a larger set of authors allows the computation of the degree of variability encountered in text on a single topic of different (types of) features.",
        "Recently, research has started to focus on authorship identification on larger sets of authors: 8 (Van Halteren, 2005), 20 (Argamon et al., 2003b), 114 (Madigan et al., 2005), or up to thousands of authors (Koppel et al., 2006) (see Section 5.1).",
        "Most of the research in personality prediction involves the Five-Factor Model of Personality: openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism.",
        "These so-called Big Five have been criticized for their limited scope, methodology and the absence of an underlying theory.",
        "Argamon et al.",
        "(2005) predict personality in student essays using functional lexical features.",
        "These features represent lexical and structural choices made in the text.",
        "The corpus was specifically built for personality prediction.",
        "Each student was asked to write a stream-of-consciousness essay and an essay of deep self-analysis.",
        "A downside of this approach is, that the students are aware their personality is under investigation, which may influence their writing style.",
        "Nowson and Oberlander (2007) perform feature selection and training on a small and clean weblog corpus, and test on a large, automatically selected corpus.",
        "Features include n-grams of words with predictive strength for the binary classification tasks.",
        "Openness is excluded from the experiments because of the skewed class distribution.",
        "Their study depends on a training corpus with accurate personality scores and clean text, which is hardly compatible with realistic situations.",
        "To mimic a realistic testing situation, they do considerably less cleaning up in the larger test corpus.",
        "While the two studies mentioned above took a bottom-up approach, Mairesse et al.",
        "(2007) approach personality prediction from a top-down perspective.",
        "On a written text corpus, they test the predictive strength of linguistic features that have been proposed in descriptive statistics studies.",

        "All students released the copyright of their text to the University of Antwerp and explicitly allowed the use of their text and associated MBTI personality profile for research, which makes it possible to distribute the corpus.",
        "The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) (Briggs Myers and Myers, 1980) is a forced-choice test based on Carl Jung's personality typology (Jung, 1921) and designed to categorize a person according to four preferences:",

        "• iNtuition and Sensing (information-gathering functions): N's trust more abstract or theoretical information, while S's trust information that is concrete.",
        "• Feeling and Thinking (decision-making functions): While F's decide based on emotions, T's tend to involve logic and reason in their decisions.",
        "• Judging and Perceiving (lifestyle): J's prefer structure in their lives, while P's like change.",
        "MBTI correlates with the Big Five (i.e. the Five-Factor Model of Personality) personality characteristics of extraversion and openness, to a lesser extent with agreeableness and consciousness, but not with neuroticism (McCrae and Costa, 1989).",
        "The participants' characteristics are too homogeneous for experiments concerning gender (77% female), mother tongue (97% native speaker of Flemish-Dutch) or region (77% from the Antwerp region), but we find interesting distributions in at least two of the four MBTI preferences (see",
        "Table 1).",
        "Personality measurement in general, and the MBTI is no exception, is a controversial domain.",
        "However, especially for scores on IE and NS dimensions, consensus seems to be that they are indeed correlated with personality traits.",

        "Syntactic features have been proposed as more reliable style markers than for example token-level features since they are not under the conscious control of the author (Baayen et al., 1996; Argamon et al., 2007).",
        "We use the Memory-Based Shallow Parser (MBSP) (Daelemans et al., 1999), which gives an incomplete parse of the input text, to extract reliable syntactic features.",
        "MBSP tokenizes the input, performs a part-of-speech analysis, looks for noun phrase, verb phrase and other phrase chunks and detects subject and object of the sentence and a number of other grammatical relations.",
        "Words or parts-of-speech (n-grams) occurring more often than expected in either of the categories are extracted automatically for every document.",
