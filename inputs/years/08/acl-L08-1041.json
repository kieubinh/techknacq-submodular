        "Componential semantics has a long tradition in Linguistics since the work of Hjelmslev in the thirties or Katz and Fodor (1963) among generativists.",
        "There is common agreement that this kind of lexical-semantic information can be extremely valuable for making complex linguistic decisions.",
        "Nevertheless, according to Simone (1990), componential analysis cannot be actually achieved due to three main reasons (being the first the most important): (1) the vocabulary of a language is too large, (2) each word needs several features for its semantics to be adequately represented and (3) semantic features should be organized in several levels.",
        "Wordnets are large lexical resources freely-available and widely used by the NLP community.",
        "Currently, they serve a wide number of tasks involving some degree of semantic processing.",
        "In most of these tasks, wordnets are used to generalize or abstract a set of synsets to a subsuming one by following the WordNet hierarchy up.",
        "The main problem is finding the right level of generalization; that is, finding the concept which optimally subsumes a given set of concepts; but it could be the case that the class which would optimally capture the generalization is not lexical (i.e. a synset), but abstract thus being better represented by non-lexical semantic features.",
        "It can also be the case that wordnet simply is not the kind of taxonomy required; this can be due to several reasons: incompleteness, incorrect structuring, or perhaps that WordNet's structure should be arranged differently for particular NLP tasks.",
        "For many tasks, it seems that using a feature-annotated lexicon seems more appropriate than using the WordNet tree-structure, since (i) the WordNet hierarchy is not consistently structured (Guarino, 1998) and (ii) a feature-annotated lexicon allows to make predictions based on measures of similarity even for words that, being sparsely distributed in WordNet, can only be generalized by reaching common hypernyms in levels too high in the hierarchy.",
        "Besides, a multiple-feature design allows to naturally depict semantically complex concepts, such as the so-called dot-objects (Pustejovsky, 1995), intrinsically polysemic words as for instance \"letter\", since a letter is something that can both be destroyed and carry information (as in \"I burnt your love letter\").",
        "Our work provides a good solution to all these questions, since 65,989 noun concepts from WordNet 1.6 (WN1.6) (Fellbaum, 1998) corresponding to 116,364 noun lexemes (variants) have been consistently annotated with an average of 6.47 features per synset, being those features organized in a multilevel hierarchy.",
        "WN1.6 was adopted in EuroWordNet (EWN) as an Inter-Linguistic Index (ILI).",
        "Therefore, this resource might allow componential semantics to be tested and applied in real world situations probably for the first time, thus contributing to a wide number of NLP tasks involving semantic processing: Word Sense Disambiguation, Syntactic Parsing using selectional restrictions, Semantic Parsing or Reasoning.",
        "Despite its wide scope, the work presented here is envisaged to be the first stage of an incremental and iterative process, as we do not assume that the current version of the EWN Top Concept Ontology (TCO) covers the optimal set of features for the aforementioned tasks.",
        "Currently, a second phase has started within the framework of the KNOW Project in which the first version of the enriched lexicon is being used to label a corpus in order to abstracting semantic properties of verbs.",
        "This will lead, presumably, to a reformulation of the TCO features and structure, probably following Vossen (2001).",

        "have a long tradition in theoretical lexical semantics so they have been usually postulated as semantic components of meanings.",

        "- 1stOrderEntity (physical things) - 2ndOrderEntity (events, states and properties) - 3rdOrderEntity (unobservable entities) 1st Order entities are further distinguished in terms of four ways of conceptualizing things (Pustejovsky, 1995):",

      "text": [
        "Our methodology for annotating the ILI with the TCO follows the strategy defined in Atserias et al.",
        "(2004) and it is based on the common assumption that hyponymy corresponds to feature set inclusion (Cruse, 2002) and in the observation that, since wordnets are taken to be crucially structured by hyponymy \"(...) by augmenting important hierarchy nodes with basic semantic features, it is possible to create a rich semantic lexicon in a consistent and cost-effective way after inheriting these features through the hyponymy relations\" (Sanfilippo et al., 1999).",
        "Nevertheless, performing such operation is not straightforward, as (i) wordnets are not consistently structured by hyponymy (Guarino, 1998), and (ii) they allow multiple inheritance.",
        "Notwithstanding, these drawbacks, instead of hindering our work, have been situations we have taken advantage of.",
        "As told above, within the EWN project, a limited set of lexical BCs was annotated with TCO features.",
        "Despite being largely general in meaning, this set did not cover all of the upper level nodes in the wordnets.",
        "Thus, the first step of our work consisted of annotating the gaps up the hierarchy, from the BCs to the unique beginners.",
        "This was made semiautomatically: synsets were assigned a TCO feature via a table of expected equivalence between TCO nodes and WN1.6 Semantic Files, e.g.:",
        "This made WN1.6 ready to be fully populated with at least one feature per synset.",
        "Nevertheless, in many cases, synsets got more than one feature, for one or more of the following reasons:",
        "- They were BCs, so they had been manually annotated with several features",
        "- In addition to their own manual annotation, they inherited features from one or more of their hypernyms",
        "- They inherited features from different hypernyms, either located at different levels in a single track of hierarchy or by the effect of multiple inheritance",
        "The work has been based on TCO feature incompatibilities.",
        "Throughout the process, co-occurrences of pairs of incompatible features in a synset have been automatically detected.",
        "The axiomatic incompatibilities are the following:",
        "- 1stOrderEntity - 2ndOrderEntity - 1 stOrderEntity - 3rdOrderEntity",
        "- 3rdOrderEntity - 2ndOrderEntity [except for SituationComponent] - 3rdOrderEntity - Mental - Object - Substance - Artifact - Natural - Animal - Creature - Human - Plant - Dynamic - Static - BoundedEvent - UnboundedEvent - Property - Relation - Physical - Mental - Agentive - Phenomenal - Stimulating",
        "The first round of feature expansion caused the following number of conflicts:",
        "- 214 feature conflicts in 49 synsets caused by incompatible hand annotation",
        "- 2,247 feature conflicts in 743 synsets caused by hand annotation incompatible with inherited features",
        "- 225,447 feature conflicts in 26,166 synsets caused by incompatibility between inherited features",
        "The first type of conflicts usually pointed to synsets causing ontological doubts to the annotators of the EWN project (e.g., \"skin\", it is an object or a substance?).",
        "The third type usually reveals errors in WordNet structure such as ISA overloading (Guarino, 1998) or other kinds of inconsistencies.",
        "The second type might be caused by either or both reasons.",
        "Manual checking of feature incompatibilities led to (i) adding or deleting ontological features, and (ii) setting inheritance blockage points.",
        "A blockage point is an annotation in WN1.6 which breaks the ISA relation between two synsets, thus no information can be passed through it by inheritance.",
        "When a case of feature incompatibility occurred, the synset involved, together with its structural surroundings (hypernyms, hyponyms), was analyzed in detail.",
        "If the problem was due to a WN1.6 subsumption error, the corresponding link was blocked and synsets below the blockage point were annotated with new TCO features.",
        "Changes in the annotation were made and blockage points were set until all conflicts were resolved.",
        "Then, following an iterative and incremental approach, inheritance was being recalculated and the resulting data was re-examined several times.",
        "Despite the large number of conflicts to solve, the task ended up being feasible because working on the topmost origin of one conflict usually results in fixing many levels of hyponyms.",
        "Regarding the completion of the work, the possibility that some areas in the WordNet hierarchy have remained unexamined cannot be completely excluded, although it should be noticed that more than 13,000 manual changes have been made and that, when removing links or features to fix errors, all hyponymy lines involved by the action have been checked again and newly annotated in order not to loss information.",
        "The task has been carried out using application interfaces, which allowed accessing the synsets and their glosses in three languages at the same time: English, Spanish and Catalan.",
        "The following information was used in order to make decisions:",
        "- Relational information regarding the synset under study and its neighbors; i.e. the WN1.6 structure",
        "- The nature of the conflict (any of the three types of incompatibility aforementioned) - Synsets' glosses as provided by EWN",
        "- Glosses, descriptions and examples of the TCO features as provided in Alonge et al.",
        "(1998)",
        "- Usual word-substitution tests that acknowledge hyponymy, as in Cruse (1986 pp.",
        "88-92).",
        "The task finished when finally a re-expansion of properties did not result in new conflicts.",
        "Then, two final steps were applied.",
        "First, as the TCO is itself a hierarchy, for every synset, its resulting annotation was expanded up-feature - e.g. when a synset bore the feature Animal it was also labeled Living, Natural, Origin and 1stOrderEntity.",
        "Second, the whole noun hierarchy was checked for consistency using formal Theorem Provers like Vampire (Riazanov and Voronkov, 2002) and E-prover (Schulz, 2002).",

        "The difference is that our annotation is (i) multiple thus more flexible (SUMO links each synset to only one label of the ontology), and (ii) more workable, since it uses a more intuitive and simple ontology (SUMO is a very large and complex one)."

        "(2005) and Alvez et al.",
        "(2008).",
        "A simple but very typical case is the following, in which the conflict comes from the combination of multiple inheritance and the incorrect use of hyponymy instead of meronymy in WN1.6:",
        "Clearly, Bandung is a city, but it is not a Java (though it is a part of Java).",
        "This case is revealed thanks to incompatibility between features Natural and Artifact.",
        "It is fixed by blocking the subsumption link between Bandung_1 and Java_1:",
        "At this point, it is worth noticing that in the original typology of ontological miscategorizations first established by Guarino (1998), four main sources of taxonomic inconsistencies were described: (a) overgeneralization, (b) reduction of sense, (c) confusion of senses and (d) suspect type-to-role relationships.",
        "During our research we set aside the last type, for it was regarded as carrying information which is both truthful and still useful in a lexical network.",
        "Moreover, we did uncover three new types of pervasive misconceptions: (i) extensional ambiguities, (ii) conflicts between 3rdOrderEntity versus Mental 2nd Order entities and (iii) technical inconsistencies of different sorts.",
        "Let us now see some examples of what our methodology has been able to uncover.",
        "Overgeneralization takes place whenever one synset has as its hyponyms one or more synsets whose meaning is not entailed by the meaning of the so-called hypernym.",
        "\"Accolade\", for example, is a tangible entity intended to express approval.",
        "Its hyponyms, however, include both events (\"citation\", \"mention\") and concepts (social constructs, e.g. \"academic degree\").",
        "Therefore, the synset has been overgeneralized: it comprises hyponyms which do not belong in its semantic class.",
        "Conflicts arise subsequently when semantic features associated with the hypernym pass on incorrectly to its hyponyms.",
        "A reduction of sense occurs whenever a hypernym accounts for a part of the meaning of one of its hyponyms, while failing to express some other crucially relevant semantic component.",
        "Take the case of {counterfoil_1, stub_4}, which is a piece of paper which conveys specific information having to do with money transfers.",
        "As such, it should have been labeled as 1stOrderEntity and, particularly, Money Representation.",
        "However, all of its hypernyms refer to \"information, content\", and go up to {abstraction_1}, from which this whole taxonomic path derives.",
        "That is, no single ancestor accounts for the fact that a counterfoil is a piece a paper (all of them have to do with the information the counterfoil conveys).",
        "A confusion of senses occurs when two conflicting lines of inheritance converge into one single synset.",
        "Thus, in the case of {ID_1}, EWN uses two semantically disjoint lines of inheritance (as a physical entity, a badge, and as the information regarding somebody's identity) to express two different meaning components.",
        "As the current design of the TCO still doesn't allow such cross-order semantic conflation, this was solved blocking one of the lines of inheritance (that corresponding to the information meaning component).",
        "With this term we refer to the fact that some entities seem to be objects in some sense but substances in yet another sense, which is why they cannot be properly labeled as either.",
        "\"Layer\", for example, refers just to an amount of matter in a homogeneous disposition over some surface.",
        "Therefore, a layer is made of some substance.",
        "On the other hand, however, it is not that substance: a layer lies over something else, so that it has at least one limiting boundary, which is one of the characteristic features based on which objects are distinguished from substances (i.e. having definite boundaries).",
        "At the same time, however, a layer as such is not an object proper, either: since it only lies relative to some other object, its limits are not intrinsic, but relative to this other object.",
        "One would never say, \"there are two objects on the table, one vase and a layer of wood\".",
        "So, synsets of this kind were left unspecified for extension, whereas previous feature inheritance usually resulting in their being labeled either as objects or substances.",
        "4.5.",
        "Conflicts between 3rd Order entities and Mental 2nd Order entities",
        "When the time came to assign semantic features to synsets such as {unit_of_measurement_1}, it was not altogether clear whether these were to be better labeled as 3rdOrderEntity (i.e. concepts) or as Mental 2nd Order entities (in this case, relations).",
        "Any unit of measurement expresses a relation between an entity and the reference used to measure that entity but, as far as the relation itself is concerned, is it abstract?",
        "That is, could a relation be so without being abstract?",
        "This would seem rather weird, for what is \"specific\" about a relation are the related entities, not the relation itself.",
        "In fact, relations are built on commonalities and commonalities cannot, by definition, be specific.",
        "Therefore, we arrived at a point at which a synset could only be a 2nd Order Relation if it was at the same time a 3rd Order entity, which simply exceeded the current theoretical framework.",
