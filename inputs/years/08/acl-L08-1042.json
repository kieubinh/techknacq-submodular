        "Picture search represents an important part of queries users express when using Internet information retrieval applications and all major search engines propose dedicated facilities.",
        "In the current paradigm, the retrieval process is based on the use of text chains related to the image file and the results are only partially relevant for the user query.",
        "With the exception of Ask, the Internet search engines do not systematically employ semantic resources to propose related queries on the answers page, a fact that limits the interaction to the expression of a query and the browsing of the results.",
        "It is interesting to note that major commercial actors do not include image processing techniques like the content based retrieval, in their architectures.",
        "This could be an effect of the fact that such techniques are difficultly scalable to the size of the Internet picture repository and that the obtained results do not resemble from a human's point of view.",
        "Consistent research efforts (Joshi, 2006), (Wang, 2006), (Liao, 2005) are directed toward the introduction of semantic resources in image search applications and the use of such structures is showed to fit the users' need.",
        "One important challenge is to propose semantic frameworks that are appropriated for a use in real-world applications, like Web search engines.",
        "An interesting characteristic of Internet image queries is that they are generally composed of few words (Jansen, 2004).",
        "The same study shows that, for the most of the times, the users tend to look only at the first answers pages.",
        "These facts should be remembered when designing retrieval architectures.",
        "In this paper, we describe Olive, a picture retrieval framework that employs a large scale conceptual hierarchy to provide a dual access to Web images.",
        "Here, we present a working system that builds on (Popescu, 2007a), where we mainly discussed the principles sustaining its construction.",
        "The employed semantic structure includes over 117000 English terms, which cover a hefty chunk of common nouns as well as some representative proper names.",
        "Queries can be expressed using keywords or using one of the retrieved items as seed for a conceptually controlled CBIR process.",
        "The system employs ontological relations in WordNet (Miller, 1990) to automatically disambiguate and reformulate user queries, to present results in a structured manner and to propose related concepts for browsing.",
        "If a term is polysemous, the user is presented with separate image answers sets.",
        "For each query, the systems checks if the concept has subtypes in the hierarchy and, if so, images corresponding to leaf nodes are collected on the fly using Google Image and proposed to the user in response to the initial query.",
        "As a consequence, Olive proposes a concept-based answers browsing as the user navigates through pages presenting subclasses of the initial concept instead of looking through a plain list of pictural representations.",
        "With the use of the reformulation, the quality of retrieved picture sets is improved (Popescu, 2007a) because the application employs specialized terms and their association to the content of the depiction is less noisy than that of more general concepts.",
        "The knowledge in WordNet is equally employed to narrow the search space before performing a content-based retrieval.",
        "Visually similar images are searched among images standing for the same leaf node in the hierarchy.",
        "This choice is motivated by the fact that, for humans, the conceptual similarity prevails over the visual one (Cox, 2000).",
        "Currently, the system is able to answer to around mono-term queries, which represent around a quarter of the total number of Internet image demands (Jansen, 2004).",
        "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: in Section 2 we discuss related work, in Section 3 we describe the image retrieval architecture we developed and, before concluding, we present an extensive evaluation of the system."

        "In (Liu, 2004), the authors evaluate different picture browsing strategies.",
        "A similarity based presentation of results is proposed and this approach is compared to a cluster based approach and a plain list display of answers.",
        "The structured presentation of results reduces the browsing time and is preferred by the users when compared to the plain list display.",
        "Knowing how the users formulate their queries is an important aspect in image search.",
        "Studies like the one we already cited (Jansen, 2004) focus on this multimedia retrieval and it is important for this finding to be considered when one designs retrieval frameworks.",
        "In (Jansen, 2004) it is shown that Web image queries are generally short.",
        "22% of them include a single word and 32% are formed of 2 words.",
        "Internet image search systems should focus on returning good quality answers to such queries.",
        "Another interesting conclusion of (Jansen, 2004) is that people generally want to have the responses with the least effort possible.",
        "This translated in the fact that they rarely look beyond the third answers page.",
        "Another explanation of this fact could be that generally, the first answers pages contain more representative results than the subsequent ones.",
        "In the following, we stress some of the important common points and differences between our work and the articles cited above.",
        "First, similarly to (Smith, 2000), (Wang, 2006), a conceptual hierarchy is used in the framework.",
        "One important distinction arises from the difference in size between the knowledge base employed by Olive and the other ones.",
        "In (Joshi, 2006), (Wang, 2006), (Yang, 2001), WordNet is used in different settings to improve image retrieval.",
        "None of the above approaches systematically use the type-subtype relation in the semantic structure to perform automatic query reformulation and propose structured answers to the user.",
        "Moreover, in (Joshi, 2006), (Wang, 2006), (Yang, 2001) the meaning separation in WordNet is disregarded and the possibility of performing query disambiguation is lost while in Olive this property is preserved.",
        "Knowing that the average polysemy of English nouns 1.23 and multiple meanings appear mostly for frequently used terms, polysemy represents an important noise source in image retrieval.",
        "Automatic query reformulation was shown to help image retrieval (Liao, 2005).",
        "Here we propose a different approach from that in (Liao, 2005) and use subtypes of a given query to search for corresponding images.",
        "Evidence that a structured presentation of pictures answers outperforms a plain list display is found in (Liao, 2005) , (Liu, 2004).",
        "The former paper proposes an organization of the results using reformulated queries that include modifiers of the initial one while in the latter work the images are grouped following visual similarity measures.",
        "In Olive, we propose a presentation of the results based on query reformulation that is different from that in (Liao, 2005).",
        "Instead of using modifiers, we employ leaf nodes in a conceptual hierarchy to display pictures.",
        "The size and the evolution of the employed database is another important factor in Web image retrieval.",
        "The use of a locally stored database is rendered necessary by the fact that those frameworks include relevance feedback ((Cox, 2000), (Smith, 2000), (Yang, 2001)) or learning techniques ((Wang, 2004, (Cai, 2004)) to enhance results.",
        "We show that it is possible to improve the results without the use of relevance feedback and learning techniques.",
        "This lightweight architecture equally allows the performing of an on the fly image collection and the system evolves at the same rate as the host, Google Image."

        "Functional diagram of Olive.",
        "The user interaction parts are represented in the ellipses, the resources Olive employs are drawn as rectangles and the active components of the application in rounded rectangles.",
        "A typical interaction in Olive goes as follows: a query is typed and it is reformulated by the system employing WordNet knowledge about the given concept.",
        "The output of this step constitutes the entry for the image spidering module, which employs an external application, Google Image to collect Web pictures.",
        "In the same time, a list of categories that are close to the query is generated using the knowledge base.",
        "Once these two processes are finished, an answers page is generated.",
        "For each image on the answers page, it is possible to search for visually related images using the PIRIA visual search engine (Joint, 2004).",
        "The knowledge base is the central part of the piece in the Olive architecture as it enables other processes like query reformulation of related query generation.",
        "We have parsed the WordNet files containing information about the nouns in the hierarchy and extracted information regarding: polysemy, hyponymy, synonymy and classes having the same parent.",
        "This pretreatment is necessary in order to speed up the execution time.",
        "There are 81426 synsets in the hierarchy and they include 117097 unique English terms standing for 145104 meanings.",
        "Around 65000 synsets are leaves in the hierarchy.",
        "We already mentioned that the average polysemy in WordNet is 1.23.",
        "In figure 2, we present a pseudo-log distribution of the number of senses for each one of the unique terms in the hierarchy.",
        "The number of monosemous terms exceeds 100000 and, with the increase of the number of senses, the amount of corresponding terms generally decreases.",
        "There are 10257 terms with 2 meanings, 2989 having 3 senses and 1178 with 4 meanings.",
        "The English word with the largest number of senses is point, which has 26 WordNet entries.",
        "Figure 2.",
        "Pseudo-log distribution of the number of senses for nouns in WordNet.",
        "For visualization purposes, log(0) was replaced with 0 and log(1) with 0.5.",
        "In the knowledge base, each synset has a separate entry whose structure depends on status of the synset in the hierarchy.",
        "Entries corresponding to leaves in the hierarchy contain information about: polysemy; the associated Web queries; categories having the same parent and hypernyms of the class.",
        "The entries for concepts having subtypes in WordNet include: polysemy information; a list of leaf concepts under the current class; a list of subtypes (with non-leaf concepts presented in priority); categories having the same parent and hypernyms of the class.",
        "The hierarchy includes a large number of categories and it is necessary to propose a way to order them so as to collect images from the Web and present results.",
        "WordNet contains some frequency information but it is not detailed enough for our purposes and it was extracted from text corpora.",
        "As we work with images, we considered appropriate to use information about this kind of media and we have developed a simple procedure to extract picture frequencies using an Internet search engine.",
        "First, it is necessary to disambiguate concepts so as to reduce the influence of polysemy on the obtained results.",
        "For each synset, the first member and the immediate parent are used in conjunction.",
        "Second, the above mentioned query is launched and the number of associated images is recuperated and stocked into a file which will be used when creating the entries in the knowledge base.",
        "In table 1, we present an excerpt from the entry corresponding to the sense of dog as animal where the related classes are ordered using Web frequency information.",
        "The information in table 1 is used query for image with the leave subtypes and to include classes that are related to dog in the answers page.",
        "PIRIA (Joint, 2004) is a tool that performs image indexing and retrieval based on low-level features.",
        "It is used as an external module in Olive.",
        "The engine includes a wide range of picture indexers and we have chosen to use one which computes texture and color information.",
        "We already mentioned that reformulation is an important feature of our approach as it allows an amelioration of the quality of the results as well a structured and interactive way of presentation.",
        "An automation of the reformulation process could implicate a risk if the knowledge in the ontology would not be accurate but, as WordNet was manually constructed by lexicographers, it generally contains good quality knowledge and can be safely used to represent a concept via its subtypes.",
        "This module recuperates information about leaf nodes in the hierarchy like the one presented in table 1 and employs it to search for Web images.",
        "When a query is launched a disambiguation procedure similar to that described in subsection 3.1 is used to compose the query (the immediate parent is added to the query).",
        "If not enough items are obtained this way, a query containing uniquely the concept name is formed.",
        "As shown by the recent introduction of a related queries generation module in the Ask, the proposition of more interactivity options in image search engines is an interesting way to explore.",
        "The main challenge that arises is that large scale semantic structures are to be included in the retrieval architectures.",
        "The utilization of such resources like WordNet constitutes a solution as they provide access to better structured information than that elicited by Ask.",

        "While cat and puppy are close to dog, it is unclear why elephant and snake are proposed.",
        "Furthermore, the presentation is semantically unsound as Alaskan husky is considered as a narrower class while golden retriever and Chihuahua are considered as expanded searches.",
        "The same observation is valid for the inclusion of rabbit and bird in the list of related names and of cat and monkey in that of enlarged searches.",
        "When querying polysemic concepts, additional meanings are proposed.",

        "This phase takes 2-3 seconds for leaf nodes, around 5 seconds for the other concepts and about 10 seconds when recuperating images for performing a CBIR search.",
        "These times are obtained for an architecture using only one computer and a 1Mbps Internet connection and they can be linearly reduced if the pass bandwidth of the connection is increased.",
        "The outputs of the query reformulation and image spidering modules are aggregated and the results are displayed as in figure 3.",

        "In Olive, some interaction means are inherited from current image search engines.",
        "We speak notably of the possibility to formulate another query and the navigation among the results pages.",

        "If the concept is polysemic a page containing images for different meanings of the term is proposed.",
        "The presentation of close concepts can be of help when the user wants to precise his search (Liao, 2005) and it is favorably assessed by the users.",
        "These conclusions are supported by the user test we present in the evaluation section.",
        "If the current concept has subtypes, the images are presented in a structured fashion, using four terminal subconcepts on each page.",
        "In figure 3, the first page of responses for dog contains images for its most frequent hyponyms: pooch, pug, Newfoundland and basset.",
        "The second page would include images for beagle, cairn, Airedale and Doberman.",
        "The results in figure 3 are to be compared with those obtained if we query Google Image with dog directly (figure 4).",
        "We observe that the pictures in the first figure are of better quality and are presented in a conceptually structured manner.",
        "A detailed page with answers for Doberman is presented in figure 5.",
        "Note that, as concept is a leaf in the hierarchy, there are no narrower classes proposed in the related box.",
        "Moreover, the concept is not ambiguous and there are no other senses to be presented.",
        "A notable difference between the pages in figures 3 and 5 is that in the latter case the user can perform a visual similarity search using any of the displayed images.",
        "The results of such a process are presented in figure 6.",
        "We remind the reader that the CBIR process is performed with a set of Web images standing for the same concept as the query (here Doberman) and employs color and texture to assess similarity.",
        "In (Popescu, 2007b), we showed that a conceptually controlled visual similarity search is by far more efficient than a retrieval process that accounts solely for low-level image parameters.",
        "This finding is also conform to the findings in (Yang, 2001), where the authors obtain better results when using both low-level and high-level semantics to find pictures."

        "We assessed Olive on two dimensions: first, a precision measure was employed so as to evaluate the quality of the obtained results and second, a test was designed to test the interaction of the user with the system.",
        "This double evaluation is necessary because it is shown in (Turpin, 2006) an increase of results precision in an information retrieval application does not necessarily engender a improved perception of the system from an user's point of view.",
        "The precision was evaluated in two settings: a surface test where the results on the first two response pages were tested and an in-depth test where the responses on the first 10 answers pages were assessed.",
        "In all tests, we used Google Image as baseline because Olive draws on this search engine.",
        "The conceptual hierarchy included in Olive covers a wide range of domains.",
        "We propose here an evaluation that accounts for a well established separation of categories in the world, where these last are separated into natural and artifacts (Keil, 1992).",
        "Further, living things and natural objects are subclasses of natural entities.",
        "In their turn, living things separate into plants and animals.",
        "We used the following four general categories to select concepts for testing: animals, plants, natural objects and artifacts.",
        "We have chosen to evaluate the performances of Olive and Google over a panel of 40 categories, 10 from each one of the general classes mentioned above.",
        "The choice of the concepts is done so as to cover as well as possible the general categories and to be easily recognizable by the evaluator, which was asked to count the number of images that where pertinent for the given query for each response page.",
        "Jansen et al.",
        "(2004) show that people who are using Web image search engines regard, in a majority of cases, the first two answers pages.",
        "An evaluation of the items on these pages will give a fair idea of the performances of the two image retrieval system as they are perceived by the users.",
        "The results of the test are presented in figure 7 and they indicate that, in mean 68.2% of the assessed images where judged pertinent for Google while 84.9% where considered as so for Olive.",
        "Over the 40 concepts, Google behaved better than Olive in two cases (lake and computer) but the differences between the two systems are minimal in these cases (less than 3%).",
        "Important differences in favor of Olive are obtained for apple (81.2% vs. 19.4%), table (90.6% vs. 44.4%) cloud (84.4% vs. 58.3%) or fox (81.2% vs. 58.3%).",
        "Over the four general categories, excellent results are obtained with our approach for animals and plant.",
        "For all these classes, a precision of more 80% is obtained, with peaks at 100% for butterfly and spider.",
        "For Google, there is a noteworthy difference between the quality of the answers on the first page, 80.3% and those on the second page, 56.1%.",
        "This distance could be explained by the fact that a relevance feedback procedure is used to rank Google results.",
        "In Olive, the corresponding percentages have values around 85%.",
        "This finding is to corroborate with the finding of the in-depth test we describe below.",
        "The results we obtained in this test are coherent to those we reported in (Popescu, 2007a), where a similar test was run over a smaller number of concepts.",
        "They are equally to be associated to the outcome of the evaluation in (Wang, 2006), where it is shown that the use of a domain ontology improves image retrieval.",
        "We have already mentioned that Olive proposes a concept-driven navigation instead of a plain list one (Google like).",

        "The difference between the two applications is bigger than the one reported in the surface precision test.",
        "This observation is supported by the fact that for Google, the results on the pages from two to ten are significantly worse than those on the first page while for Olive, the quality of the results is relatively constant over the ten pages.",
        "For pages three to ten, the precision is around 60% for Google and superior to 85% for Olive.",
        "When we look at individual concepts, the precision obtained with Olive is better for all eight concepts.",

        "The smallest distance, 7.2%, is obtained for frog.",
        "We stated that, for existing search engines, the users prefer to look at the first answers pages.",
        "An obvious explanation for this observation is that reaching the results requires less effort.",
        "The results in figure 8 support a second explanation: the users rarely look beyond the second answers page because they are aware that the corresponding results are of poor quality when compared to those displayed first.",
        "We designed a test where ten evaluators were asked to use Olive and rate some of the characteristics of the interaction process.",
        "The testers (computer science and linguistics students) had no experience with the system except for a training query.",
        "The interaction scenario consisted in a series of five entry queries (duck, angora, apple, car, rock) followed by a free exploration of the functions of the system.",
        "Each tester passed around 20 minutes to explore Olive and another 10 to answer the questions.",
