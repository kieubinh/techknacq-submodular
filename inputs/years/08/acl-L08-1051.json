        "There has long been a need for a rich corpus that reflects both within-document co-reference as well as cross-document co-reference.",
        "While within-doc co-reference will indicate whether there are multiple references to the same entity within a document, cross-document co-reference will indicate whether two different documents contain references to the same entity.",
        "It remains an open research question as to the extent to which algorithms developed for within-document coreference resolution can be successfully applied to the cross-document case.",
        "This corpus should be able to contribute to answering this question, since it incorporates high quality within-document coreference annotations, as well as the links resolving entities across documents.",
        "Being able to accurately resolve entity mentions across diverse documents will prove useful in a variety of application areas.",
        "For example, the results of search engine queries containing names of individuals could be organized by the unique entities to which they refer, accelerating the user's ability to navigate to the desired documents",
        "This corpus was created as part of the activities of the workshop entitled \"Exploiting Lexical and Encyclopedic Resources for Entity Disambiguation.\"",
        "Hosted by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Language and Speech Processing during the Summer of 2007, and it will be made available to the public.",
        "The corpus was based on the complete English ACE2005 Entity Detection and Recognition (EDR) data set, available from the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) data sets (catalog numbers LDC2005E18 and LDC2005T06) and described in (Doddington, et al., 2004).",
        "The LDC created the annotations that capture the within-document co-reference chains for seven types of entities (persons, organizations, locations, geopolitical entities, weapons and vehicles) and their three types of mentions."

      "heading": "2.. Annotation Methods",
      "text": [
        "In order to create the cross-document co-reference corpus, we made use of the previously developed Callisto/EDNA annotation tool.",
        "This is a specialized annotation task plug-in for the Callisto corpus annotation tool (http://callisto.mitre.org/).",
        "This Callisto client plug-in makes use of a web server (in our case, we used Tomcat) and Lucene web services plugins created for this task.",
        "The ACE2005 source texts and standoff annotations (in the ACE APF XML format) are hosted on a server and indexed using a customized Lucene document parser.",
        "The result of this process is that search engine clients can search the ACE2005 repository using structure-dependent queries, such as searching for strings within entity name mentions, and within entities of a particular type and sub-type.",
        "The Callisto/EDNA annotation tool provides an integrated interface where EDR-annotated documents can be examined and individual entities can be linked to other entities in the corpus.",
        "Figure 1 shows the Callisto/EDNA graphical user interface.",
        "The tagged text is presented in the upper left hand corner to provide the annotator with context for the mention(s) to be linked.",
        "In the pane at the bottom of the interface are presented tables of all of the within-document ACE annotations already present in the document.",
        "Usually the entity table will be displayed here, enabling the annotator to sort and step through the entity-level annotations to be linked across the corpus.",
        "The ACE entity annotations are color-coded: black indicates that the phrase is not a candidate for co-reference, green indicates that the term has already been co-referenced, and red indicates that the term has yet to be co-referenced.",
        "Clicking on an ACE annotation entry fills in the Entity Search Criteria with whatever is known about that ACE entity, e.g., the type and subtype.",
        "Clicking on the SEARCH button results in a list of search results that are potential target entities for co-reference across the complete document collection, which are then displayed in the upper right hand side search results pane.",
        "Clicking on a target entity brings up a set of detailed attributes for the annotator to consider about the selected target entity, and a LINK button that enables the annotator to co-reference the ACE annotation with the target entity, if desired.",
        "Figure 2 shows a close-up of the search query pane, which can be further manipulated by the user to broaden the search to alternate spellings, alternate entity types, etc.",
        "Figure 3 illustrates how the target entity details are displayed.",
        "There has been some exploratory cross-document annotation of ACE documents in the past.",
        "The results of these experiments were that some types of entities posed particularly difficult for annotators to resolve, especially those for which no name was used as a mention anywhere in the document.",
        "To make this annotation process tractable, we configured the Callisto/EDNA tool to focus the annotation process on entities that met the following criteria:",
        "(1) The entity had at least one mention of type NAME with a document;",
        "(2) The entity was of type PER, ORG, GPE or LOC.",
        "To expedite the annotation process, we decided to apply an initial automated pre-annotation (cross-document linking) process prior to manual annotation.",
        "We had observed in early efforts that much of the time invested by the human annotator was in physically linking frequently occurring entities to each of the numerous entities in other documents where such entities were mentioned.",
        "For example, the President of the United States occurred in a significant percentage of the ACE documents, and the annotation of this phrase would necessitate a laborious process of stepping through the physical clicking (actually a whole cascade of user mouse actions) of many highly probable co-referring entities.",
        "The automatic preprocessing procedure was written in Java to load the complete ACE2005 corpus EDR annotations into memory, after which it proceeded to link each pairwise entity just in case those two entities were of exactly the same TYPE and SUBTYPE and the entities shared at least one mention of type NAME whose strings were identical (using a case-sensitive string comparison test).",
        "We were concerned that this procedure would produce inappropriate links, but in actuality it produced very few.",

        "The Callisto/EDNA annotation tool provided the ability for the annotator to quickly review and, if warranted, remove any links made earlier, whether by this automatic process or by a human annotator.",
        "As a bonus, annotation became faster after this preprocessing step, as links could be made at the group level, where a group would be all those entities sharing a common name, type and subtype.",
        "For example, a single linking action between an entity cluster with the named entity Bush and another entity cluster with the named entity the \"W\" would enable all of the associated entities in various documents to be linked."

        "To our knowledge the first effort for creating corpora to train and evaluate cross-document co-reference resolution algorithms was that initiated by Breck Baldwin and Amit Bagga (Bagga, et al., 1998), in which they created the so-called John Smith corpus.",
        "Bagga and Baldwin used the relatively common name John Smith to find documents that were about different individuals in the news.",
        "The two main benefits of the present work are (1) by performing the cross-document co-reference annotation on top of the already fully-annotated ACE2005 corpus, we have high-quality co-reference information at both the within-doc and cross-document levels; (2) the size of this corpus is significantly larger than the previously available data sets.",
        "There have been other data sets created that address the general problem of identifying entities across documents, but these have involved annotation schemes that do not capture all of the named, nominal and pronominal mentions of the entities.",
        "For example, in the recent SemEval \"Web People\" evaluation (Artiles, et al., 2005), disambiguation is annotated at the level of documents that are (mostly) \"about\" a particular person, although some systems exploited mention-level features and local contexts (e.g., Heyl & Neumann, 2007).",
        "The annotation schemes adopted to support author identification in citations (Lawrence, et al., 1999) is at a similar mention level, but the texts themselves, collections of bibliographic citations, are quite specialized.",

        "Examples include the co-referencing of \"Scott Peterson\" and \"Laci Peterson,\" probably because they were each referred to as \"Peterson\" on some occasion.",
        "One desirable side effect of this annotation is that it clusters proper names with their corresponding nicknames.",
        "For example, \"Bama\" for \"Alabama\", and \"Qland\" or simply \"Q\" for \"Queensland\".",
        "These nicknames will not be found in a gazetteer, but the cross-document corpus will give a system the means to find the full name, which will give it the ability to map a location using a gazetteer."

        "Additionally, features compare the canonical mentions in each chain, testing for substring matches.",
        "We were able to achieve F1 performance as high as: 0.96 (BCubed), 0.91 (Pairwise) and 0.89 (MUC).",
        "This performance is relatively high, indicating a low ambiguity level.",
        "However, this performance is the result of clustering the gold-standard within-document co-reference chains; given predicted chains this problem becomes much more challenging.",
        "Additionally, ambiguity can be retroactively injected into the dataset as desired.",
        "Methods analogous to pseudo-words in the word sense disambiguation task have been applied to co-reference to introduce ambiguity while still retaining many statistical properties of the original dataset (Mann and Yarowsky 2007)."
