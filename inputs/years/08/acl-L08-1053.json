        "A recent survey by (Nadeau et al., 2007), covering the last 15 years of research in named entity recognition (NER), shows that the field has been growing significantly, in terms of the number of languages processed, textual genres and domains covered.",
        "As the authors describe, the availability of large amounts of data motivated researchers to gradually abandon the early hand-crafted rule systems, and adopt (supervised and semi-supervised) machine learning techniques.",
        "The performance of these systems is usually measured by testing the system on unseen texts, which will be compared to a gold standard or key, to assess precision, recall and F-measure in the identification and classification of the named entities (NE).",
        "In general, the training and test conditions are similar, i.e., the system is trained with texts that are comparable in terms of genre, topic and language to the test texts; otherwise the performance will most certainly decrease.",
        "What if we keep the same genre, topic and language, but change the time frame of test texts?",
        "Do texts vary over time in a way that will affect the performance of a name tagger?",
        "Such issues are important in selecting the training data for a tagger.",
        "In this paper we show that as the time gap between training and test texts increases (i) the similarity between the two texts decreases, (ii) the name lists of those texts overlap less; and (iii) the performance of an NE tagger also decays.",
        "Furthermore, we will show that the results of the corpus analysis and the system performance correlate over time.",
        "The paper is structured as follows: we begin by a brief discussion on how time has been dealt with in natural language processing; then we characterize the task we are assessing and the corpus used in our experiments; in sections 4. and 5., we present, respectively, the methodology to analyze the corpus, and the name tagger architecture; finally, we show the results of our experiments overtime and conclude, pointing to future directions."

      "text": [
        "Time in natural language processing can be viewed through two different perspectives: as a relevant object that can be processed or as a system variable that conditions its performance.",
        "The former has been by far more explored, and consists in recognizing and relating temporal information in texts (e.g., identification of temporal expressions, identification of when an event took place, ordering events chronologically and novelty detection).",
        "We are more interested in the second perspective that sees time as a system variable, i.e., there are changes in texts over time (either due to language changes or to topic and subtopic shifts) that affect the performance of natural language systems and, hence, systems should be conceived time-aware.",
        "The majority of works we found address this question in an indirect way by recognizing that linguistic resources are never complete.",
        "For instance, (Stevenson and Gaizauskas, 2000) explore NE annotated corpora to automatically update gazetteers and (Fairon and Courtois, 2000) use online newspapers to enlarge dictionaries of common words.",
        "This option follows the suggestion \"more data is better data\" (Church and Mercer, 1993), focusing on the idea of collecting more data, which indeed enlarge the previous resources, but without a concern for selecting relevant data that would increase even more the resources or would produce tailored resources for analysing a specific corpus.",
        "Some authors, however, show that simply adding more data in the training stage is not enough: (Ji and Grishman, 2006) show that enlarging the size of training data doesn't always yield the best results, and they stress the need of carefully selecting appropriate data to bootstrap a name tagger; (Atterer and Schütze, 2006), in a study about disambiguating prepositional phrase and relative clause attachment, also argue that the size of the unannotated corpus had little effect on the performance not only due to the noisiness of the statistics extracted from the unannotated corpus, but also because the corpora were from distinct sources and time periods.",
        "The idea of having similar temporal data for training and testing NLP systems is also shared by other authors.",
        "(Gale and Church, 1994) when comparing different probability estimators for English bigrams, split a one year corpus into training and test by assigning each bigram starting at an even-numbered word to the former, and those starting at odd-numbered words to the latter.",
        "In this way, they were aiming at obtaining closer training and test samples, avoiding temporal bias (they had observed measurable differences over the period of one month).",
        "(Church, 1995) studied the correlation between word variants (singular/plural, adjective/adverb, lower case/upper case) by comparing the correlation estimates obtained in one year of the Associated Press corpus with the estimates obtained on different years of the same news agency.",
        "He observed that the estimates were highly reliable over a period of five years (from 1988 to 1992), but since the estimates degraded over time, he suggested that in order to predict the correlation between two word forms in one year one should use the estimates of the previous year instead of the estimates obtained ten years before.",
        "As in this latter work, we trained our name tagger in one time frame and then tested the tagger with texts within other time frames.",
        "Moreover, we also compared the texts over time in different ways, relating the results of the corpus analysis with the results of the tagger performance."

        "The Politics section of the corpus corresponds to about one quarter of the corpus.",
        "From this section, we created a golden collection (key) of 16 texts by manually annotating with NE the first 400 extracts in each semester; from those we used the first 192 extracts to collect the tagger seeds and the remaining 208 as test sets; the following 7856 extracts of each semester are also used by the NE tagger as unla-beled data.",

        "The first evaluation for named entity recognition in Portuguese, HAREM, took place in 2004 (Cardoso and Santos, 2007).",
        "We adopted the HAREM NE annotation scheme, but simplified the classification task to approximate the MUC named entity task (Grishman and Sundheim, 1995): (i) we are only interested in proper names of people, organizations and locations; (ii) assignment of type and morphological attributes is not considered; (iii) the classification gives preference to the classification of the base form rather than to the name function, as in the \"form over function\" approach (Johannessen et al., 2004).",
        "This last decision means that, for instance, Portugal is classified as location in both of these contexts:",
        "Portugal is located in Europe Portugal voted against the proposal",
        "In HAREM, these references should be classified as location and organization, respectively.",
        "For a thorough comparison between MUC and HAREM tasks cf. (Seco, 2007).",
        "We conducted the experiments on samples of the Politics articles of the Portuguese corpus CETEMPublico (Rocha and Santos, 2000).",
        "The corpus has 180 million words and spans 8 years, from 1991 to 1998, divided into semesters.",
        "The original newspaper articles were fragmented by the corpus builders into extracts (typically 2 paragraphs each, which in Politics resulted in about 5 sentences per extract),",
        "The tagger seeds correspond to the set of different names obtained after collecting the first 2500 name instances of each year in the golden collection.",
        "Figure 1 shows the distribution of seeds by category in each time frame.",
        "Even though, there are more seeds classified as people (about 40% of the different seeds are people names, and the remaining names are equally distributed by organizations and locations), people names are less frequent: in average, each name occurs about 1.6 times, whereas organization and location names occur about 2.29 and 2.34, respectively.",
        "Hence, in terms of name instances the category distribu-tionis 32.2%, 34.81%and 32.99% for people, organization and location, respectively.",
        "From the 7856 unannotated extracts of each semester, the tagger uses the first 82456 unlabeled names and corresponding surrounding context as pairs of unlabeled examples to bootstrap.",

        "On the other hand, we compared the name lists of the golden collection that we manually annotated and the name lists extracted by the name tagger.",
        "We begin by describing the corpus similarity approach and then the name list overlap metrics.",
        "In order to measure corpus similarity over time, we adopted the method proposed by (Kilgarriff, 2001) to compare language varieties.",
        "Given two corpora A and B with the same number of words, the author measures the similarity between A and B, similarity (A, B), by applying the following algorithm:",
        "• Split corpus A and B into k slices each",
        "• Repeat m times:",
        "- Randomly allocate § slices from A to Ai and | slices from B to Bj - Construct word frequency lists for Aj and Bj",

        "• Output mean and standard deviation of the distances obtained in all experiments i = 1.. .m",
        "After measuring similarity (A, B), one must also compute similarity(A, A) and similarity(B, B), which give the within-corpus similarity, i.e. corpus homogeneity, of corpora A and B, respectively.",
        "The author argues that the similarity between two corpora can only be properly interpreted if one compares it to the corpus homogeneity of each corpus: for instance, if the similarity between the two corpora is small but their homogeneity is high, then one may conclude the two corpora belong to different language varieties.",
        "(Baayen, 2001) also advocates a similar position stating that to understand the importance of an intertextual difference one should account for the intratextual variability of the text characteristic being analyzed.",
        "In his study, Kilgarriff compared different distance metrics by applying the algorithm to Known-Similarity Corpora (KSC).",
        "As x by degrees of freedom (CBDF) performed the best on the KSC, we used this distance in our experiments.",
        "The remaining parameters of the algorithm, n and k, were established empirically and equal 2000 and 10, respectively.",
        "Instead of randomly allocating the slices from both A and B, we iterate over all combinations of 5 slices drawn from a partition of 10, select those slices of A for Aj, and select the complementary-numbered slices of B for Bj.",
        "Furthermore, if a set of 5 indices for A and 5 for B has already been used to compute a distance, we exclude the case where these two sets are interchanged.",
        "This corresponds to running -|- experiments, i.e., 126 experiments.",
        "In this way, we guarantee that in the homogeneity experiments: (i) we don't compare the same halves more than once; (ii) we don't compare overlapped halves, i.e., we don't assign a slice with the same index to both halves.",
        "The consequence of doing this is that similarity(A,B) = similarity(B, A).",
        "Since the values are always very close, we didn't average the two to obtain a single value for the similarity between A and",
        "B.",
        "This decision is reasonable because, as we will see, all corpora are highly homogeneous, and also because, in any case, we made all possible comparisons within the time interval.",
        "Even though the previous approach can be extended to compare name lists, we wanted to have an idea of how much overlap existed between name lists over time, i.e., how many names were shared between texts within different time frames.",
        "As a measure of overlap between names occurring in one reference text and each of the remaining texts, we used Jacquard's coefficient.",
        "This metric calculates the number of name types that occur in both texts relative to the total number of different names in the joint texts.",
        "As an alternative, which gives more weight to frequent names, we also measured the name token overlap.",
