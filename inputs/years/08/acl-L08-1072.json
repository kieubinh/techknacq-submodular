        "Several methods of automatically combining the multiple annotations to produce a single annotation are compared, but none produces better results than simply picking one of the annotated versions at random.",

      "text": [
        "When annotating a corpus for an information extraction (ie) task, it is normal to annotate at least part of it multiple times in order to measure inter-annotator agreement (iaa) and thereby monitor the quality of the annotation and quantify the difficulty of the task.",
        "These multiply annotated documents can then be reconciled to produce a gold standard which is used to train and test a machine-learning based ie system.",
        "In our experience in the biomedical domain, however, this reconciliation process is very time-consuming, and therefore costly, with the reconciliation of a pair of annotated documents taking much longer than annotating the document for a third time.",
        "But if reconciliation is too expensive, and the corpus is to be used as training data, can one make better use of the multiply annotated data?",
        "This paper will set out to answer two questions with empirical evidence presented from biomedical ie tasks.",
        "The first question is how best to use the multiply annotated data in training machine learning systems; whether to try to automatically reconcile the documents using some type of combination algorithm, or whether to provide all copies to the machine learning algorithm and leave it to \"reconcile\" the documents.",
        "The second question concerns how best to spend annotation budget, on multiple annotation of documents already in the corpus, or on annotating new documents.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, these questions have not previously been addressed in the literature.",
        "This paper is organised as follows: after reviewing related work in the following section, the corpora and experimental system are described in Section 3.",
        "An account of the experiments performed is provided in Section 4, with the results presented in Section 5 and discussed in Section 6."

        "The experiments described in this papers make use of a text mining pipeline which was developed as part of the txm project and integrated into a biomedical curation tool to enable assisted curation for biomedical literature (Alex et al., 2008).",
        "In order to train the machine learning components of the system, and to test the system, a collection of full-text biomedical articles were annotated with items of biomedical interest.",
        "The decision to annotate full-text articles instead of abstracts as training data for a biomedical text mining system is supported by previous work of Shah et al.",
        "(2003) and Mcintosh and Curran (2007) who argue that paper abstracts do not always contain sufficient information.",
        "In the pilot data annotation phase of txm, multiply annotated papers were reconciled to create one gold standard annotation for each paper.",
        "However, this process was found to be very time-consuming, particularly as dealing with full-text articles.",
        "In order to obtain good machine learning results, a further decision was made to invest valuable annotation time to annotate more papers rather than reconcile multiple annotations.",
        "Consequently, the two corpora that were finally annotated as training material for the txm pipeline were not reconciled and therefore contain multiple annotations for a proportion of papers (see Section 3).",
        "These multiple annotations were used to calculate iaa in order to monitor annotation consistency over time.",
        "The collection of iaa during annotation has also been advocated by Lu et al.",
        "(2006) and Inderjeet et al.",
        "(2005).",
        "Furthermore, annotation consistency is an aspect that was highlighted as important in experiments carried out by Alex et al.",
        "(2006).",
        "Measures of iaa are also used to get a better understanding of how difficult it is to extract such information automatically."

        "The PPI corpus contains approximately 75,000 sentences and the TE corpus around 63,000.",
        "A total of nine qualified biologists were employed to annotate each corpus with named entities and relations (as shown in Tables 1 and 2), to map selected entity types to identifiers in appropriate standard databases, and to enrich the relations with certain properties and attributes (Haddow and Matthews, 2007).",
        "Only the entities and relations will be considered in this paper.",

        "During the annotation of each corpus, a selection of papers were doubly or triply annotated, as shown in Table 3, and these multiply annotated papers were used to compute iaa.",
        "For each pair of corresponding annotations, the iaa is calculated by taking one of the annotators as the gold standard and scoring the other annotator against them by calculating precision, recall and F1 in the usual way.",
        "The F1 is not affected by the ordering of the annotators in this calculation (Brants, 2000).",
        "Entities are compared using exact match as in Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder (2003), and relations are considered equal if they have the same type and arguments.",

        "A combined iaa is also included, where pairs of annotated documents were scored on all relations, not just those where the annotators agree on the entities.",
        "This combined score indicates the level of agreement on the whole task of relation markup.",
        "To produce an average iaa for a particular relation or entity type, the F1 scores on each pair of corresponding annotated papers were micro-averaged, i.e. each relation or entity instance was given equal weight in computing the overall scores shown in Table 4.",
        "Table 4: inter-annotator agreement for entities, relations, and the combined entity/relation annotation task.",
        "Both named entity recognition (ner) and relation extraction (re) were implemented using maximum entropy based machine learning approaches as part of an information extraction pipeline (Alex et al., 2008).",
        "The pipeline contains a preprocessing component which performs tokenisation and sentence splitting, linguistic analysis (such as part-of-speech tagging and chunking) and adds some biological markup (indicating species words and abbreviation definitions).",
