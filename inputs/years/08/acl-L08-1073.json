        "With the sharp increase in the amount of published information available in biology and related fields, biomedical text mining has become an important research tool.",
        "Although shallow text processing techniques based on pattern matching have been employed with some success to biomedical text, there is now a growing interest in applying more advanced natural language processing techniques, such as full syntactic parsing, to identify more complex relationships between concepts in the biomedical literature.",
        "Some of these relationships are hierarchical in nature, and some involve phrases that are widely separated in the text, making them difficult to recognize using only surface patterns.",
        "Among the general full-sentence syntactic parsing approaches that have been applied to biomedical text recently, many can be broadly categorized as either constituent parsers that identify the phrase structure of input sentences, or dependency parsers that identify direct relationships between words in input sentences.",
        "Because different parsers use different styles of syntactic representation, it is difficult to compare the accuracy of different syntactic analysis approaches.",
        "In the parsing community, the use of a fixed set of dependency-based grammatical relations (Carroll et al., 1998) has been proposed as a way of comparing parsers that use different formalisms.",
        "While this evaluation scheme is not as widely used as PARSEVAL, it has recently gained some traction as a more framework-independent alternative, and has been used in the evaluation of parsers that work with various types of syntactic representations, from the one in the widely used Penn Treebank, to others based on lexicalized grammar formalisms, such as CCG and HPSG (Preiss, 2003; Kaplan et al. 2004; Clark and Curran, 2007; Miyao et al., 2007).",
        "One obstacle in applying the same type of formalism-independent dependency-based evaluation scheme to parsers for biomedical text is the lack of a manually annotated corpus to serve as a gold-standard.",
        "Previous work on evaluation of parsers in the biomedical domain (Pyysalo et al., 2007; Clegg and Shepherd, 2007) used corpora automatically converted to the Stanford dependency scheme (de Marneffe et al., 2006) from gold-standard phrase structure trees in the Penn Treebank (PTB) (Marcus et al., 1993) format.",
        "Although the Stanford dependency (SD) format was originally intended to be used by NLP applications, and not in parser evaluation, a program that converts structures in PTB format into SD structures is freely available, and is distributed with the Stanford parser , making SD convenient for comparison among PTB parsers.",
        "However, this automatic conversion produces a significant number of errors, and the resulting SD data cannot be considered a gold-standard corpus.",
        "Because these errors are undocumented, the suitability of the resulting corpus for parser evaluation is questionable (although the conversion may still be well suited for use in applications).",
        "Furthermore, the lack of a complete detailed description of the different dependency types in the SD scheme makes it unlikely that accurate and reliable conversion from other representation formats (such as CCG- or HPSG-based formats) can be achieved.",
        "To address these concerns, we propose the use of Carroll et al.",
        "'s GR evaluation scheme for parsers in the biomedical domain.",
        "The GR scheme was designed specifically for parser evaluation, and it has been used for that purpose by different NLP research groups.",
        "In addition, manually annotated gold-standard corpora exist in other domains (Briscoe and Carroll, 2006).",
        "We have started the creation of a gold-standard corpus for parser evaluation in the biomedical domain, by annotating sentences from the GENIA corpus (Kim et al., 2003) using Carroll et al.",
        "'s GR scheme.",
        "In this paper, we describe the main issues in the creation of the evaluation corpus, including our application of the GR scheme to a domain that is significantly different than other domains that this scheme has been applied to previously."

        "The Grammatical Relation scheme (GR) was proposed aiming at a framework-independent metric for parsing accuracy (Carroll et al., 1998).",
        "A set of 700 sentences extracted from Section 23 of the Penn Treebank, the same set as the PARC 700 Dependency Bank (King et al.,2004), was manually annotated and made publicly available in addition to an older set of 500 sentences from the SUSANNE corpus.",
        "Carroll and Briscoe (2006) used 140 of the 700 sentences as the development set, and the remaining 560 were used as the gold standard data for evaluation.",
        "The same 560-sentence set is also used as the gold standard by Clark and Curran (2007) and Miyao et al.",

        "PTB-GR.",
        "Figure 1 shows an example of GR annotation.",
        "GR represents labeled syntactic dependencies between words.",
        "For example, ncsubj means a non-clausal subject, dobj , and ncmod expresses a non-clausal modifier.",
        "Most relations are binary, while a few relation types have additional slots that represent subtypes of the relations.",
        "For example, (xcomp to seeks discourage) means that discourage is a to-infinitival complement of seeks.",
        "Refer to (Briscoe, 2006) for the definition of these relation types.",
        "GR annotations are almost purely syntactic, and therefore lack the means to evaluate the true potential of deep linguistic parsers that compute relationships based on semantics.",
        "However, it should be noted that GR represents non-local dependencies such as control/raising and movement.",
        "In this example, (ncsubj discourage CNN _) indicates a control relation, (dobj discourage opportunities) expresses a moved object of discourage, and (cmod _ opportunities seeks) indicates a relation between a relative clause and its antecedent.",
        "Since these relations are not explicitly represented by PTB parsers, this scheme may serve as a starting point in the identification of the added benefits of deep parsing and the discussion of problems in framework-independent evaluation.",
        "On the other hand, identifying most of the relationships in the GR scheme in the output of shallow phrase structure parsers requires matching of tree patterns, which makes it challenging to evaluate those parsers."

        "In addition to the difficulty of determining the structure without deep domain knowledge, there is a problem that arises from the descriptive power of the GR scheme.",
        "The GR scheme does not have a mechanism that fully represents the distributive reading of coordination.",
        "For example, CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes can be read in two ways: 1) the T lymphocytes that are CD4-positive and CD8-positive at the same time 2) the T lymphocytes that are CD4-positive and the T lymphocytes that are CD8-positive.",
        "The first interpretation can be straightforwardly encoded into Figure 8-a.",
        "However, the second interpretation is hard to encode in the GR scheme.",
        "In PTB-GR, phrases like the London and Tokyo markets (meaning the London market and the Tokyo market) are encoded into a structure like Figure8-a.",
        "The GR scheme does have a mechanism to encode ellipsis, by placing ellip in the place of ellipsis, so that the second interpretation can encode a structure as in Figure 8-b.",
        "However, the problem is that there is no way to anchor the ellipsis to indicate what is omitted.",
        "Alternatively, the second interpretation can be encoded into Figure 8-c, but here the entities that are coordinated is quite different from the ones that are predicted from the widely used phrase structures.",
        "In the actual annotation, the structures like Figure 8-b and 8-c coexist in the corpus, although annotation is done by only one annotator."

        "Although in the abstracts sentences are longer, and, as a consequence, tend to have more complex structure, the declaration of terms has alleviated the difficulty by removing the dependencies inside those terms, which are often NPs whose internal structures are not relevant.",
        "This is usually consistent to the policy of other corpora like BioInfer (Pyysalo et al., 2007) where pre-modifier attachment in noun phrases without internal coordination is not resolved.",
        "The concept of 'terms' in the GENIA annotation is broader than named entities and the terms sometimes include post-noun modifiers and, even in some cases, coordination.",
        "This is the major source of the inconsistency of boundaries as described in section 4.3.",
        "The particular example in the section needs the re-annotation on the side of the term corpus, but there is no simple solution such as excluding adjectives from the terms, as there are in examples like simian immunodeficiency virus that has very similar structure but regarded as a name (of a virus).",
        "Similarly, as there are terms like signal transducers and activator of transcription, which are generally recognized as a name of a protein, even post-noun modifiers or coordination cannot be blindly separated from terms.",
        "As a separate process from the annotation of the structure outside the terms, we have compiled a list of GENIA terms appearing in the 50 abstracts, and have annotated the dependency structure inside them where possible.",
        "The result of this annotation is not included in the current annotation, but once a policy of breaking up terms into smaller components is established, they can be included in the corpus.",
        "The list of annotated terms is also expected to work as a 'gazetteer' when we expand the annotation to a larger set in order to avoid the problem of inconsistency, as structure annotation is especially more difficult in the domain-specific terms for prospective annotators who are basically linguists.",
        "As for the other inconsistency with the existing GENIA, namely, the tokenization problem, it would be the POS corpus that should be corrected.",
        "The tokenization policy of the GENIA POS corpus follows that of the PTB corpus for compatibility and for ease of combining PTB and GENIA in training POS taggers.",
        "However, it has been pointed out that the PTB tokenization policy is not suitable, and finer-grained tokenization is necessary for biomedical texts (Yamamoto et al., 2004, Kulick et al., 2004, Tomanek et al., 2007).",
        "For the precise dependency annotation, changing tokenization policy is necessary.",
        "Using xml scheme dual annotation of PTB-based and finer-grained tokenization could be possible in the GENIA POS corpus, which should be done.",
        "The source of other difficulties is that the dependency annotated with the scheme is not a shallow syntactic structure, and is also not a fully semantic structure.",
        "As a result, information that can be annotated cannot be rich enough to express some kind of structure that can be expressed in other formalisms.",
        "For example, the PTB scheme has the mechanism to co-index the NULL element into a word or a phrase that is supposed to be in the place of NULL.",
        "A similar mechanism may be incorporated into the GR scheme to fully annotate the ellipsis, and that would be convenient for annotating the coordination such as the one mentioned in section 4.4.2.",
        "In the two cases of X Y-ing Z structure mentioned in the section 4.2.3, the current annotation scheme loses the information that X is an argument of Y.",
        "In addition, the current scheme loses the distinction between NF kappa B binding domain, where both NF kappa B, and domain are arguments of binding, and NF kappa B binding activity where activity is not an argument, but an appositive (i.e., NF kappa B binding = activity).",
        "These can be distinguished if xmod instead of ncmod is used as in the following examples illustrated in Figure 9.",
        "NF kappa B binding domain (dobj binding *NF kappa B*) (xmod _ domain binding) (ncsubj binding domain _) NF kappa B binding activity (dobj binding *NF kappa B*) (xmod ta activity binding)",
        "Figure 8.",
        "NF kappa B binding domain vs NF kappa B binding activity",
        "On the other hand, due to the specialized nature of the text, it will be difficult to correctly annotate the precise structure without deep domain knowledge, and also, an annotation that is semantically too precise may not be suitable for comparison between parsers with various levels of depth in analysis.",
        "A tradeoff between the richness of the information and convenience for evaluation must be established, with informative documentation thereof.",
        "A possible solution may be using the underspecification of relation types in evaluation, but whether underspecification involving complex structures (e.g, unifying the three annotations in Figure 8) can be achieved in a straightforward way is yet to be discussed.",
        "Another kind of problem involving the descriptive power of the annotation scheme is that there are parts of scientific text that has different syntax from ordinary English, like references and mathematical expressions.",
        "In the abstracts, the cases are few, but if the corpus should be enhanced to annotate full text of scientific papers, more references or expressions may have to be annotated.",
        "As for the reference, one solution is to declare them like we did for named entities and not analyze the inside, at least at the parsing stage.",
        "However, it would not be appropriate to do so for mathematical expressions, because sometimes an expression behaves like a (embedded) sentence.",
        "For example, in a mathematics textbook, it is usual for one to encounter sentences like We can find integers a and b such that ma-mb=1 and Tn<Tn+1 If n>0.",
        "The use and syntax of embedded mathematics ( and also chemical) expression would be worth investigating seriously with more examples."
