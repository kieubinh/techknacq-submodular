        "Affective computing aims at providing more effective and natural human computer interfaces.",
        "The goal of most of the efforts in affective computing is recognizing emotions, such as anger or boredom.",
        "However, stress is paid hardly any attention, even though everybody experiences stress at work or in everyday situations.",
        "These situations may even be dangerous, for example while driving the car during rush hour.",
        "An understanding car management system could be of great importance in these situations, by calming down the driver by playing different music or warning him about his current emotional status.",
        "This example illustrates the usefulness of an automatic stress recognizer.",
        "However, currently it is difficult to implement such applications since data is difficult to obtain and the available datasets are mostly recordings made by the military.",
        "Furthermore, the vocabulary of the datasets is limited (Vlasenko et al., 2007; Hansen and Bou-Ghazale, 1997).",
        "The goal of this work is to obtain a large dataset comprising a large vocabulary at different stress levels.",
        "Therefore, an approach to record audio signals containing actual stress induced by an air controller simulation, described in detail in Sect.",
        "2., is introduced in this paper.",
        "Subjects are asked to play this air controller simulation and answer different questions taken randomly from a pool of questions comprising among others personal, political, mathematical, or geographical topics.",
        "Additionally, a Jeopardy category of questions was included in order to provoke the forming of complete questions, while under stress.",
        "Methods to evaluate the recorded data and an automatic stress recognition architecture are proposed in Sects.",
        "3. and 4.. For the evaluation of the recorded data a second experiment had to be conducted with different subjects, who had to listen to the recordings and label them with a numerical value between 0 (no stress) and 100 (very stressed).",
        "The results of this evaluation experiment will be presented in 3.1.. An additional goal is the implementation of a stress recognizer that performs close to real-time.",
        "The recognition and evaluation parts of this proposed work are based on recently published work (Maganti et al., 2007b; Scherer et al., 2007; Scherer et al., 2008).",
        "For the recognition features extracted from the audio signal resembling the rate of change of frequency in time windows of 100 ms, called modulation spectrum features, will be used as input to a novel type of recurrent neural networks, namely echo state networks (ESNs), that can be trained very efficiently using the direct pseudo inverse calculation to adapt their output weights.",

        "The task of the game is to send as many planes as possible to their desired target.",

        "Furthermore, the performance of the players is recorded for each trial.",
        "These two values could also indicate the sensitivity of the subject towards increasing stress or difficulty in a computer game.",
        "To summarize, the subjects' assignment is to use the mouse to select and change the flight paths of multiple planes flying at different speeds, according to the difficulty level, and to say the correct answers for the questions shown on top.",
        "The subjects will be given the same instructions at their first visit and are encouraged to come back in order to improve their performance.",
