        "In the last few years various researchers have focused their attention on speaker recognition systems in multilingual environments, where speaker models may be trained with recordings in one language but testing is performed in another one.",
        "Works like those made by Faundez and Satue-Villar (2006) and Durou (1999) show that there is an accuracy decrease in these language-mismatched conditions, but they give no further insight on how to alleviate the problem.",
        "Other works like the ones by Akbacak and Hansen (2007) and by Ma and Meng (2004) give some sort of solution to the problem, but they involve knowing in advance the possible languages that will be used, and training a speaker model for each of them, which is not always possible.",
        "In this work we try to find a feature-level solution, i.e. finding a robust parameterization that helps maintaining the recognition accuracy in language-mismatched conditions.",
        "Being a feature-level solution, it should be completely generalizable to any language not seen during the training.",
        "It addresses this problem in a bilingual region, the Basque Country, in which two official languages co-exist: Basque and Spanish.",
        "Both languages have very little in common, as Basque is not an Indo-European language like Spanish, which is a Romance.",
        "In fact, Basque is considered a language isolate, i.e. without any relationship with any other living or extinct language.",
        "This real-life situation can be seen as the worst-case scenario for a speech processing system, be it a speech recognition or a speaker recognition system, as we are dealing with larger differences than only dialectal ones."

        "2.1 Speaker Identification in Language-mismatched conditions",
        "The most popular approach for speaker recognition systems makes use of Gaussian mixture models (GMM) (Paalanen et al., 2006) of short-term spectral features, like MFCC or LPCC (Young, 1995; Reynolds & Rose, 1995).",
        "These spectral features characterize the vocal tract filter at the moment of articulation, effectively capturing not only the characteristic vocal tract of each speaker (thus allowing his/her identification) but also the characteristic vocal tract of each phoneme.",
        "This means that MFCC and LPCC features capture information about the phonetic content of the utterance too.",
        "In a text-independent speaker recognition system problems arise when, in a multilingual environment, the model is trained in a language but the testing is made in another.",
        "Usually the phonetic content of both languages is not the same, so that the score of the test utterances will be misleading, increasing the error rate of the system.",
        "A straightforward way to reduce the disagreement between the test utterance and the model is to perform the training with recordings from both languages.",
        "In this way, there is a chance for the characteristics of all phonemes to be learnt.",
        "This solution is adopted by Ma and Meng (2004).",
        "Another way would be having a different speaker model for each language, and using a language detector to decide which one to use, as proposed by Akbacak and Hansen (2007).",
        "But these approaches will not be generalizable to a different language from those used during training.",
        "A more language-independent solution is desirable.",
        "In the last few years new high level features have been proposed and successfully applied for speaker recognition problems in a monolingual working frame (Reynolds et al., 2003).",
        "Among them, prosodic features, which are related to intonation, energy and speech rate, seem a good option (Dehak, Dumouchel & Kenny, 2007) since they can be easily estimated by automatic signal processing algorithms and can be extracted even from very short utterances.",
        "Like the spectral parameterization, these prosodic features contain information of both the speaker and the spoken language.",
        "In the case of a multi-language system, the advantages of using prosodic features may arise if the inter-speaker variability of these features is larger than the inter-language variability.",
        "In this case it is reasonable to say that prosody is less language-dependent than speaker-dependent.",
        "Section 4 describes the measurement of the speaker and language separability of MFCC and prosodic features in order to see if they can be successfully applied to reduce the error rate in our bilingual case."

        "Plantronics DSP-400 microphone was used for this purpose, and audio signals were sampled at 44.1 kHz and 16 bit per sample.",
        "Each speaker was recorded in four different sessions, with unequal time spacing, in order to adequately capture the speech variability over time.",
        "This bilingual Basque/Spanish database was acquired together with a multimodal biometric database (Galbally et al., 2007) and the calendar designed for the acquisition of the latter was also used for the new database.",
        "There is a difference of two weeks between the recording of the first and second sessions, four weeks between the second and third sessions and six weeks between the third and fourth sessions.",
        "Each speaker recorded 7 numeric sequences formed by 8 digits that the speaker read as she or he preferred.",

        "In the present work two kinds of features have been used: spectral and prosodic.",
        "Traditional MFCC parameterization was used as representative of spectral information.",
        "18 MFCC features augmented with first and second derivatives were calculated every 10 ms, and mean and variance normalization (MVN) was applied to reduce channel effects.",
        "Prosodic features were also considered, as they may improve the performance of the system.",
        "Used prosodic features consist of intonation and absolute energy extracted every 10 ms, together with their first and second derivatives.",
        "MVN was also applied in order to reduce the intersession variability of these features.",
        "As no pitch information is available in unvoiced frames, only voiced ones are used.",
        "This approach makes possible to append prosodic values to the already calculated MFCC vectors, effectively including prosody into the baseline GMM system.",
        "A proper speech parameterization for speaker recognition should have large inter-speaker variability (in order to be able to discriminate among the speakers) and low intra-speaker variability, both inter-language and intersession (so that the feature distribution does not change much between training and testing conditions).",
        "In order to verify the suitability of the proposed features, their variability was estimated using the Kullback-Leibler divergence (Kullback & Leibler, 1951) as a distance measure between distributions.",
        "For inter-speaker variability, the KL divergence was computed between every possible pair of speakers.",
        "The mean value among all the pairs was used as a measure of inter-speaker variability, as it should be representative of the mean divergence between any two random speakers.",
        "This estimation was carried out separately for Basque and Spanish.",
        "Similarly, the intersession variability for each speaker was estimated as the mean KL divergence between all possible pairs of available sessions for that speaker.",
        "The final intersession variability was estimated as the mean variability among all speakers.",
        "This estimation was also carried out separately for Basque and Spanish.",
        "Last, the KL divergence between the features for Basque and Spanish recordings was calculated for every speaker.",
        "Again, the mean value among all speakers was used as a global measure of inter-language variability.",
        "The inter-speaker variability to inter-language variability ratio can be used as a measure to compare two feature sets in terms of language-robustness.",
        "In a similar way, the inter-speaker variability to intersession variability ratio can be a measure of the session-robustness.",
        "It is desirable for these two ratios to have a value as large as possible.",
        "Results of all these measures are summarized in Table 1 for plain MFCC and the proposed parameterization.",
        "As expected, adding the new prosodic features to the already calculated MFCC vectors increases all variabilities, as new feature dimensions can only increase the distance between two distributions.",
        "But while the inter-speaker variability is increased about a 30%, the inter-language variability is increased only a 12%.",
        "As reflected by the inter-speaker to inter-language ratio, this results in an increase around 15% in the language-robustness.",
        "values for plain MFCC and prosody-augmented (MFCC+P) features, for Spanish (S) and Basque (B) recordings.",
        "The drawback is that intonation and energy measures have a great intersession variability, so at least part of the gain obtained in language robustness will be lost in session sensitivity.",
        "The overall inter-speaker to intersession variability ratio is reduced around a 2-3%.",
        "This means that when language-matched tests are performed (i.e. no inter-language variability occurs), results with the new features are expected to be a little worse than with plain MFCC features."
