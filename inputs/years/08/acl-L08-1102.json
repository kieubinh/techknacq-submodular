        "In many U.S. localities, when emergency calls are received in languages other than English (primarily Spanish) the dispatching center connects the call to the Language Line human translation service (Language line Services) to translate for them.",
        "Though using human translators to assist callers during emergency calls might seem optimal, this scheme actually has serious shortcomings.",
        "The process is very slow, especially in starting up, and the translators are unfamiliar with the task, resulting in very poor quality service.",
        "We are applying and adapting speech translation technology to the domain of 9-1-1 emergency dispatching.",
        "(The standard emergency telephone number in the United States is \"9-1-1\".)",
        "The 9-1-1 domain has many research challenges, but we believe it is also a feasible domain for a real-world speech translation application.",
        "The domain is challenging because it requires real-time operation and the recognition and translation of stressed telephone-quality speech in multiple dialects; it is still feasible because we have significant in-domain data, there are strong vocabulary and task constraints, and perfection is not required.",
        "This domain also has clear, significant social value, addressing the chronic shortage of translation of Spanish (and in larger cities, a large number of other languages) at U.S. emergency dispatch centers.",
        "While we currently are working on Spanish/English, the approaches we use are largely language-independent.",
        "We expect that this project will eventually lead to an actually deployed system that performs full automatic speech recognition (ASR) and targeted, classification-based machine translation (MT).",
        "This would be an important scientific result, validating for the first time the hypothesis that speech can be adequately recognized and translated for real-world use.",
        "Our initial work is aimed at demonstrating that we can produce ASR and utterance classification of sufficient quality to allow the development of such a practical, limited-domain system.",
        "The results reported here achieve the goal of justifying further work in building, user-testing, and evaluating a full pilot system."

      "text": [
        "When someone dials 9-1-1 in most places in the United States, they are connected to a special dispatching center.",
        "The operators there have been trained to perform a rapid triage, or categorization of emergency calls.",
        "The major initial decision is whether to send police, fire or medical personnel; the appropriate units are dispatched as soon as this decision is made.",
        "While the responding unit is en route, the dispatcher attempts to elicit more details about the emergency from the caller.",
        "The additional details are intended to help the responding unit prepare for the situation that they will encounter.",
        "For example, the police want to know the level of violence involved in advance.",
        "Will they be walking into an armed confrontation, or is someone reporting a crime that occurred yesterday?",
        "Another important issue is the exact location of the emergency; although the 9-1-1 equipment displays the phone number and address of the call, the information is not always correct, the emergency may not be at the location of the telephone, and cellular telephones (and Voice-over-IP) do not generally provide 9-1-1 location information.",
        "As the dispatcher elicits more information about the emergency, they radio it to the responding unit."

        "Full reliable speech-to-speech translation is still beyond our capabilities, especially for real-time human-directed conversation.",
        "However in many applications, full translation is not actually required, and a more limited form is adequate (Stallard et al., 2007; Gao et al., 2006).",
        "Based on the domain's characteristics, we are following a highly asymmetrical design for the eventual full system (Frederking et al., 2000), see Figure 1.",
        "The dispatcher is already seated at a workstation, and we intend to keep them \"in the loop\", for both technical and social reasons.",
        "In the dispatcher-to-caller direction, we can work with text and menus, so we require■ no English ASR,",
        "■ no true English-to-Spanish MT, and",
        "■ simple, domain-limited, Spanish speech synthesis.",
        "The caller-to-dispatcher direction is interesting.",
        "In this direction we require much more",
        "■ Spanish ASR that can handle emotional spontaneous telephone speech in mixed dialects,",
        "■ Spanish-to-English MT, but",
        "■ no English Speech Synthesis.",
        "In the final system, we will adapt an approach that was demonstrated in the joint NSF/EU \"Nespole!\"",
        "project (Lavie et al., 2001): Domain Action (DA) classification (Levin et al., 2003; Langley 2003).",
        "We use the term DA to refer to the combination of a general Speech Act with domain-specific concepts.",
        "DAs capture speaker intention in a limited-domain system, rather than detailed literal meaning, and thus help the MT system cope with ungrammaticality and ASR errors, by ignoring out-of-domain speech and focusing on recognizing the main intent and crucial details of each utterance.",
        "Example DAs in this domain might be Request-Ambulance (\"I need an ambulance!\")",
        "or Giving-Address (\"I live at 2635 Rodeo Drive\").",
        "Once we have classified the utterance into a DA, the next step in the eventual full system will be to identify and translate just the arguments of the DA.",
        "An example output argument structure for the second DA above might be (address-number=\"2635\", address-street=\"Rodeo Drive\").",
        "In this initial work, we only seek to demonstrate that we can carry out utterance classification on ASR output of sufficient quality to support this approach to MT.",
        "The actual MT system will be developed in a follow-on project."

        "The acoustic models are trained on 50 Spanish 9-1-1 calls, which amount to 4 hours of speech data.",
        "The system uses three-state, left-to-right, sub-phonetically tied semi-continuous models with 400 context-dependent distributions with the same number of codebooks.",
        "Each codebook has 32 gaussians per state.",

        "The interpolation weights are determined using the transcriptions of 10 calls (development set).",
        "The test data consists of 15 telephone calls from different speakers, which amounts to a total of 1 hour.",
        "Both development and test set calls consisted of manually segmented and transcribed speaker turns that don't have a significant overlap with other speakers.",
        "The perplexity of the test set according to the language model is 96.7.",
        "The accuracy of the Spanish ASR on the test set is 76.5%.",

        "As described in Section 3 above, the speech recognizer output needs to be classified into domain-specific actions (DAs) for eventual translation, as well as dialogue control.",
        "So as an initial evaluation, experiments were carried out on classifying manual audio transcriptions of the 9-1-1 calls used to train the speech recognizer.",
        "We extracted all the dialog turns in the transcriptions between the human translator and the caller and labelled them according to the DA of the caller.",

        "■ Using synonyms from Spanish EuroWordNet to smooth the match between utterances",
        "■ Using discourse context to bias classification",
        "These techniques would be in addition to the more mundane improvements we hope to have from acquiring, transcribing and labeling more data (currently in progress), improving the utterance tag-set (also in progress), and further improving the ASR.",
        "Another possibility is to use a second stage of classification on highly-confusable classes (Liu et al., 2003).",
        "Note in the confusion matrix (Table 3) that the matrix is fairly sparse; the misclassifications only occur between certain classes.",
        "We could train a set of classifiers",
        "The overall accuracy of the classifier on 10-fold cross-validation is 60.12%.",
        "However, if we leave out all misclassifications of tags as \"Others\", the overall accuracy of the classifier improves to 68.8%, as shown in the last column of Table 2.",
        "This analysis is interesting due to eventual dialogue system design issues.",
        "If the full system classifies an utterance with the \"Others\" tag, it will need to prompt the caller with more specific questions (e.g. \"Do you need an ambulance?\")",

        "Thus the accuracy without \"Others\" more accurately reflects the expected performance of the eventual full system.",

        "The final system will be integrated with the 9-1-1 answering and dispatching unit which has access to the uninterrupted caller channel of the full-duplex telephone line, thus avoiding segmentation.",
