        "Recent years have seen increased interest within the speaker recognition community in high-level features, so named because they are abstract from the acoustic signal.",

        "The effort required to annotate large corpora for many features would be impractical were it not for existing data and annotations and technologies that simplify the annotator's task.",
        "The project requires data that have been orthographically transcribed to serve as a guide to potential loci for the features sought.",
        "Specifically, we use orthographic transcripts, a pronouncing lexicon and forced-aligner to generate a putative, time-aligned, phonetic transcription of the audio imagining that the speaker's utterances were standard.",
        "If the high-level features are described as deviations from standard pronunciation, any locus in which actual pronunciation differs from putative standard is a potential high-level feature.",
        "However since complete phonetic transcription is cost-prohibitive, automatic phonetic transcription is not adequately accurate and we lack dialect studies for every difference one might encounter, we instead use these technologies to guide human annotators to expected features."

        "The raw audio data come from a number of existing sources.",
        "The first is the Mixer corpus (Cieri, et.",
        "al.",
        "2006) of conversational telephone speech (CTS) collected at LDC to support the development of speaker recognition technologies robust to changes in language and channel.",
        "During recruitment, Mixer subjects provided their age, sex, occupation, cities where born and raised, and ethnicity.",
        "Subjects then completed ten or more telephone calls, six minutes in duration, speaking to other subjects, whom they typically did not know, about assigned topics.",
        "Bilingual speakers of Arabic, Mandarin, Russian, and Spanish were paired and encouraged to complete some calls in English and some in the other language.",
        "Some calls (about 7%) took place in a room where eight or more microphones recorded one side of the conversation.",
        "All calls were audited for topic and audio quality but were not generally transcribed.",
        "Although Mixer was clearly not designed for the current effort, it is one of the few corpora in which subjects self-report ethnicity.",
        "Because the pool contains speakers of multiple American English dialects, who categorized themselves as African American and other ethnicities, it provides a rare opportunity to compare those groups in the same situation.",
        "Of course, the data needed to be transcribed, and were, using a specification described below.",
        "To date 126 Mixer calls have been transcribed by the Phanotics project.",
        "Of these, 35 calls included conversations between two speakers of AAVE while 91 include conversations between one AAVE speaker and one non-AAVE speaker.",
        "The second source of data was the Fisher corpus (Cieri, et.",
        "al.",
        "2004) collected at LDC to support the development of speech-to-text technologies within the DARPA EARS program (LDC 2002).",
        "During recruitment, Fisher subjects provided their age, sex, native language, and the cities where they were born and raised.",
        "During the collection, subjects completed from one to 25 calls, ten minutes in duration, speaking to other participants, whom they typically did not know, about assigned topics.",
        "The calls were audited for topic and quality before verbatim, time-aligned orthographic transcripts were produced.",
        "Because Fisher was created for another purpose, the development of speech recognition technologies, it lacks crucial information on the ethnicity of the speaker.",
        "However, because some of the Fisher subjects were LDC employees, their family, friends, and colleagues, it was possible to identify a handful that could be assigned to an ethnic category after the fact.",
        "To date, 171 Fisher calls have been selected for use in this project.",
        "Other potential sources of data include the StoryCorpsÂ® Griot (StoryCorps 2008) initiative and several corpora of recording interviews contributed by individual sociolinguists and dialectologists working in communities in the United States.",
        "The StoryCorps Griot initiative, funded by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, is a one-year effort to record interviews of African Americans.",
        "This ongoing project will establish nine different recording locations open for up to six weeks each.",
        "At each location, African Americans may make appointments to use the recording booth for one hour interviews of friends and family.",
        "Potential users receive instructions on how to conduct good interviews and a trained facilitator is present to help the interviews which cover whatever topics the subjects choose.",
        "Participants receive a free copy of their interview; other copies are archived and distributed.",
        "StoryCorps has agreed to provide selected material to this project in exchange for transcripts.",

        "This Phanotics Quick Transcription specification emphasizes speed and accuracy.",
        "Annotators begin by segmenting speech, virtually, at the sentence level making sure not to cut too closely to the speech.",
        "To improve the results of subsequent forced-alignment, sentences are further segmented if they are longer than eight seconds or contain more than 0.5 seconds of silence internally.",
        "Each audio channel, for example each side of a telephone conversation, is segmented independently.",
        "Segments may overlap and audio that contains no speech may be left unsegmented.",
        "Although these parameters are appropriate for the current task, they constrain the choice of the transcription tool, ruling out for example the very popular Transcriber, which cannot easily handle two channel files and does not permit overlapping segments on a single channel.",
        "We use the Xtrans tool (Maeda and Strassel 2004) created at LDC for this effort.",
        "The transcription uses standard orthography, case, and punctuation with a few exceptions.",
        "Punctuation is limited to period, question mark, and comma.",
        "Double dash marks incomplete sentences and restarts, while single dash marks incomplete words.",
        "Proper names are capitalized as are acronyms and strings of letter pronounced separately.",
        "Uttered numbers are written as words and not as strings of digits.",
        "A limited set of standard contractions are used and non-standard contractions ('cause for because), are written as the full word.",
        "Obviously mispronounced and idiosyncratic words are tagged with a '+' symbol but, otherwise, no attempt is made to mark dialectal pronunciation since this will be accomplished in the annotation phase.",
        "A limited set of non-lexemes, (um, uh), are used in filled pauses.",
        "Speech errors are transcribed exactly as they are produced but the time allocated to transcribe highly diffluent section is limited since these sections will be rejected at the next stage.",

      "text": [
        "The final annotation step for this effort is to identify features that distinguish a given dialect from the standard language.",
        "Such features are often described as rules that change the standard form into a non-standard form.",
        "The rules apply variably according to internal and external constraints including the lexical identity and morphology of the affected word, its position within a sentence, the phonological environment, the functional effect of the change (for example whether it neutralizes a distinction between two words), the age, sex, socioeconomic class of the speakers, and the dialects they speak.",
        "The complete set of rules is too lengthy to discuss here.",
        "However, some examples include: the reduction of consonant clusters in final position (left lef', missed miss); the deletion of r (car ca'), l (palm pa'm) and w (young ones young 'uns); and, the change of the voiced and voiceless interdental fricatives into voiced and voiceless stops respectively (bother boda').",
        "The preparation described above and customized tools together simplify the annotation process.",
        "Since the rules are specified as a-^b/x_y (\"a becomes b when preceded by x and followed by y\"), the input and environment parts of the rule (xay) constitute a search term for finding the feature.",
        "The input and output parts of the rule (a -^b) form a question to be answered: Did the subject say xay or xby?",
        "This question is generally answered through annotation.",
        "Where a phonetic decoder is accurate enough, this question may be answered automatically and we plan to investigate this process in later phases.",
        "The tool, SPAAT (Super Phonetic Annotation and Analysis Tool) is designed for rapid annotation and analysis.",
        "For each feature under study, it presents the annotator with a list of regions of interest (ROI), locations where a rule may have applied, where a feature may be present.",
        "Since the transcript and audio have been previously forced-aligned, the annotator can listen to the audio with a small amount of preceding and following context.",
        "The annotator's job is to decide whether or not the rule has applied (whether the form is standard or non-standard, whether the feature is present, whether the subject said xay or xby) and to what degree.",
        "If the annotator is not certain they may mark ROIs indeterminate.",
        "They may also indicate places where problems with noise or voice quality render a decision difficult and places where the tool requests an annotation of a region that is not a true ROI (a false positive).",

        "Since, we have completed our pilots just as this paper is going to print, we can only report briefly on initial agreement.",
        "Initial interannotator agreement varies considerably by rule, rule type, annotator and annotator training.",
        "Absolute average initial agreement across a pool of five or more annotators, across all rules was 74.49% on a three-way decision where a feature is annotated as present, intermediate or absent.",
        "If we convert the decision to two-way (feature is present versus intermediate + absent) initial agreement climbs to 85.54%.",
        "Pairwise agreement by chance in three way and two way decisions is, respectively, 11.1% and 25%.",
        "Initial two way agreement rates were 83.81% for rules involving substitutions and 91.95% for rules involving reductions and insertions.",
        "Now that we have initial agreement results, the team is expanding the documentation and training program and creating a small gold standard corpus before moving into production annotation.",
        "The documentation currently includes a description of each rule, the rule syntax, a prose description with examples and a breakdown of what each possible annotation decision means in the case of that rule.",
        "We are currently adding examples with audio to be sure annotators are consistent when they note that a feature is present, intermediate or absent, when an unexpected form is attested, when a decision is too difficult to make and when the region identified is not a true ROI.",
        "Once annotators have read this documentation, have trained and have been tested against a gold-standard corpus, we expect significant increases in interannotator agreement.",
        "Naturally we retain the option to shift annotators to other tasks if they have difficulty with this task and to exclude rules that apply infrequently, seem to have little distinguishing power or cannot be annotated with adequate confidence."
