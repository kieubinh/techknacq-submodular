        "In this paper we explore a novel approach to the incorporation of semantic information in natural language processing without falling victim to the notorious problems ofambigu-ity and lack of robustness, namely through the formal interpretation of semantic annotation.",
        "This approach is based on the observation that semantic annotations are intended to capture some of the meaning of the annotated text.",
        "Annotating a text with semantic roles, for instance, is intended to capture the semantic relations between verbs and their arguments.",
        "Annotations have traditionally been viewed as a kind of labels, useful for identifying linguistic patterns in corpora.",
        "of for finding certain types of information in a text, such as temporal information in documents with temporal annotations.",
        "Since semantic annotations capture something of the meaning of the annotated text, it should be possible to do more with them then use them as mere labels; it should be possible to use them as partial descriptions of meaning.",
        "This idea has been behind several semantic annotation efforts; e.g. in describing their motivation behind the TimeML specification language for events and temporal expressions in text, Pustejovsky et al.",
        "(2003) argue that \"event recognition drives basic inferences from text,\" and claim that TimeML annotations can therefore improve the performance of text-based question answering systems.",
        "But in spite of this, TimeML is defined as an XML-based annotation language with a well-defined syntax, but without a semantics, so that there is no solid ground for allowing the\"basic inferences\" that motivate the effort.",
        "TimeML is no exception in this respect (the FrameNet and PropBank projects presenting other examples); it is just one instance of the general trend in the design of semantic annotation systems to take their semantics for granted.",
        "There is in fact something paradoxical about using a semantic annotation language without a semantics, since there is a priori no reason why semantically undefined annotations would describe something of the meanings of natural language expressions any better than the expressions themselves.",
        "Bunt & Romary (2002) have therefore argued that one of the fundamental requirements of a language for semantic annotation is that it should have a formal semantics.",
        "In this paper we explore the possibility of designing annotation languages and schemes which do have a well-defined semantics.",
        "We will show that defining a formal semantics for an annotation scheme/language may have the additional advantage of improving its design, compared to considering designs which have only a syntactic definition.",
        "The inspiration for this paper comes from participating in two recent and ongoing efforts in the area of semantic annotation, namely the European eContent project LIRICS (Linguistic Infrastructure for Interoperable Resources and Systems, http://lirics.loria.fr), and the expert group on semantic content (http://iso-tdg3.uvt.nl) of the International Organisation for Standardization ISO.",
        "One important activity developed by the ISO expert group concerns a project to define an international standard for annotating temporal information, based on TimeML and therefore informally known as ISO-TimeML.",
        "Other activities, performed in concert with the LIRICS project, concern the design of sets of well-defined and well-documented concepts (following ISO standard 12620) for semantic annotation, which are made publicly available in an on-line registry.",
        "The focus of the latter activities is in three areas of semantic annotation: semantic roles, referential relations, and communicative functions of dialogue utterances.",
        "This paper is concerned with the interpretation of annotations in the areas of temporal information, referential relations, and semantic roles.",
        "We propose an XML-based integrated format for the representation of annotations concerned with these types of information, inspired by the TimeML-format.",
        "We refer to the language for the integrated annotation of this information as \"SemML\" (Semantic Markup Language), and we define a compositional formal semantics for this language by translating SemML expressions in a compositional manner into a formal logical language (that of Second-Order Predicate Logic, to be precise) that has a well-established formal semantics.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "In the next section we consider briefly the annotation of temporal and event information according to ISO-TimeML, and its proposed semantics in terms of Interval Temporal Logic.",
        "In particular we will indicate some deficiencies and limitations of that semantics, suggesting that an event-based semantics is preferable to a semantics based on temporal intervals.",
        "In section 3 we consider the annotation of semantic role and reference information in an XML-based format, similar to that of TimeML, using the data categories defined in the LIRICS project.",
        "We argue that the interpretation of quantified semantic role information and/or reference information cannot be done in an adequate fashion in firstorder logic, and we show how second-order logic can be used.",
        "In section 4 we discuss the effects of integrating the annotation of time, semantic roles, and reference in a single representation structure.",
        "We point out the existence of certain overlaps between the annotation concepts used in ISO-TimeML, those used for semantic role annotation, and those used for reference annotation.",
        "In section 5 we present a compositional semantics for the integrated SemML language.",
        "We discuss the problems with devising a compositional translation from SemML to formal logic, and present a solution to these problems.",
        "The paper concludes in section 6 with some remarks on what has been achieved in this paper, on its limitations, and on its perspectives."

        "Also, when we want to annotate and interpret other than temporal information, such as semantic roles and coreference relations, then obviously we need a richer underlying ontology than that of ITL.",
        "A deficiency of the ITL-based semantics, at least in the form in which it has been formulated, is that it is not compositional.",

        "But when both temporal annotation and semantic role annotation are performed and expressed in integrated annotation structures, then temporal anchoring relations are better regarded as temporal, and dropped as semantic roles.",
        "Aspectual relations and temporal anchoring also need to be reconsidered when performing integrated semantic annotation.",

        "In this paper we indicated how various types of semantic information can be annotated in an integrated fashion in an annotation language with a well-defined semantics.",
        "In fact, the integrated interpretation of the various kinds of semantic information is of more interest than the integrated annotation.",
        "One may wish to annotate various types of semantic information in separate layers, using a layered approach to annotation.",
        "But in both cases the same issues arise concerning (a) deciding which information belongs to which type (to which layer); and (b) how does the meaning of the annotations of one type (in one semantic layer) consistently combine with that of other types (in other semantic layers)?",
        "In this respect, we have come across several phenomena where existing semantic annotation schemes are incompatible.",
        "We noted for instance that the relations between events encoded in ISO-TimeML by means of slink and alink are predominantly of a thematic rather than a temporal nature, and does belong to the area/layer of semantic role relations.",
        "On the other hand, the relations between an event and its place and time, which are usually annotated by means of semantic roles, do not really belong there since they do not constitute relations between an eventuality and a 'participant' in that eventuality; they rather belong to the areas/layers of temporal and spatial information.",
        "Also, referential relations may have dependencies with aspectual relations between the verbs denoting the eventualities in which the referents participate, e.g. in the case of control verbs (Amy started to [Amy] laugh.).",
        "These are just a few examples of how the semantic study of the concepts used in semantic annotation may lead to a better conceptual understanding and to improving the annotation schemas for the various types of information.",
        "It is also worth pointing out that, except for the interferences between concepts in different areas/layers ofthe kind just mentioned, the approach to semantic annotation interpretation described in this paper is independent of the particular choices of annotation tags; for instance, the set of semantic roles that we considered, taken from the LIRICS project (see Petukhova & Bunt, 2008) could be replaced by another set of roles without any change in the procedure for translating the annotations into formal logic.",
        "Finally, it is clear that the approach that we have outlined can be extended to other areas of semantic annotation, such as spatial information, noun-noun relations, quantification, and discourse relations.",
        "It thus offers the exciting perspective of increasingly incorporating semantic information in a robust and incremental fashion in NLP applications, as the technology of semantic annotation continues to develop."
