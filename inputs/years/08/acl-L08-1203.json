        "A microarray (or a gene chip/array) is a collection of microscopic spots on a solid surface which enables monitoring expressions of thousands genes (virtually the entire genome) simultaneously.",
        "The term \"gene expression\" refers to turning on and off the production of proteins by which a given organism responds to environmental and biological situations.",
        "Microarrays play a significant role in today's biomedicine.",
        "They have been successfully used in diagnoses and prognoses for various diseases, to plan treatment, to design new drugs, etc.",
        "The amount of data produced by microarray analysis is large and it is not possible to analyze it manually.",
        "The gene expression matrix can contain a lot of noise, missing values or other irregular variations.",
        "Advanced statistical or machine learning methods are applied to normalize data and to identify and correct unacceptable expression values (see, e.g., (Yang et al., 2002, Hershey et al., 2008) for approaches to microarray data normalization and (Yoon et al., 2007, Wang et al., 2006) for missing value estimation).",
        "There is also a need for management of the huge amount of diverse data.",
        "The heterogeneity can present the major obstacle for the fusion mechanism as data from different laboratories are produced by widely varying experimental techniques and can be incomplete in many respects.",
        "The next step in the automatic processing of microarray data consists in grouping genes with similar behavior (and, usually, filtering out the rest).",
        "Various clustering algorithms have been applied for identifying biologically relevant groups of genes and samples.",
        "A survey of the clustering methods used for gene expression data can be found in (Jiang et al., 2004).",
        "The mentioned processes form the general part of present standard microarray data processing which is common for various experiments run by laboratories all over the world.",
        "Many biologists work directly with the output of the employed clustering techniques and try to find a connection between the current measurements and their knowledge on the domain.",
        "Advanced visualization techniques can be called for to support the interpretation process.",
        "Nevertheless, it is usually extremely difficult to find the proper links between the potentially significant genes from the produced clusters and to formulate and verify correct hypotheses on the results.",
        "Even the experts with a long experience in the field often miss significant clues that would support the interpretation.",
        "They can fail to remember an article on the topic presenting the evidence in another context, not be aware of the latest results studying another organism, miss a paper on a discovered protein interaction patterns etc.",
        "Without a help of information technologies, the interpretation presents a tedious work with many potential obstacles.",
        "The aim of our research is to reduce the workload as much as possible and let biologists focus on the interpretation of the particular pieces of knowledge the system can automatically infer from available data.",
        "Even though the deep biological knowledge will be probably always necessary to uncover new principles of the processes in living organisms, today's computers can significantly reduce the need for manual search of relevant scientific literature, the evidence from previous experiments and additional information.",
        "As there are potentially many sources of relevant biological knowledge, one has to think about general ways to integrate the different views provided by the different databases.",
        "The actual fusion mechanism we apply in our work takes advantage of the latest semantic-web technologies and standards that facilitate the definition of the data-integration semantics.",
        "KnoFusius benefits from RDF/OWL-based data communication and interchange and defines open interfaces for later extensions.",
        "In this respect, we continue the work of Ruttenberg et al.",
        "(2007), Badea (2006) and many others that show the significance of the semantic web vision for the biomedical research.",
        "An important trend that helps us to speed up the development of the tool is \"the opening\" of the large biomedical databases.",
        "More and more sites are changing from former data silos to fully interoperable services and they can be therefore easily plugged into the semantics-aware platforms."

        "A schema of the KnoFusius system is given in Figure 1.",
        "The process starts with experimental data prepared with the help of advanced biomedical methods and tools.",
        "The user can provide a normalized description of the experimental setup which can be then used to retrieve additional data from various databases.",
        "The quality of metadata is crucial for the success of subsequent processing steps.",
        "experimental d",
        "clustered expression data from the primary experiment description of the disease and experimental setting",
        "interpretation by an expert",
        "PubMed and other sources of scientific literature",
        "Array express databases containing the results of other groups around the world are searched next.",
        "As it is extremely difficult (if not impossible) to compare the primary expression data across various experimental settings, arrays used etc., the system counts upon metainformation, provided by the original experimenters and stored together with the primary data in the array expression databases.",
        "We are currently trying to provide wrapper components that should enable combining data from two most populated databases - ArrayExpress (www.arrayexpress.com) and STNK (www.stanford.edu).",
        "The fusion on this level is rather problematic as the two databases differ significantly in their content as well as the functions supported.",
        "The experimental data are then combined with relevant information from biomedical knowledge bases.",
        "They include various ontologies such as GO - the Gene Ontology (www.geneontology.org) or OBI - the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (obi.sourceforge.net), pathway maps (representing the knowledge on the molecular interaction and reaction networks) such as KEGG - the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Pathway collection (www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html), Biocarta (biocarta.com) or the BioCyc collection (biocyc.org), protein knowledge bases such as UniProt the Universal Protein Resource (uniprot.org) and many other resources.",
        "Even though the biomedical knowledge bases try to scan journals and conference proceedings regularly to embrace as much information as possible, one still cannot rely on their full coverage.",
        "This is partially due to the shallow text analysis techniques employed and also due to the limited scope of the primary resources.",
        "Moreover, those knowledge bases that are \"curated\" by an individual or a small group of people have to tackle the issues of subjectivity and availability of the curators.",
        "On the other hand, the approach followed in our work reduces the work of personal judges to the definition of a declarative set of extraction patterns for particular pieces of knowledge, and, if necessary, to semi-automatic evaluation of the source reliability.",
        "The text mining is applied not only to the content of the PubMed database, but also to the additional sources of scientific publications that can be stored locally (recent conference proceedings, various reports with restricted access rights...).",
        "An important point of the direct analysis of the scientific articles and papers (instead of taking benefit just from the preprocessed biomedical databases) is our ability to consider different weights (influence, reliability) of various pieces of information from various sources.",
        "The reasoning within the knowledge fusion system deals with explicitly represented uncertainty (see (Novacek & Smrz, 2006) for the details of our approach) and the source reliability is one of the important factors participating in the process.",
        "As mentioned above, we employ rather deep text processing to extract as much relevant information as possible.",
        "After the standard preprocessing steps transformation of the input formats, tokenization and sentence boundary detection, we employ POS tagging, syntactic analysis and pronominal anaphora resolution.",
        "We benefit from the available domain-specific terminological thesauri and ontologies to define particular categories of interest.",
        "The results form an input for our pattern-based semantic-relation extractor.",
        "It takes advantage of general-purpose language resources, namely WordNet, to expand predefined knowledge patterns (and transfer terms to concepts in general).",
        "The set of extracted relations (such as \"protein-A inhibits protein-B\") is then merged with the related information from biomedical knowledge bases and the output is used to filter and interpret the experimental data in hand.",
        "A significant attention has been recently paid to the aggregation and integration of data drawn from diverse sources in the field of life sciences.",
        "A unifying view on these activities can be provided by the vision of the semantic web - an extension of the current web that enables automatic processing of the various resources.",
        "It is based on common formats (RDF, OWL, RIF.)",
        "and related technologies.",
        "For example, the above-mentioned knowledge bases have been recently transformed from many proprietary formats (often focusing on the visual representation suitable for humans) into RDF/OWL appropriate for machine processing.",
        "There are many limitations of the current semantic web technologies due to their immaturity.",
        "The major issue connected to the huge knowledge bases and complex ontologies typical for the biomedical field is the low performance and limited scalability of the available automatic reasoners.",
        "That is why we currently employ ad-hoc mechanisms for the interpretation of experimental data based on a simple fuzzy-rule chaining.",
        "However, as the overall architecture is modular enough to allow easy replacement of the inferring engine, we plan to evaluate various recently proposed solutions (Stracia, 2001, Simou & Kollias, 2007) in terms of their performance and scalability and to integrate the module that will best meet our needs."

        "It is always difficult to evaluate systems aiming at finding new, potentially interesting links among given pieces of knowledge that should help to understand a complex problem.",
        "To evaluate the functionality of KnoFusius, we defined two tasks that are described in the following text.",
        "The first set of input data consists of two lists of gene identifiers - 22 genes that showed to be up-regulated and 29 down-regulated in an experiment.",
        "No additional knowledge on the disease in question, experimental settings or other characteristics has been provided to the system.",

        "GEPAS (Gene Expression Profile Analysis Suite - gepas.bioinfo.cipf.es/) has been used to preprocess data.",
        "KnoFusius is called to help biologists find the best match between their measurements and knowledge stored in the form of published pathway databases.",
        "The pathways are taken as graphs (see Figure 2) stored in a local database which combines data from KEGG and Biocarta sites mentioned above.",
        "Results are presented in the form of pathway lists ordered according to their estimated relevance to the experimental data on input.",
