        "2002, King et al.",
        "2003).",
        "The FEMTI framework is publicly available and benefits from user-friendly interfaces that guide evaluators with the definition of quality models and the selection of metrics (http ://www.issco .unige.ch/femti/).",

      "text": [
        "FEMTI is made up of three components: the first one ('Part I') is a classification of possible user requirements or, more generally, of contexts of use of an MT system.",
        "Therefore, FEMTI Part I classifies the characteristics concerning the task to be performed by the MT system, the author and text type of the input to the system, and the type of user of the system.",
        "The second component of FEMTI ('Part II') is a classification of quality characteristics based on the general ones first defined in the ISO/IEC 9126-1 standard for software evaluation (ISO/IEC 1991, 2001).",
        "The six top level characteristics of FEMTI Part II are the ISO ones, namely functionality, reliability, usability, efficiency, maintainability and portability, plus an extra characteristic, namely cost.",
        "Each top level characteristic is further decomposed into a hierarchy of characteristics which are specific to MT systems, and human and/or automatic metrics are attached to each node of this hierarchy, which can be used to evaluate the corresponding feature of the system, i.e. a quality attribute.",
        "The third component of FEMTI is the linking mechanism between Part I and Part II described in the next section.",
        "The generation of evaluation plans is based on particular quality models, which are subsets of the FEMTI Part II repertoire of quality characteristics and metrics.",
        "To extract such a subset, evaluators define first the requirements for the system (Part I), then apply a mechanism that uses the relations between each user requirement and the relevant quality characteristics of the system to be evaluated to construct the quality model.",
        "Therefore, the influence of the intended context of use on the quality model is represented formally as a matrix, called a generic contextual quality model or GCQM (Popescu-Belis et al.",
        "2006).",
        "Each row of the FEMTI GCQM represents a quality characteristic of Part II, and each column is a context characteristic from Part I.",
        "(For efficiency and readability, only those items from Parts I and II - context/quality characteristics - that have a connection or relation with one or more items are represented in the actually implementation of the GCQM.)",
        "The fact that a specific context characteristic requires the evaluation of a specific quality is represented as a relation or link between one item in Part I and another item in Part II.",
        "In the matrix representation of the GCQM, a link is represented by a weight in the corresponding cell indicating the importance of the link.",
        "Figure l. Excerpt of a GCQM showing four context characteristics and four quality characteristics: context Cl0has the highest connection to quality Q24",
        "The scale used for the weights is: 1 (low importance), 2 (medium importance), 3 (high importance) or n/a, which indicates the presence of a link with no specific weight (this allows backwards compatibility with the first version of FEMTI, which did not use weighted links).",
        "For example, context Cl0 is linked to quality Q24 indicated by a non-zero value and the weight of the link is 3, as shown in Figure l. When an evaluator specifies a context of use with FEMTI, the FEMTI software represents the selected characteristics as a context vector, which is used internally to retrieve relevant quality characteristics from Part II that should be evaluated for that context of use.",
        "This process thus generates a quality vector by computing the matrix product of the context vector and of the GCQM matrix.",
        "Recent work on FEMTI was devoted to develop new web-based interfaces as well as to define and implement an automatic tool that provides suggestions for relating contexts of use to quality characteristics, as described formally in the previous section (Estrella et al.",
        "2005).",
        "There are two interfaces to the framework, one for evaluators and one for experts.",
        "The evaluators' interface helps to generate MT evaluation plans based on a given context of use, offering significant improvement in terms of automation over the first version of FEMTI.",
        "The interface for experts is intended to help experts define the links in the GCQM between items in Part I and items in Part II, based on their own implicit knowledge of relevant quality characteristics, or on experience from previous evaluations.",
        "Experts can assign weights on the links as mentioned above, including the 'n/a' mention if a relation is hypothesized but its precise strength is not apparent to them (many links imported from the initial version of FEMTI are currently marked with 'n/a').",
        "The two interfaces to FEMTI are tightly related, since it is through the experts' interface that GCQMs are created, but it is in the evaluators interface that an averaged GCQM combining those created by experts is used.",
        "In the evaluators' interface, once an evaluator defines an intended context of use (represented internally as a vector), the scripts implementing the linking mechanism described in the previous section retrieve relevant links from the averaged GCQM and compute the relevant quality characteristics from Part II, which are highlighted by the interface.",
        "The last step in building a customized quality model consists of selecting the actual quality characteristics that will be evaluated among those proposed by FEMTI, and finally the corresponding metrics to measure them."

        "Evaluation of MT systems is a complex task to normalize, even with a user-friendly interface that automatically suggests relevant quality for an intended context of use.",
        "For many MT developers, evaluation remains a matter of measuring the \"quality\" of output text using reference-based metrics such as BLEU or human-based metrics such as accuracy/fluency.",
        "However, when evaluating software dedicated to real-life commercial applications, context-based evaluation cannot be avoided if optimal choices have to be made for large organizations, as the two following case studies show.",

        "GPHIN continuously gathers and disseminates multilingual information from newswire and web sites, which requires several MT subsystems or 'engines', which were carefully selected to ensure the success of the system as a whole.",
        "The requirements for these engines are very strict, given the mode of operation of GPHIN.",
        "In consequence, a list of important qualities that determine whether or not to incorporate a new MT engine into the system was defined, which includes robustness, high interoperability and ease of dictionary update.",
        "Robustness is a critical aspect, and no actual engine passed the stress tests, so a special module was developed to fix this issue.",
        "The GPHIN system proved to be very productive in monitoring and efficient in early detection of outbreaks, the most relevant case being the detection of a SARS outbreak almost three months in advance.",

        "The main quality attributes in this model were extracted from user feedback and include translation quality, usability, actual translation directions and supported file formats.",
