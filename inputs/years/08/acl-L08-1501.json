        "Some courses, such as IITC, due to their restricted size, have been totally transcribed, whereas for others, the orthographic transcription is not yet completed.",
        "Given the richness of this corpus for the study of a variety of speech phenomena, disfluencies in particular, a subset of the corpus, including around 2 hours from each course, was fully annotated at different levels.",
        "The multilayer manual annotation was done using the Wavesurfer tooland additional information obtained automatically is provided in compatible format.",
        "An enriched orthographic transcription (Snover et al., 2004) is crucial, not only to make the recognition output intelligible for readers (e.g. hearing impaired students), but also to facilitate the study and testing of automatic capitalization and punctuation methods.",
        "The first annotation tier contains, thus, the full transcription of what has been said by the teacher such as described above, enriched with punctuation marks.",
        "The use of punctuation was restricted, however, to full stop, comma, and question mark, in order to clearly distinguish declarative and interrogative sentence-like units, avoiding more complex and subjective punctuation markers.",
        "Disfluent sequences that may eventually be suppressed are delimited by angular brackets and their edges aligned with the speech signal.",
        "Those sequences are transposed to the disfluency tier, where more detailed analysis is provided.",
        "Segmentation marks were also inserted for regions in the audio file that were not further analysed.",
        "Those are delimited by square brackets and may correspond to changes in background noise, signal saturation, speech overlap, etc.",
        "Special attention has been given to the marking of students' comments and clarification requests, which are inaudible, given the recording conditions, but crucial to the written text readability.",
        "Other symbols at the left and right edge of the words were also added, to account for different types of phenomena and /or facilitate subsequent searches.",
        "Table 2 shows the complete list of used symbols.",
        "In previous studies for E.P.",
        "(Mata, 1999; Moniz, 2006), including our preliminary work on university lectures (Trancoso et al., 2006) only three basic forms have been found for filled pauses: an elongated central vowel only, a central vowel followed by a nasal murmur and a nasal murmur only, which have been orthographically coded as \"aa\", \"aam\" and \"mm\", respectively.",
        "More recent studies, however, (Moniz, et al., 2007) refer a strong speaker dependent variation in what the form and contextual distribution of filled pauses is concerned.",
        "While some speakers appear to use just one form in all contexts (a central vowel only), others may used the three forms and the quality of the vowel may also change according in function of the height of the previous word last vowel.",
        "In order to get a better insight into this type of variation, and also to distinguish between long and brief forms which appear to accomplish distinct functions, those were coded using the SAMPA alphabet for European Portuguese, preceded by \"%\".",
        "The annotation of disfluencies is provided in a separate tier (annotation file), closely following Shriberg (1994) and basically using the same set of labels, as shown in table 3.This annotation scheme, is based on Levelt's (1983) model and has been successfully used to train methods for the identification and automatic removal of disfluencies in order to produce clean readable texts (Shriberg, 2005 and references therein).",
        "It appears to be also the most adequate from a point of view of linguistic research as, in spite of some divergences, it is widely accepted that disfluencies have an internal structure and, three different regions at least, need to be consider in their analysis: (i) the reparandum, containing the linguistic materials to be repaired; (ii) the interregnum or temporal region of variable length which may contain filled or unfilled pauses, as well as editing terms; and (iii) the repair itself.",

        "In fact, although further work is needed in order to get a better insight into the specific behaviour of filled pauses and prolongations, results obtain so far support the view that both phenomena can be regarded as manifestations of planning effort at different levels of the prosodic structure and, therefore, considered to be in complementary distribution.",
        "Independent evidence for the treatment of prolongations at pair with other classes of disfluencies was also presented in Eklund (2004), whose results suggest language specific effects on their production and contextual distribution.",
