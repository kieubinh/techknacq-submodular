        "It is a widely accepted hypothesis that alcoholic intoxication as other factors such as fatigue, stress, illness influence the way a person speaks.",
        "Most people claim that they are capable of judging the state of intoxication of a known or unknown person by her speech even if they have never experienced the 'normal' speech of the same person.",
        "If this hypothesis is true, then",
        "• sub-hypothesis 1 : perception tests should reveal a nearly 100% detection of intoxication from the speech signal alone",
        "• sub-hypothesis 2 : it should be possible to detect the relevant features signaling intoxication from the speech signal automatically using methods of pattern recognition",
        "Quite a number of studies during the last decades have tried to investigate that hypothesis from different points of view: looking for reliable acoustic (Kunzel & Braun, 2003; Cooney et al., 1998) or behavioristic (Hollien et al., 2001; Behne et al., 1991; Sobell et al., 1982; Trojan & Kryspin-Exne, 1968) features that may indicate intoxication, studying the physiological effects of alcohol on the articulators (Watanabe et al., 1994) or even pursuing forensic questions (Kunzel & Braun, 2003; Braun, 1991; Klingholz et al., 1988; Martin & Yuchtman, 1986) such as in the infamous case of the captain of the Exxon Valdez (Johnson et al., 1990).",
        "To our knowledge up to this point nobody has ever seriously claimed to be able to detect the grade of intoxication from the speech signal by means of automatic methods.",
        "However, if we assume that such a method exists, it is vital for future work that a corpus of intoxicated speech that not only covers lab speech but speech from a possible real life situation as well is freely available to the scientific community.",

        "The possible range is between 0.5 and 2.5 .",
        "Using both Watson-and Widmark formula the amount of required alcohol for each person is estimated and converted into the corresponding amount of beer or wine the subject has to drink in order to reach her individual chosen BAC.",
        "After having consumed the estimated amount of alcohol within the maximum time period of one hour, the speaker has to wait another 20 minutes before undergoing two alcohol tests, a breath alcohol concentration (BRAC) test and a blood sample test.",
        "We use two different BRAC testers of the same technology: Drager Alcotest 7410, a pretest instrument with fuel cell as measuring principle and an internal conversion from mg/l BRAC to BAC, and an Envitec Alcotest, similar in construction.",
        "The BAC in is determined by Head-Space Gaschromatography as used in forensic analytics but without ADH-method averaging over repeat determination.",
        "Immediately after the tests, the speaker is asked to perform the ALC speech test which will last no longer than 15 minutes to avoid any significant changes (saturation, decomposition) of the measured blood alcohol level.",
        "At least two weeks later the speaker is required to undergo a second recording in sober condition, which takes about 30 minutes and includes two times as many prompts as the test in intoxicated condition.",
        "To factor out other influences, in both tests the speaker will be interviewed about any pathological or psychological events that may affect her speech.",
        "If any such factors are evident, the test is either postponed or the speaker is not admitted to ALC at all.",
        "The recordings take place in an automobile, to ensure the same acoustic environment for the different recording locations.",
        "The engine is switched off except for the application speech where the running engine creates a realistic ambience for control commands.",
        "The test is supervised by a member of the ALC staff, who at the same time acts as the conversational partner for the dialogues.",
        "The recordings are controlled with a laptop by the speaker herself where the respective task is prompted on the display.",

        "To give consideration to all questions listed in the introduction and to test the feasibility of realistic applications it is necessary to yield recordings of different types of speech, such as read speech, command speech, spontaneous monologues and dialogues.",
        "For the recordings in intoxicated condition the read speech part consists of five numbers (telephone, credit card), five addresses, two tongue twisters and three selected sentences of speech training (which for simplification are both referred to as tongue twisters in the following) and five control commands as being used in automobiles.",
        "While designing the read speech part there was paid great attention to the combination of sounds that have been reported as being prone to alcoholic intoxication (e.g. (Kunzel/Braun/Eysholdt, 1992)), such as the alveolar voiceless fricative alternating with the post-alveolar voiceless fricative, the alveolar voiceless plosive alternating with the velar voiceless plosive as well as all voiceless plosives alternating with their voiced counterparts.",
        "Spontaneous speech is covered by five control commands that must be formulated by the speaker herself following directions on screen (situational prompting (Mogele/Kaiser/Schiel, 2006)), three monologues and two dialogues with the recording supervisor, which are initiated by pictures and questions; the length of the monologues and dialogues is restricted to 60 sec each.",
        "Particularly the monologues and dialogues evoke rather spontaneous speech that comes fairly close to real-life-situations.",

        "No correlation between a rising error rate and the BAC across speakers could be found.",
        "Since the number of spoken words may differ between the two conditions (e.g. by repetition of words) tables 3 and 4 show the word normalized error rates for the tongue twisters and the addresses of the different groups omission, insertion, substitution and repetition for each gender and condition.",
