        "Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications.",
        "In our work, T is a textual unit that is typically made up of one or more sentences while H usually contains one simpler sentence.",
        "This is based on the logical assumption that T must enclose more information than H in order to entail it.",
        "We say that T entails H if and only if the meaning of H can be inferred from the meaning of T. Our corpus dataset consists of 600 TH pairs equally divided in three subsets each one representing the output of a certain application.",
        "Each portion of the dataset intends to include TH examples that correspond to success and failure cases of the actual applications.",
        "The applications chosen for the needs of the current work are: Question Answering (QA), Comparable Documents (CD) and Machine Translation (MT).",
        "Moreover, since the applications at hand are, in most cases, domain-oriented, we initially opted for gathering textual data pertaining to specific subject fields (i.e., law, politics, travel, etc).",
        "However, our intention was to build an up-to-date resource, which would cover as many thematic domains as possible, and therefore, the corpus was further enriched with texts representing general language.",
        "Raw data have been manually annotated for Textual Entailment.",
        "Each TH pair appears within a single <pair> element, with the following attributes:",
        "♦ id: a numeral identifier, unique for each TH pair.",

        "♦ domain: the specific subject field that the initial documents pertain to.",
        "Possible values in the present implementation are \"law\", \"politics\", travel\", \"finance\", \"sports\", \"culture\", and \"general\".",

        "Selection of appropriate applications was the starting point for the development of the GTEC.",
        "Corpus development with a view to RTE was systematically tackled for the first time in the PASCAL Challenge Workshops.",
        "In this framework, textual data were collected corresponding to NLP applications for which RTE was considered a significant element.",
        "To this end, RTE 1 datasets pertained to seven applications: Information Retrieval (IR), Comparable Documents (CD), Reading Comprehension (RC), Question Answering (QA), Information Extraction (IE), Machine Translation (MT), and Paraphrase Acquisition (PP).",
        "The results of the first challenge led to the reduction of the applications under study in subsequent challenges, by eliminating the applications that rendered the best results.",
        "Therefore, consecutive Challenges (RTE 2 and RTE 3) catered only for IR, QA, IE, and Summarization (SUM).",
        "The latter was added as an application relative to CD, yet quite distinct from it, since a machine's output was compared to a text that was produced manually.",
        "With the above considerations taken into account and on the basis of the similarity that some of the above applications appear to have, the GTEC was collected with respect to three different text processing applications: QA, CD, and MT.",
        "More precisely, we clustered the above eight applications into two separate groups based on the theoretical assumption that (a) the first group (comprising IR, IE, and QA) has roughly to do with extraction of information either in the form of a sentence or as a template filling procedure, while (b) the second group (that comprises CD, RC, SUM, PP, and MT) has comparable corpora creation as a common denominator.",
        "Regarding the first group, we focused on QA on the basis of observations of the RTE datasets, according to which QA pairs are similar to those pertaining to the IR and IE tasks, while, at the same time, they are the most representative ones.",
        "Furthermore, CD and MT were chosen as the most representative applications of the second group with MT further engaging the rather strict notion of parallel documents.",
        "The dataset was then, manually, collected separately for each application.",
        "Candidate TH pairs pertaining to the CD task were selected from a variety of sources: (a) proper comparable documents, (b) texts and their summaries, and (c) news headlines.",
        "Different methodologies were employed accordingly.",
        "A cluster of comparable news articles pertaining to politics, economics, sports, culture etc.",
        "referring to the same topic or subject matter were initially collected from online sources (electronic newspaper or magazine editions, portals, etc.).",
        "These were further coupled with existing comparable documents that were collected at the Institute for Language and Speech Processing in the framework of national and EU-funded projects.",
        "Once the cluster of comparable documents was intact, selection of the candidate T and H pairs was performed with manual alignment of sentences that present high lexical similarity (overlap).",
        "Similarly, TH pairs pertinent to the CD dataset were extracted from texts and their corresponding summaries on the basis of the assumption that a text and its summary consist a pair of comparable documents.",
        "To this end, a number of online texts and their summaries were collected from online resources, and the TH pairs were extracted by applying sentence alignment methods on the basis of lexical overlap (Table 1).",

        "Finally, the so-called title-lead paragraph technique, proposed in the literature was also exploited (see Table 2).",
        "Based on the observation that the title of a news article is most of the times a partial paraphrase of the first paragraph, conveying thus a comparable meaning, (Bayer et al., 2005) proved it to be a fruitful methodology for automatically acquiring training data that are sufficient for large-scale statistical models.",
        "To this end, we collected a number of news stories from various web sites, and their titles and corresponding lead paragraphs were extracted forming the H and T text fragments of the candidate pairs respectively.",
        "The T and H pairs for the MT setting were selected from alternative translations of the same source document, that is, human translations as opposed to translations produced automatically.",
        "The methodology adopted involved (a) the manual inspection of a variety of multilingual web sites that pertain to the domains of interest, and (b) the identification of candidate sources for the collection of parallel English - Greek documents.",
        "The requirement to be met was that the source documents should be in English, whereas the Greek texts should be produced by human translators.",
        "This approach differs from the one followed in the RTE challenges, since the two text fragments are translations of a unique source text and not translations of different but comparable text sources as in the RTE.",
        "In this way, we believe that we are closer to an MT evaluation scenario.",
        "The website of the European Union proved to be an invaluable source with this respect.",
        "Once the documents were collected, the English text was translated into Greek via the SYSTRAN1 translation engine.",
        "The T and H pairs for the MT dataset were then selected from the sentence aligned human and machine translations (see Table 3).",
        "Since in the MT setting, however, both T and H are translations of the same text fragment, they should ideally express the same meaning regardless of differences in surface structure.",
        "Practically, whether entailment holds or not, depends on these differences.",
        "Moreover, pairs in the MT dataset that were judged as true seemed to exhibit a relationship broader than entailment.",
        "Since T and H fragments are, to a large extent, paraphrases of each other, semantic equivalence seemed more appropriate for this task.",
        "This observation resulted into an apparent deviation from the official RTE guidelines, as we started wondering about which of the two translations (human or machine) should consist the T text fragment and which the H one.",
        "We thus decided to examine both options by including in the MT dataset 100 pairs with T being the machine translation and H the human one (Tmachine -> Hhuman) while another 100 pairs were added where T and H were the human and machine translations respectively (Thuman Hmachine).",
        "Annotators' judgments showed that in the MT task, textual entailment was conceived to be bidirectional, that is, T and H fragments have to entail each other, for a machine translation to be considered acceptable.",
        "Lack of relevant systems, capable of providing true and false entailment pairs with respect to the task at hand, forced us to adopt manual selection of the QA dataset.",
        "The process consisted in three stages.",
        "Initially, a set of quizzes found over the Internet was chosen to serve as an appropriate source for extracting questions that could be fed as an input to a QA system.",
        "From the initial 500 questions, a subset of 200 questions was finally selected, that were either factual, or relative to definitions.",
        "Moreover, the answers to the selected questions had to be relevant to entities such as persons, temporal or local complements etc.",
        "At the next stage, following the official RTE specifications, the questions selected were turned into affirmative sentences with the correct answer \"plugged in\", thus forming the H text fragments.",
        "Finally, l www.",
        "sy stran.com keywords of the H text fragments were identified (mainly names of persons, locations, and organizations) and were subsequently used for querying using Google.",
        "The answers returned to the set of queries corresponding to each H text fragment formed a pool from which the most appropriate text segment T was extracted.",
        "Two selection criteria were taken into account: (a) T should contain the answer either as its main proposition or as a dependent one, and (b) T should exhibit some sort of lexical or syntactic similarity with H (Table 4).",

        "To cope with the fact that high word overlap between T and H is not always a positive evidence for textual entailment, and since the appropriate lexical resources, such as WordNet, FrameNet, etc, are either sparse or non-existent for the Greek language, we opted for a system, which takes into account not only word overlap but also further lexical evidence such as lexical paraphrases, syntactic structure similarity based on dependency relations and shallow semantic analysis.",
        "Initially, the system uses extended lexical resources for spotting synonyms, antonyms and identifying structures in T and H sharing the same semantic content.",
        "Paraphrase acquisition is further enhanced with limited pattern recognition and the application of appropriate transformations.",
        "Where no other lexical relation is found, the system makes use of latent semantic analysis in order to assign scores or penalties accordingly.",
        "Finally, the system makes use of syntactic labels and dependency relations among constituents for the final estimation of similarity among T and H structures.",
        "Basically, our system \"rewards\" lexical similarity only when syntactic equivalence is also attested.",
        "The system is currently under development.",
        "System performance was evaluated with the Precision and Recall metrics.",
        "Initial results show that a system, which takes syntactic analysis into consideration, can achieve satisfactory results.",
        "More precisely, the accuracy of the system reaches 67%, while recall amounts to 87%.",
