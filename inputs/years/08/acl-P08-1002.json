        "The goal of coreference resolution is to determine which noun phrases in a document refer to the same real-world entity.",
        "As part of this task, coreference resolution systems must decide which pronouns refer to preceding noun phrases (called antecedents) and which do not.",
        "In particular, a long-standing challenge has been to correctly classify instances of the English pronoun it.",
        "Consider the sentences:",
        "(1) You can make it in advance.",
        "(2) You can make it in Hollywood.",
        "In sentence (1), it is an anaphoric pronoun referring to some previous noun phrase, like \"the sauce\" or \"an appointment.\"",
        "In sentence (2), it is part of the idiomatic expression \"make it\" meaning \"succeed.\"",
        "A coreference resolution system should find an antecedent for the first it but not the second.",
        "Pronouns that do not refer to preceding noun phrases are called non-anaphoric or non-referential pronouns.",
        "The word it is one of the most frequent words in the English language, accounting for about 1% of tokens in text and over a quarter of all third-person pronouns.",
        "Usually between a quarter and a half of it instances are non-referential (e.g.",
        "Section 4, Table 3).",
        "As with other pronouns, the preceding discourse can affect it's interpretation.",
        "For example, sentence (2) can be interpreted as referential if the preceding sentence is \"You want to make a movie?\"",
        "We show, however, that we can reliably classify a pronoun as being referential or non-referential based solely on the local context surrounding the pronoun.",
        "We do this by turning the context into patterns and enumerating all the words that can take the place of it in these patterns.",
        "For sentence (1), we can extract the context pattern \"make * in advance\" and for sentence (2) \"make * in Hollywood,\" where \"*\" is a wildcard that can be filled by any token.",
        "Non-referential distributions tend to have the word it filling the wildcard position.",
        "Referential distributions occur with many other noun phrase fillers.",
        "For example, in our n-gram collection (Section 3.4), \"make it in advance\" and \"make them in advance\" occur roughly the same number of times (442 vs. 449), indicating a referential pattern.",
        "In contrast, \"make it in Hollywood\" occurs 3421 times while \"make them in Hollywood\" does not occur at all.",
        "These simple counts strongly indicate whether another noun can replace the pronoun.",
        "Thus we can computationally distinguish between a) pronouns that refer to nouns, and b) all other instances: including those that have no antecedent, like sentence (2),",
        "'e.g.",
        "http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/bncfreq/flists.html",
        "and those that refer to sentences, clauses, or implied topics of discourse.",
        "Beyond the practical value of this distinction, Section 3 provides some theoretical justification for our binary classification.",
        "Section 3 also shows how to automatically extract and collect counts for context patterns, and how to combine the information using a machine learned classifier.",
        "Section 4 describes our data for learning and evaluation, It-Bank: a set of over three thousand labelled instances of the pronoun it from a variety of text sources.",
        "Section 4 also explains our comparison approaches and experimental methodology.",
        "Section 5 presents our results, including an interesting comparison of our system to human classification given equivalent segments of context."

        "The difficulty of non-referential pronouns has been acknowledged since the beginning of computational resolution of anaphora.",
        "Hobbs (1978) notes his algorithm does not handle pronominal references to sentences nor cases where it occurs in time or weather expressions.",
        "Hirst (1981, page 17) emphasizes the importance of detecting non-referential pronouns, \"lest precious hours be lost in bootless searches for textual referents.\"",
        "Muller (2006) summarizes the evolution of computational approaches to non-referential it detection.",
        "In particular, note the pioneering work of Paice and Husk (1987), the inclusion of non-referential it detection in a full anaphora resolution system by Lappin and Leass (1994), and the machine learning approach of Evans (2001).",
        "There has recently been renewed interest in non-referential pronouns, driven by three primary sources.",
        "First of all, research in coreference resolution has shown the benefits of modules for general noun anaphoricity determination (Ng and Cardie, 2002; Denis and Baldridge, 2007).",
        "Unfortunately, these studies handle pronouns inadequately; judging from the decision trees and performance figures, Ng and Cardie (2002)'s system treats all pronouns as anaphoric by default.",
        "Secondly, while most pronoun resolution evaluations simply exclude non-referential pronouns, recent unsupervised approaches (Cherry and Bergsma, 2005; Haghighi and Klein, 2007) must deal with all pronouns in unrestricted text, and therefore need robust modules to automatically handle non-referential instances.",
        "Finally, reference resolution has moved beyond written text into in spoken dialog.",
        "Here, non-referential pronouns are pervasive.",
        "Eckert and Strube (2000) report that in the Switchboard corpus, only 45% of demonstratives and third-person pronouns have a noun phrase antecedent.",
        "Handling the common non-referential instances is thus especially vital.",
        "One issue with systems for non-referential detection is the amount of language-specific knowledge that must be encoded.",
        "Consider a system that jointly performs anaphora resolution and word alignment in parallel corpora for machine translation.",
        "For this task, we need to identify non-referential anaphora in multiple languages.",
        "It is not always clear to what extent the features and modules developed for English systems apply to other languages.",
        "For example, the detector of Lappin and Leass (1994) labels a pronoun as non-referential if it matches one of several syntactic patterns, including: \"It is Cogv-ed that Sentence,\" where Cogv is a \"cognitive verb\" such as recommend, think, believe, know, anticipate, etc.",
        "Porting this approach to a new language would require not only access to a syntactic parser and a list of cognitive verbs in that language, but the development of new patterns to catch non-referential pronoun uses that do not exist in English.",
        "Moreover, writing a set of rules to capture this phenomenon is likely to miss many less-common uses.",
        "Alternatively, recent machine-learning approaches leverage a more general representation of a pronoun instance.",
        "For example, Muller (2006) has a feature for \"distance to next complementizer (that, if, whether)\" and features for the tokens and part-of-speech tags of the context words.",
        "Unfortunately, there is still a lot of implicit and explicit English-specific knowledge needed to develop these features, including, for example, lists of \"seem\" verbs such as appear, look, mean, happen.",
        "Similarly, the machine-learned system of Boyd et al.",
        "(2005) uses a set of \"idiom patterns\" like \"on the face ofit\" that trigger binary features if detected in the pronoun context.",
        "Although machine learned systems can flexibly balance the various indicators and contra-indicators of non-referentiality, a particular feature is only useful if it is relevant to an example in limited labelled training data.",
        "Our approach avoids hand-crafting a set of specific indicator features; we simply use the distribution of the pronoun's context.",
        "Our method is thus related to previous work based on Harris (1985)'s distributional hypothesis.",
        "It has been used to determine both word and syntactic path similarity (Hin-dle, 1990; Lin, 1998a; Lin and Pantel, 2001).",
        "Our work is part of a trend of extracting other important information from statistical distributions.",
        "Dagan and Itai (1990) use the distribution of a pronoun's context to determine which candidate antecedents can fit the context.",
        "Bergsma and Lin (2006) determine the likelihood of coreference along the syntactic path connecting a pronoun to a possible antecedent, by looking at the distribution of the path in text.",
        "These approaches, like ours, are ways to inject sophisticated \"world knowledge\" into anaphora resolution."

        "Our approach distinguishes contexts where pronouns cannot be replaced by a preceding noun phrase (non-noun-referential) from those where nouns can occur (noun-referential).",
        "Although coref-erence evaluations, such as the MUC (1997) tasks, also make this distinction, it is not necessarily used by all researchers.",
        "Evans (2001), for example, distinguishes between \"clause anaphoric\" and \"pleonastic\" as in the following two instances:",
        "(3) The paper reported that it had snowed.",
        "It was obvious.",
        "(clause anaphoric) (4) It was obvious that it had snowed.",
        "(pleonastic)",

        "From our perspective, this interpretation is somewhat arbitrary.",
        "One could also say that the It in both cases refers to the clause \"that it had snowed.\"",
        "Indeed, annotation experiments using very fine-grained categories show low annotation reliability (Muller, 2006).",
        "On the other hand, there is no debate over the importance nor the definition of distinguishing pronouns that refer to nouns from those that do not.",
        "We adopt this distinction for our work, and show it has good inter-annotator reliability (Section 4.1).",
        "We henceforth refer to non-noun-referential simply as non-referential, and thus consider the word It in both sentences (3) and (4) as non-referential.",
        "Non-referential pronouns are widespread in natural language.",
        "The es in the German \"Wie geht es Ihnen\" and the il in the French \"S'il vous plait\" are both non-referential.",
        "In pro-drop languages that may omit subject pronouns, there remains the question of whether an omitted pronoun is referential (Zhao and Ng, 2007).",
        "Although we focus on the English pronoun it, our approach should differentiate any words that have both a structural and a referential role in language, e.g. words like this, there and that (Muller, 2007).",
        "We believe a distributional approach could also help in related tasks like identifying the generic use of you (Gupta et al., 2007).",
        "Our method extracts the context surrounding a pronoun and determines which other words can take the place of the pronoun in the context.",
        "The extracted segments of context are called context patterns.",
        "The words that take the place of the pronoun are called pattern fillers.",
        "We gather pattern fillers from a large collection of n-gram frequencies.",
        "The maximum size of a context pattern depends on the size of n-grams available in the data.",
        "In our n-gram collection (Section 3.4), the lengths of the n-grams range from unigrams to 5-grams, so our maximum pattern size is five.",
        "For a particular pronoun in text, there are five possible 5-grams that span the pronoun.",
        "For example, in the following instance of it: ... said here Thursday that it is unnecessary to continue ... We can extract the following 5-gram patterns: said here Thursday that * here Thursday that * is",
        "Thursday that * is unnecessary that * is unnecessary to",
        "* is unnecessary to continue Similarly, we extract the four 4-gram patterns.",
        "Shorter n-grams were not found to improve performance on development data and hence are not extracted.",
        "We only use context within the current sentence (including the beginning-of-sentence and end-of-sentence tokens) so if a pronoun occurs near a sentence boundary, some patterns may be missing.",
        "We take a few steps to improve generality.",
        "We change the patterns to lower-case, convert sequences of digits to the # symbol, and run the Porter stem-mer (Porter, 1980).",
        "To generalize rare names, we convert capitalized words longer than five characters to a special NE tag.",
        "We also added a few simple rules to stem the irregular verbs be, have, do, and said, and convert the common contractions 'nt, 's, 'm, 're, 've, 'd, and 'll to their most likely stem.",
        "We do the same processing to our n-gram corpus.",
        "We then find all n-grams matching our patterns, allowing any token to match the wildcard in place of it.",
        "Also, other pronouns in the pattern are allowed to match a corresponding pronoun in an n-gram, regardless of differences in inflection and class.",
        "We now discuss how to use the distribution of pattern fillers.",
        "For identifying non-referential it in English, we are interested in how often it occurs as a pattern filler versus other nouns.",
        "However, determining part-of-speech in a large n-gram corpus is not simple, nor would it easily extend to other languages.",
        "Instead, we gather counts for five different classes of words that fill the wildcard position, easily determined by string match (Table 1).",
        "The third-person plural they (#2) reliably occurs in patterns where referential it also resides.",
        "The occurrence of any other pronoun (#3) guarantees that at the very least the pattern filler is a noun.",
        "A match with the infrequent word token (UNK) (#4) (explained in Section 3.4) will likely be a noun because nouns account for a large proportion of rare words in a corpus.",
        "Gathering any other token (#5) also mostly finds nouns; inserting another part-of-speech usually",
        "Table 2: 5-gram context patterns and pattern-filler counts for the Section 3.2 example.",
        "results in an unlikely, ungrammatical pattern.",
        "Table 2 gives the stemmed context patterns for our running example.",
        "It also gives the n-gram counts of pattern fillers matching the first four filler types (there were no matches of the (UNK) type, #4).",
        "There are many possible ways to use the above counts.",
        "Intuitively, our method should identify as non-referential those instances that have a high proportion of fillers of type #1 (i.e., the word it), while labelling as referential those with high counts for other types of fillers.",
        "We would also like to leverage the possibility that some of the patterns may be more predictive than others, depending on where the wildcard lies in the pattern.",
        "For example, in Table 2, the cases where the it-position is near the beginning of the pattern best reflect the non-referential nature of this instance.",
        "We can achieve these aims by ordering the counts in a feature vector, and using a labelled set of training examples to learn a classifier that optimally weights the counts.",
        "For classification, we define non-referential as positive and referential as negative.",
        "Our feature representation very much resembles Table 2.",
        "For each of the five 5-gram patterns, ordered by the position of the wildcard, we have features for the logarithm of counts for filler types #1, #2, ... #5.",
        "Similarly, for each of the four 4-gram patterns, we provide the log-counts corresponding to types #1, #2, ... #5 as well.",
        "Before taking the logarithm, we smooth the counts by adding a fixed number to all observed values.",
        "We also provide, for each pattern, a feature that indicates if the pattern is not available because the it-position would cause the pattern to span beyond the current sentence.",

      "text": [
        "We have presented an approach to detecting non-referential pronouns in text based on the distribution of the pronoun's context.",
        "The approach is simple to implement, attains state-of-the-art results, and should be easily ported to otherlanguages.",
        "Ourtech-nique demonstrates how large volumes of data can be used to gather world knowledge for natural language processing.",
        "A consequence of this research was the creation of It-Bank, a collection of thousands of labelled examples of the pronoun it, which will benefit other coreference resolution researchers.",
        "Error analysis reveals that our system is getting good leverage out of the pronoun context, achieving results comparable to human performance given equivalent information.",
        "To boost performance further, we will need to incorporate information from preceding discourse.",
        "Future research will also test the distributional classification of other ambiguous pronouns, like this, you, there, and that.",
        "Another avenue of study will look at the interaction between coreference resolution and machine translation.",
        "For example, if a single form in English (e.g. that) is separated into different meanings in another language (e.g., Spanish demonstrative ese, nominal reference ese, abstract or statement reference eso, and complementizer que), then aligned examples provide automatically-disambiguated English data.",
        "We could extract context patterns and collect statistics from these examples like in our current approach.",
        "In general, jointly optimizing translation and coref-erence is an exciting and largely unexplored research area, now partly enabled by our portable non-referential detection methodology."
