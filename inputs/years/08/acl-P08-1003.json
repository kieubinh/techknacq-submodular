        "Current methods for large-scale information extraction take advantage of unstructured text available from either Web documents (Banko et al., 2007; Snow et al., 2006) or, more recently, logs of Web search queries (Pa§ca, 2007) to acquire useful knowledge with minimal supervision.",
        "Given a manually-specified target attribute (e.g., birth years for people) and starting from as few as 10 seed facts such as (e.g., John Lennon, 1941), as many as a million facts of the same type can be derived from unstructured text within Web documents (Pa§ca et al., 2006).",
        "Similarly, given a manually-specified target class (e.g., Drug) with its instances (e.g., Vi-codin and Xanax) and starting from as few as 5 seed attributes (e.g., side effects and maximum dose for Drug), other relevant attributes can be extracted for the same class from query logs (Pa§ca, 2007).",
        "These and other previous methods require the manual specification of the input classes of instances before any knowledge (e.g., facts or attributes) can be acquired for those classes.",
        "'Contributions made during an internship at Google.",
        "The extraction method introduced in this paper mines a collection of Web search queries and a collection of Web documents to acquire open-domain classes in the form of instance sets (e.g., {whales, seals, dolphins, sea lions,...}) associated with class labels (e.g., marine animals), as well as large sets ofopen-domain attributes for each class (e.g., circulatory system, life cycle, evolution, food chain and scientific name for the class marine animals).",
        "In this light, the contributions of this paper are fourfold.",
        "First, instead of separately addressing the tasks of collecting unlabeled sets of instances (Lin, 1998), assigning appropriate class labels to a given set of instances (Pantel and Ravichandran, 2004), and identifying relevant attributes for a given set of classes (Pa§ca, 2007), our integrated method from Section 2 enables the simultaneous extraction of class instances, associated labels and attributes.",
        "Second, by exploiting the contents of query logs during the extraction of labeled classes of instances from Web documents, we acquire thousands (4,583, to be exact) of open-domain classes covering a wide range of topics and domains.",
        "The accuracy reported in Section 3.2 exceeds 80% for both instance sets and class labels, although the extraction of classes requires a remarkably small amount of supervision, in the form of only a few commonly-used Is-A extraction patterns.",
        "Third, we conduct the first study in extracting attributes for thousands of open-domain, automatically-acquired classes, at precision levels over 70% at rank 10, and 67% at rank 20 as described in Section 3.3.",

        "In comparison, the approach ofthis paper pursues a more aggressive goal, by extracting a larger and more diverse number of labeled classes, whose instances are often more difficult to extract than country names and most company names, at precision scores of almost 80%.",

        "Our evaluation of the accuracy of class instances is again stricter, since the evaluation sample is larger, and includes more varied classes, whose instances are sometimes more difficult to identify in text.",
        "Previous work on the automatic acquisition of attributes for open-domain classes from text is less general than the extraction method and experiments presented in our paper.",
        "Indeed, previous evaluations were restricted to small sets of classes (forty classes in (Pa§ca, 2007)), whereas our evaluations also consider a random, more diverse sample of open-domain classes.",
        "More importantly, by dropping the requirement of manually providing a small set of seed attributes for each target class, and relying on only a few seed attributes specified for one reference class, we harvest class attributes without the need of first determining what the classes should be, what instances they should contain, and from which resources the instances should be collected."

        "In a departure from previous approaches to large-scale information extraction from unstructured text on the Web, this paper introduces a weakly-supervised extraction framework for mining useful knowledge from a combination of both documents and search query logs.",
        "In evaluations over labeled classes of instances extracted without a-priori restrictions to specific domains of interest and with very little supervision, the accuracy exceeds 90% for class labels, approaches 80% for class instances, and exceeds 70% (at rank 10) and 67% (at rank 20) for class attributes.",
        "Current work aims at expanding the number of instances within each class while retaining similar precision levels; extracting attributes with more consistent precision scores across classes from different domains; and introducing confidence scores in attribute extraction, allowing for the detection of classes for which it is unlikely to extract large numbers of useful attributes from text."
