        "Statistical machine translation (SMT) is complicated by the fact that words can move during translation.",
        "If one assumes arbitrary movement is possible, that alone is sufficient to show the problem to be NP-complete (Knight, 1999).",
        "Syntactic cohesion is the notion that all movement occurring during translation can be explained by permuting children in a parse tree (Fox, 2002).",
        "Equivalently, one can say that phrases in the source, defined by subtrees in its parse, remain contiguous after translation.",
        "Early",
        "* Work conducted while at the University of Alberta.",
        "We use the term \"syntactic cohesion\" throughout this paper to mean what has previously been referred to as \"phrasal cohesion\", because the non-linguistic sense of \"phrase\" has become so common in machine translation literature.",
        "methods for syntactic SMT held to this assumption in its entirety (Wu, 1997; Yamada and Knight, 2001).",
        "These approaches were eventually superseded by tree transducers and tree substitution grammars, which allow translation events to span subtree units, providing several advantages, including the ability to selectively produce uncohesive translations (Eisner, 2003; Graehl and Knight, 2004; Quirk et al., 2005).",
        "What may have been forgotten during this transition is that there is a reason it was once believed that a cohesive translation model would work: for some language pairs, cohesion explains nearly all translation movement.",
        "Fox (2002) showed that cohesion is held in the vast majority of cases for English-French, while Cherry and Lin (2006) have shown it to be a strong feature for word alignment.",
        "We attempt to use this strong, but imperfect, characterization of movement to assist a non-syntactic translation method: phrase-based SMT.",
        "Phrase-based decoding (Koehn et al., 2003) is a dominant formalism in statistical machine translation.",
        "Contiguous segments of the source are translated and placed in the target, which is constructed from left to right.",
        "The process iterates within a beam search until each word from the source has been covered by exactly one phrasal translation.",
        "Candidate translations are scored by a linear combination of models, weighted according to Minimum Error",
        "Rate Training or MERT (Och, 2003).",
        "Phrasal SMT draws strength from being able to memorize non-compositional and context-specific translations, as well as local reorderings.",
        "Its primary weakness is in movement modeling; its default distortion model applies a flat penalty to any deviation from source order, forcing the decoder to rely heavily on its language model.",
        "Recently, a number of data-driven distortion models, based on lexical features and relative distance, have been proposed to compensate for this",
        "Onaizan and Papineni, 2006; Kuhn et al., 2006).",
        "There have been a number of proposals to incorporate syntactic information into phrasal decoding.",
        "Early experiments with syntactically-informed phrases (Koehn et al., 2003), and syntactic re-ranking of K-best lists (Och et al., 2004) produced mostly negative results.",
        "The most successful attempts at syntax-enhanced phrasal SMT have directly targeted movement modeling: Zens et al.",
        "(2004) modified a phrasal decoder with ITG constraints, while a number of researchers have employed syntax-driven source reordering before decoding begins (Xia and McCord, 2004; Collins et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2007).",
        "We attempt something between these two approaches: our constraint is derived from a linguistic parse tree, but it is used inside the decoder, not as a preprocessing step.",
        "We begin in Section 2 by defining syntactic cohesion so it can be applied to phrasal decoder output.",
        "Section 3 describes how to add both hard and soft cohesion constraints to a phrasal decoder.",

        "Previous approaches to measuring the cohesion of a sentence pair have worked with a word alignment (Fox, 2002; Lin and Cherry, 2003).",
        "This alignment is used to project the spans of subtrees from the source tree onto the target sentence.",
        "If a modifier and its head, or two modifiers of the same head, have overlapping spans in the projection, then this indicates a cohesion violation.",
        "To check phrasal translations for cohesion violations, we need a way to project the source tree onto the decoder's output.",
        "Fortunately, each phrase used to create the target sentence can be tracked back to its original source phrase, providing an alignment between source and target phrases.",
        "Since each source token is used exactly once during translation, we can transform this phrasal alignment into a word-to-phrase alignment, where each source token is linked to a target phrase.",
        "We can then project the source subtree spans onto the target phrase sequence.",
        "Note that we never consider individual tokens on the target side, as their connection to the source tree is obscured by the phrasal abstraction that occurred during translation.",
        "Let em be the input source sentence, and /f be the output target phrase sequence.",
        "Our word-to-phrase alignment ai £ [1,p], 1 < i < m, maps a source token position i to a target phrase position e^.",
        "Next, we introduce our source dependency tree T. Each source token ei is also a node in T. We define T(e^) to be the subtree of T rooted at e^.",
        "We define a local tree to be a head node and its immediate modifiers.",
        "With this notation in place, we can define our projected spans.",
        "Following Lin and Cherry (2003), we define a head span to be the projection of a single token ei onto the target phrase sequence:",
        "and the subtree span to be the projection of the subtree rooted at ei:",
        "Consider the simple phrasal translation shown in Figure 1 along with a dependency tree for the English source.",
        "If we examine the local tree rooted at likes, we get the following projected spans:",
        "For any local tree, we consider only the head span of the head, and the subtree spans of any modifiers.",
        "Typically, cohesion would be determined by checking these projected spans for intersection.",
        "However, at this level of resolution, avoiding intersection becomes highly restrictive.",
        "The monotone translation in Figure 1 would become non-cohesive: nobody intersects with both its sibling pay and with its head likes at phrase index 1.",

        "Restricting phrases to syntactic constituents has been shown to harm performance (Koehn et al., 2003), so we tighten our definition of a violation to disregard cases where the only point of overlap is obscured by our phrasal resolution.",
        "To do so, we replace span intersection with a new notion of span innersection.",
        "Assume we have two spans [u, v] and [x, y] that have been sorted so that [u, v] < [x, y] lexicographically.",
        "We say that the two spans innersect if and only if x < v. So, [1, 3] and [2, 4] innersect, while [1, 3] and [3, 4] do not.",
        "One can think of innersection as intersection, minus the cases where the two spans share only a single boundary point, where x = v. When two projected spans innersect, it indicates that the second syntactic constituent must begin before the first ends.",
        "If the two spans in question correspond to nodes in the same local tree, innersection indicates an unambiguous cohesion violation.",
        "Under this definition, the translation in Figure 1 is cohesive, as none of its spans innersect.",
        "Our hope is that syntactic cohesion will help the decoder make smarter distortion decisions.",
        "An example with distortion is shown in Figure 2.",
        "In this case, we present two candidate French translations of an English sentence, assuming there is no entry in the phrase table for \"voting session.\"",
        "Because the proper French construction is \"session of voting\", the decoder has to move voting after session using a distortion operation.",
        "Figure 2 shows two methods to do so, each using an equal numbers of phrases.",
        "The projected spans for the local tree rooted at begins in each candidate are shown in Table 1.",
        "Note the innersection between the head begins and its modifier session in (b).",
        "Thus, a cohesion-aware system would receive extra guidance to select (a), which maintains the original meaning much better than (b).",
        "A first attempt at using cohesion to improve SMT output would be to apply our definition as a filter on K-best lists.",
        "That is, we could have a phrasal decoder output a 1000-best list, and return the highest-ranked cohesive translation to the user.",
        "We tested this approach on our English-French development set, and saw no improvement in BLEU score.",
        "Error analysis revealed that only one third of the un-cohesive translations had a cohesive alternative in their 1000-best lists.",
        "In order to reach the remaining two thirds, we need to constrain the decoder's search space to explore only cohesive translations."

        "To create a such a check, we need to detect a cohesion violation inside a partial translation hypothesis.",
        "We cannot directly apply our span-based cohesion definition, because our word-to-phrase alignment is not yet complete.",
        "However, we can still detect violations, and we can do so before the spans involved are completely translated.",

        "We can say that the translation of b interrupts the translation of a.",
        "We can enforce cohesion by ensuring that these interruptions never happen.",

        "Since we have yet to cover voting, we know that the projected span of T(session) will end at some index v > 2, creating an innersection.",
        "This eliminates the hypothesis after having proposed only the first two phrases.",
        "In this section, we formally define an interruption, and present an algorithm to detect one during decoding.",
        "During both discussions, we represent each target phrase as a set that contains the English tokens used in its translation: f j = [ei\\ai = j}.",
        "Formally, an interruption occurs whenever the decoder would add a phrase fh+1 to the hypothesis fh, and:",
        "The key to checking for interruptions quickly is knowing which subtrees T(r) to check for qualities (1:a,b,c).",

        "Only open subtrees can lead to interruptions.",

        "Furthermore, we need only consider subtrees that contain the left and rightmost source tokens eL and eR translated by fh.",
        "Since f h was created from a contiguous string of source tokens, any distinct subtree between these two endpoints will be completed within fh.",
        "Finally, for each of these focus points eL and eR, only the highest containing subtree T(r) that does not completely contain fh+1 needs to be considered.",
        "Anything higher would contain all of fh+1, and would not satisfy requirement (1:b) of our interruption definition.",
        "Any lower subtree would be a descendant of r, and therefore the check for the lower subtree is subsumed by the check for T(r).",
        "This leaves only two subtrees, highlighted in our running example in Figure 3c.",
        "With this analysis in place, an extension fh+1 of the hypothesis fh can be checked for interruptions with Algorithm 1.",
        "Step (i) in this algorithm finds an ancestor r such that T(r) completely contains",
        "session commence session de vote débute demai n",

        "It would then check T(session) for coverage in f. Since voting £ T(session) is not covered in f, it would detect an interruption.",
        "Walking up the tree takes at most linear time, and each check to see if T(r) contains all of fh+1can be performed in constant time, provided the source spans of each subtree have been precomputed.",
        "Checking to see if all of T(r) has been covered in Step (ii) takes at most linear time.",

        "Therefore, we propose a soft version of our cohesion constraint.",
        "We perform our interruption check, but we do not invalidate any hypotheses.",
        "Instead, each hypothesis maintains a count of the number of extensions that have caused interruptions during its construction.",
        "This count becomes a feature in the decoder's log-linear model, the weight of which is trained with MERT.",
        "After the first interruption, the exact meaning of further interruptions becomes difficult to interpret; but the interruption count does provide a useful estimate of the extent to which the translation is faithful to the source tree structure.",
        "Initially, we were not certain to what extent this feature would be used by the MERT module, as BLEU is not always sensitive to syntactic improvements.",
        "However, trained with our French-English tuning set, the interruption count received the largest absolute feature weight, indicating, at the very least, that the feature is worth scaling to impact decoder.",
        "We modify the Moses decoder (Koehn et al., 2007) to translate head-annotated sentences.",

        "Examining the French translations produced by our cohesion constrained phrasal decoder, we can draw some qualitative generalizations.",
        "The constraint is used primarily to prevent distortion: it provides an intelligent estimate as to when source order must be respected.",
        "The resulting translations tend to be more literal than unconstrained translations.",
        "So long as the vocabulary present in our phrase table and language model supports a literal translation, cohesion tends to produce an improvement.",
        "Consider the first translation example shown in Table 5.",
        "In the baseline translation, the language model encourages the system to move the negation away from \"exist\" and toward \"reduce.\"",
        "The result is a tragic reversal of meaning in the translation.",
        "Our cohesion constraint removes this option, forcing the decoder to assemble the correct French construction for \"does not yet exist.\"",
        "The second example shows a case where our resources do not support a literal translation.",
        "In this case, we do not have a strong translation mapping to produce a French modifier equivalent to the English \"banning.\"",
        "Stuck with a noun form (\"the ban\"), the baseline is able to distort the sentence into something that is almost correct (the above gloss is quite generous).",
        "The cohesive system, even with a soft constraint, cannot reproduce the same movement, and returns a less grammatical translation.",
        "We also examined cases where the decoder overrides the soft cohesion constraint and produces an uncohesive translation.",
        "We found this was done very rarely, and primarily to overcome parse errors.",
        "Only one correct syntactic construct repeatedly forced the decoder to override cohesion: Minipar's conjunction representation, which connects conjuncts in parent-child relationships, is at times too restrictive.",
        "A sibling representation, which would allow conjuncts to be permuted arbitrarily, may work better."

      "text": [
        "We have presented a definition of syntactic cohesion that is applicable to phrase-based SMT.",
        "We have used this definition to develop a linear-time algorithm to detect cohesion violations in partial decoder hypotheses.",
        "This algorithm was used to implement a soft cohesion constraint for the Moses decoder, based on a source-side dependency tree.",
        "Our experiments have shown that roughly 1/5 of our baseline English-French translations contain cohesion violations, and these translations tend to receive lower BLEU scores.",
        "This suggests that cohesion could be a strong feature in estimating the confidence of phrase-based translations.",
        "Our soft constraint produced improvements ranging between 0.5 and 1.1 BLEU points on sentences for which the baseline produces uncohesive translations.",
        "A human evaluation showed that translations created using a soft cohesion constraint are preferred over uncohe-sive translations in the majority of cases.",
