        "Most state-of-the-art statistical machine translation systems are based on large phrase tables extracted from parallel text using word-level alignments.",
        "These word-level alignments are most often obtained using Expectation Maximization on the conditional generative models of Brown et al. (1993) and Vogel et al. (1996).",
        "As these word-level alignment models restrict the word alignment complexity by requiring each target word to align to zero or one source words, results are improved by aligning both source-to-target as well as target-to-source, then heuristically combining these alignments.",
        "Finally, the set of phrases consistent with the word alignments are extracted from every sentence pair; these form the basis of the decoding process.",
        "While this approach has been very successful, poor wordlevel alignments are nonetheless a common source of error in machine translation systems.",
        "A natural solution to several of these issues is unite the word-level and phrase-level models into one learning procedure.",
        "Ideally, such a procedure would remedy the deficiencies of word-level alignment models, including the strong restrictions on the form of the alignment, and the strong independence assumption between words.",
        "Furthermore it would obviate the need for heuristic combination of word alignments.",
        "A unified procedure may also improve the identification of non-compositional phrasal translations, and the attachment decisions for unaligned words.",
        "In this direction, Expectation Maximization at the phrase level was proposed by Marcu and Wong (2002), who, however, experienced two major difficulties: computational complexity and controlling overfitting.",
        "Computational complexity arises from the exponentially large number of decompositions of a sentence pair into phrase pairs; overfitting is a problem because as EM attempts to maximize the likelihood of its training data, it prefers to directly explain a sentence pair with a single phrase pair.",
        "In this paper, we attempt to address these two issues in order to apply EM above the word level.",
        "We attack computational complexity by adopting the polynomial-time Inversion Transduction Grammar framework, and by only learning small non-compositional phrases.",
        "We address the tendency of EM to overfit by using Bayesian methods, where sparse priors assign greater mass to parameter vectors with fewer non-zero values therefore favoring shorter, more frequent phrases.",
        "We test our model by extracting longer phrases from our model's alignments using traditional phrase extraction, and find that a phrase table based on our system improves MT results over a phrase table extracted from traditional word-level alignments."

        "X – [XX ], X – (XX), X – C.",

        "We parameterize our probabilistic model in the manner of a PCFG: we associate a multinomial distribution with each nonterminal, where each outcome in this distribution corresponds to an expansion of that nonterminal.",
        "Specifically, we place one multinomial distribution 9X over the three expansions of the nonterminal X, and another multinomial distribution 9C over the expansions of C. Thus, the parameters in our model can be listed as where is for the inverted rule, P[] for the straight rule, Pc for the third rule, satisfying +p +PC = 1, and where e/f P(e/f) = 1 is a multinomial distribution over phrase pairs.",
        "This is our model in a nutshell.",
        "We can train this model using a two-dimensional extension ofthe inside-outside algorithm on bilingual data, assuming every phrase pair that can appear as a leaf in a parse tree of the grammar a valid candidate.",
        "However, it is easy to show that the maximum likelihood training will lead to the saturated solution where Pc = 1 – each sentence pair is generated by a single phrase spanning the whole sentence.",
        "From the computational point of view, the full EM algorithm runs in O(n) where n is the average length of the two input sentences, which is too slow in practice.",
        "The key is to control the number of parameters, and therefore the size of the set of candidate phrases.",
        "We deal with this problem in two directions.",
        "First we change the objective function by incorporating a prior over the phrasal parameters.",
        "This has the effect of preferring parameter vectors in 9C with fewer non-zero values.",
        "Our second approach was to constrain the search space using simpler alignment models, which has the further benefit of significantly speeding up training.",
        "First we train a lower level word alignment model, then we place hard constraints on the phrasal alignment space using confident word links from this simpler model.",
        "Combining the two approaches, we have a staged training procedure going from the simplest unconstrained word based model to a constrained Bayesian word-level ITG model, and finally proceeding to a constrained Bayesian phrasal model."

        "Given a bitext cell defined by the four boundary indices (i , j, l , m) as shown in Figure 1a, we prune based on a figure of merit V (i , j , l , m) approximating the utility of that cell in a full ITG parse.",

        "Finally we ran 10 iterations of phrase-based ITG over the residual charts, using EM or VB, and extracted the Viterbi alignments.",
        "For translation, we used the standard phrasal decoding approach, based on a reimplementation of the Pharaoh system (Koehn, 2004).",
        "The output of the word alignment systems (GIZA++ or ITG) were fed to a standard phrase extraction procedure that extracted all phrases of length up to 7 and estimated the conditional probabilities of source given target and target given source using relative frequencies.",
        "Thus our phrasal ITG learns only the minimal non-compositional phrases; the standard phrase-extraction algorithm learns larger combinations of these minimal units.",
        "In addition the phrases were annotated with lexical weights using the IBM Model 1 tables.",
        "The decoder also used a trigram language model trained on the target side ofthe training data, as well as word count, phrase count, and distortion penalty features.",
        "Minimum Error Rate training (Och, 2003) over BLEU was used to optimize the weights for each of these models over the development test data.",
        "We used the NIST 2002 evaluation datasets for tuning and evaluation; the 10-reference development set was used for minimum error rate training, and the 4-reference test set was used for evaluation.",
        "We trained several phrasal translation systems, varying only the word alignment (or phrasal alignment) method.",
        "Table 1 compares the four systems: the GIZA++ baseline, the ITG word-based model, the ITG multiword model using EM training, and the ITG multiword model using VB training.",
        "ITG-mwm-VB is our best model.",
        "We see an improvement of nearly Development Test",
        "Table 1: Translation results on Chinese-English, using the subset of training data (141K sentence pairs) that have length limit 35 on both sides.",
        "(No length limit in translation. )",
        "2 points dev set and nearly 1 point of improvement on the test set.",
        "We also observe the consistent superiority of VB over EM.",
        "The gain is especially large on the test data set, indicating VB is less prone to overitting."

        "We have presented an improved and more eficient method of estimating phrase pairs directly.",
        "By both changing the objective function to include a bias toward sparser models and improving the pruning techniques and eficiency, we achieve signiicant gains on test data with practical speed.",
        "In addition, these gains were shown without resorting to external models, such as GIZA++.",
        "We have shown that VB is both practical and effective for use in MT models.",
        "However, our best system does not apply VB to a single probability model, as we found an appreciable beneit from bootstrapping each model from simpler models, much as the IBM word alignment models are usually trained in succession.",
        "We ind that VB alone is not suficient to counteract the tendency of EM to prefer analyses with smaller trees using fewer rules and longer phrases.",
        "Both the tic-tac-toe pruning and the non-compositional constraint address this problem by reducing the space ofpossible phrase pairs.",
        "On top of these hard constraints, the sparse prior of VB helps make the model less prone to overitting to infrequent phrase pairs, and thus improves the quality of the phrase pairs the model learns.",
