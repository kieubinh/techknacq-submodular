        "Large vocabulary speech recognition today achieves a level of accuracy that makes it useful in the production of written documents.",
        "Especially in the medical and legal domains large volumes of text are traditionally produced by means of dictation.",
        "Here document creation is typically a \"back-end\" process.",
        "The author dictates all necessary information into a telephone handset or a portable recording device and is not concerned with the actual production of the document any further.",
        "A transcriptionist will then listen to the recorded dictation and produce a well-formed document using a word processor.",
        "The goal of introducing speech recognition in this process is to create a draft document automatically, so that the transcriptionist only has to verify the accuracy of the document and to fix occasional recognition errors.",
        "We observe that users try to spend as little time as possible dictating.",
        "They usually focus only on the content and rely on the transcriptionist to compose a readable, syntactically correct, stylistically acceptable and formally compliant document.",
        "For this reason there is a considerable discrepancy between the final document and what the speaker has said literally.",
        "In particular in medical reports we see differences of the following kinds:",
        "• Punctuation marks are typically not verbalized.",
        "• No instructions on the formatting of the report are dictated.",
        "Section headings are not identified as such.",
        "• Frequently section headings are only implied.",
        "(\"vitals are\" – \"Physical Examination: Vital Signs:\")",
        "• The dictation usually begins with a preamble (e.g. \"This is doctor Xyz ...\") which does not appear in the report.",
        "Similarly there are typical phrases at the end of the dictation which should not be transcribed (e.g. \"End of dictation.",
        "Thank you.\")",
        "• There are specific standards regarding the use of medical terminology.",
        "Transcriptionists frequently expand dictated abbreviations (e.g. \"CVA\" – \"cerebrovascular accident\") or otherwise use equivalent terms (e.g. \"nonicteric sclerae\" – \"no scleral icterus\").",
        "• The dictation typically has a more narrative style (e.g. \"She has no allergies.",
        "\", \"I examined him\").",
        "In contrast, the report is normally more impersonal and structured (e.g. \"Allergies: None.",
        "\", \"he was examined\").",
        "• For the sake of brevity, speakers frequently omit function words.",
        "(\"patient\" – \"the patient\", \"denies fever pain\" – \"he denies any fever or pain\")",
        "• As the dictation is spontaneous, disfluencies are quite frequent, in particular false starts, corrections and repetitions.",
        "(e.g. \"22-year-old female, sorry, male 22-year-old male\" – \"22-year-old male\")",
        "• Instruction to the transcriptionist and so-called normal reports, predefined text templates invoked by a short phrase like \"This is a normal chest x-ray.\"",
        "• In addition to the above, speech recognition output has the usual share of recognition errors some of which may occur systematically.",
        "These phenomena pose a problem that goes beyond the speech recognition task which has traditionally focused on correctly identifying speech utterances.",
        "Even with a perfectly accurate verbatim transcript of the user's utterances, the transcriptionist would need to perform a significant amount of editing to obtain a document conforming to the customary standards.",
        "We need to look for what the user wants rather than what he says.",
        "Natural language processing research has addressed a number of these issues as individual problems: automatic punctuation (Liu et al., 2005), text segmentation (Beeferman et al., 1999; Matusov et al., 2003) disfluency repair (Heeman et al., 1996) and error correction (Ringger and Allen, 1996; Strzalkowski and Brandow, 1997; Peters and Drexel, 2004).",
        "The method we present in the following attempts to address all this by a unified transformation model.",
        "The goal is simply stated as transforming the recognition output into a text document.",
        "We will first describe the general framework of learning transformations from example documents.",
        "In the following two sections we will discuss a rule-induction-based and a probabilistic transformation method respectively.",
        "Finally we present experimental results in the context of medical transcription and conclude with an assessment of both methods."
