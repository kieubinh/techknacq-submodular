        "Most information retrieval models (Salton et al., 1975; Fuhr, 1992; Ponte and Croft, 1998; Fang and Zhai, 2005) compute relevance scores based on matching of terms in queries and documents.",
        "Since various terms can be used to describe a same concept, it is unlikely for a user to use a query term that is exactly the same term as used in relevant documents.",
        "Clearly, such vocabulary gaps make the retrieval performance non-optimal.",
        "Query expansion (Voorhees, 1994; Mandala et al., 1999a; Fang and",
        "Zhai, 2006; Qiu and Frei, 1993; Bai et al., 2005; Cao et al., 2005) is a commonly used strategy to bridge the vocabulary gaps by expanding original queries with related terms.",
        "Expanded terms are often selected from either co-occurrence-based thesauri (Qiu and Frei, 1993; Bai et al., 2005; Jing and Croft, 1994; Peat and Willett, 1991; Smeaton and van Rijsbergen, 1983; Fang and Zhai, 2006) or handcrafted thesauri (Voorhees, 1994; Liu et al., 2004) or both (Cao et al., 2005; Mandala et al., 1999b).",
        "Intuitively, compared with co-occurrence-based thesauri, hand-crafted thesauri, such as WordNet, could provide more reliable terms for query expansion.",
        "However, previous studies failed to show any significant gain in retrieval performance when queries are expanded with terms selected from WordNet (Voorhees, 1994; Stairmand, 1997).",
        "Although some researchers have shown that combining terms from both types of resources is effective, the benefit of query expansion using only manually created lexical resources remains unclear.",
        "The main challenge is how to assign appropriate weights to the expanded terms.",
        "In this paper, we re-examine the problem of query expansion using lexical resources with the recently proposed axiomatic approaches (Fang and Zhai, 2006).",
        "The major advantage of axiomatic approaches in query expansion is to provide guidance on how to weight related terms based on a given term similarity function.",
        "In our previous study, a cooccurrence-based term similarity function was proposed and studied.",
        "In this paper, we study several term similarity functions that exploit various information from two lexical resources, i.e., WordNet and dependency-thesaurus constructed by Lin (Lin, 1998), and then incorporate these similarity functions into the axiomatic retrieval framework.",
        "We conduct empirical experiments over several TREC standard collections to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of query expansion based on these similarity functions.",
        "Experiment results show that all the similarity functions improve the retrieval performance, although the performance improvement varies for different functions.",
        "We find that the most effective way to utilize the information from WordNet is to compute the term similarity based on the overlap of synset definitions.",
        "Using this similarity function in query expansion can significantly improve the retrieval performance.",
        "According to the retrieval performance, the proposed similarity function is significantly better than simple mutual information based similarity function, while it is comparable to the function proposed in (Fang and Zhai, 2006).",
        "Furthermore, we show that the retrieval performance can be further improved if the proposed similarity function is combined with the similarity function derived from co-occurrence-based resources.",

        "Axiomatic approaches have recently been proposed and studied to develop retrieval functions (Fang and Zhai, 2005; Fang and Zhai, 2006).",
        "The main idea is to search for a retrieval function that satisfies all the desirable retrieval constraints, i.e., axioms.",
        "The underlying assumption is that a retrieval function satisfying all the constraints would perform well empirically.",
        "Unlike other retrieval models, axiomatic retrieval models directly model the relevance with term level retrieval constraints.",
        "In (Fang and Zhai, 2005), several axiomatic retrieval functions have been derived based on a set of basic formalized retrieval constraints and an inductive definition of the retrieval function space.",
        "The derived retrieval functions are shown to perform as well as the existing retrieval functions with less parameter sensitivity.",
        "One of the components in the inductive definition is primitive weighting function, which assigns the retrieval score to a single term document {d} for a single term query {q} based on where o(q) is a term weighting function of q.",
        "A limitation of the primitive weighting function described in Equation 1 is that it can not bridge vocabulary gaps between documents and queries.",
        "To overcome this limitation, in (Fang and Zhai, 2006), we proposed a set of semantic term matching constraints and modified the previously derived axiomatic functions to make them satisfy these additional constraints.",
        "In particular, the primitive weighting function is generalized as where s(q, d) is a semantic similarity function between two terms q and d, and f is a monotonically increasing function defined as where f3 is a parameter that regulates the weighting ofthe original query terms and the semantically similar terms.",
        "We have shown that the proposed generalization can be implemented as a query expansion method.",
        "Specifically, the expanded terms are selected based on a term similarity function s and the weight of an expanded term t is determined by its term similarity with a query term q, i.e., s(q,t), as well as the weight of the query term, i.e., o(q).",
        "Note that the weight of an expanded term t is o (t) in traditional query expansion methods.",
        "In our previous study (Fang and Zhai, 2006), term similarity function s is derived based on the mutual information of terms over collections that are constructed under the guidance of a set of term semantic similarity constraints.",
        "The focus of this paper is to study and compare several term similarity functions exploiting the information from lexical resources, and evaluate their effectiveness in the axiomatic retrieval models."

        "In this section, we discuss a set of term similarity functions that exploit the information stored in two lexical resources: WordNet (Miller, 1990) and dependency-based thesaurus (Lin, 1998).",
        "The most commonly used lexical resource is WordNet (Miller, 1990), which is a hand-crafted lexical system developed at Princeton University.",
        "Words are organized into four taxonomies based on different parts of speech.",
        "Every node in the WordNet is a synset, i.e., a set of synonyms.",
        "The definition of a synset, which is referred to as gloss, is also provided.",
        "For a query term, all the synsets in which the term appears can be returned, along with the definition of the synsets.",
        "We now discuss six possible term similarity functions based on the information provided by WordNet.",
        "Since the definition provides valuable information about the semantic meaning of a term, we can use the definitions of the terms to measure their semantic similarity.",
        "The more common words the definitions of two terms have, the more similar these terms are (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2005).",
        "Thus, we can compute the term semantic similarity based on synset definitions in the following way:",
        "where D(t) is the concatenation of the definitions for all the synsets containing term t and |D| is the number of words of the set D.",
        "Within a taxonomy, synsets are organized by their lexical relations.",

        "â€¢ Meronym(Mero): X is a meronym of Y if X is a part of Y.",
        "Since these relations are binary, we define the term similarity functions based on these relations in the following way.",
        "where R G {syn, hyper, hypo, holo, mero}, TR(t) is a set of words that are related to term t based on the relation R, and as are non-zero parameters to control the similarity between terms based on different relations.",
        "However, since the similarity values for all term pairs are same, the values of these parameters can be ignored when we use Equation 2 in query expansion.",
        "Another lexical resource we study in the paper is the dependency-based thesaurus provided by Lin (Lin, 1998).",
        "The thesaurus provides term similarities that are automatically computed based on dependency relationships extracted from a parsed corpus.",
        "We define a similarity function that can utilize this thesaurus as follows:",
        "where L(t1,t2) is the similarity of terms stored in the dependency-based thesaurus and TPLin is a set of all the term pairs stored in the thesaurus.",
        "The similarity of two terms would be assigned to zero if we can not find the term pair in the thesaurus.",
        "Since all the similarity functions discussed above capture different perspectives of term relations, we propose a simple strategy to combine these similarity functions so that the similarity of a term pair is the highest similarity value of these two terms of all the above similarity functions, which is shown as follows.",
        "s combined (t1 ,t2)",
        "Rset = {def, syn, hyper, hypo, holo, mero, Lin}.",
        "In summary, we have discussed eight possible similarity functions that exploit the information from the lexical resources.",

        "Third, the similarity function based on Lin's thesaurus is more effective than those based on term relations from the WordNet, while it is less effective compared with the definition-based similarity function, which might be caused by its smaller coverage.",
        "Finally, combining different WordNet-based similarity functions does not help, which may indicate that the expanded terms selected by different functions are overlapped.",
        "As shown in Table 2, the similarity function based on synset definitions, i.e., sdef, is most effective.",

        "We can make the similar observation from the results for short verbose queries as shown in Table 4.",
        "One advantage of sdef over sMIImp is the computational cost, because sdef can be computed offline in advance while sMIImp has to be computed online from query-dependent working sets which takes much more time.",
        "The low computational cost and high retrieval performance make sdef more attractive in the real world applications.",
        "Since both types of similarity functions are able to improve retrieval performance, we now study whether combining them could lead to better performance.",

        "The results for short verbose queries are similar.",

        "Query expansion is an effective technique in information retrieval to improve the retrieval performance, because it often can bridge the vocabulary gaps between queries and documents.",
        "Intuitively, hand-crafted thesaurus could provide reliable related terms, which would help improve the performance.",
        "However, none of the previous studies is able to show significant performance improvement through query expansion using information only from manually created lexical resources.",
        "In this paper, we re-examine the problem ofquery expansion using lexical resources in recently proposed axiomatic framework and find that we are able to significantly improve retrieval performance through query expansion using only hand-crafted lexical resources.",
        "In particular, we first study a few term similarity functions exploiting the information from two lexical resources: WordNet and dependency-based thesaurus created by Lin.",
        "We then incorporate the similarity functions with the query expansion method in the axiomatic retrieval models.",
        "Systematical experiments have been conducted over six standard TREC collections and show promising results.",
        "All the proposed similarity functions improve the retrieval performance, although the degree of improvement varies for different similarity functions.",
        "Among all the functions, the one based on synset definition is most effective and is able to significantly and consistently improve retrieval performance for all the data sets.",
        "This similarity function is also compared with some similarity functions using mutual information.",
        "Furthermore, experiment results show that combining similarity functions from different resources could further improve the performance.",

        "Unlike previous studies, we are able to show that query expansion using only manually created thesauri can lead to significant performance improvement.",
        "The main reason is that the axiomatic approach provides guidance on how to appropriately assign weights to expanded terms.",
        "There are many interesting future research directions based on this work.",
        "First, we will study the same problem in some specialized domain, such as biology literature, to see whether the proposed approach could be generalized to the new domain.",
        "Second, the fact that using axiomatic approaches to incorporate linguistic information can improve retrieval performance is encouraging.",
        "We plan to extend the axiomatic approach to incorporate more linguistic information, such as phrases and word senses, into retrieval models to further improve the performance."
