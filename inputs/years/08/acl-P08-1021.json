        "In order to describe the nuances of an action, a verb may be associated with various concepts such as tense, aspect, voice, mood, person and number.",
        "In some languages, such as Chinese, the verb itself is not inflected, and these concepts are expressed via other words in the sentence.",
        "In highly inflected languages, such as Turkish, many of these concepts are encoded in the inflection of the verb.",
        "In between these extremes, English uses a combination of inflections (see Table 1) and \"helping words\", or auxiliaries, to form complex verb phrases.",
        "It should come as no surprise, then, that the misuse of verb forms is a common error category for some non-native speakers of English.",
        "For example, in the Japanese Learners of English corpus (Izumi et al., 2003), errors related to verbs are among the most frequent categories.",

        "The base form is also used to construct the infinitive with \"to\".",
        "An exception is the verb \"to be\", which has more forms.",
        "A system that automatically detects and corrects misused verb forms would be both an educational and practical tool for students of English.",
        "It may also potentially improve the performance of machine translation and natural language generation systems, especially when the source and target languages employ very different verb systems.",
        "Research on automatic grammar correction has been conducted on a number of different parts-of-speech, such as articles (Knight and Chander, 1994) and prepositions (Chodorow et al., 2007).",
        "Errors in verb forms have been covered as part of larger systems such as (Heidorn, 2000), but we believe that their specific research challenges warrant more detailed examination.",

        "Our goal is to correct confusions among these five forms, as well as the infinitive.",
        "These confusions can be viewed as symptoms of one of two main underlying categories of errors; roughly speaking, one category is semantic in nature, and the other, syntactic.",
        "The first type of error is concerned with inappropriate choices of tense, aspect, voice, or mood.",
        "These may be considered errors in semantics.",

        "This type of error may be further subdivided as follows:",
        "Subject-Verb Agreement The verb is not correctly inflected in number and person with respect to the subject.",
        "A common error is the confusion between the base form and the third person singular form, e.g., He *have been living there since June.",
        "(2)",
        "Auxiliary Agreement In addition to the modal auxiliaries, other auxiliaries must be used when specifying the perfective or progressive aspect, or the passive voice.",
        "Their use results in a complex verb phrase, i.e., one that consists of two or more verb constituents.",
        "Mistakes arise when the main verb does not \"agree\" with the auxiliary.",

        "(3)",
        "In general, the auxiliaries can serve as a hint to the intended verb form, even as the auxiliaries \"has been\" in the above case suggest that the progressive aspect was intended.",

        "One strategy for correcting verb form errors is to identify the intended syntactic relationships between the verb in question and its neighbors.",
        "For subject-verb agreement, the subject of the verb is obviously crucial (e.g., \"he\" in (2)); the auxiliary is relevant for resolving auxiliary agreement (e.g., \"has been'\" in (3)); determining the verb that receives the complementation is necessary for detecting any complementation errors (e.g., \"wants\" in (4)).",
        "Once these items are identified, most verb form errors may be corrected in a rather straightforward manner.",
        "The success of this strategy, then, hinges on accurate identification of these items, for example, from parse trees.",
        "Ambiguities will need to be resolved, leading to two research issues (ยง3.2 and ยง3.3).",
        "The three so-called primaryverbs, \"have\", \"do\" and \"be\", can serve as either main or auxiliary verbs.",
        "The verb \"be\" can be utilized as a main verb, but also as an auxiliary in the progressive aspect (INGprog in Table 3) or the passive voice (EDpass).",
        "The three examples below illustrate these possibilities:",
        "This is work not play.",
        "(main verb) My father is working in the lab.",
        "(INGprog) A solution is worked out.",
        "(EDpass)",
        "These different roles clearly affect the forms required for the verbs (if any) that follow.",
        "Disambiguation among these roles is usually straightforward because of the different verb forms (e.g., \"working\" vs. \"worked\").",
        "If the verb forms are incorrect, disambiguation is made more difficult:",
        "This is work not play.",
        "My father is *work in the lab.",
        "A solution is *work out.",
        "Similar ambiguities are introduced by the other primary verbs.",
        "The verb \"have\" can function as an auxiliary in the perfect aspect (EDperf) as well as a main verb.",
        "The versatile \"do\" can serve as \"do\"-support or add emphasis (BASEdo), or simply act as a main verb.",
        "The ambiguities discussed above may be expected to cause degradation in automatic parsing performance.",
        "In other words, sentences containing verb form errors are more likely to yield an \"incorrect\" parse tree, sometimes with significant differences.",
