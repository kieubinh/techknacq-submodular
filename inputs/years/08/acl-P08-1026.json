        "Underspecification (Reyle, 1993; Copestake et al., 2005; Bos, 1996; Egg et al., 2001) has become the standard approach to dealing with scope ambiguity in large-scale handwritten grammars (see e.g. Cope-stake and Flickinger (2000)).",
        "The key idea behind underspecification is that the parser avoids computing all scope readings.",
        "Instead, it computes a single compact underspecified description for each parse.",
        "One can then strengthen the underspecified description to efficiently eliminate subsets of readings that were not intended in the given context (Koller and Niehren, 2000; Koller and Thater, 2006); so when the individual readings are eventually computed, the number of remaining readings is much smaller and much closer to the actual perceived ambiguity of the sentence.",
        "In the past few years, a \"standard model\" of scope underspecification has emerged: A range of formalisms from Underspecified DRT (Reyle, 1993) to dominance graphs (Althaus et al., 2003) have offered mechanisms to specify the \"semantic material\" of which the semantic representations are built up, plus dominance or outscoping relations between these building blocks.",
        "This has been a very successful approach, but recent algorithms for eliminating subsets of readings have pushed the expressive power of these formalisms to their limits; for instance, Koller and Thater (2006) speculate that further improvements over their (incomplete) redundancy elimination algorithm require a more expressive formalism than dominance graphs.",
        "On the theoretical side, Ebert (2005) has shown that none of the major underspecification formalisms are expressively complete, i.e. supports the description of an arbitrary subset of readings.",
        "Furthermore, the somewhat implicit nature of dominance-based descriptions makes it difficult to systematically associate readings with probabilities or costs and then compute a best reading.",
        "In this paper, we address both of these shortcomings by proposing regular tree grammars (RTGs) as a novel underspecification formalism.",
        "Regular tree grammars (Comon et al., 2007) are a standard approach for specifying sets of trees in theoretical computer science, and are closely related to regular tree transducers as used e.g. in recent work on statistical MT (Knight and Graehl, 2005) and grammar formalisms (Shieber, 2006).",
        "We show that the \"dominance charts\" proposed by Koller and Thater (2005b) can be naturally seen as regular tree grammars; using their algorithm, classical underspecified descriptions (dominance graphs) can be translated into RTGs that describe the same sets of readings.",
        "However, RTGs are trivially expressively complete because every finite tree language is also regular.",
        "We exploit this increase in expressive power in presenting a novel redundancy elimination algorithm that is simpler and more powerful than the one by Koller and Thater (2006); in our algorithm, redundancy elimination amounts to intersection of regular tree languages.",
        "Furthermore, we show how to define a PCFG-style cost model on RTGs and compute best readings of deterministic RTGs efficiently, and illustrate this model on a machine learning based model of scope preferences (Higgins and Sadock, 2003).",
        "To our knowledge, this is the first efficient algorithm for computing best readings of a scope ambiguity in the literature.",
        "The paper is structured as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we will first sketch the existing standard approach to underspecification.",
        "We will then define regular tree grammars and show how to see them as an underspecification formalism in Section 3.",
        "We will present the new redundancy elimination algorithm, based on language intersection, in Section 4, and show how to equip RTGs with weights and compute best readings in Section 5.",
        "We conclude in Section 6."

        "This simplifies semantics construction, and current algorithms (Koller and Thater, 2005a) support the efficient enumeration of readings from an USR when it is necessary.",
        "Furthermore, it is possible to perform certain semantic processing tasks such as eliminating redundant readings (see Section 4) directly on the level of underspecified representations without explicitly enumerating individual readings.",
        "Under the \"standard model\" of scope underspecification, readings are considered as formulas or trees.",

        "Each reading is encoded as one configuration of the dominance graph, which can be obtained by \"plugging\" the tree fragments into each other, in a way that respects the dominance edges: The source node of each dominance edge must dominate (i.e., be an ancestor of) the target node in each configuration.",
        "The trees in Fig. 1a-e are the five configurations of the example graph.",
        "An important class of dominance graphs are hy- pernormally connected dominance graphs, or dominance nets (Niehren and Thater, 2003).",

      "text": [
        "Because every finite tree language is regular, RTGs constitute an expressively complete underspecification formalism in the sense of Ebert (2005): They can represent arbitrary subsets of the original set of readings.",
        "Ebert shows that the classical dominance-based underspecification formalisms, such as MRS, Hole Semantics, and dominance graphs, are all expressively incomplete, which Koller and Thater (2006) speculate might be a practical problem for algorithms that strengthen USRs to remove unwanted readings.",
        "We will now show how both the expressive completeness and the availability of standard constructions for RTGs can be exploited to get an improved redundancy elimination algorithm.",
        "Redundancy elimination (Vestre, 1991; Chaves, 2003; Koller and Thater, 2006) is the problem of deriving from an USR U another USR U', such that the readings of U ' are a proper subset of the readings of U , but every reading in U is semantically equivalent to some reading in U '.",
        "For instance, the following sentence from the Rondane treebank is analyzed as having six quantifiers and 480 readings by the ERG grammar; these readings fall into just two semantic equivalence classes, characterized by the relative scope of \"the lee of\" and \"a small hillside\".",
        "A redundancy elimination would therefore ideally reduce the underspecified description to one that has only two readings (one for each class).",
        "(1) We quickly put up the tents in the lee of a small hillside and cook for the first time in the open.",
        "(Rondane 892)",
        "Koller and Thater (2006) define semantic equivalence in terms of a rewrite system that specifies under what conditions two quantifiers may exchange their positions without changing the meaning of the semantic representation.",
        "For example, if we assume the following rewrite system (with just a single rule), the five configurations in Fig. 1a-e fall into three equivalence classes - indicated by the dotted boxes around the names a-e - because two pairs of readings can be rewritten into each other.",
        "Based on this definition, Koller and Thater (2006) present an algorithm (henceforth, KT06) that deletes rules from a dominance chart and thus removes subsets of readings from the USR.",
        "The KT06 algorithm is fast and quite effective in practice.",
        "However, it essentially predicts for each production rule of a dominance chart whether each configuration that can be built with this rule is equivalent to a configuration that can be built with some other production for the same subgraph, and is therefore rather complex.",
        "We now define a new algorithm for redundancy elimination.",
        "It is based on the intersection of regular tree languages, and will be much simpler and more powerful than KT06.",
        "Let G = ( S, N, £, R) be an RTG with a linear order on the terminals £; for ease of presentation, we assume £ C N. Furthermore, let f : £ – £' be a relabelling function into the signature £' of the rewrite system.",
        "For example, G could be the dominance chart of some dominance graph D, and f could be the labelling function of D.",
        "We can then define a tree language LF as follows: LF contains all trees over £ that do not contain a subtree of the form 41 (x1,..., xi-1, 42(...), xi+1,..., x*) where q1 > q2 and the rewrite system contains a rule that has f (41XX1,...,f (q2)(...),...,Xk) on the left or right hand side.",
        "LF is a regular tree language, and can be accepted by a regular tree grammar GF with O(n) nonterminals and O(n) rules, where n = |£'|.",
        "A filter grammar for Fig. 1 looks as follows:",
        "This grammar accepts all trees over £ except ones in which a node with label 2 is the parent of a node with label 1, because such trees correspond to configurations in which a node with label az is the parent of a node with label ax, az and ax are permutable, and 2 > 1.",
        "In particular, it will accept the configurations (b), (c), and (e) in Fig. 1, but not (a) or (d).",
        "Since regular tree languages are closed under intersection, we can compute a grammar G' such that L(G') = L(G) nLF.",
        "This grammar has O(nk) nonterminals and O(nk) productions, where k is the number of production rules in G, and can be computed in time O(nk).",
        "The relabelled grammar f(G') accepts all trees in which adjacent occurrences of permutable quantifiers are in a canonical order (sorted from lowest to highest node name).",
        "For example, the grammar G' for the example looks as follows; note that the nonterminal alphabet of G' is the product of the nonterminal alphabets of G and GF.",
        "Significantly, the grammar contains no productions for {1,3,5,6, 7}q1 with terminal symbol 1,and no production for {1,5, 7}q1.",
        "This reduces the tree language accepted by f (G') to just the configurations (b), (c), and (e) in Fig. 1, i.e. exactly one representative of every equivalence class.",
        "Notice that there are two different nonterminals, {5}Q1 and {5}S, corresponding to the subgraph {5}, so the intersected RTG is not a dominance chart any more.",
        "As we will see below, this increased expressivity increases the power of the redundancy elimination algorithm.",
        "The algorithm presented here is not only more transparent than KT06, but also more powerful; for example, it will reduce the graph in Fig. 4 of Koller and Thater (2006) completely, whereas KT06 won't.",
        "To measure the extent to which the new algorithm improves upon KT06, we compare both algorithms on the USRs in the Rondane treebank (version of January 2006).",
        "The Rondane treebank is a \"Redwoods style\" treebank (Oepen et al., 2002) containing MRS-based underspecified representations for sentences from the tourism domain, and is distributed together with the English Resource Grammar (ERG) (Copestake and Flickinger, 2000).",
        "The treebank contains 999 MRS-nets, which we translate automatically into dominance graphs and further into RTGs; the median number of scope readings per sentence is 56.",
        "For our experiment, we consider all 950 MRS-nets with less than 650 000 configurations.",
        "We use a slightly weaker version of the rewrite system that Koller and Thater (2006) used in their evaluation.",
        "It turns out that the median number of equivalence classes, computed by pairwise comparison of all configurations, is 8.",
        "The median number of configurations that remain after running our algorithm is also 8.",
        "By contrast, the median number after running KT06 is 11.",
        "For a more fine-grained comparison, Fig. 3 shows the percentage of USRs for which the two algorithms achieve complete reduction, i.e. retain only one reading per equivalence class.",
        "In the diagram, we have grouped USRs according to the natural logarithm of their numbers of configurations, and report the percentage of USRs in this group on which the algorithms were complete.",
        "The new algorithm dramatically outperforms KT06: In total, it reduces 96% of all USRs completely, whereas KT06 was complete only for 40%.",
        "This increase in completeness is partially due to the new algorithm's ability to use non-chart RTGs: For 28% of the sentences, it computes RTGs that are not dominance charts.",
        "KT06 was only able to reduce 5 of these 263 graphs completely.",
        "The algorithm needs 25 seconds to run for the entire corpus (old algorithm: 17 seconds), and it would take 50 (38) more seconds to run on the 49 large USRs that we exclude from the experiment.",
        "By contrast, it takes about 7 hours to compute the equivalence classes by pairwise comparison, and it would take an estimated several billion years to compute the equivalence classes of the excluded USRs.",
        "In short, the redundancy elimination algorithm presented here achieves nearly complete reduction at a tiny fraction of the runtime, and makes a useful task that was completely infeasible before possible.",
        "Finally, let us briefly consider the ramifications of expressive completeness on efficiency.",
        "Ebert (2005) proves that no expressively complete underspecification formalism can be compact, i.e. in the worst case, the USR of a set of readings become exponentially large in the number of scope-bearing operators.",
        "In the case of RTGs, this worst case is achieved by grammars of the form S – t1 | ... | tn, where t1,..., tnare the trees we want to describe.",
        "This grammar is as big as the number of readings, i.e. worst-case exponential in the number n of scope-bearing operators, and essentially amounts to a meta-level disjunction over the readings.",
        "Ebert takes the incompatibility between compactness and expressive completeness as a fundamental problem for underspecification.",
        "We don't see things quite as bleakly.",
        "Expressions of natural language itself are (extremely underspecified) descriptions of sets of semantic representations, and so Ebert's argument applies to NL expressions as well.",
        "This means that describing a given set of readings may require an exponentially long discourse.",
        "Ebert's definition of compactness may be too harsh: An USR, although exponential-size in the number of quantifiers, may still be polynomial-size in the length of the discourse in the worst case.",
        "Nevertheless, the tradeoff between compactness and expressive power is important for the design of underspecification formalisms, and RTGs offer a unique answer.",
        "They are expressively complete; but as we have seen in Fig. 2, the RTGs that are derived by semantic construction are compact, and even intersecting them with filter grammars for redundancy elimination only blows up their sizes by a factor of O(n).",
        "As we add more and more information to an RTG to reduce the set of readings, ultimately to those readings that were meant in the actual context of the utterance, the grammar will become less and less compact; but this trend is counterbalanced by the overall reduction in the number of readings.",
        "For the USRs in Rondane, the intersected RTGs are, on average, 6% smaller than the original charts.",
        "Only 30% are larger than the charts, by a maximal factor of 3.66.",
        "Therefore we believe that the theoretical non-compactness should not be a major problem in a well-designed practical system."

        "Given a weighted, hypernormally connected dominance graph D, we can extend the chart of B(D) to a wRTG by assigning rule weights as follows: The weight of a rule Do – i(D1,..., Dn) is the product over the weights of all soft dominance and disjointness edges that are established by this rule.",
        "We say that a rule establishes a soft dominance edge from u to v if u = i and v is in one of the subgraphs Di,..., Dn; we say that it establishes a soft disjointness edge between u and v if u and v are in different subgraphs Dj and Dk (j = k).",
        "It can be shown that the weight this grammar assigns to each derivation is equal to the weight that the original dominance graph assigns to the corresponding configuration.",
        "If we apply this construction to the example graph in Fig. 4, we obtain the following wRTG:",
        "For example, picking \"az\" as the root of a configuration (Fig.",
        "1 (c), (d)) of the entire graph has a weight of 1, because this rule establishes no soft edges.",
        "On the other hand, choosing \"ax\" as the root has a weight of 9, because this establishes the soft disjointness edge (and in fact, leads to the derivation of the maximum-weight configuration in Fig. 1 (e)).",
        "The problem of computing the best configuration of a weighted dominance graph - or equivalently, the best derivation of a weighted tree grammar - can now be solved by standard algorithms for wRTGs.",
        "For example, Knight and Graehl (2005) present an algorithm to extract the best derivation of a wRTG in time O(t + n log n) where n is the number of nonterminals and t is the number of rules.",
        "In practice, we can extract the best reading of the most ambiguous sentence in the Rondane treebank (4.5 x 10 readings, 75 000 grammar rules) with random soft edges in about a second.",

        "In this paper, we have shown how regular tree grammars can be used as a formalism for scope under-specification, and have exploited the power of this view in a novel, simpler, and more complete algorithm for redundancy elimination and the first efficient algorithm for computing the best reading of a scope ambiguity.",
        "In both cases, we have adapted standard algorithms for RTGs, which illustrates the usefulness of using such a well-understood formalism.",
        "In the worst case, the RTG for a scope ambiguity is exponential in the number of scope bearers in the sentence; this is a necessary consequence of their expressive completeness.",
        "However, those RTGs that are computed by semantic construction and redundancy elimination remain compact.",
        "Rather than showing how to do semantic construction for RTGs, we have presented an algorithm that computes RTGs from more standard underspecification formalisms.",
        "We see RTGs as an \"underspecifi-cation assembly language\" - they support efficient and useful algorithms, but direct semantic construction may be inconvenient, and RTGs will rather be obtained by \"compiling\" higher-level underspecified representations such as dominance graphs or MRS.",
        "This perspective also allows us to establish a connection to approaches to semantic construction which use chart-based packing methods rather than dominance-based underspecification to manage scope ambiguities.",
        "For instance, both Combinatory Categorial Grammars (Steedman, 2000) and synchronous grammars (Nesson and Shieber, 2006) represent syntactic and semantic ambiguity as part of the same parse chart.",
        "These parse charts can be seen as regular tree grammars that accept the language of parse trees, and conceivably an RTG that describes only the semantic and not the syntactic ambiguity could be automatically extracted.",
        "We could thus reconcile these completely separate approaches to semantic construction within the same formal framework, and RTG-based algorithms (e.g., for redundancy elimination) would apply equally to dominance-based and chart-based approaches.",
        "Indeed, for one particular grammar formalism it has even been shown that the parse chart contains an isomorphic image of a dominance chart (Koller and",
        "Rambow, 2007).",
        "Finally, we have only scratched the surface of what can be be done with the computation of best configurations in Section 5.",
        "The algorithms generalize easily to weights that are taken from an arbitrary ordered semiring (Golan, 1999; Borchardt and Vogler, 2003) and to computing minimal-weight rather than maximal-weight configurations.",
        "It is also useful in applications beyond semantic construction, e.g. in discourse parsing (Regneri et al., 2008).",
        "Acknowledgments.",
        "We have benefited greatly from fruitful discussions on weighted tree grammars with Kevin Knight and Jonathan Graehl, and on discourse underspecification with Markus Egg.",
        "We also thank Christian Ebert, Marco Kuhlmann, Alex Lascarides, and the reviewers for their comments on the paper.",
        "Finally, we are deeply grateful to our former colleague Joachim Niehren, who was a great fan of tree automata before we even knew what they are."
