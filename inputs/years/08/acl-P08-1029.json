        "The problem of transfer learning, where information gained in one learning task is used to improve performance in another related task, is an important new area of research.",
        "In the subproblem of domain adaptation, a model trained over a source domain is generalized to perform well on a related target domain, where the two domains' data are distributed similarly, but not identically.",
        "We introduce the concept of groups of closely-related domains, called genres, and show how inter-genre adaptation is related to domain adaptation.",
        "We also examine multitask learning, where two domains may be related, but where the concept to be learned in each case is distinct.",
        "We show that our prior conveys useful information across domains, genres and tasks, while remaining robust to spurious signals not related to the target domain and concept.",
        "We further show that our model generalizes a class of similar hierarchical priors, smoothed to varying degrees, and lay the groundwork for future exploration in this area."

        "Consider the task of named entity recognition (NER).",
        "Specifically, you are given a corpus of news articles in which all tokens have been labeled as either belonging to personal name mentions or not.",
        "The standard supervised machine learning problem is to learn a classifier over this training data that will successfully label unseen test data drawn from the same distribution as the training data, where \"same distribution\" could mean anything from having the train and test articles written by the same author to having them written in the same language.",
        "Having successfully trained a named entity classifier on this news data, now consider the problem of learning to classify tokens as names in email data.",
        "An intuitive solution might be to simply retrain the classifier, de novo, on the email data.",
        "Practically, however, large, labeled datasets are often expensive to build and this solution would not scale across a large number of different datasets.",
        "Clearly the problems of identifying names in news articles and emails are closely related, and learning to do well on one should help your performance on the other.",
        "At the same time, however, there are serious differences between the two problems that need to be addressed.",
        "For instance, capitalization, which will certainly be a useful feature in the news problem, may prove less informative in the email data since the rules of capitalization are followed less strictly in that domain.",
        "These are the problems we address in this paper.",
        "In particular, we develop a novel prior for named entity recognition that exploits the hierarchical feature space often found in natural language domains (§1.2) and allows for the transfer of information from labeled datasets in other domains (§1.3).",
        "§2 introduces the maximum entropy (maxent) and conditional random field (CRF) learning techniques employed, along with specifications for the design and training of our hierarchical prior.",
        "Finally, in §3 we present an empirical investigation of our prior's performance against a number of baselines, demonstrating both its effectiveness and robustness.",
        "In many NER problems, features are often constructed as a series of transformations of the input training data, performed in sequence.",
        "Thus, if our task is to identify tokens as either being (O)utside or (I)nside person names, and we are given the labeled sample training sentence:",
        "Give the book to Professor Caldwell",
        "one such useful feature might be: Is the token one slot to the left of the current token Professor?",
        "We can represent this symbolically as L.1.Professor where we describe the whole space ofuseful features of this form as: {direction = (L)eft, (C)urrent, (R)ight}.",
        "{distance = 1, 2, 3, ...}.",
        "{value = Professor, book, ...}.",
        "We can conceptualize this structure as a tree, where each slot in the symbolic name of a feature is a branch and each period between slots represents another level, going from root to leaf as read left to right.",
        "Thus a subsection ofthe entire feature tree for the token Caldwell could be drawn as in Figure 1 (zoomed in on the section of the tree where the L.1.Professor feature resides).",
        "direction true false ...",
        "Figure 1: Graphical representation of a hierarchical feature tree for token Caldwell in example Sentence 1.",
        "Representing feature spaces with this kind oftree, besides often coinciding with the explicit language used by common natural language toolkits (Cohen, 2004), has the added benefit of allowing a model to easily back-off, or smooth, to decreasing levels of specificity.",
        "For example, the leaf level of the feature tree for our sample Sentence 1 tells us that the word Professor is important, with respect to labeling person names, when located one slot to the left of the current word being classified.",
        "This may be useful in the context of an academic corpus, but might be less useful in a medical domain where the word Professor occurs less often.",
        "Instead, we might want to learn the related feature L.1.Dr.",
        "In fact, it might be useful to generalize across multiple domains the fact that the word immediately preceding the current word is often important with respect",

        "LeftToken.IsWord.IsTitle.equals.",
        "*",
        "LeftToken.IsWord.IsTitle.equals.mr to the named entity status of the current word.",
        "This is easily accomplished by backing up one level from a leaf in the tree structure to its parent, to represent a class of features such as L.1.*.",
        "It has been shown empirically that, while the significance of particular features might vary between domains and tasks, certain generalized classes of features retain their importance across domains (Minkov et al., 2005).",
        "By backing-off in this way, we can use the feature hierarchy as a prior for transferring beliefs about the significance of entire classes of features across domains and tasks.",
        "Some examples illustrating this idea are shown in table 1.",
        "When only the type of data being examined is allowed to vary (from news articles to e-mails, for example), the problem is called domain adaptation (Daumé III and Marcu, 2006).",
        "When the task being learned varies (say, from identifying person names to identifying protein names), the problem is called multi-task learning (Caruana, 1997).",
        "Both of these are considered specific types of the overarching transfer learning problem, and both seem to require a way of altering the classifier learned on the first problem (called the source domain, or source task) to fit the specifics of the second problem (called the target domain, or target task).",
        "More formally, given an example x and a class label y, the standard statistical classification task is to assign a probability, p(y|x), to x of belonging to class y.",
        "In the binary classification case the labels are Y e {0,1}.",
        "In the case we examine, each example x% is represented as a vector of binary features (/1(xi), • • • , fF(x^)) where F is the number of features.",
        "The data consists of two disjoint subsets: the training set (Xtmm, Ytraira) = {(x1,y1) • • • , (xN, yN)}, available to the model for its training and the test set Xtest = (x1; • • • , xM), upon which we want to use our trained classifier to make predictions.",
        "In the paradigm of inductive learning, (Xtrain, Ytrain) are known, while both Xtest and Ytest are completely hidden during training time.",
        "In this cases Xtest and Xtrain are both assumed to have been drawn from the same distribution, D. In the setting of transfer learning, however, we would like to apply our trained classifier to examples drawn from a distribution different from the one upon which it was trained.",
        "We therefore assume there are two different distributions, Vsource and Dtarget, from which data may be drawn.",
        "Given this notation we can then precisely state the transfer learning",
        "target test",
        "data (X/™, Ytrounce) drawn from Dsource.",
        "drawn from Dtarget, given training",
        "In this paper we focus on two subproblems of transfer learning:",
        "• domain adaptation, where we assume Y (the set of possible labels) is the same for both Dsourceand Dtarget, while Dsource and Dtarget themselves are allowed to vary between domains.",
        "• multi-task learning (Ando and Zhang, 2005; Caruana, 1997; Sutton and McCallum, 2005; Zhang et al., 2005) in which the task (and label set) is allowed to vary from source to target.",
        "Domain adaptation can be further distinguished by the degree ofrelatedness between the source and target domains.",
        "For example, in this work we group data collected in the same medium (e.g., all annotated emails or all annotated news articles) as belonging to the same genre.",
        "Although the specific boundary between domain and genre for a particular set of data is often subjective, it is nevertheless a useful distinction to draw.",
        "One common way of addressing the transfer learning problem is to use a prior which, in conjunction with a probabilistic model, allows one to specify a priori beliefs about a distribution, thus biasing the results a learning algorithm would have produced had it only been allowed to see the training data (Raina et al., 2006).",
        "In the example from §1.1, our belief that capitalization is less strict in emails than in news articles could be encoded in a prior that biased the importance of the capitalization feature to be lower for emails than news articles.",
        "In the next section we address the problem of how to come up with a suitable prior for transfer learning across named entity recognition problems."

        "While all three plots show HIER outperforming each of the three baselines, not surprisingly, the non-transfer GAUSS method suffers the worst, followed by the naive concatenation (CAT) baseline.",
        "Both methods fail to make any explicit distinction between the source and target domains and thus suffer when the domains differ even slightly from each other.",
        "Although the differences are more subtle, the rightmost plot of Figure 5 suggests HIER is likewise able to outperform the non-hierarchical CHELBA prior in certain transfer scenarios.",
        "CHELBA is able to avoid suffering as much as the other baselines when faced with large difference between domains, but is still unable to capture",
        "Figure 5: Comparative performance of baseline methods (GAUSS, CAT, CHELBA) vs. HIER prior, as trained on nine prior datasets (both pure and concatenated) of various sample sizes, evaluated on MUC6 and CSPACE datasets.",
        "Points below the y = x line indicate HIER outperforming baselines.",
        "as many dependencies between domains as HIER."

        "In this work we have introduced hierarchical feature tree priors for use in transfer learning on named entity extraction tasks.",
        "We have provided evidence that motivates these models on intuitive, theoretical and empirical grounds, and have gone on to demonstrate their effectiveness in relation to other, competitive transfer methods.",
        "Specifically, we have shown that hierarchical priors allow the user enough flexibility to customize their semantics to a specific problem, while providing enough structure to resist unintended negative effects when used inappropriately.",
        "Thus hierarchical priors seem a natural, effective and robust choice for transferring learning across NER datasets and tasks.",
        "Some of the first formulations of the transfer learning problem were presented over 10 years ago (Thrun, 1996; Baxter, 1997).",
        "Other techniques have tried to quantify the generalizability of certain features across domains (Daumé III and Marcu, 2006; Jiang and Zhai, 2006), or tried to exploit the common structure of related problems (Ben-David et al., 2007; Scholkopf et al., 2005).",
        "Most of this prior work deals with supervised transfer learning, and thus requires labeled source domain data, though there are examples of unsupervised (Arnold et al., 2007), semi-supervised (Grandvalet and Ben-gio, 2005; Blitzer et al., 2006), and transductive approaches (Taskar et al., 2003).",
        "Recent work using so-called meta-level priors to transfer information across tasks (Lee et al., 2007), while related, does not take into explicit account the hierarchical structure ofthese meta-level features often found in NLP tasks.",
        "Daumé allows an extra degree of freedom among the features of his domains, implicitly creating a two-level feature hierarchy with one branch for general features, and another for domain specific ones, but does not extend his hierarchy further (Daumé III, 2007)).",
        "Similarly, work on hierarchical penalization (Szafranski et al., 2007) in two-level trees tries to produce models that rely only on a relatively small number of groups of variable, as structured by the tree, as opposed to transferring knowledge between branches themselves.",
        "Our future work is focused on designing an algorithm to optimally choose a smoothing regime for the learned feature trees so as to better exploit the similarities between domains while neutralizing their differences.",
        "Along these lines, we are working on methods to reduce the amount of labeled target domain data needed to tune the prior-based models, looking forward to semi-supervised and unsupervised transfer methods.",
