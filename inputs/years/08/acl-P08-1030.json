        "Identifying events of a particular type within individual documents - 'classical' information extraction - remains a difficult task.",
        "Recognizing the different forms in which an event may be expressed, distinguishing events of different types, and finding the arguments of an event are all challenging tasks.",
        "Fortunately, many of these events will be reported multiple times, in different forms, both within the same document and within topically-related documents (i.e. a collection of documents sharing participants in potential events).",
        "We can take advantage of these alternate descriptions to improve event extraction in the original document, by favoring consistency of interpretation across sentences and documents.",
        "Several recent studies involving specific event types have stressed the benefits of going beyond traditional single-document extraction; in particular, Yangarber (2006) has emphasized this potential in his work on medical information extraction.",
        "In this paper we demonstrate that appreciable improvements are possible over the variety of event types in the ACE (Automatic Content Extraction) evaluation through the use of cross-sentence and cross-document evidence.",
        "As we shall describe below, we can make use of consistency at several levels: consistency of word sense across different instances of the same word in related documents, and consistency of arguments and roles across different mentions of the same or related events.",
        "Such methods allow us to build dynamic background knowledge as required to interpret a document and can compensate for the limited annotated training data which can be provided for each event type."

        "The 2005 ACE evaluation had 8 types of events, with 33 subtypes; for the purpose of this paper, we will treat these simply as 33 distinct event types.",

        "• A trigger is correctly labeled if its event type and offsets match a reference trigger.",
        "• An argument is correctly identified if its event type and offsets match any of the reference argument mentions.",

        "• Role Classifier: to classify arguments by argument role.",
        "• Reportable-Event Classifier: Given a trigger, an event type, and a set of arguments, to determine whether there is a reportable event mention.",
        "In the test procedure, each document is scanned for instances of triggers from the training corpus.",
        "When an instance is found, the system tries to match the environment of the trigger against the set of patterns associated with that trigger.",
        "This pattern-matching process, if successful, will assign some of the mentions in the sentence as arguments of a potential event mention.",
        "The argument classifier is applied to the remaining mentions in the sentence; for any argument passing that classifier, the role classifier is used to assign a role to it.",

        "So if we can determine the sense (event type) of a word in the related documents, this will allow us to infer its sense in the test document.",
        "In this way related documents can help recover event mentions missed by within-sentence extraction.",

        "In this section we present the results of applying this inference method to improve ACE event extraction.",
        "We used 10 newswire texts from ACE 2005 training corpora (from March to May of 2003) as our development set, and then conduct blind test on a separate set of 40 ACE 2005 newswire texts.",
        "For each test text we retrieved 25 related texts from English TDT5 corpus which in total consists of 278,108 texts (from April to September of 2003).",
        "We select the thresholds (4 with k=1~13) for various confidence metrics by optimizing the F-measure score of each rule on the development set, as shown in Figure 2 and 3 as follows.",
        "Each curve in Figure 2 and 3 shows the effect on precision and recall of varying the threshold for an individual rule.",
        "The labeled point on each curve shows the best F-measure that can be obtained on the development set by adjusting the threshold for that rule.",
        "The gain obtained by applying successive rules can be seen in the progression of successive points towards higher recall and, for argument labeling, precision.",
        "Table 5 shows the overall Precision (P), Recall (R) and F-Measure (F) scores for the blind test set.",
        "In addition, we also measured the performance of two human annotators who prepared the ACE 2005 training data on 28 newswire texts (a subset of the blind test set).",
        "The final key was produced by review and adjudication of the two annotations.",
        "Both cross-sentence and cross-document inferences provided significant improvement over the baseline with local confidence thresholds controlled.",
        "We conducted the Wilcoxon Matched-Pairs Signed-Ranks Test on a document basis.",
        "The results show that the improvement using cross-sentence inference is significant at a 99.9% confidence level for both trigger and argument labeling; adding cross-document inference is significant at a 99.9% confidence level for trigger labeling and 93.4% confidence level for argument labeling.",
        "From table 5 we can see that for trigger labeling our approach dramatically enhanced recall (22.9% improvement) with some loss (7.4%) in precision.",
        "This precision loss was much larger than that for the development set (0.3%).",
        "This indicates that the trigger propagation thresholds optimized on the development set were too low for the blind test set and thus more spurious triggers got propagated.",
        "The improved trigger labeling is better than one human annotator and only 4.7% worse than another.",
        "For argument labeling we can see that cross-sentence inference improved both identification (3.7% higher F-Measure) and classification (6.1% higher accuracy); and cross-document inference mainly provided further gains (1.9%) in classification.",
        "This shows that identification consistency may be achieved within a narrower context while the classification task favors more global background knowledge in order to solve some difficult cases.",
        "This matches the situation of human annotation as well: we may decide whether a mention is involved in some particular event or not by reading and analyzing the target sentence itself; but in order to decide the argument's role we may need to frequently refer to wider discourse in order to infer and confirm our decision.",
        "In fact sometimes it requires us to check more similar web pages or even wikipedia databases.",
        "This was exactly the intuition of our approach.",
        "We should also note that human annotators label arguments based on perfect entity mentions, but our system used the output from the IE system.",
        "So the gap was also partially due to worse entity detection.",
        "Error analysis on the inference procedure shows that the propagation rules (3), (4), (7) and (9) produced a few extra false alarms.",
        "For trigger labeling, most of these errors appear for support verbs such as \"take\" and \"get\" which can only represent an event mention together with other verbs or nouns.",
        "Some other errors happen on nouns and adjectives.",
        "These are difficult tasks even for human annotators.",
        "As shown in table 5 the inter-annotator agreement on trigger identification is only about 40%.",
        "Besides some obvious overlooked cases (it's probably difficult for a human to remember 33 different event types during annotation), most difficulties were caused by judging generic verbs, nouns and adjectives.",
        "In fact, compared to a statistical tagger trained on the corpus after expert adjudication, a human annotator tends to make more mistakes in trigger classification.",
        "For example it's hard to decide whether \"named\" represents a \"Person-nel_Nominate\" or \"PersonnelStart-Position\" event mention; \"hacked to death\" represents a \"Life_Die\" or \"Conflict_Attack\" event mention without following more specific annotation guidelines."
