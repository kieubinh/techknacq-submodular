        "This paper demonstrates a new method for leveraging free-text annotations to infer semantic properties of documents.",
        "Free-text annotations are becoming increasingly abundant, due to the recent dramatic growth in semi-structured, user-generated online content.",
        "An example of such content is product reviews, which are often annotated by their authors with pros/cons keyphrases such as \"a real bargain\" or \"good value.\"",
        "To exploit such noisy annotations, we simultaneously find a hidden paraphrase structure of the keyphrases, a model of the document texts, and the underlying semantic properties that link the two.",
        "This allows us to predict properties of unannotated documents.",
        "Our approach is implemented as a hierarchical Bayesian model with joint inference, which increases the robustness of the keyphrase clustering and encourages the document model to correlate with semantically meaningful properties.",
        "We perform several evaluations of our model, and find that it substantially outperforms alternative approaches."

        "A central problem in language understanding is transforming raw text into structured representations.",
        "Learning-based approaches have dramatically increased the scope and robustness of this type of automatic language processing, but they are typically dependent on large expert-annotated datasets, which are costly to produce.",
        "In this paper, we show how novice-generated free-text annotations available online can be leveraged to automatically infer document-level semantic properties.",
        "With the rapid increase of online content created by end users, noisy free-text annotations have pros/cons: great nutritional value ... combines it all: an amazing product, quick and friendly service, cleanliness, great nutrition...",
        "pros/cons: a bit pricey, healthy ... is an awesome place to go if you are health conscious.",
        "They have some really great low calorie dishes and they publish the calories and fat grams per serving.",

        "For example, consider reviews of consumer products and services.",
        "Often, such reviews are annotated with keyphrase lists of pros and cons.",
        "We would like to use these keyphrase lists as training labels, so that the properties of unannotated reviews can be predicted.",
        "Having such a system would facilitate structured access and summarization of this data.",
        "However, novice-generated keyphrase annotations are incomplete descriptions of their corresponding review texts.",
        "Furthermore, they lack consistency: the same underlying property may be expressed in many ways, e.g., \"healthy\" and \"great nutritional value\" (see Figure 1).",
        "To take advantage of such noisy labels, a system must both uncover their hidden clustering into properties, and learn to predict these properties from review text.",
        "This paper presents a model that addresses both problems simultaneously.",
        "We assume that both the document text and the selection of keyphrases are governed by the underlying hidden properties of the document.",
        "Each property indexes a language model, thus allowing documents that incorporate the same property to share similar features.",
        "In addition, each keyphrase is associated with a property; keyphrases that are associated with the same property should have similar distributional and surface features.",
        "We link these two ideas in a joint hierarchical Bayesian model.",
        "Keyphrases are clustered based on their distributional and lexical properties, and a hidden topic model is applied to the document text.",
        "Crucially, the keyphrase clusters and document topics are linked, and inference is performed jointly.",
        "This increases the robustness of the keyphrase clustering, and ensures that the inferred hidden topics are indicative of salient semantic properties.",
        "Our model is broadly applicable to many scenarios where documents are annotated in a noisy manner.",
        "In this work, we apply our method to a collection of reviews in two categories: restaurants and cell phones.",
        "The training data consists ofreview text and the associated pros/cons lists.",
        "We then evaluate the ability of our model to predict review properties when the pros/cons list is hidden.",
        "Across a variety of evaluation scenarios, our algorithm consistently outperforms alternative strategies by a wide margin."

        "Review Analysis Our approach relates to previous work on property extraction from reviews (Popescu et al., 2005; Hu and Liu, 2004; Kim and Hovy, 2006).",
        "These methods extract lists of phrases, which are analogous to the keyphrases we use as input to our algorithm.",
        "However, our approach is distinguished in two ways: first, we are able to predict keyphrases beyond those that appear verbatim in the text.",
        "Second, our approach learns the relationships between keyphrases, allowing us to draw direct comparisons between reviews.",
        "Bayesian Topic Modeling One aspect of our model views properties as distributions over words in the document.",
        "This approach is inspired by methods in the topic modeling literature, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003), where topics are treated as hidden variables that govern the distribution of words in a text.",
        "Our algorithm extends this notion by biasing the induced hidden topics toward a clustering of known keyphrases.",
        "Tying these two information sources together enhances the robustness of the hidden topics, thereby increasing the chance that the induced structure corresponds to semantically meaningful properties.",
        "Recent work has examined coupling topic models with explicit supervision (Blei and McAuliffe, 2007; Titov and McDonald, 2008).",
        "However, such approaches assume that the documents are labeled within a predefined annotation structure, e.g., the properties of food, ambiance, and service for restaurants.",
        "In contrast, we address free-text annotations created by end users, without known semantic properties.",
        "Rather than requiring a predefined annotation structure, our model infers one from the data."

        "In this paper, we have shown how free-text annotations provided by novice users can be leveraged as a training set for document-level semantic inference.",
        "The resulting hierarchical Bayesian model overcomes the lack of consistency in such annotations by inducing a hidden structure of semantic properties, which correspond both to clusters of keyphrases and hidden topic models in the text.",
        "Our system successfully extracts semantic properties of unannotated restaurant and cell phone reviews, empirically validating our approach.",
        "Our present model makes strong assumptions about the independence of similarity scores.",
        "We believe this could be avoided by modeling the generation of the entire similarity matrix jointly.",
        "We have also assumed that the properties themselves are unstructured, but they are in fact related in interesting ways.",
        "For example, it would be desirable to model antonyms explicitly, e.g., no restaurant review should be simultaneously labeled as having good and bad food.",
        "The correlated topic model (Blei and Lafferty, 2006) is one way to account for relationships between hidden topics; more structured representations, such as hierarchies, may also be considered.",
        "Finally, the core idea of using free-text as a source of training labels has wide applicability, and has the potential to enable sophisticated content search and analysis.",
        "For example, online blog entries are often tagged with short keyphrases.",
        "Our technique could be used to standardize these tags, and assign keyphrases to untagged blogs.",
        "The notion of free-text annotations is also very broad – we are currently exploring the applicability of this model to Wikipedia articles, using section titles as keyphrases, to build standard article schemas."
