        "As the number of image collections is rapidly growing, so does the need to browse and search them.",
        "Recent years have witnessed significant progress in developing methods for image retrieval, many of which are query-based.",
        "Given a database of images, each annotated with keywords, the query is used to retrieve relevant pictures under the assumption that the annotations can essentially capture their semantics.",
        "One stumbling block to the widespread use of query-based image retrieval systems is obtaining the keywords for the images.",
        "Since manual annotation is expensive, time-consuming and practically infeasible for large databases, there has been great interest in automating the image annotation process (see references).",
        "More formally, given an image I with visual features Vi = {vi, v2,..., vN} and a set of keywords W = {w1,w2wM}, the task consists in finding automatically the keyword subset W[ C W, which can appropriately describe the image I.",
        "Indeed, several approaches have been proposed to solve this problem under a variety of learning paradigms.",
        "These range from supervised classification (Vailaya et al., 2001; Smeulders et al., 2000) to instantiations of the noisy-channel model (Duygulu et al., 2002), to clustering (Barnard et al., 2002), and methods inspired by information retrieval (Lavrenko et al., 2003; Feng et al., 2004).",
        "Obviously in order to develop accurate image annotation models, some manually labeled data is required.",
        "Previous approaches have been developed and tested almost exclusively on the Corel database.",
        "The latter contains 600 CD-ROMs, each containing about 100 images representing the same topic or concept, e.g., people, landscape, male.",
        "Each topic is associated with keywords and these are assumed to also describe the images under this topic.",
        "As an example consider the pictures in Figure 1 which are classified under the topic male and have the description keywords man, male, people, cloth, and face.",
        "Current image annotation methods work well when large amounts of labeled images are available but can run into severe difficulties when the number of images and keywords for a given topic is relatively small.",
        "Unfortunately, databases like Corel are few and far between and somewhat idealized.",
        "Corel contains clusters of many closely related images which in turn share keyword descriptions, thus allowing models to learn image-keyword associations",
        "Figure 1: Images from the Corel database, exemplifying the concept male with keyword descriptions man, male, people, cloth, and face.",
        "reliably (Tang and Lewis, 2007).",
        "It is unlikely that models trained on this database will perform well out-of-domain on other image collections which are more noisy and do not share these characteristics.",
        "Furthermore, in order to develop robust image annotation models, it is crucial to have large and diverse datasets both for training and evaluation.",
        "In this work, we aim to relieve the data acquisition bottleneck associated with automatic image annotation by taking advantage of resources where images and their annotations co-occur naturally.",
        "News articles associated with images and their captions spring readily to mind (e.g., BBC News, Yahoo News).",
        "So, rather than laboriously annotating images with their keywords, we simply treat captions as labels.",
        "These annotations are admittedly noisy and far from ideal.",
        "Captions can be denotative (describing the objects the image depicts) but also connotative (describing sociological, political, or economic attitudes reflected in the image).",
        "Importantly, our images are not standalone, they come with news articles whose content is shared with the image.",
        "So, by processing the accompanying document, we can effectively learn about the image and reduce the effect of noise due to the approximate nature of the caption labels.",
        "To give a simple example, if two words appear both in the caption and the document, it is more likely that the annotation is genuine.",
        "In what follows, we present a new database consisting of articles, images, and their captions which we collected from an on-line news source.",
        "We then propose an image annotation model which can learn from our noisy annotations and the auxiliary documents.",
        "Specifically, we extend and modify Lavrenko's (2003) continuous relevance model to suit our task.",
        "Our experimental results show that this model can successfully scale to our database, without making use of explicit human annotations in any way.",
        "We also show that the auxiliary document contains important information for generating more accurate image descriptions."

        "The earliest approaches are closely related to image classification (Vailaya et al., 2001; Smeulders et al., 2000), where pictures are assigned a set of simple descriptions such as indoor, outdoor, landscape, people, animal.",
        "A binary classifier is trained for each concept, sometimes in a \"one vs all\" setting.",
        "The focus here is mostly on image processing and good feature selection (e.g., colour, texture, contours) rather than the annotation task itself.",

        "Another way of capturing co-occurrence information is to introduce latent variables linking image features with words.",
        "Standard latent semantic analysis (LSA) and its probabilistic variant (PLSA) have been applied to this task (Hofmann, 1998).",
        "Barnard et al.",
        "(2002) propose a hierarchical latent model in order to account for the fact that some words are more general than others.",
        "More sophisticated graphical models (Blei and Jordan, 2003) have also been employed including Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).",
        "Finally, relevance models originally developed for information retrieval, have been successfully applied to image annotation (Lavrenko et al., 2003; Feng et al., 2004).",
        "A key idea behind these models is to find the images most similar to the test image and then use their shared keywords for annotation.",
        "Our approach differs from previous work in two important respects.",
        "Firstly, our ultimate goal is to develop an image annotation model that can cope with real-world images and noisy data sets.",
        "To this end we are faced with the challenge of building an appropriate database for testing and training purposes.",
        "Our solution is to leverage the vast resource of images available on the web but also the fact that many of these images are implicitly annotated.",
        "For example, news articles often contain images whose captions can be thought of as annotations.",
        "Secondly, we allow our image annotation model access to knowledge sources other than the image and its keywords.",
        "This is relatively straightforward in our case; an image and its accompanying document have shared content, and we can use the latter to glean information about the former.",
        "But we hope to illustrate the more general point that auxiliary linguistic information can indeed bring performance improvements on the image annotation task."

        "Our work is an extension of the continuous relevance annotation model put forward in Lavrenko et al.",
        "(2003).",
        "Unlike other unsupervised approaches where a set of latent variables is introduced, each defining a joint distribution on the space of keywords and image features, the relevance model captures the joint probability of images and annotated words directly, without requiring an intermediate clustering stage.",
        "This model is a good point of departure for our task for several reasons, both theoretical and empirical.",
        "Firstly, expectations are computed over every single point in the training set and therefore parameters can be estimated without EM.",
        "Indeed, Lavrenko et al.",
        "achieve competitive performance with latent variable models.",
        "Secondly, the generation of feature vectors is modeled directly, so there is no need for quantization.",
        "Thirdly, as we show below the model can be easily extended to incorporate information outside the image and its keywords.",
        "In the following we first lay out the assumptions underlying our model.",
        "We next describe the continuous relevance model in more detail and present our extensions and modifications.",
        "Assumptions Since we are using a nonstandard database, namely images embedded in documents, it is important to clarify what we mean by image annotation, and how the precise nature of our data impacts the task.",
        "We thus make the following assumptions:",
        "1.",
        "The caption describes the content of the image directly or indirectly.",
        "Unlike traditional image annotation where keywords describe salient objects, captions supply more detailed information, not only about objects, and their attributes, but also events.",
        "In Figure 2 the caption mentions Marcin and Florent the two individuals shown in the picture but also the fact that they face competition from outside Europe.",
        "2.",
        "Since our images are implicitly rather than explicitly labeled, we do not assume that we can annotate all objects present in the image.",
        "Instead, we hope to be able to model event-related information such as \"what happened\", \"who did it\", \"when\" and \"where\".",
        "Our annotation task is therefore more semantic in nature than traditionally assumed.",
        "3.",
        "The accompanying document describes the content of the image.",
        "This is trivially true for news documents where the images conventionally depict events, objects or people mentioned in the article.",
        "To validate these assumptions, we performed the following experiment on our BBC News dataset.",
        "We randomly selected 240 image-caption pairs and manually assessed whether the caption content words (i.e., nouns, verbs, and adjectives) could describe the image.",
        "We found out that the captions express the picture's content 90% of the time.",
        "Furthermore, approximately 88% of the nouns in subject or object position directly denote salient picture objects.",
        "We thus conclude that the captions contain useful information about the picture and can be used for annotation purposes.",
        "Model Description The continuous relevance image annotation model (Lavrenko et al., 2003) generatively learns the joint probability distribution P(V, W) of words W and image regions V. The key assumption here is that the process of generating images is conditionally independent from the process of generating words.",
        "Each annotated image in the training set is treated as a latent variable.",
        "Then for an unknown image I, we estimate:",
        "where D is the number of images in the training database, Vi are visual features of the image regions representing i, Wi are the keywords of i, s is a latent variable (i.e., an image-annotation pair), and P(s) the prior probability of s. The latter is drawn from a uniform distribution:",

        "According to equation (3), a Gaussian kernel is fit to every feature vector vi corresponding to region i in the image of the latent variable s. Each kernel here is determined by the feature covariance matrix £, and for simplicity, £ is assumed to be a diagonal matrix: £ = |3I, where I is the identity matrix; and P is a scalar modulating the bandwidth of the kernel whose value is optimized on the development set.",
        "Lavrenko et al.",
        "(2003) estimate the word probabilities P(WI\\s) using a multinomial distribution.",
        "This is a reasonable assumption in the Corel dataset, where the annotations have similar lengths and the words reflect the salience of objects in the image (the multinomial model tends to favor words that appear multiple times in the annotation).",
        "However, in our dataset the annotations have varying lengths, and do not necessarily reflect object salience.",
        "We are more interested in modeling the presence or absence of words in the annotation and thus use the multiple-Bernoulli distribution to generate words (Feng et al., 2004).",
        "And rather than relying solely on annotations in the training database, we can also take the accompanying document into account using a weighted combination.",
        "The probability of sampling a set of words W given a latent variable s from the underlying multiple Bernoulli distribution that has generated the training set D is:",
        "where P(w\\s) denotes the probability of the w'th component of the multiple Bernoulli distribution.",
        "Now, in estimating P(w s) we can include the document as:",
        "where a is a smoothing parameter tuned on the development set, sa is the annotation for the latent variable s and sd its corresponding document.",
        "Equation (5) smooths the influence of the annotation words and allows to offset the negative effect of the noise inherent in our dataset.",
        "Since our images are implicitly annotated, there is no guarantee that the annotations are all appropriate.",
        "By taking into account Pest(w\\sd), it is possible to annotate an image with a word that appears in the document but is not included in the caption.",
        "We use a Bayesian framework for estimating Pest(w\\sa).",
        "Specifically, we assume a beta prior (conjugate to the Bernoulli distribution) for each word:",
        "where y is a smoothing parameter estimated on the development set, bwsa is a Boolean variable denoting whether w appears in the annotation sa, and Nw is the number of latent variables that contain w in their annotations.",
        "We estimate Pest(w sd) using maximum likelihood estimation (Ponte and Croft, 1998):",
        "where numwsi denotes the frequency of w in the accompanying document of latent variable s and numsdthe number of all tokens in the document.",
        "Note that we purposely leave Pest unsmoothed, since it is used as a means of balancing the weight of word frequencies in annotations.",
        "So, if a word does not appear in the document, the possibility of selecting it will not be greater than a (see Equation (5)).",
        "Unfortunately, including the document in the estimation of Pest (w\\s) increases the vocabulary which in turn increases computation time.",
        "Given a test image-document pair, we must evaluate P(w\\VI) for every w in our vocabulary which is the union of the caption and document words.",
        "We reduce the search space, by scoring each document word with its tf * idf weight (Salton and McGill, 1983) and adding the n-best candidates to our caption vocabulary.",
        "This way the vocabulary is not fixed in advance for all images but changes dynamically depending on the document at hand.",
        "Re-ranking the Annotation Hypotheses It is easy to see that the output of our model is a ranked word list.",
        "Typically, the k-best words are taken to be the automatic annotations for a test image I (Duygulu et al., 2002; Lavrenko et al., 2003; Jeon and Manmatha, 2004) where k is a small number and the same for all images.",
        "So far we have taken account of the auxiliary document rather naively, by considering its vocabulary in the estimation of P(W\\s).",
        "Crucially, documents are written with one or more topics in mind.",
        "The image (and its annotations) are likely to represent these topics, so ideally our model should prefer words that are strong topic indicators.",
        "A simple way to implement this idea is by re-ranking our k-best list according to a topic model estimated from the entire document collection.",
        "Specifically, we use Latent Dirichlet Allocation represents documents as a mixture of topics and has been previously used to perform document classification (Blei et al., 2003) and ad-hoc information retrieval (Wei and Croft, 2006) with good results.",
        "Given a collection of documents and a set of latent variables (i.e., the number of topics), the LDA model estimates the probability of topics per document and the probability of words per topic.",
        "The topic mixture is drawn from a conjugate Dirichlet prior that remains the same for all documents.",
        "For our re-ranking task, we use the LDA model to infer the m-best topics in the accompanying document.",
        "We then select from the output of our model those words that are most likely according to these topics.",
        "To give a concrete example, let us assume that for a given image our model has produced five annotations, w1, w2, w3, w4, and w5.",
        "However, according to the LDA model neither w2 nor w5 are likely topic indicators.",
        "We therefore remove w2 and w5 and substitute them with words further down the ranked list that are topical (e.g., w6 and w7).",
        "An advantage of using LDA is that at test time we can perform inference without retraining the topic model."

        "In this paper, we describe a new approach for the collection of image annotation datasets.",
        "Specifically, we leverage the vast resource of images available on the Internet while exploiting the fact that many of them are labeled with captions.",
        "Our experiments show that it is possible to learn an image annotation model from caption-picture pairs even if these are not explicitly annotated in any way.",
        "We also show that the annotation model benefits substantially from additional information, beyond the caption or image.",
        "In our case this information is provided by the news documents associated with the pictures.",
        "But more generally our results indicate that further linguistic knowledge is needed to improve performance on the image annotation task.",
        "For instance, resources like WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) can be used to expand the annotations by exploiting information about is-a relationships.",
        "The uses of the database discussed in this article are many and varied.",
        "An interesting future direction concerns the application of the proposed model in a semi-supervised setting where the annotation output is iteratively refined with some manual intervention.",
        "Another possibility would be to use the document to increase the annotation keywords by identifying synonyms or even sentences that are similar to the image caption.",
        "Also note that our analysis of the accompanying document was rather shallow, limited to part of speech tagging.",
        "It is reasonable to assume that results would improve with more sophisticated preprocessing (i.e., named entity recognition, parsing, word sense disambiguation).",
        "Finally, we also believe that the model proposed here can be usefully employed in an information retrieval setting, where the goal is to find the image most relevant for a given query or document.",
