        "Hedge detection seeks to perform a kind of semantic filtering of texts, that is it tries to separate factual statements from speculative/uncertain ones.",
        "To demonstrate the detrimental effects of speculative language on biomedical NLP tasks, we will consider two inherently different sample tasks, namely the ICD-9-CM coding ofradiology records and gene information extraction from biomedical scientific texts.",
        "The general features of texts used in these tasks differ significantly from each other, but both tasks require the exclusion of uncertain (or speculative) items from processing.",
        "The test set of the hedge classification dataset (Medlock and Briscoe, 2007) has also been annotated for gene names.",
        "Examples of speculative assertions: Thus, the D-mib wing phenotype may result from defective N inductive signaling at the D-V boundary.",
        "A similar role ofCroquemort has not yet been tested, but seems likely since the crq mutant used in this study (crqKG01679) is lethal in pupae.",
        "After an automatic parallelisation of the 2 annotations (sentence matching) we found that a significant part of the gene names mentioned (638 occurences out of a total of 1968) appears in a speculative sentence.",
        "This means that approximately 1 in every 3 genes should be excluded from the interaction detection process.",
        "These results suggest that a major portion of system false positives could be due to hedging if hedge detection had been neglected by a gene interaction extraction system.",
        "Automating the assignment of ICD-9-CM codes for radiology records was the subject ofa shared task challenge organised in Spring 2007.",
        "The detailed description of the task, and the challenge itself can be found in (Pestian et al., 2007) and online.",
        "ICD-9-CM codes that are assigned to each report after the patient's clinical treatment are used for the reimbursement process by insurance companies.",
        "There are official guidelines for coding radiology reports (Moisio, 2006).",
        "These guidelines strictly state that an uncertain diagnosis should never be coded, hence identifying reports with a diagnosis in a speculative context is an inevitable step in the development of automated ICD-9-CM coding systems.",
        "The following examples illustrate a typical non-speculative context where a given code should be added, and a speculative context where the same code should never be assigned to the report: non-speculative: Subsegmental atelectasis in the left lower lobe, otherwise normal exam.",
        "speculative: Findings suggesting viral or reactive airway disease with right lower lobe atelectasis or pneumonia.",
        "In an ICD-9 coding system developed for the challenge, the inclusion of a hedge classifier module (a simple keyword-based lookup method with 38 keywords) improved the overall system performance from 79.7% to 89.3%.",
        "Although a fair amount of literature on hedging in scientific texts has been produced since the 1990s (e.g. (Hyland, 1994)), speculative language from a Natural Language Processing perspective has only been studied in the past few years.",
        "This phenomenon, together with others used to express forms of authorial opinion, is often classified under the notion of subjectivity (Wiebe et al., 2004), (Shana-han et al., 2005).",
        "Previous studies (Light et al., 2004) showed that the detection of hedging can be solved effectively by looking for specific keywords which imply that the content of a sentence is speculative and constructing simple expert rules that describe the circumstances of where and how a keyword should appear.",
        "Another possibility is to treat the problem as a classification task and train a statistical model to discriminate speculative and non-speculative assertions.",
        "This approach requires the availability of labeled instances to train the models on.",

        "• The construction of a complex feature selection procedure which successfully reduces the number of keyword candidates without excluding helpful keywords.",
        "• We demonstrate that with a very limited amount of expert supervision in finalising the feature representation, it is possible to build accurate hedge classifiers from (semi-) automatically collected training data.",
        "• The extension of the feature representation used by previous works with bigrams and tri-grams and an evaluation of the benefit of using longer keywords in hedge classification.",
        "• We annotated a small test corpora of biomedical scientific papers from a different source to demonstrate that hedge keywords are highly task-specific and thus constructing models that generalise well from one task to another is not feasible without a noticeable loss in accuracy."

        "As VSM is inadequate for capturing the (possibly relevant) relations between subsequent tokens, we decided to extend the representation with bi-and trigrams of words.",
        "We chose not to add any weighting of features (by frequency or importance) and for the Maximum Entropy Model classifier we included binary data about whether single features occurred in the given context or not.",
        "To build our classifier models, we used the dataset gathered and made available by (Medlock and Briscoe, 2007).",
        "They commenced with the seed set Sspec gathered automatically (all sentences containing suggest or likely - two very good speculative keywords), and Snspec that consisted of randomly selected sentences from which the most probable speculative instances were filtered out by a pattern matching and manual supervision procedure.",

        "• Order U by P (spec) values assigned by the classifier",
        "• Tspec – most probable batch",
        "• Tnspec – least probable batch",
        "What makes this iterative method efficient is that, as we said earlier, hedging is expressed via keywords in natural language texts; and often several keywords are present in a single sentence.",
        "The seed set Sspec contained either suggest or likely, and due to the fact that other keywords cooccur with these two in many sentences, they appeared in Sspec with reasonable frequency.",
        "For example, P(spec\\may) = 0.9985 on the seed sets created by (Medlock and Briscoe, 2007).",
        "The iterative extension of the training sets for each class further boosted this effect, and skewed the distribution of speculative indicators as sentences containing them were likely to be added to the extended training set for the speculative class, and unlikely to fall into the non-speculative set.",
        "We should add here that the very same feature has an inevitable, but very important side effect that is detrimental to the classification accuracy of models trained on a dataset which has been obtained this way.",
        "This side effect is that other words (often common words or stopwords) that tend to cooccur with hedge cues will also be subject to the same iterative distortion of their distribution in speculative and non-speculative uses.",
        "Perhaps the best example of this is the word it.",
        "Being a stopword in our case, and having no relevance at all to speculative assertions, it has a class conditional probability of P(spec\\it) = 74.67% on the seed sets.",
        "This is due to the use of phrases like it suggests that, it is likely, and so on.",
        "After the iterative extension of training sets, the class-conditional probability of it dramatically increased, to P(spec\\it) = 94.32%.",
        "This is a consequence of the frequent co-occurence of it with meaningful hedge cues and the probabilistic model used and happens with many other irrelevant terms (not just stopwords).",
        "The automatic elimination of these irrelevant candidates is one of our main goals (to limit the number of candidates for manual consideration and thus to reduce the human effort required to select meaningful hedge cues).",
        "This shows that, in addition to the desired effect of introducing further speculative keywords and biasing their distribution towards the speculative class, this iterative process also introduces significant noise into the dataset.",
        "This observation led us to the conclusion that in order to build efficient classifiers based on this kind of dataset, we should filter out noise.",
        "In the next part we will present our feature selection procedure (evaluated in the Results section) which is capable of underranking irrelevant keywords in the majority of cases.",
        "To handle the inherent noise in the training dataset that originates from its weakly supervised construction, we applied the following feature selection procedure.",
        "The main idea behind it is that it is unlikely that more than two keywords are present in the text, which are useful for deciding whether an instance is speculative.",
        "Here we performed the following steps:",
        "1.",
        "We ranked the features x by frequency and their class conditional probability P(spec\\x).",
        "We then selected those features that had P(spec\\x) > 0.94 (this threshold was chosen arbitrarily) and appeared in the training dataset with reasonable frequency (frequency above 10-5).",
        "This set constituted the 2407 candidates which we used in the second analysis phase.",
        "2.",
        "For trigrams, bigrams and unigrams - processed separately - we calculated a new class-conditional probability for each feature x, discarding those observations of x in speculative instances where x was not among the two highest ranked candidate.",
        "Negative credit was given for all occurrences in non-speculative contexts.",
        "We discarded any feature that became unreliable (i.e. any whose frequency dropped below the threshold or the strict class-conditional probability dropped below 0.94).",
        "We did this separately for the uni-, bi-and trigrams to avoid filtering out longer phrases because more frequent, shorter candidates took the credit for all their occurrences.",
        "In this step we filtered out 85% of all the keyword candidates and kept 362 uni-, bi-, and trigrams altogether.",
        "3.",
        "In the next step we re-evaluated all 362 candidates together and filtered out all phrases that had a shorter and thus more frequent substring of themselves among the features, with a similar class-conditional probability on the speculative class (worse by 2% at most).",
        "Here we discarded a further 30% of the candidates and kept 253 uni-, bi-, and trigrams altogether.",
        "This efficient way of reranking and selecting potentially relevant features (we managed to discard 89.5% of all the initial candidates automatically) made it easier for us to manually validate the remaining keywords.",
        "This allowed us to incorporate supervision into the learning model in the feature representation stage, but keep the weakly supervised modelling (with only 5 minutes of expert supervision required).",
        "Maximum Entropy Models (Berger et al., 1996) seek to maximise the conditional probability of classes, given certain observations (features).",
        "This is performed by weighting features to maximise the likelihood of data and, for each instance, decisions are made based on features present at that point, thus maxent classification is quite suitable for our purposes.",
        "As feature weights are mutually estimated, the maxent classifier is capable of taking feature dependence into account.",
        "This is useful in cases like the feature it being dependent on others when observed in a speculative context.",

        "On the other hand, it proved to be useful to consider bi-and trigrams as hedge cues in scientific texts.",
        "This, and the fact that many hedge cues were found to be ambiguous (they appeared in both speculative and non-speculative assertions) can be attributed to the literary style of the articles.",
        "Next, as the learnt maximum entropy models show, the hedge classification task reduces to a lookup for single keywords or phrases and to the evaluation of the text based on the most relevant cue alone.",
        "Removing those features that were insufficient to classify an instance as a hedge individually did not produce any difference in the F^=1 (spec) scores.",

        "((Wiebe et al., 2004)), who addressed the broader task of subjectivity learning and found that the density of other potentially subjective cues in the context benefits classification accuracy, we observed that the co-occurence of speculative cues in a sentence does not help in classifying a term as speculative or not.",
        "Realising that our learnt models never predicted speculative labels based on the presence of two or more individually weak cues and discarding such terms that were not reliable enough to predict a speculative label (using that term alone as a single feature) slightly improved performance, we came to the conclusion that even though speculative keywords tend to cooccur, and two keywords are present in many sentences; hedge cues have a speculative meaning (or not) on their own without the other term having much impact on this.",

        "The main issue thus lies in the selection of keywords, for which we proposed a procedure that is capable of reducing the number of candidates to an acceptable level for human evaluation - even in data collected automatically and thus having some undesirable properties.",
        "The worse results on biomedical scientific papers from a different source also corroborates our finding that hedge cues can be highly ambiguous.",
        "In our experiments two keywords that are practically never used in a non-speculative context in the Fly-Base articles we used for training were responsible for 50% of false positives in BMC texts since they were used in a different meaning.",
        "In our case, the keywords possible and likely are apparently always used as speculative terms in the FlyBase articles used, while the articles from BMC Bioinformat-ics frequently used such cliche phrases as all possible combinations or less likely / more likely .",

        "This shows that the portability of hedge classifiers is limited, and cannot really be done without the examination of the specific features of target texts or a more heterogenous corpus is required for training.",
        "The construction of hedge classifiers for each separate target application in a weakly supervised way seems feasible though.",
        "Collecting bi-and trigrams which cover non-speculative usages of otherwise common hedge cues is a promising solution for addressing the false positives in hedge classifiers and for improving the portability of hedge modules.",
        "In this paper we focused on the recognition of hedge cues in texts.",
        "Another important issue would be to determine the scope of hedge cues in order to locate uncertain sentence parts.",
        "This can be solved effectively using a parser adapted for biomedical papers.",
        "We manually evaluated the parse trees generated by (Miyao and Tsujii, 2005) and came to the conclusion that for each keyword it is possible to define the scope of the keyword using subtrees linked to the keyword in the predicate-argument syntactic structure or by the immediate subsequent phrase (e.g. prepositional phrase).",
        "Naturally, parse errors result in (slightly) mislocated scopes but we had the general impression that state-of-the-art parsers could be used efficiently for this issue.",
        "On the other hand, this approach requires a human expert to define the scope for each keyword separately using the predicate-argument relations, or to determine keywords that act similarly and their scope can be located with the same rules.",
        "Another possibility is simply to define the scope to be each token up to the end of the sentence (and optionally to the previous punctuation mark).",
        "The latter solution has been implemented by us and works accurately for clinical free texts.",
        "This simple algorithm is similar to NegEx (Chapman et al., 2001) as we use a list of phrases and their context, but we look for punctuation marks to determine the scopes of keywords instead of applying a fixed window size."
