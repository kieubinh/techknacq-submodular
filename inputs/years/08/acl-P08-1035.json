        "For better or worse, much of prior work on sentence compression (Riezler et al., 2003; McDonald, 2006; Turner and Charniak, 2005) turned to a single corpus developed by Knight and Marcu (2002) (K&M, henceforth) for evaluating their approaches.",
        "The K&M corpus is a moderately sized corpus consisting of 1,087 pairs of sentence and compression, which account for about 2% of a Ziff-Davis collection from which it was derived.",
        "Despite its limited scale, prior work in sentence compression relied heavily on this particular corpus for establishing results (Turner and Charniak, 2005; McDonald, 2006; Clarke and Lapata, 2006; Galley and McKe-own, 2007).",
        "It was not until recently that researchers started to turn attention to an alternative approach which does not require supervised data (Turner and",
        "Charniak, 2005).",
        "Our approach is broadly in line with prior work",
        "Clarke and Lapata, 2006), in that we make use of some form of syntactic knowledge to constrain compressions we generate.",
        "What sets this work apart from them, however, is a novel use we make of Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to select among possible compressions (Lafferty et al., 2001; Sutton and McCallum, 2006).",
        "An obvious benefit of using CRFs for sentence compression is that the model provides a general (and principled) probabilistic framework which permits information from various sources to be integrated towards compressing sentence, a property K&M do not share.",
        "Nonetheless, there is some cost that comes with the straightforward use of CRFs as a discriminative classifier in sentence compression; its outputs are often ungrammatical and it allows no control over the length of compression they generates (Nomoto, 2007).",
        "We tackle the issues by harnessing CRFs with what we might call dependency truncation, whose goal is to restrict CRFs to working with candidates that conform to the grammar.",
        "Thus, unlike McDonald (2006), Clarke and Lapata (2006) and Cohn and Lapata (2007), we do not insist on finding a globally optimal solution in the space of 2n possible compressions for an n word long sentence.",
        "Rather we insist on finding a most plausible compression among those that are explicitly warranted by the grammar.",
        "Later in the paper, we will introduce an approach called the 'Dependency Path Model' (DPM) from the previous literature (Section 4), which purports to provide a robust framework for sentence compression in Japanese.",
        "We will look at how the present approach compares with that of DPM in Section 6."

        "Our idea on how to make CRFs comply with grammar is quite simple: we focus on only those label sequences that are associated with grammatically correct compressions, by making CRFs look at only those that comply with some grammatical constraints G, and ignore others, regardless of how probable they are.",
        "But how do we find compressions that are grammatical?",
        "To address the issue, rather than resort to statistical generation models as in the previous literature (Cohn and Lapata, 2007; Galley and McKeown, 2007), we pursue a particular rule-based approach we call a 'dependency truncation,' which as we will see, gives us a greater control over the form that compression takes.",

        "Whatever choice we make for compression among candidates in G(S), should be grammatical, since they all are.",
        "One linguistic feature of the Japanese language we need to take into account when generating compressions, is that the sentence, which is free of word order and verb-final, typically takes a left-branching structure as in Figure 1, consisting of an array of morphological units called bunsetsu (BS, henceforth).",
        "A BS, which we might regard as an inflected form (case marked in the case of nouns) of verb, adjective, and noun, could involve one or more independent linguistic elements such as noun, case particle, but acts as a morphological atom, in that it cannot be torn apart, or partially deleted, without compromising the grammaticality.Noting that a Japanese sentence typically consists of a sequence of case marked NPs and adjuncts, followed by a main verb at the end (or what would be called 'matrix verb' in linguistics), we seek to compress each of the major chunks in the sentence, leaving untouched the matrix verb, as its removal often leaves the sentence unintelligible.",
        "In particular, starting with the leftmost BS in a major constituent, we work up the tree by pruning BSs on our way up, which in general gives rise to grammatically legitimate compressions of various lengths (Figure 2).",
        "More specifically, we take the following steps to construct G(S).",
        "Let S = abcde.",
        "Assume that it has a dependency structure as in Figure 3.",
        "We begin by locating terminal nodes, i.e., those which have no incoming edges, depicted as filled circles in Figure 3, and find a dependency (singly linked) path from each terminal node to the root, or a node labeled 'e' here, which would give us two paths pi = a-c-d-e and p2 = b-c-d-e (call them terminating dependency paths, or TDPs).",
        "Now create a set T of all trimmings, or suffixes of each TDP, including an empty string:",
        "Then we merge subpaths from the two sets in every possible way, i.e., for any two subpaths ti £ T(pi) and t2 £ T(p2), we take aunion over nodes in ti and t2; Figure 4 shows how this might done.",
        "We remove duplicates if any.",
        "This would give us G(S)={{a b c {}}, a set of compressions over S based on TDPs.",
        "What is interesting about the idea is that creating G(S) does not involve much of anything that is specific to a given language.",
        "Indeed this could be done on English as well.",
        "Take for instance a sentence at the top of Table 1, which is a slightly modified lead sentence from an article in the New York Times.",
        "Assume that we have a relevant dependency structure as shown in Figure 5, where we have three TDPs, i.e., one with southern, one with British and one with lethal.",
        "Then G(S) would include those listed in Table 1.",
        "A major difference from Japanese lies in the direction in which a tree is branching out: right versus left.",
        "Having said this, we need to address some language specific constraints: in Japanese, for instance, we should keep a topic marked NP in compression as its removal often leads to a decreased readability; and also it is grammatically wrong to start any compressed segment with sentence nominalizers such as",

        "An important point about the dependency truncation is that for most of the time, a compression it generates comes out reasonably grammatical, so the number of 'extras' should be small.",
        "Finally, in order for CRFs to work with the compressions, we need to translate them into a sequence of binary labels, which involves labeling an element token, bunsetsu or a word, with some label, e.g., 0 for 'remove' and 1 for 'retain,' as in Figure 6.",

        "We note that the approach here does not rely on so much of CRFs as a discriminative classiier as CRFs as a strategy for ranking among a limited set of label sequences which correspond to syntactically plausible simpli-ications of input sentence.",
