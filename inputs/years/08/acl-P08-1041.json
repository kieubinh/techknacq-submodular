        "With the ever increasing popularity of emails, it is very common nowadays that people discuss specific issues, events or tasks among a group of people by emails(Fisher and Moody, 2002).",
        "Those discussions can be viewed as conversations via emails and are valuable for the user as a personal information repository(Ducheneaut and Bellotti, 2001).",
        "In this paper, we study the problem of summarizing email conversations.",
        "Solutions to this problem can help users access the information embedded in emails more effectively.",
        "For instance, 10 minutes before a meeting, a user may want to quickly go through a previous discussion via emails that is going to be discussed soon.",
        "In that case, rather than reading each individual email one by one, it would be preferable to read a concise summary of the previous discussion with the major information summarized.",
        "Email summarization is also helpful for mobile email users on a small screen.",
        "Summarizing email conversations is challenging due to the characteristics of emails, especially the conversational nature.",
        "Most of the existing methods dealing with email conversations use the email thread to represent the email conversation structure, which is not accurate in many cases (Yeh and Harnly, 2006).",
        "Meanwhile, most existing email summarization approaches use quantitative features to describe the conversation structure, e.g., number of recipients and responses, and apply some general multi-document summarization methods to extract some sentences as the summary (Rambow et al., 2004) (Wan and McKeown, 2004).",
        "Although such methods consider the conversation structure somehow, they simplify the conversation structure into several features and do not fully utilize it into the summarization process.",
        "In contrast, in this paper, we propose new summarization approaches by sentence extraction, which rely on a fine-grain representation of the conversation structure.",
        "We first build a sentence quotation graph by content analysis.",
        "This graph not only captures the conversation structure more accurately, especially for selective quotations, but it also represents the conversation structure at the finer granularity of sentences.",
        "As a second contribution of this paper, we study several ways to measure the cohesion between parent and child sentences in the quotation graph: clue words (re-occurring words in the reply) (Carenini et al., 2007), semantic similarity and cosine similarity.",
        "Hence, we can directly evaluate the importance of each sentence in terms of its cohesion with related ones in the graph.",
        "The extractive summarization problem can be viewed as a node ranking problem.",
        "We apply two summarization algorithms, Generalized ClueWordSummarizer and Page-Rank to rank nodes in the sentence quotation graph and to select the corresponding most highly ranked sentences as the summary.",
        "Subjective opinions are often critical in many conversations.",
        "As a third contribution of this paper, we study how to make use of the subjective opinions expressed in emails to support the summarization task.",
        "We integrate our best cohesion measure together with the subjective opinions.",
        "Our empirical evaluations show that subjective words and phrases can significantly improve email summarization.",
        "To summarize, this paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we discuss related work.",
        "After building a sentence quotation graph to represent the conversation structure in Section 3, we apply two summarization methods in Section 4.",
        "In Section 5, we study summarization approaches with subjective opinions.",
        "Section 6 presents the empirical evaluation of our methods.",
        "We conclude this paper and propose future work in Section 7."

        "For email summarization by sentence extraction, the fragment granularity may be inadequate.",

        "Third, we did not consider subjective opinions.",
        "Finally, we did not compared CWS to other possible graph-based approaches as we propose in this paper.",
        "Other than for email summarization, other document summarization methods have adopted graphranking algorithms for summarization, e.g., (Wan et al., 2007), (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004) and (Erkan and Radev, 2004).",
        "Those methods built a complete graph for all sentences in one or multiple documents and measure the similarity between every pair of sentences.",
        "Graph-ranking algorithms, e.g., Page-Rank (Brin and Page, 1998), are then applied to rank those sentences.",
        "Our method is different from them.",
        "First, instead of using the complete graph, we build the graph based on the conversation structure.",
        "Second, we try various ways to compute the similarity among sentences and the ranking of the sentences.",
        "Several studies in the NLP literature have explored the reoccurrence of similar words within one document due to text cohesion.",
        "The idea has been formalized in the construct of lexical chains (Barzi-lay and Elhadad, 1997).",
        "While our approach and lexical chains both rely on lexical cohesion, they are quite different with respect to the kind of linkages considered.",
        "Lexical chain is only based on similarities between lexical items in contiguous sentences.",
        "In contrast, in our approach, the linkage is based on the existing conversation structure.",

        "We first use ANOVA to compare the four methods.",
        "For the pyramid precision, the F ratio is 50, and the p-value is 2.1E-29.",
        "This shows that the four methods are significantly different in the average accuracy.",
        "In Table 1, by comparing CWS with the other methods, we can see that CWS obtains the highest precision (0.60).",
        "The widely used cosine similarity does not perform well.",
        "Its precision (0.39) is about half of the precision of CWS with a p-value less than 0.0001.",
        "This clearly shows that CWS is significantly better than CWS-Cosine.",
        "Meanwhile, both semantic similarities have lower accuracy than CWS, and the differences are also statistically significant even with the conservative Bonferroni adjustment (i.e., the p-values in Table 1 are multiplied by three).",
        "The above experiments show that the widely used cosine similarity and the more sophisticated semantic similarity in WordNet are less accurate than the basic CWS in the summarization framework.",
        "This is an interesting result and can be viewed at least from the following two aspects.",
        "First, clue words, though straight forward, are good at capturing the important sentences within an email conversation.",
        "The higher accuracy of CWS may suggest that people tend to use the same words to communicate in email conversations.",
        "Some related words in the previous emails are adopted exactly or in another similar format (modulo stemming).",
        "This is different from other documents such as newspaper articles and formal reports.",
        "In those cases, the authors are usually professional in writing and choose their words carefully, even intentionally avoid repeating the same words to gain some diversity.",
        "However, for email conversation summarization, this does not appear to be the case.",
        "Moreover, in the previous discussion we only considered the accuracy in precision without considering the runtime issue.",
        "In order to have an idea of the runtime of the two methods, we did the following comparison.",
        "We randomly picked 1000 pairs of words from the 20 conversations and compute their semantic distance in \"jcn\".",
        "It takes about 0.056 seconds to get the semantic similarity for one pair on the average.",
        "In contrast, when the weight of edges are computed based on clue words, the average runtime to compute the SentScore for all sentences in a conversation is only 0.05 seconds, which is even a little less than the time to compute the semantic similarity of one pair of words.",
        "In other words, when CWS has generated the summary of one conversation, we can only get the semantic distance between one pair of words.",
        "Note that for each edge in the sentence quotation graph, we need to compute the distance for every pair of words in each sentence.",
        "Hence, the empirical results do not support the use of semantic similarity.",
