        "Prosodic, lexical, and disfluency factors that increase ASR error rates",
        "Many factors are thought to increase the chances of misrecognizing a word in ASR, including low frequency, nearby disfluencies, short duration, and being at the start of a turn.",
        "However, few of these factors have been formally examined.",
        "This paper analyzes a variety of lexical, prosodic, and disfluency factors to determine which are likely to increase ASR error rates.",
        "Findings include the following.",
        "(1) For disfluencies, effects depend on the type of disfluency: errors increase by up to 15% (absolute) for words near fragments, but decrease by up to 7.2% (absolute) for words near repetitions.",
        "This decrease seems to be due to longer word duration.",
        "(2) For prosodic features, there are more errors for words with extreme values than words with typical values.",
        "(3) Although our results are based on output from a system with speaker adaptation, speaker differences are a major factor influencing error rates, and the effects of features such as frequency, pitch, and intensity may vary between speakers."

        "In order to improve the performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems on conversational speech, it is important to understand the factors that cause problems in recognizing words.",
        "Previous work on recognition of spontaneous monologues and dialogues has shown that infrequent words are more likely to be misrecognized (Fosler-Lussier and Morgan, 1999; Shinozaki and Furui, 2001) and that fast speech increases error rates (Siegler and Stern, 1995; Fosler-Lussier and Morgan, 1999; Shinozaki and Furui, 2001).",
        "Siegler and Stern (1995) and Shinozaki and Furui (2001) also found higher error rates in very slow speech.",
        "Word length (in phones) has also been found to be a useful predictor of higher error rates (Shinozaki and Furui, 2001).",
        "In Hirschberg et al.",
        "'s (2004) analysis of two human-computer dialogue systems, misrecog-nized turns were found to have (on average) higher maximum pitch and energy than correctly recognized turns.",
        "Results for speech rate were ambiguous: faster utterances had higher error rates in one corpus, but lower error rates in the other.",
        "Finally, Adda-Decker and Lamel (2005) demonstrated that both French and English ASR systems had more trouble with male speakers than female speakers, and found several possible explanations, including higher rates of disfluencies and more reduction.",
        "Many questions are left unanswered by these previous studies.",
        "In the word-level analyses of Fosler-Lussier and Morgan (1999) and Shinozaki and Fu-rui (2001), only substitution and deletion errors were considered, so we do not know how including insertions might affect the results.",
        "Moreover, these studies primarily analyzed lexical, rather than prosodic, factors.",
        "Hirschberg et al.",
        "'s (2004) work suggests that prosodic factors can impact error rates, but leaves open the question of which factors are important at the word level and how they influence recognition of natural conversational speech.",
        "Adda-Decker and Lamel's (2005) suggestion that higher rates of dis-fluency are a cause of worse recognition for male speakers presupposes that disfluencies raise error rates.",
        "While this assumption seems natural, it has yet to be carefully tested, and in particular we do not know whether disfluent words are associated with errors in adjacent words, or are simply more likely to be misrecognized themselves.",
        "Other factors that are often thought to affect a word's recognition, such as its status as a content or function word, and whether it starts a turn, also remain unexamined.",
        "The present study is designed to address all of these questions by analyzing the effects of a wide range of lexical and prosodic factors on the accuracy of an English ASR system for conversational telephone speech.",
        "In the remainder ofthis paper, we first describe the data set used in our study and introduce a new measure of error, individual word error rate (IWER), that allows us to include insertion errors in our analysis, along with deletions and substitutions.",
        "Next, we present the features we collected for each word and the effects of those features individually on IWER.",
        "Finally, we develop a joint statistical model to examine the effects of each feature while controlling for possible correlations.",
        "For our analysis, we used the output from the SRI/ICSI/UW RT-04 CTS system (Stolcke et al., 2006) on the NIST RT-03 development set.",
        "This system's performance was state-of-the-art at the time of the 2004 evaluation.",
        "The data set contains 36 telephone conversations (72 speakers, 38477 reference words), half from the Fisher corpus and half from the Switchboard corpus.",
        "The standard measure of error used in ASR is word error rate (WER), computed as 100(7 + D + S) / R, where I, D and S are the number of insertions, deletions, and substitutions found by aligning the ASR hypotheses with the reference transcriptions, and R is the number of reference words.",
        "Since we wish to know what features of a reference word increase the probability of an error, we need a way to measure the errors attributable to individual words â€“ an individual word error rate (IWER).",
        "We assume that a substitution or deletion error can be assigned to its corresponding reference word, but for insertion errors, there may be two adjacent reference words that could be responsible.",
        "Our solution is to assign any insertion errors to each of",
        "Table 1: Individual word error rates for different word types, and the proportion of words belonging to each type.",
        "Deletions of filled pauses, fragments, and guesses are not counted as errors in the standard scoring method.",
        "the adjacent words.",
        "We could then define IWER as 100(n + nd + ns)/R, where ni, nd, and ns are the insertion, deletion, and substitution counts for individual words (with nd = D and ns = S).",
        "In general, however, ni > I, so that the IWER for a given data set would be larger than the WER.",
        "To facilitate comparisons with standard WER, we therefore discount insertions by a factor a, such that ani = I.",
        "In this study, a = .617."

        "Figure 2 shows that words with longer duration have lower IWER.",
        "Since words with more phones tend to have longer duration, but lower frequency, there is no overall effect of length.",
        "Figure 2 shows that means of pitch and intensity have relatively little effect except at extreme values, where more errors occur.",
        "In contrast, pitch and intensity range show clear linear trends, with greater range of pitch or intensity leading to lower IWER.",

        "Preliminary investigation indicated that using the mean values would lead to the best overall fit to the data.",
        "In addition to these basic fixed effects, our initial model included quadratic terms for all of the numeric features, as suggested by our analysis in Section 3, as well as random effects for speaker identity and word identity.",

        "There is no longer an effect for final repetitions or words after repetitions; all other disfluency features increase the odds of an error by a factor of 1.3 to 2.9.",
        "These differences from Section 3 can be explained by noting that words near filled pauses and repetitions have longer durations than other words (Bell et al., 2003).",
        "Longer duration lowers IWER, so controlling for duration reveals the negative effect of the nearby disfluencies.",
        "Our results are also consistent with Shriberg's (1995) findings on fluency in repeated words, since final repetitions have no significant effect in our combined model, while non-final repetitions incur a penalty.",
        "Without controlling for other lexical or prosodic features, we found that a word is more likely to be misrecognized at the beginning of a turn, and less likely to be misrecognized if it is an open class word.",
        "According to our joint model, these effects still hold even after controlling for other features.",
        "Similarly, male speakers still have higher error rates than females.",
        "This last result sheds some light on the work of Adda-Decker and Lamel (2005), who suggested several factors that could explain males' higher error rates.",
        "In particular, they showed that males have higher rates of disfluency, produce words with slightly shorter durations, and use more alternate (\"sloppy\") pronunciations.",
        "Our joint model controls for the first two of these factors, suggesting that the third factor or some other explanation must account for the remaining differences between males and females.",
        "One possibility is that female speech is more easily recognized because females tend to have expanded vowel spaces (Diehl et al., 1996), a factor that is associated with greater intelligibility (Brad-low et al., 1996) and is characteristic of genres with lower ASR error rates (Nakamura et al., 2008).",
        "Examining the effects of pitch and intensity individually, we found that increased range for these features is associated with lower IWER, while higher pitch and extremes of intensity are associated with higher IWER.",
        "In the joint model, we see the same effect of pitch mean and an even stronger effect for intensity, with the predicted odds of an error dramatically higher for extreme intensity values.",
        "Meanwhile, we no longer see a benefit for increased pitch range and intensity; rather, we see small quadratic effects for both features, i.e. words with average ranges of pitch and intensity are recognized more easily than words with extreme values for these features.",
        "As with disfluencies, we hypothesize that the linear trends observed in Section 3 are primarily due to effects of duration, since duration is moderately correlated with both log pitch range (t = .35) and intensity range (t = .41).",
        "Our final two prosodic features, duration and speech rate, showed strong linear and weak quadratic trends when analyzed individually.",

        "We examined the importance of the random effect for speaker identity in a similar fashion to the effect for word identity.",
        "As shown in Table 3, speaker identity is a very important factor in determining the probability of error.",

        "In this paper, we introduced the individual word error rate (IWER) for measuring ASR performance on individual words, including insertions as well as deletions and substitutions.",
        "Using IWER, we analyzed the effects of various word-level lexical and prosodic features, both individually and in a joint model.",
        "Our analysis revealed the following effects.",
        "(1) Words at the start of a turn have slightly higher IWER than average, and open class (content) words have slightly lower IWER.",
        "These effects persist even after controlling for other lexical and prosodic factors.",
        "(2) Disfluencies heavily impact error rates: IWER for non-final repetitions and words adjacent to fragments rises by up to 15% absolute, while IWER for final repetitions and words following repetitions decreases by up to 7.2% absolute.",
        "Controlling for prosodic features eliminates the latter benefit, and reveals a negative effect of adjacent filled pauses, suggesting that the effects of these disfluencies are normally obscured by the greater duration of nearby words.",
        "(3) For most acoustic-prosodic features, words with extreme values have worse recognition than words with average values.",
        "This effect becomes much more pronounced after controlling for other factors.",
        "(4) After controlling for lexical and prosodic characteristics, the lexical items with the highest error rates are primarily homophones or near-homophones (e.g., buy vs. by, then vs. than).",
        "(5) Speaker differences account for much of the variance in error rates between words.",
        "Moreover, the direction and strength of effects of different prosodic features may vary between speakers.",
        "While we plan to extend our analysis to other ASR systems in order to determine the generality of our findings, we have already gained important insights into a number of factors that increase ASR error rates.",
        "In addition, our results suggest a rich area for future research in further analyzing the variability of both lexical and prosodic effects on ASR behavior for different speakers."
