        "Gazetteers, or entity dictionaries, are important for performing named entity recognition (NER) accurately.",
        "Since building and maintaining high-quality gazetteers by hand is very expensive, many methods have been proposed for automatic extraction of gazetteers from texts (Riloff and Jones, 1999; The-len and Riloff, 2002; Etzioni et al., 2005; Shinzato et al., 2006; Talukdar et al., 2006; Nadeau et al., 2006).",
        "Most studies using gazetteers for NER are based on the assumption that a gazetteer is a mapping from a multi-word noun (MN) to named entity categories such as \"Tokyo Stock Exchange – {ORGANIZATION}\".",
        "However, since the correspondence between the labels and the NE categories can be learned by tagging models, a gazetteer will be useful as long as it returns consistent labels even if those returned are not the NE categories.",
        "By changing the perspective in such a way, we can explore more broad classes of gazetteers.",
        "For example, we can use automatically extracted hyponymy relations (Hearst, 1992; Shinzato and Torisawa, 2004), or automatically induced MN clusters (Rooth et al., 1999; Torisawa, 2001).",
        "For instance, Kazama and Torisawa (2007) used the hyponymy relations extracted from Wikipedia for the English NER, and reported improved accuracies with such a gazetteer.",
        "We focused on the automatically induced clusters of multi-word nouns (MNs) as the source of gazetteers.",
        "We call the constructed gazetteers cluster gazetteers.",
        "In the context of tagging, there are several studies that utilized word clusters to prevent the data sparseness problem (Kazama et al., 2001; Miller et al., 2004).",
        "However, these methods cannot produce the MN clusters required for constructing gazetteers.",
        "In addition, the clustering methods used, such as HMMs and Brown's algorithm (Brown et al., 1992), seem unable to adequately capture the semantics of MNs since they are based only on the information of adjacent words.",
        "We utilized richer syntactic/semantic structures, i.e., verb-MN dependencies to make clean MN clusters.",
        "Rooth et al.",
        "(1999) and Torisawa (2001) showed that the EM-based clustering using verb-MN dependencies can produce semantically clean MN clusters.",
        "However, the clustering algorithms, especially the EM-based algorithms, are computationally expensive.",
        "Therefore, performing the clustering with a vocabulary that is large enough to cover the many named entities required to improve the accuracy of NER is difficult.",
        "We enabled such large-scale clustering by parallelizing the clustering algorithm, and we demonstrate the usefulness of the gazetteer constructed.",
        "We parallelized the algorithm of (Torisawa, 2001) using the Message Passing Interface (MPI), with the prime goal being to distribute parameters and thus enable clustering with a large vocabulary.",
        "Applying the parallelized clustering to a large set of dependencies collected from Web documents enabled us to construct gazetteers with up to 500,000 entries and 3,000 classes.",
        "In our experiments, we used the IREX dataset (Sekine and Isahara, 2000) to demonstrate the usefulness of cluster gazetteers.",
        "We also compared the cluster gazetteers with the Wikipedia gazetteer constructed by following the method of (Kazama and Torisawa, 2007).",
        "The improvement was larger for the cluster gazetteer than for the Wikipedia gazetteer.",
        "We also investigated whether these gazetteers improve the accuracies further when they are used in combination.",
        "The experimental results indicated that the accuracy improved further in several cases and showed that these gazetteers complement each other.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we explain the construction of cluster gazetteers and its parallelization, along with a brief explanation of the construction of the Wikipedia gazetteer.",
        "In Section 3, we explain how to use these gazetteers as features in an NE tagger.",
        "Our experimental results are reported in Section 4."

        "Note that we do not exclude non-NEs when we construct the gazetteer.",
        "We expect that tagging models (CRFs in our case) can learn an appropriate weight for each gazetteer match regardless of whether it is an NE or not.",
        "To learn p(n\\c) and p(c) for Japanese, we use the EM-based clustering method presented by Torisawa (2001).",
        "This method assumes a probabilistic model of verb-MN dependencies with hidden semantic classes: where v £ V is a verb and n £ N is an MN that depends on verb v with relation r. A relation, r, is represented by Japanese postpositions attached to n. For example, from the following Japanese sentence, we extract the following dependency: v = (drink), r = § (\"wo\" postposition), n = H – (beer).",

        "In addition, we also treated the MN-MN expressions, \"MNX 0} MN2\" \"MN2 of MNi\"), as dependencies v = MN2, r = O, n = MN1, since these expressions also characterize the dependent MNs well.",
        "Given L training examples of verb-MN dependencies {(vti,ni,fi)}L=1, where fi is the number of dependency (vti,ni) in a corpus, the EM-based clustering tries to find p(vt\\c), p(n\\c), and p(c) that maximize the (log)-likelihood of the training examples:",
        "We iteratively update the probabilities using the EM algorithm.",
        "For the update procedures used, see Torisawa (2001).",
        "The corpus we used for collecting dependencies was a large set (76 million) of Web documents, that were processed by a dependency parser, KNP (Kurohashi and Kawahara, 2005).",

        "The space requirements are O(\\VT\\\\C\\ + \\N\\\\C\\ + \\C\\) for storing the parameters, p(vt\\c), p(n\\c), and p(c), plus O(L) for storing the training examples.",

        "With the setting, \\N\\ = 500,000, \\VT\\ = 500,000, and \\C\\ = 3, 000, the algorithm requires more than 44 GB for the parameters and 4 GB of memory for the training examples.",
        "A machine with more than 48 GB of memory is not widely available even today.",
        "Therefore, we parallelized the clustering algorithm, to make it suitable for running on a cluster of PCs with a moderate amount of memory (e.g., 8 GB).",
        "First, we decided to store the training examples on a file since otherwise each node would need to store all the examples when we use the data splitting described below, and having every node consume 4 GB of memory is memory-consuming.",
        "Since the access to the training data is sequential, this does not slow down the execution when we use a buffering technique appropriately.",
        "We then split the matrix for the model parameters, p(n\\c) and p(vt\\c), along with the class coordinate.",
        "That is, each cluster node is responsible for storing only a part of classes Cl, i.e., 1/\\P\\ of the parameter matrix, where P is the number of cluster nodes.",

        "This routine first computes p(vti\\ci)p(ni\\ci)p(ci) for each q £ Ci, and stores the sum of these values as localZ.",
        "The routine uses an MPI function, MPI_Allreduce, to sum up localZ of the all cluster nodes and to set Z with the resulting sum.",
        "We can compute p( ci\\ vti, ni) by using this Z to normalize the value.",
        "Although the above is the essence of our paralleliza-tion, invoking MPI_Allreduce in the innermost loop is very expensive because the communication setup is not so cheap.",
        "Therefore, our implementation calculates p(ci\\ vti, ni) in batches of B examples and calls MPI_Allreduce at every B examples.",
        "We used a value of B = 4, 096 in this study.",

        "Most of the methods (Shin-zato et al., 2006; Talukdar et al., 2006; Nadeau et al., 2006) are oriented at the NE category.",
        "They extracted a gazetteer for each NE category and utilized it in a NE tagger.",
        "On the other hand, Kazama and Torisawa (2007) extracted hyponymy relations, which are independent of the NE categories, from Wikipedia and utilized it as a gazetteer.",
        "The effectiveness of this method was demonstrated for Japanese NER as well by this study.",
        "Inducing features for taggers by clustering has been tried by several researchers (Kazama et al., 2001; Miller et al., 2004).",

        "(2006) used gazetteers with about 85,000 entries in total.",
        "By parallelizing the clustering algorithm, we successfully constructed a cluster gazetteer with up to 500,000 entries from a large amount of dependency relations in Web documents.",

        "Wikipedia also produced a large gazetteer of more than 550,000 entries.",
