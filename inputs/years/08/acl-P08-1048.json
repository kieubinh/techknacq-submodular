        "Roget's Thesaurus, first introduced over 150 years ago, has gone through many revisions to reach its current state.",
        "We compare two versions, the 1987 and 1911 editions of the Thesaurus with each other and with WordNet 3.0.",
        "Roget's Thesaurus has a unique structure, quite different from WordNet, of which the NLP community has yet to take full advantage.",
        "In this paper we demonstrate that although the 1911 version of the Thesaurus is very old, it can give results comparable to systems that use WordNet or newer versions of Roget's Thesaurus.",
        "The main motivation for working with the 1911 Thesaurus instead of newer versions is that it is in the public domain, along with related NLP-oriented software packages.",
        "For applications that call for an NLP-friendly thesaurus, WordNet has become the de-facto standard.",
        "Although WordNet is a fine resources, we believe that ignoring other thesauri is a serious oversight.",
        "We show on three applications how useful the 1911 Thesaurus is.",
        "We ran the well-established tasks of determining semantic relatedness of pairs of terms and identifying synonyms (Jar-masz and Szpakowicz, 2004).",
        "We also proposed a new method of representing the meaning of sentences or other short texts using either WordNet or Roget's Thesaurus, and tested it on the data set provided by Li et al.",
        "(2006).",
        "We hope that this work will encourage others to use Roget's Thesaurus in their own NLP tasks.",
        "Previous research on the 1987 version of Roget's Thesaurus includes work of Jarmasz and Szpakow-icz (2004).",
        "They propose a method of determining semantic relatedness between pairs of terms.",
        "Terms that appear closer together in the Thesaurus get higher weights than those farther apart.",
        "The experiments aimed at identifying synonyms using a modified version of the proposed semantic similarity function.",
        "Similar experiments were carried out using WordNet in combination with a variety of semantic relatedness functions.",
        "Roget's Thesaurus was found generally to outperform WordNet on these problems.",
        "We have run similar experiments using the 1911Thesaurus.",
        "Lexical chains have also been developed using the 1987 Roget's Thesaurus (Jarmasz and Szpakowicz, 2003).",
        "The procedure maps words in a text to the Head (a Roget's concept) from which they are most likely to come.",
        "Although we did not experiment with lexical chains here, they were an inspiration for our sentence relatedness function.",
        "Roget's Thesaurus does not explicitly label the relations between its terms, as WordNet does.",
        "Instead, it groups terms together with implied relations.",
        "Kennedy and Szpakowicz (2007) show how disambiguating one of these relations, hypernymy, can help improve the semantic similarity functions in (Jarmasz and Szpakowicz, 2004).",
        "These hyper-nym relations were also put towards solving analogy questions.",
        "This is not the first time the 1911 version of Roget's Thesaurus has been used in NLP research.",
        "Cas-sidy (2000) used it to build the semantic network FACTOTUM.",
        "This required significant (manual) restructuring, so FACTOTUM cannot really be considered a true version of Roget's Thesaurus.",
        "The 1987 data come from Penguin's Roget's Thesaurus (Kirkpatrick, 1987).",
        "The 1911 version is available from Project Gutenberg.",
        "We use WordNet 3.0, the latest version (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "In the experiments we present here, we worked with an interface to Roget's Thesaurus implemented in Java 5.0.",
        "It is built around a large index which stores the location in the thesaurus of each word or phrase; the system individually indexes all words within each phrase, as well as the phrase itself.",
        "This was shown to improve results in a few applications, which we will discuss later in the paper."

        "Although the 1987 and 1911 Thesauri are very similar in structure, there are a few differences, among them, the number of levels and the number of parts-of-speech represented.",
        "For example, the 1911 version contains some pronouns as well as more sections dedicated to phrases.",
        "There are nine levels in Roget's Thesaurus hierarchy, from Class down to Word.",
        "We show them in Table 1 along with the counts of instances of each level.",

        "the lexical material, organized into approximately a thousand concepts, resides.",
        "Head Groups often pair up opposites, for example Head #1 \"Existence\" and Head #2 \"Nonexistence\" are found in the same Head Group in both versions of the Thesaurus.",
        "Terms in the Thesaurus may be labelled with cross-references to other words in different Heads.",
        "We did not use these references in our experiments.",
        "The part-of-speech level is a little confusing, since clearly no such grouping contains an exhaustive list of all nouns, all verbs etc.",
        "We will write \"POS\" to indicate a structure in Roget's and \"part-of-speech\" to indicate the word category in general.",
        "The four main parts-of-speech represented in a POS are nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs.",
        "Interjections are also included in both the 1911 and 1987 thesauri; they are usually phrases followed by an exclamation mark, such as \"for God's sake!\"",
        "and \"pshaw!\".",
        "The Paragraph and Semicolon Group are not given names, but can often be represented by the first word.",
        "The 1911 version also contains phrases (mostly quotations), prefixes and pronouns.",

        "We seek a function that, given s, assigns to all concepts of specificity s a weight progressively larger than to their neighbours.",
        "The weights in this function should be assigned based on specificity, so that all concepts of the same specificity receive the same score.",
        "Weights will differ depending on a combination of specificity and how frequently words that signal the concepts appear in a sentence.",
        "The weight of concepts with specificity s should be the highest, of those with specificity s ± 1 - lower, of those with specificity s ± 2 lower still, and so on.",
        "In order to achieve this effect, we weight the concepts using a normal distribution, where the mean is s:",
        "Since the Head is often considered the main category in Roget's, we expect a specificity of 5 to be best, but we decided to test the values 1 through 9 as a possible setting for specificity.",
        "We do not claim that this weighting scheme is optimal; other weighting schemes might do better.",
        "For the purpose of comparing the 1911 and 1987 Thesauri and WordNet, however, this method appears sufficient.",
        "With this weighting scheme, we determine the distance between two sentences using cosine similarity:",
        "For this problem we used the MIT Java WordNet Interface version 1.1.1.",

        "Once again, the 1987 version is superior to the 1911 version, but the 1911 version still works quite well.",
        "We hope to investigate further the representation of sentences and other short texts using Roget's Thesaurus.",
        "These kinds of measurements can help with problems such as identifying relevant sentences for extractive text summarization, or possibly paraphrase identification (Dolan et al., 2004).",
        "Another - longer-term - direction of future work could be merging Roget's Thesaurus with WordNet.",
        "We also plan to study methods of automatically updating the 1911 Roget's Thesaurus with modern words.",
        "Some work has been done on adding new terms and relations to WordNet (Snow et al., 2006) and FACTOTUM (O'Hara and Wiebe, 2003).",
        "Similar methods could be used for identifying related terms and assigning them to a correct semicolon group or paragraph."
