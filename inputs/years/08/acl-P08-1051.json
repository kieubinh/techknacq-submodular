        "Question answering research has only recently started to spread from short factoid questions to more complex ones.",
        "One significant challenge is the evaluation: manual evaluation is a difficult, time-consuming process and not applicable within efficient development of systems.",
        "Automatic evaluation requires a corpus of questions and answers, a definition of what is a correct answer, and a way to compare the correct answers to automatic answers produced by a system.",
        "For this purpose we present a Wikipedia-based corpus of Why-questions and corresponding answers and articles.",
        "The corpus was built by a novel method: paid participants were contacted through a Web-interface, a procedure which allowed dynamic, fast and inexpensive development of data collection methods.",
        "Each question in the corpus has several corresponding, partly overlapping answers, which is an asset when estimating the correctness of answers.",
        "In addition, the corpus contains information related to the corpus collection process.",
        "We believe this additional information can be used to post-process the data, and to develop an automatic approval system for further data collection projects conducted in a similar manner."

        "Automatic question answering (QA) is an alternative to traditional word-based search engines.",
        "Instead of returning a long list of documents more or less related to the query parameters, the aim of a QA system is to isolate the exact answer as accurately as possible, and to provide the user only a short text clip containing the required information.",
        "One of the major development challenges is evaluation.",
        "The conferences such as TREC, CLEFand NTCIR have provided valuable QA evaluation methods, and in addition produced and distributed corpora of questions, answers and corresponding documents.",
        "However, these conferences have focused mainly on fact-based questions with short answers, so called factoid questions.",
        "Recently more complex tasks such as list, definition and discourse-based questions have also been included in TREC in a limited fashion (Dang et al., 2007).",
        "More complex how-and why-questions (for Asian languages) were also included in the NTCIR07, but the provided data comprised only 100 questions, of which some were also factoids (Fukumoto et al., 2007).",
        "Not only is the available non-factoid data quite limited in size, it is also questionable whether the data sets are usable in development outside the conferences.",
        "Lin and Katz (2006) suggest that training data has to be more precise, and, that it should be collected, or at least cleaned, manually.",
        "Some corpora of why-questions have been collected manually: corpora described in (Verberne et al., 2006) and (Verberne et al., 2007) both comprise fewer than 400 questions and corresponding answers (one or two per question) formulated by native speakers.",
        "However, we believe one answer per question is not enough.",
        "Even with factoid questions it is sometimes difficult to define what is a correct answer, and complex questions result in a whole new level of ambiguity.",
        "Correctness depends greatly on the background knowledge and expectations of the person asking the question.",
        "For example, a correct answer to the question \"Why did Mr. X take Ms. Y to a coffee shop?\"",
        "could be very different depending on whether we knew that Mr. X does not drink coffee or that he normally drinks it alone, or that Mr. X and Ms. Y are known enemies.",
        "The problem of several possible answers and, in consequence, automatic evaluation has been tackled for years within another field of study: automatic summarisation (Hori et al., 2003; Lin and Hovy, 2003).",
        "We believe that the best method of providing \"correct\" answers is to do what has been done in that field: combine a multitude of answers to ensure both diversity and consensus among the answers.",
        "Correctness of an answer is also closely related to the required level of detail.",
        "The Internet FAQ pages were successfully used to develop QA-systems (Jijk-oun and de Rijke, 2005; Soricut and Brill, 2006), as have the human-powered question sites such as An-swers.com, Yahoo Answers and Google Answers, where individuals can post questions and receive answers from peers (Mizuno et al., 2007).",
        "Both resources can be assumed to contain adequately error-free information.",
        "FAQ pages are created so as to answer typical questions well enough that the questions do not need to be repeated.",
        "Question sites typically rank the answers and offer bonuses for people providing good ones.",
        "However, both sites suffer from excess of information.",
        "FAQ-pages tend to also answer questions which are not asked, and also contain practical examples.",
        "Human-powered answers often contain unrelated information and discourselike elements.",
        "Additionally, the answers do not always have a connection to the source material from which they could be extracted.",
        "One purpose of our project was to take part in the development of QA systems by providing the community with a new type of corpus.",
        "The corpus includes not only the questions with multiple answers and corresponding articles, but also certain additional information that we believe is essential to enhance the usability ofthe data.",
        "In addition to providing a new QA corpus, we hope our description of the data collection process will provide insight, resources and motivation for further research and projects using similar collection methods.",
        "We collected our corpus through Amazon Mechanical Turk service (MTurk).",
        "The MTurk infrastructure allowed us to distribute our tasks to a multitude of workers around the world, without the burden of advertising.",
        "The system also allowed us to test the workers suitability, and to reward the work without the bureaucracy of employment.",
        "To our knowledge, this is the first time that the MTurk service has been used in equivalent purpose.",
        "We conducted the data collection in three steps: generation, answering and rephrasing of questions.",
        "The workers were provided with a set of Wikipedia articles, based on which the questions were created and the answers determined by sentence selection.",
        "The WhyQA-corpus consists of three parts: original questions along with their rephrased versions, 8-10 partly overlapping answers for each question, and the Wikipedia articles including the ones corresponding to the questions.",
        "The WhyQA-corpus is in XML-format and can be downloaded and used under the GNU Free Documentation License from www.furui.cs.titech.ac.jp/."

        "Question-answer pairs have previously been generated for example by asking workers to both ask a question and then answer it based on a given text (Verberne et al., 2006; Verberne et al., 2007).",
        "We decided on a different approach for two reasons.",
        "Firstly, based on our experience such an approach is not optimal in the MTurk framework.",
        "The tasks that were welcomed by workers required a short attention span, and reading long texts was negatively received with many complaints, sloppy work and slow response times.",
        "Secondly, we believe that the aforementioned approach can produce unnatural questions that are not actually based on the information need of the workers.",
        "We divided the QA-generation task into two phases: question-generation (QGenHIT) and answering (QAHIT).",
        "We also trimmed the amount of the text that the workers were required to read to create the questions.",
        "These measures were taken both in order to lessen the cognitive burden of the task and to produce more natural questions.",
        "In the first phase the workers generated the questions based on a part of Wikipedia article.",
        "The resulting questions were then uploaded to the system as new HITs with the corresponding articles, and answered by available (different) workers.",
        "Our hypothesis is that the questions are more natural iftheir answer is not known at the time of the creation.",
        "Finally, in an additional third phase, 5 rephrased versions of each question were created in order to gain variation (QRepHIT).",
        "The data quality was ensured by requiring the workers to achieve a certain result from a test (or a Qualification) before they could work on the aforementioned tasks.",
        "Below we explain the MTurk system, and then our collection process in detail.",
        "Mechanical Turk is a Web-based service, offered by Amazon.com, Inc.",
        "It provides an API through which employers can obtain a connection to people to perform a variety of simple tasks.",
        "With tools provided by Amazon.com, the employer creates tasks, and uploads them to the MTurk Web-site.",
        "Workers can then browse the tasks and, if they find them profitable and/or interesting enough, work on them.",
        "When the tasks are completed, the employer can download the results, and accept or reject them.",
        "Some key concepts of the system are listed below, with short descriptions of the functionality.",
        "• HIT Human Intelligence Task, the unit of a payable chore in MTurk.",
        "• Requester An \"employer\", creates and uploads new HITs and rewards the workers.",
        "Requesters can upload simple HITs through the MTurk Requester web site, and more complicated ones through the MTurk Web Service APIs.",
        "• Worker An \"employee\", works on the hits through the MTurk Workers' web site.",
        "• Assignment.",
        "One HIT consists of one or more assignments.",
        "One worker can complete a single HIT only once, so if the requester needs multiple results per HIT, he needs to set the assignment-count to the desired figure.",
        "A HIT is considered completed when all the assignments have been completed.",
        "• Rewards At upload time, each HIT has to be assigned a fixed reward, that cannot be changed later.",
        "Minimum reward is $0.01.",
        "Amazon.com collects a 10% (or a minimum of $0.05) service fee per each paid reward.",
        "• Qualifications To improve the data quality, a HIT can also be attached to certain tests, \"qualifications\" that are either system-provided or created by the requester.",
        "An example of a system-provided qualification is the average approval ratio of the worker.",
        "Even if it is possible to create tests that workers have to pass before being allowed to work on a HIT so as to ensure the worker's ability, it is impossible to test the motivation (for instance, they cannot be interviewed).",
        "Also, as they are working through the Web, their working conditions cannot be controlled.",
        "The document collection used in our research was derived from the Wikipedia XML Corpus by De-noyer and Gallinari (2006).",
        "We selected a total of 84 articles, based on their length and contents.",
        "A certain length was required so that we could expect the article to contain enough interesting material to produce a wide selection of natural questions.",
        "The articles varied in topic, degree of formality and the amount of details; from \"Horror film\" and \"Christmas worldwide\" to \"G-Man (Half-Life)\" and \"History of London\".",
        "Articles consisting of bulleted lists were removed, but filtering based on the topic of the article was not performed.",
        "Essentially, the articles were selected randomly.",
        "The first phase of the question-answer generation was to generate the questions.",
        "In QGenHIT we presented the worker with only part of a Wikipedia article, and instructed them to think of a why-question that they felt could be answered based on the original, whole article which they were not shown.",
        "This approach was expected to lead to natural curiosity and questions.",
        "Offering too little information would have lead to many questions that would finally be left unanswered, and it also did not give the workers enough to work on.",
        "Giving too much information Qualification The workers were required to pass a test before working on the HITs.",

        "The total cost of producing the corpus was about $350, consisting of $310 paid in workers rewards and $40 in Mechanical Turk fees, including all the trials conducted during the development of the final system.",
        "Also included is a set of Wikipedia documents (WikiXML, about 660 000 articles or 670MB in compressed format), including the ones corresponding to the questions (84 documents).",
        "The source of Wik-iXML is the English part of the Wikipedia XML Corpus by Denoyer and Gallinari (2006).",
        "In the original data some of the HTML-structures like lists and tables occurred within sentences.",
        "Our sentence-selection approach to QA required a more finegrained segmentation and for our purpose, much of the HTML-information was redundant anyway.",
        "Consequently we removed most of the HTML-structures, and the table-cells, list-items and other similar elements were converted into sentences.",
        "Apart from sentence-information, only the section-title information was maintained.",
        "Example data is shown in Table 2.",
        "Despite the Qualifications and other measures taken in the collection phase of the corpus, we believe the quality of the data remains open to question.",
        "However, the Mechanical Turk framework provided additional information for each assignment, for example the time workers spent on the task.",
        "We believe this information can be used to analyse and use our data better, and have included it in the corpus to be used in further experiments.",
        "• Worker Id Within the MTurk framework, each worker is assigned a unique id.",
        "Worker id can be used to assign a reliability-value to the workers, based on the quality of their previous work.",
        "It was also used to examine whether the same workers worked on the same data in different phases: Of the original questions, only 7 were answered and 4 other rephrased by the same worker they were created by.",
        "However, it has",
        "to be acknowledged that it is also possible for one worker to have had several accounts in the system, and thus be working under several different worker ids.",
        "• Time On Task The MTurk framework also provides the requester the time it took for the worker to complete the assignment after accepting it.",
        "This information is also included in the corpus, although it is impossible to know precisely how much time the workers actually spent on each task.",
        "For instance, it is possible that one worker had several assignments open at the same time, or that they were not concentrating fully on working on the task.",
        "A high value of Time On Task thus does not necessarily mean that the worker actually spent a long time on it.",
        "However, a low value indicates that he/she did only spend a short time on it.",

        "assignment ids and original upload times of the HITs are provided to make it possible to retrace the collection steps if needed.",
        "• Completion Time Completion time is the timestamp of the moment when the task was completed by a worker and returned to the system.",
        "The time between the completion time and the upload time is presumably highly dependent on the reward, and on the appeal of the task in question.",
        "As an example of the post-processing of the data, we conducted some preliminary experiments on the answer agreement between workers.",
        "Out of the 695 questions, 159 were filtered out in the first part of QAHIT.",
        "We first uploaded only 3 assignments, and the questions that 2 out of 3 workers deemed unanswerable were filtered out.",
        "This left 536 questions which were considered answered, each one having 8-10 answers from different workers.",
        "Even though in the majority ofcases (83% ofthe questions) one of the workers replied with the NoA, the ones that answered did agree up to a point: of all the answers, 72% were such that all of their sentences were selected by at least two different workers.",
        "On top of this, an additional 17% of answers shared at least one sentence that was selected by more than one worker.",
        "To understand the agreement better, we also calculated the average agreement of selected sentences based on sentence ids and N-gram overlaps between the answers.",
        "In both of these experiments, only those 536 questions that were considered answerable were included.",
        "As the questions were answered by means of sentence selection, the simplest method to check the agreement between the workers was to compare the ids of the selected sentences.",
        "The agreement was calculated as follows: each answer was compared to all the other answers for the same question.",
        "For each case, the agreement was defined as Agreement = Go\"Jmm'°^^As, where Commonlds is the number of sentence ids that existed in both answers, and Alllds is the number of different ids in both answers.",
        "We calculated the overall average agreement ratio (Total Avg) and the average of the best matches between two assignments within one HIT (Best Match).",
        "We ran the test for two data sets: The most typical case of the workers cheating was to mark the question unaswerable.",
        "Because of this the first data set included only the real answers, and the NoAs were removed (NoA not included, 3872 answers).",
        "If an answer was compared with a NoA, the agreement was 0, and if two NoAs were compared, the agreement was 1.",
        "We did, however, also include the figures for the whole data set (NoA included, 4638 answers).",
        "The results are shown in Table 3.",
        "The Best Match results were quite high compared to the Total Avg.",
        "From this we can conclude that in the majority of cases, there was at least one quite similar answer among those for that HIT.",
        "However, comparing the sentence ids is only an indicative measure, and it does not tell the whole story about agreement.",
        "For each document there may exist several separate sentences that contain the same kind of information, and so two answers can be alike even though the sentence ids do not match.",
        "Defining the agreement over several passages of texts has for a long time been a research problem within the field of automatic summarisation.",
        "For each document it is possible to create several summarisations that can each be considered correct.",
        "The problem has been approached by using the ROUGE-metric: calculating the N-gram overlap between manual, \"correct\" summaries, and the automatic summaries.",

        "When selecting sentences, this is not an issue, so we decided to use only unigram and bigram counts (Table 4: R-1, R2), as well as the skip-bigram values (R-SU) and the longest common N-gram metric R-L. We calculated the figures for two data sets in the same way as in the case of sentence id agreement.",

        "During the initial trials of data collection we encountered some unexpected phenomena.",
        "For example, increasing the reward did have a positive effect in reducing the time it took for HITs to be completed, however it did not correlate in desirable way with data quality.",
        "Indeed the quality actually decreased with increasing reward.",
        "We believe that this unexpected result is due to the distributed nature of the worker pool in Mechanical Turk.",
        "Clearly the motivation of some workers is other than monetary reward.",
        "Especially if the HIT is interesting and can be completed in a short period of time, it seems that there are people willing to work on them even for free.",
        "MTurk requesters cannot however rely on this voluntary workforce.",
        "From MTurk Forums it is clear that some of the workers rely on the money they get from completing the HITs.",
        "There seems to be a critical reward-threshold after which the \"real workforce\", i.e. workers who are mainly interested in performing the HITs as fast as possible, starts to participate.",
        "When the motivation changes from voluntary participation to maximising the monetary gain, the quality of the obtained results often understandably suffers.",
        "It would be ideal if a requester could rely on the voluntary workforce alone for results, but in many cases this may result either in too few workers and/or too slow a rate of data acquisition.",
        "Therefore it is often necessary to raise the reward and rely on efficient automatic validation of the data.",
        "We have looked into the answer agreement of the workers as an experimental post-processing step.",
        "We believe that further work in this area will provide the tools required for automatic data quality control."

        "We propose that combining several answers from different people is an important factor in defining the \"correct\" answer to a why-question, and to that goal have included several answers for each question in the corpus.",
        "We have also included data that we believe is valuable in post-processing the data: the work history of a single worker, the time spent on tasks, and the agreement on a single HIT between a set of different workers.",
        "We believe that this information, especially the answer agreement of workers, can be successfully used in post-processing and analysing the data, as well as automatically accepting and rejecting workers' submissions in similar future data collection exercises."
