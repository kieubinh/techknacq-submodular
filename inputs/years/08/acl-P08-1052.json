        "Despite the tremendous amount of work on word similarity (see (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006) for an overview), there is surprisingly little research on the important related problem of relational similarity semantic similarity between pairs of words.",

        "are taking the GRE test nowadays are familiar with an instance of this problem - verbal analogy questions, which ask whether, e.g., the relationship between ostrich and bird is more similar to that between lion and cat, or rather between primate and monkey.",
        "These analogies are difficult, and the average test taker gives a correct answer 57% of the time (Turney and Littman, 2005).",
        "Many NLP applications could benefit from solving relational similarity problems, including but not limited to question answering, information retrieval, machine translation, word sense disambiguation, and information extraction.",
        "For example, a relational search engine like TextRunner, which serves queries like \"find all X such that X causes wrinkles\", asking for all entities that are in a particular relation with a given entity (Cafarella et al., 2006), needs to recognize that laugh wrinkles is an instance of CAUSE-EFFECT.",
        "While there are not many success stories so far, measuring semantic similarity has proven its advantages for textual entailment (Tatu and Moldovan, 2005).",
        "In this paper, we introduce a novel linguistically-motivated Web-based approach to relational similarity, which, despite its simplicity, achieves state-of-the-art performance on a number of problems.",
        "Following Turney (2006b), we test our approach on SAT verbal analogy questions and on mapping noun-modifier pairs to abstract relations like TIME, LOCATION and CONTAINER.",

        "These vectors are used in a nearest-neighbor classifier to solve SAT verbal analogy problems, yielding 47% accuracy.",
        "The same approach is applied to classifying noun-modifier pairs: using the Diverse dataset of Nastase and Szpakow-icz (2003), Turney&Littman achieve F-measures of 26.5% with 30 fine-grained relations, and 43.2% with 5 course-grained relations.",
        "Turney (2005) extends the above approach by introducing the latent relational analysis (LRA), which uses automatically generated synonyms, learns suitable patterns, and performs singular value decomposition in order to smooth the frequencies.",

        "The following nonexhaustive and possibly overlapping relations are possible: Cause-Effect (e.g., hormone-growth), Instrument-Agency (e.g., laser-printer), Theme-Tool (e.g., workforce), Origin-Entity (e.g., grain-alcohol), Content-Container (e.g., bananas-basket), Product-Producer (e.g., honey-bee), and Part-Whole (e.g., leg-table).",
        "Each relation is considered in isolation; there are 140 training and at least 70 test examples per relation.",
        "Given an example, we reduced the target entities e1 and e2 to single nouns by retaining their heads only.",
        "We then mined the Web for sentences containing these nouns, and we extracted the above-described feature types: verbs, prepositions and coordinating conjunctions.",
        "We further used the following problem-specific contextual feature types:",
        "Sentence words: after stop words removal and stemming with the Porter (1980) stemmer; Entity words: lemmata of the words in ei and e2; Query words: words part of the query string.",
        "Each feature type has a specific prefix which prevents it from mixing with other feature types; the last feature type is used for type C only (see below).",
        "The SemEval competition defines four types of systems, depending on whether the manually annotated WordNet senses and the Google query are used: A (WordNet=no, Query=no), B (WordNet=yes, Query=no), C (WordNet=no, Query=yes), and D (WordNet=yes, Query=yes).",
        "We experimented with types A and C only since we believe that having the manually annotated WordNet sense keys is an unrealistic assumption for a real-world application.",
        "As before, we used a 1-nearest-neighbor classifier with TF.IDF-weighting, breaking ties by predicting the majority class on the training data.",
        "The evaluation results are shown in Table 5.",
        "We studied the effect of different subsets of features and of more Google star operators.",
        "As the table shows, using up to ten Google stars instead of up to eight (see section 3) yields a slight improvement in accuracy for systems of both type A (65.4% vs. 67.3%) and type C (67.0% vs. 68.1%).",
        "Both results represent a statistically significant improvement over the majority class baseline and over using sentence words only, and a slight improvement over the best type A and type C systems on SemEval'07, which achieved 66% and 67% accuracy, respectively.",
        "The last dataset we experimented with is a subset of the 387 examples listed in the appendix of (Levi, 1978).",

        "In Levi's theory, complex nominals can be derived from relative clauses by removing one of the following 12 abstract predicates: CAUSEi (e.g., tear gas), CAUSE2 (e.g., drug deaths), HAVEi (e.g., apple cake), HAVE2 (e.g., lemon peel), MAKEi (e.g., silkworm), MAKE2 (e.g., snowball), USE (e.g., steam iron), BE (e.g., soldier ant), IN (e.g., field mouse), FOR (e.g., horse doctor), FROM (e.g., olive oil), and ABOUT (e.g., price war).",
        "In the resulting nominals, the modifier is typically the object of the predicate; when it is the subject, the predicate is marked with the index 2.",
        "The second derivational mechanism in the theory is nominalization; it produces nominals whose head is a nominalized verb.",
        "Since we are interested in noun compounds only, we manually cleansed the set of 387 examples.",
        "We first excluded all concatenations (e.g., silkworm) and examples with adjectival modifiers (e.g., electric shock), thus obtaining 250 noun-noun compounds (Levi-250 dataset).",
        "We further filtered out all nom-inalizations for which the dataset provides no abstract predicate (e.g., city planner), thus ending up with 214 examples (Levi-214 dataset).",
        "As in the previous experiments, for each of the 214 noun-noun compounds, we mined the Web for sentences containing both target nouns, from which we extracted paraphrasing verbs, prepositions and coordinating conjunctions.",
        "We then performed leave-one-out cross-validation experiments with a 1-nearest-neighbor classifier, trying to predict the correct predicate for the testing example.",
        "The results are shown in Table 6.",
        "As we can see, using prepositions alone yields about 33% accuracy, which is a statistically significant improvement over the majority-class baseline.",
        "Overall, the most important features are the verbs: they yield 45.8% accuracy when used alone, and 50% together with prepositions.",
        "Adding coordinating conjunctions helps a bit with verbs, but not with prepositions.",
        "Note however that none of the differences between the different feature combinations involving verbs are statistically significant.",
        "The righthand side of the table reports the results when the query patterns involving THAT (see section 3) were not used.",
        "We can observe a small 1-3% drop in accuracy for all models involving verbs, but it is not statistically significant.",
        "We also show the average number of distinct features and sum of feature counts per example: as we can see, there is a strong positive correlation between number of features and accuracy."

        "We found that verbs were especially useful features for this task.",
        "An important advantage of the approach is that it does not require knowledge about the semantics of the individual nouns.",
        "A potential drawback is that it might not work well for low-frequency words.",
        "The evaluation on several relational similarity problems, including SAT verbal analogy, head-modifier relations, and relations between complex nominals has shown state-of-the-art performance.",
        "The presented approach can be further extended to other combinations of parts of speech: not just noun-noun and adjective-noun.",
        "Using a parser with a richer set of syntactic dependency features, e.g., as proposed by Padó and Lapata (2007), is another promising direction for future work."
