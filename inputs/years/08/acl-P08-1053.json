        "Moreover, different applications produce different types of challenges and different opportunities.",
        "As a result, optimizing a single recognition system for all transcription tasks is well beyond the reach of present technology, and even systems that are apparently similar on average can make different mistakes on different sources.",
        "A natural response to this challenge is to combine retrieval results from multiple systems, each imperfect, to achieve reasonably robust behavior over a broader range of tasks.",
        "In this paper, we compare alternative ways of combining these ranked lists.",
        "Note, we do not assume access to the internal workings of the recognition systems, or even to the transcripts produced by those systems.",
        "System combination has a long history in information retrieval.",
        "Most often, the goal is to combine results from systems that search different content (\"collection fusion\") or to combine results from different systems on the same content (\"data fusion\").",
        "When working with multiple transcriptions of the same content, we are again presented with new opportunities.",
        "In this paper we compare some well known techniques for combination of retrieval results with a new evidence combination technique based on a general framework known as Generalized Additive Models (GAMs).",
        "We show that this new technique significantly outperforms several well known information retrieval fusion techniques, and we present evidence that it is the ability of GAMs to combine inputs non-linearly that at least partly explains our improvements.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "We first review prior work on evidence combination in information retrieval in Section 2, and then introduce Generalized Additive Models in Section 3.",
        "Section 4 describes the design of our experiments with a 589 hour collection of conversational speech for which information retrieval queries and relevance judgments are available.",

        "One approach for combining ranked retrieval results is to simply linearly combine the multiple system scores for each topic and document.",
        "This approach has been extensively applied in the literature (Bartell et al., 1994; Callan et al., 1995; Powell et al., 2000; Vogt and Cottrell, 1999), with varying degrees of success, owing in part to the potential difficulty of normalizing scores across retrieval systems.",
        "In this study, we partially abstract away from this potential difficulty by using the same retrieval system on both representations of the collection documents (so that we don't expect score distributions to be significantly different for the combination inputs).",
        "Of course, many fusion techniques using more advanced score normalization methods have been proposed.",
        "Shaw and Fox (1994) proposed a number of such techniques, perhaps the most successful of which is known as CombMNZ.",
        "CombMNZ has been shown to achieve strong performance and has been used in many subsequent studies (Lee, 1997; Montague and Aslam, 2002; Beitzel et al., 2004; Lillis et al., 2006).",
        "In this study, we also use CombMNZ as a baseline for comparison, and following Lil-lis et al.",
        "(2006) and Lee (1997), compute it in the following way.",
        "First, we normalize each score s as norm(si) = – Si~mm(s) , where max(s) and min(s) are the maximum and minimum scores seen in the input result list.",
        "After normalization, the CombMNZ score for a document d is computed as CombMNZd = Ns,d x \\Nd > 0|.",
        "Here, L is the number of ranked lists to be combined, N£ d is the normalized score of document d in ranked list £, and \\Nd > 0\\ is the number of nonzero normalized scores given to d by any result set.",
        "Manmatha et al.",
        "(2001) showed that retrieval scores from IR systems could be modeled using a Normal distribution for relevant documents and exponential distribution for non-relevant documents.",
        "However, in their study, fusion results using these comparatively complex normalization approaches achieved performance no better than the much simpler CombMNZ.",
        "A simple rank-based fusion technique is interleaving (Voorhees et al., 1994).",
        "In this approach, the highest ranked document from each list is taken in turn (ignoring duplicates) and placed at the top of the new, combined list.",
        "Many probabilistic combination approaches have also been developed, a recent example being Lillis et al.",
        "(2006).",
        "Perhaps the most closely related proposal, using logistic regression, was made first by Savoy et al.",
        "(1988).",
        "Logistic regression is one example from the broad class of models which GAMs encompass.",
        "Unlike GAMs in their full generality however, logistic regression imposes a comparatively high degree of linearity in the model structure.",
        "Previous work on single-collection result fusion has naturally focused on combining results from multiple retrieval systems.",
        "In this case, the potential for performance improvements depends critically on the uniqueness of the different input systems being combined.",
        "Accordingly, small variations in the same system often do not combine to produce results better than the best of their inputs (Beitzel et al., 2004).",
        "Errorful document collections such as conversational speech introduce new difficulties and opportunities for data fusion.",
        "This is so, in particular, because even the same system can produce drastically different retrieval results when multiple representations of the documents (e.g., multiple transcript hypotheses) are available.",
        "Consider, for example, Figure 1 which shows, for each term in each of our title queries, the proportion of relevant documents containing that term in only one of our two transcript hypotheses.",
        "Critically, by plotting this proportion against the term's inverse document frequency, we observe that the most discriminative query terms are often not available in both document represen-",
        "Inverse Document Frequency",
        "Figure 1: For each term in each query, the proportion of relevant documents containing the term vs. inverse document frequency.",
        "For increasingly discriminative terms (higher idf), we observe that the probability of only one transcript containing the term increases dramatically.",
        "tations.",
        "As these high-idf terms make large contributions to retrieval scores, this suggests that even an identical retrieval system may return a large score using one transcript hypothesis, and yet a very low score using another.",
        "Accordingly, a linear combination of scores is unlikely to be optimal.",
        "A second example illustrates the difficulty.",
        "Suppose recognition system A can recognize a particular high-idf query term, but system B never can.",
        "In the extreme case, the term may simply be out of vocabulary, although this may occur for various other reasons (e.g., poor language modeling or pronunciation dictionaries).",
        "Here again, a linear combination of scores will fail, as will rank-based interleaving.",
        "In the latter case, we will alternate between taking a plausible document from system A and an inevitably worse result from the crippled system B.",
        "As a potential solution for these difficulties, we consider the use of generalized additive models for retrieval fusion."

        "Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) are a generalization of Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), while GLMs are a generalization of the well known linear model.",
        "In a GLM, the distribution of an observed random variable Yi is related to the linear predictor r]i through a smooth monotonic link function 9(v>i) = Vi = Xi/3.",
        "Here, Xi is the ith row of the model matrix X (one set of observations corresponding to one observed yi) and f3 is a vector of unknown parameters to be learned from the data.",
        "If we constrain our link function g to be the identity transformation, and assume Yi is Normal, then our GLM reduces to a simple linear model.",
        "But GLMs are considerably more versatile than linear models.",
        "First, rather than only the Normal distribution, the response Yi is free to have any distribution belonging to the exponential family of distributions.",
        "This family includes many useful distributions such as the Binomial, Normal, Gamma, and Poisson.",
        "Secondly, by allowing non-identity link functions g, some degree of non-linearity may be incorporated in the model structure.",
        "A well known GLM in the NLP community is logistic regression (which may alternatively be derived as a maximum entropy classifier).",
        "In logistic regression, the response is assumed to be Binomial and the chosen link function is the logit transformation,",
        "Generalized additive models allow for additional model flexibility by allowing the linear predictor to now also contain learned smooth functions fj of the covariates xk.",
        "For example, g{pli) = X*6 + fi(xii) + f2(X2i) + f3(X3i,X4i).",
        "As in a GLM, ^i = E(Y) and Yi belongs to the exponential family.",
        "Strictly parametric model components are still permitted, which we represent as a row of the model matrix X* (with associated parameters 6).",
        "GAMs may be thought of as GLMs where one or more covariate has been transformed by a basis expansion, f (x) = bj (x)f3j.",
        "Given a set of q basis functions bj spanning a q-dimensional space of smooth transformations, we are back to the linear problem of learning coefficients j5j which \"optimally\" fit the data.",
        "If we knew the appropriate transformation of our covariates (say the logarithm), we could simply apply it ourselves.",
        "GAMs allow us to learn these transformations from the data, when we expect some transformation to be useful but don't know it's form a priori.",
        "In practice, these smooth functions may be represented and the model parameters may be learned in various ways.",
        "In this work, we use the excellent open source package mgcv (Wood, 2006), which uses penalized likelihood maximization to prevent arbitrarily \"wiggly\" smooth functions (i.e., overfitting).",
        "Smooths (including multidimensional smooths) are represented by thin plate regression splines (Wood, 2003).",
        "The chief difficulty introduced in combining ranked speech retrieval results is the severe disagreement introduced by differing document hypotheses.",
        "As we saw in Figure 1, it is often the case that the most discriminative query terms occur in only one transcript source.",
        "Our first new approach for handling differences in transcripts is an extension of the logistic regression model previously used in data fusion work, (Savoy et al., 1988).",
        "Specifically, we augment the model with the first-order interaction of scores x1x2 and the factor ai, so that where the relevance Ri ~ Binomial.",

        "where ai corresponds to data row i, with associated document representations disource and query qi.",
        "The intuition is simply that we'd like our model to have different biases for or against relevance based on which transcript source retrieved the document.",
        "This is a small-dimensional way of dampening the effects of significant disagreements in the document representations.",
        "If a document's score is large in both systems, we expect it to have high probability of relevance.",
        "However, as a document's score increases linearly in one source, we have no reason to expect its probability of relevance to also increase linearly.",
        "Moreover, because the most discriminative terms are likely to be found in only one transcript source, even an absent score for a document does not ensure a document is not relevant.",
        "It is clear then that the mapping from document scores to probability of relevance is in general a complex nonlinear surface.",
        "The limited degree of nonlinear structure afforded to GLMs by non-identity link functions is unlikely to sufficiently capture this intuition.",
        "Instead, we can model this non-linearity using a generalized additive model with multidimensional smooth f (xibm,xBBN), so that logit{E(Ri)} = fto + f (xibm ,xbbn ).",
        "Again, Ri ~ Binomial and ft0 is a learned intercept (which, alternatively, may be absorbed by the smooth f).",
        "Figure 2 shows the smoothing transformation f learned during our evaluation.",
        "Note the small decrease in predicted probability of relevance as the retrieval score from one system decreases, while the probability curves upward again as the disagreement increases.",
        "This captures our intuition that systems often disagree strongly because discriminative terms are often not recognized in all transcript sources.",
        "We can think of the probability of relevance mapping learned by the factor model of Section 3.1.1 as also being a surface defined over the space of input document scores.",
        "That model, however, was constrained to be linear.",

        "While speech retrieval is one example of retrieval under errorful document representations, other similar tasks may also benefit from these combination models.",
        "This includes the task of cross-language retrieval, as well as the retrieval ofdocuments obtained by optical character recognition.",
        "Within speech retrieval, further work also remains to be done.",
        "For example, various other features are likely to be useful in predicting optimal system combination.",
        "These might include, for example, confidence scores, acoustic confusability, or other strong cues that one recognition system is unlikely to have properly recognized a query term.",
        "We look forward to investigating these possibilities in future work.",
        "The question of how much a system should expose its internal workings (e.g., its document representations) to external systems is a long standing problem in meta-search.",
        "We've taken the rather narrow view that systems might only expose the list of scores they assigned to retrieved documents, a plausible scenario considering the many systems now emerging which are effectively doing this already.",
        "Some examples include EveryZing, the MIT Lec- ture Browser, and Comcast's video search.",
        "This trend is likely to continue as the underlying representations of the content are themselves becoming increasingly complex (e.g., word and subword level lattices or confusion networks).",
        "The cost of exposing such a vast quantity of such complex data rapidly becomes difficult to justify.",
        "But if the various representations of the content are available, there are almost certainly other combination approaches worth investigating.",
        "Some possible approaches include simple linear combinations of the putative term frequencies, combinations of one best transcript hypotheses (e.g., using ROVER (Fiscus, 1997)), or methods exploiting word-lattice information (Evermann and Woodland, 2000).",
        "Our planet's 6.6 billion people speak many more words every day than even the largest Web search engines presently index.",
        "While much of this is surely not worth hearing again (or even once!",
        "), some of it is surely precious beyond measure.",
        "Separating the wheat from the chaff in this cacophony is the raison d'etre for information retrieval, and it is hard to conceive of an information retrieval challenge with greater scope or greater potential to impact our society than improving our access to the spoken word."
