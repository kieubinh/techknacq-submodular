        "This section describes algorithms which result in the four types of intensional summaries shown in Fig. 2.",

        "Let D be a domain comprised of a set R of database records {ri, ...rn}.",
        "Each record consists of a set of attributes {Aj, ...,An}, with associated values v: D(Ai)={vi;i,vit2, ...,vin}.",
        "In a dialogue system, a constraint is a value introduced by a user with either an explicit or implied associated attribute.",
        "A constraint c is a function over records in D such that Cj(R) returns a record r if r C D and r : Ai = c. The set of all dialogue constraints {ci, ... , cn} is the context C at any point in the dialogue.",
        "The set of records R in D that satisfy C is the focal information: R is the extension of C in D. For example, the attribute cuisine in a restaurant domain has values such as \"French\" or \"Italian\".",
        "A user utterance instantiating a constraint on cuisine, e.g., \"I'm interested in Chinese food\", results in a set of records for restaurants serving Chinese food.",
        "Intensional summaries as shown in Fig. 2 are descriptions of the focal information, that highlight particular subsets of the focal information and make generalizations over these subsets.",
        "The algorithm for constructing intensional summaries takes as input the focal information R, and consists of the following steps:",
        "• Rank attributes in context C, using one of two ranking methods (Sec.",
        "2.1);",
        "Figure 2: Four intensional summary types for a task specifying restaurants with Indian cuisine in London.",
        "• Select top-N attributes and construct clusters using selected attributes (Sec.",
        "2.2);",
        "• Construct frames for generation, perform aggregation and generate responses.",
        "We explore two candidates for attribute ranking: User model and Refiner.",
        "User model: The first algorithm utilizes decision-theoretic user models to provide an attribute ranking specific to each user (Carenini and Moore, 2000).",
        "The database contains 596 restaurants in London, with up to 19 attributes and their values.",
        "To utilize a user model, we first elicit user ranked preferences for domain attributes.",
        "Attributes that are unique across all entities, or missing for many entities, are automatically excluded, leaving six attributes: cuisine, decor quality, food quality, price, service, and neighborhood.",
        "These are ranked using the SMARTER procedure (Edwards and Barron, 1994).",
        "Rankings are converted to weights ( w) for each attribute, with a formula which guarantees that the weights sum to 1:",
        "where K equals the number of attributes in the ranking.",

        "The weights are also used for cluster scoring in Sec. 2.3.",
        "User model ranking is used to produce UM-Sing and UM-Assoc in Fig. 2.",
        "Refiner method: The second attribute ranking method is based on the Refiner algorithm for summary construction (Polifroni et al., 2003).",
        "The Refiner returns values for every attribute in the focal information in frames ordered by frequency.",
        "If the counts for the top-N (typically, 4) values for a particular attribute, e.g., cuisine, exceeded M% (typically 80%) of the total counts for all values, then that attribute is selected.",
        "For example, 82% of Indian restaurants in the London database are in the neighborhoods Mayfair, Soho, and Chelsea.",
        "Neighborhood would, therefore, be chosen as an attribute to speak about for Indian restaurants.",
        "The thresholds M and N in the original Refiner were set a priori, so it was possible that no attribute met or exceeded the thresholds for a particular subset of the data.",
        "In addition, some entities could have many unknown values for some attributes.",
        "Thus, to insure that all user queries result in some summary response, we modify the Refiner method to include a ranking function for attributes.",

        "Subjects assumed three \"personas\", a native Londoner, a tourist who was interacting with the system for the first time (GT), or a tourist for which the system has a user model (UMT).",
        "The personas were designed to reflect differing ends of the spectra defined by Belkin to characterize informationseeking strategies (Belkin et al., 1994).",
        "There was a significant preference for intensional summaries across all personas, but especially when the personas were unfamiliar with the domain.",
        "This preference indicates that the benefits of intensional summaries outweigh the increase in verbosity.",
        "We then tested four algorithms for summary construction.",
        "Results show that intensional summaries based on a user model with association rules, or on the Refiner method (Polifroni et al., 2003), are equally effective.",
        "While (Dem-berg and Moore, 2006) found that their user model stepwise refinement (UMSR) method was superior to the Refiner method, they also found many situations (70 out of 190) in which the Refiner method was preferred.",
        "Our experiment was structured differently, but it suggests that, in certain circumstances, or within certain domains, users may wish to hear about choices based on an analysis of focal information, irrespective of user preferences.",
        "Our intensional summary algorithms automatically construct summaries from a database, along with user models collected via a domain-independent method; thus we believe that the methods described here are domain-independent.",
        "Furthermore, in tests to determine whether a classifier can predict the best summary type to use in a given context, we achieved an accuracy of 68% as compared to a majority class baseline of 47%, using dialogue context features.",
        "Both of these results point hopefully towards a different way of automating dialogue design, one based on a combination of user modelling and an analysis of contextual information.",
        "In future work we hope to test these algorithms in other domains, and show that in-tensional summaries can not only be automatically derived but also lead to reduced task times and increased task success."
