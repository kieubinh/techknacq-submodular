        "NER systems have been developed for English and few other languages with high accuracy.",
        "These belong to two main categories based on machine learning (Bikel et al., 1997; Borthwick, 1999; McCallum and Li, 2003) and language or domain specific rules (Grishman, 1995; Wakaoetal., 1996).",
        "In English, the names are usually capitalized which is an important clue for identifying a name.",
        "Absence of capitalization makes the Hindi NER task difficult.",
        "Also, person names are more diverse in Indian languages, many common words being used as names.",
        "A pioneering work on Hindi NER is by Li and McCallum (2003) where they used Conditional Random Fields (CRF) and feature induction to automatically construct only the features that are important for recognition.",
        "In an effort to reduce overfit-ting, they use a combination of a Gaussian prior and early-stopping.",
        "In their Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) based approach for Hindi NER development, Saha et al.",
        "(2008) also observed that the performance of the MaxEnt based model often decreases when huge number of features are used in the model.",
        "This is due to overfitting which is a serious problem in most of the NLP tasks in resource poor languages where annotated data is scarce.",
        "This paper is a study on effectiveness of word clustering and selection as feature reduction techniques for MaxEnt based NER.",
        "For clustering we use a number of word similarities like cosine similarity among words and co-occurrence, along with the k-means clustering algorithm.",
        "The clusters are then used as features instead of words.",
        "For important word selection we use corpus based statistical measurements to find the importance of the words in the NER task.",
        "A significant performance improvement over baseline MaxEnt was observed after using the above feature reduction techniques.",

        "Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) principle is a commonly used technique which provides probability of belongingness of a token to a class.",
        "MaxEnt computes the probability p(o\\h) for any o from the space of all possible outcomes O, and for every h from the space of all possible histories H. In NER, history can be viewed as all information derivable from the training corpus relative to the current token.",
        "The computation of probability (p(o\\h)) of an outcome for a token in MaxEnt depends on a set of features that are helpful in making predictions about the outcome.",
        "The features may be binary-valued or multivalued.",
        "Given a set of features and a training corpus, the MaxEnt estimation process produces a model in which every feature fi has a weight aij.",
        "We can compute the conditional probability as (Berger et al., 1996):",
        "The conditional probability of the outcome is the product of the weights of all active features, normalized over the products of all the features.",
        "For our development we have used a Java based open-nlp MaxEnt toolkit.",
        "A beam search algorithm is used to get the most probable class from the probabilities.",
        "The training data for the Hindi NER task is composed of about 243K words which is collected from the popular daily Hindi newspaper \"Dainik Jagaran\".",
        "This corpus has been manually annotated and contains about 16,491 Named Entities (NEs).",
