        "In recent years, the computational linguistics community has developed an impressive number of semantic verb classifications, i.e., classifications that generalise over verbs according to their semantic properties.",
        "Intuitive examples of such classifications are the Motion with a Vehicle class, including verbs such as drive, fly, row, etc., or the Break a Solid Surface with an Instrument class, including verbs such as break, crush, fracture, smash, etc.",
        "Semantic verb classifications are of great interest to computational linguistics, specifically regarding the pervasive problem ofdata sparseness in the processing of natural language.",
        "up to now, such classifications have been used in applications such as word sense disambiguation (Dorr and Jones, 1996; Kohomban and Lee, 2005), machine translation (Prescher et al., 2000; Koehn and Hoang, 2007), document classification (Klavans and Kan, 1998), and in statistical lexical acquisition in general (Rooth et al., 1999; Merlo and Stevenson, 2001; Korhonen, 2002; Schulte im Walde, 2006).",
        "Given that the creation of semantic verb classifications is not an end task in itself, but depends on the application scenario of the classification, we ind various approaches to an automatic induction of semantic verb classifications.",
        "For example, Siegel and McKeown (2000) used several machine learning algorithms to perform an automatic aspectual classification of English verbs into event and stative verbs.",
        "Merlo and Stevenson (2001) presented an automatic classification of three types of English intransitive verbs, based on argument structure and heuristics to thematic relations.",
        "Pereira et al.",
        "(1993) and Rooth et al.",
        "(1999) relied on the Expectation-Maximisation algorithm to induce soft clusters of verbs, based on the verbs' direct object nouns.",
        "Similarly, Korhonen et al.",
        "(2003) relied on the Information Bottleneck (Tishby et al., 1999) and subcate-gorisation frame types to induce soft verb clusters.",
        "This paper presents an innovative, complex approach to semantic verb classes that relies on selectional preferences as verb properties.",
        "The underlying linguistic assumption for this verb class model is that verbs which agree on their selectional preferences belong to a common semantic class.",
        "The model is implemented as a soft-clustering approach, in order to capture the polysemy of the verbs.",
        "The training procedure uses the Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm (Baum, 1972) to iteratively improve the probabilistic parameters of the model, and applies the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle (Rissanen, 1978) to induce WordNet-based selectional preferences for arguments within subcategorisation frames.",
        "Our model is potentially useful for lexical induction (e.g., verb senses, subcategorisation and selectional preferences, collocations, and verb alternations), and for NLP applications in sparse data situations.",
        "In this paper, we provide an evaluation based on a language model.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organised as follows.",
        "Section 2 introduces our probabilistic verb class model, the EM training, and how we incorporate the MDL principle.",
        "Section 3 describes the clustering experiments, including the experimental setup, the evaluation, and the results.",

        "Consequently, the EM algorithm a priori prefers fine-grained concepts but - due to sparse data problems - tends to overfit the training data.",

        "As a result, each concept class is assigned a fraction of the frequency of the whole data set (and the top concept receives the total frequency of the data set).",

        "2.",
        "The model is trained for a predefined number of iterations.",
        "In each iteration, not only the model probabilities are re-estimated and maximised (as done by EM), but also the cuts through the concept hierarchies that represent the various selectional preference models are re-assessed.",
        "In each iteration, the following steps are performed.",
        "(a) The partial WordNet hierarchies that represent the selectional preference models are expanded to include the hyponyms of the respective leaf concepts of the partial hierarchies.",
        "I.e., in the first iteration, all models are expanded towards the hyponyms of entity, and in subsequent iterations each selectional preference model is expanded to include the hyponyms of the leaf nodes in the partial hierarchies resulting from the previous iteration.",
        "This expansion step allows the selection models to become more and more detailed, as the training proceeds and the verb clusters (and their selectional restrictions) become increasingly specific.",
        "(b) The training tuples are processed: For each tuple, a PCFG parse forest as indicated by Figure 1 is done, and the Inside-Outside algorithm is applied to estimate the frequencies of the \"parse tree rules\", given the current model probabilities.",
        "(c) The MDL principle is applied to each selectional preference model: Starting from the respective leaf concepts in the partial hierarchies, MDL is calculated to compare each set of hyponym concepts that share a hypernym with the respective hypernym concept.",
        "If the MDL is lower for the set of hyponyms than the hypernym, the hyponyms are left in the partial hierarchy.",
        "Otherwise the expansion of the hyper-nym towards the hyponyms is undone and we continue recursively upwards the hierarchy, calculating MDL to compare the former hypernym and its co-hyponyms with the next upper hypernym, etc.",
        "The recursion allows the training algorithm to remove nodes which were added in earlier iterations and are no longer relevant.",
        "It stops if the MDL is lower for the hyponyms than for the hypernym.",
        "This step results in selectional preference models that minimally contain the top concept entity, and maximally contain the partial WordNet hierarchy between entity and the concept classes that have been expanded within this iteration.",

        "As we wanted to train and assess our verb class model under various conditions, we used different fractions of the training data in different training regimes.",

        "Furthermore, we disregarded tuples with personal pronoun arguments; they are not represented in WordNet, and even if they are added (e.g. to general concepts such as person, entity) they have a rather destructive effect.",
        "We considered two subsets of the subcate-gorisation frames with 10 and 20 elements, which were chosen according to their overall frequency in the training data; for example, the 10 most frequent frame types were subj:obj, subj, subj:ap, subj:to, subj:obj:obj2, subj:obj:pp-in, subj:adv, subj:pp-in, subj:vbase, subj:that.",
        "When relying on theses 10/20 subcategorisation frames, plus including the above restrictions, we were left with 39,773/158,134 and 42,826/166,303 training tuple types/tokens, respectively.",
        "The overall number of training tuples was therefore much smaller than the generally available data.",

        "We expected that the verb class model would perform better than the baseline model on tuples where one or more of the arguments were not observed with the respective verb, because either the argument itself or a semantically similar argument (according to the selectional preferences) was observed with verbs belonging to the same cluster.",
        "We also expected that the verb class model assigns a lower probability than the baseline model to test tuples which frequently occurred in the training data, since the verb class model fails to describe precisely the idiosyncratic properties of verbs which are not shared by the other verbs of its cluster.",

        "Smoothing of the Verb Class Model Although the verb class model has a built-in smoothing capacity, it needs additional smoothing for two reasons: Firstly, some of the nouns in the test data did not occur in the training data.",

        "Hence we smoothed the concept instantiation probabilities p( noun| concept) with Witten-Bell smoothing (Chen and Goodman, 1998).",
        "Secondly, we smoothed the probabilities of the concepts in the selectional preference models where zero probabilities may occur.",
        "The smoothing ensures that the verb class model assigns a positive probability to each verb-argument tuple with a known verb, a known subcategorisation frame, and arguments which are in WordNet.",

        "The differences in the result indicate that the models including the hapax legomena are worse than the models that excluded the sparse events; at the same time, the differences between baseline and clustering model are larger.",

        "This paper presented an innovative, complex approach to semantic verb classes that relies on selectional preferences as verb properties.",
        "The probabilistic verb class model underlying the semantic classes was trained by a combination of the EM algorithm and the MDL principle, providing soft clusters with two dimensions (verb senses and subcate-gorisation frames with selectional preferences) as a result.",
        "A language model-based evaluation showed that after 10 training iterations the verb class model results are above the baseline results.",
        "or a fixed number of arguments from one particular subcategorisation frame, whereas our model defines a probability distribution over all subcategori-sation frames.",
        "Furthermore, our model specifies selectional preferences in terms of general WordNet concepts rather than sets of individual words.",
        "In a similar vein, our model is both similar and distinct in comparison to the soft clustering approaches by Pereira et al.",
        "(1993) and Korhonen et al.",
        "(2003).",
        "Pereira et al.",
        "(1993) suggested deterministic annealing to cluster verb-argument pairs into classes of verbs and nouns.",
        "On the one hand, their model is asymmetric, thus not giving the same interpretation power to verbs and arguments; on the other hand, the model provides a more fine-grained clustering for nouns, in the form of an additional hierarchical structure of the noun clusters.",
        "Korhonen et al.",
        "(2003) used verb-frame pairs (instead of verbargument pairs) to cluster verbs relying on the Information Bottleneck (Tishby et al., 1999).",
        "They had a focus on the interpretation of verbal polysemy as represented by the soft clusters.",
        "The main difference of our model in comparison to the above two models is, again, that we incorporate selectional preferences (rather than individual words, or subcategorisation frames).",
        "In addition to the above soft-clustering models, various approaches towards semantic verb classification have relied on hard-clustering models, thus simplifying the notion of verbal polysemy.",
        "Two large-scale approaches of this kind are Schulte im Walde (2006), who used k-Means on verb subcat-egorisation frames and verbal arguments to cluster verbs semantically, and Joanis et al.",
        "(2008), who applied Support Vector Machines to a variety of verb features, including subcategorisation slots, tense, voice, and an approximation to animacy.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, Schulte im Walde (2006) is the only hard-clustering approach that previously incorporated selectional preferences as verb features.",
        "However, her model was not soft-clustering, and she only used a simple approach to represent selectional preferences by WordNet's top-level concepts, instead of making use of the whole hierarchy and more sophisticated methods, as in the current paper.",
        "Last but not least, there are other models of selectional preferences than the MDL model we used in our paper.",
        "Most such models also rely on the",
        "WordNet hierarchy (Resnik, 1997; Abney and Light, 1999; Ciaramita and Johnson, 2000; Clark and Weir, 2002).",
        "Brockmann and Lapata (2003) compared some of the models against human judgements on the acceptability of sentences, and demonstrated that the models were significantly correlated with human ratings, and that no model performed best; rather, the different methods are suited for different argument relations."

        "We plan to improve the verb class model with respect to (i) a concept-wise (instead of a cut-wise) implementation of the MDL principle, to operate on concepts instead of combinations of concepts; and (ii) variations of the concept hierarchy, using e.g. the sense-clustered WordNets from the Stanford Word-Net Project (Snow et al., 2007), or a WordNet version improved by concepts from DOLCE (Gangemi et al., 2003), to check on the influence of conceptual details on the clustering results.",
        "Furthermore, we aim to use the verb class model in NLP tasks, (i) as resource for lexical induction of verb senses, verb alternations, and collocations, and (ii) as a lexical resource for the statistical disambiguation of parse trees."
