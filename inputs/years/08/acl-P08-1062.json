        "In NE translation, most person names are transliterated, and some parts of location names or organization names also need to be transliterated.",
        "Transliteration has two directions: forward transliteration which transforms an original name into target language, and backward transliteration which recovers a name back to its original expression.",

        "In this paper, we focus on backward transliteration from Chinese to English.",
        "Many previous researches have tried to build a transliteration model using statistical approach [Knight and Graehl, 1998; Lin and Chen, 2002; Virga and Khudanpur, 2003; Gao, 2004].",
        "There are two main challenges in statistical backward transliteration: First, statistical transliteration approach selects the most probable translations based on the knowledge learned from the training data.",
        "This approach, however, does not work well when there are multiple standards [Gao, 2004].",
        "Second, backward transliteration is more challenging than forward transliteration as it is required to disambiguate the noises introduced in the forward transliteration and estimate the original name as close as possible [Lin and Chen, 2002].",
        "One of the most important causes in introducing noises is that: some silent syllables in original names have been missing when they are transliterated to target language.",
        "For example, when \"Campbell\" is transliterated into \"i^/kanJJl/bei/K/er\", the \"p\" is missing.",

        "We can't get Chinese-English bilingual pages when the input is a Chinese query.",
        "Therefore, the existing assistance approaches using web-mining to assist transliteration are not suitable for Chinese to English backward transliteration.",
        "Thus in this paper, we mainly focus on the following two problems to be solved in transliteration.",
        "Problem I: Some silent syllables are missing in English-Chinese forward transliteration.",
        "How to recover them effectively and efficiently in backward transliteration is still an open problem.",
        "Problem II: Statistical transliteration always chooses the translations based on probabilities.",
        "However, in some cases, the correct translation may have lower probability.",
        "Therefore, more studies are needed on combination with other techniques as supplements.",
        "Aiming at these two problems, we propose a method which mines monolingual web resources to assist backward transliteration.",
        "The main ideas are as follows.",
        "We assume that for every Chinese entity name which needs to be backward transliterated to an English original name, the correct transliteration exists somewhere in the web.",
        "What we need to do is to find out the answers based on the clues given by statistical transliteration results.",
        "Different from the traditional methods which extract transliteration pairs from bilingual pages, we only use monolingual web resources.",

        "Firstly, there are much more monolingual web resources available to be used.",
        "Secondly, our method can revise the transliteration candidates to the existing words before the subsequent re-ranking process, so that we can better mine the correct transliteration from the Web.",
        "Concretely, there are two phases involved in our approach.",
        "In the first phase, we split the result of transliteration into syllables, and then a syllable-based searching processing can be employed to revise the result in a word list generated from web pages, with an expectation of higher recall of transliteration.",
        "In the second phase, we use a revised word as a search query to get its contexts and hit information, which are integrated into the AdaBoost classifier to determine whether the word is a transliteration name or not with a confidence score.",
        "This phase can readjust the candidate's score to a more reasonable point so that precision of transliteration can be improved.",

        "The phonetic similarity expansion is based on the input Chinese Pinyin sequence, so it's same for all candidates.",
        "Syllable expansion based on syllable similarity: If two syllables have similar alignment probability with every pinyin, we can view these two syllables as synonymy.",
        "Therefore, if a syllable is in the query, its synonymies should be contained too.",
        "For example, \"fea\" and \"fe\" can replace each other.",
