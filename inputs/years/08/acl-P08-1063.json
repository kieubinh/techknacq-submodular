        "Semantic Role Labeling is the problem of analyzing clause predicates in open text by identifying arguments and tagging them with semantic labels indicating the role they play with respect to the verb.",
        "Such sentence-level semantic analysis allows to determine \"who\" did \"what\" to \"whom\", \"when\" and \"where\", and, thus, characterize the participants and properties of the events established by the predicates.",
        "This kind of semantic analysis is very interesting for a broad spectrum of NLP applications (information extraction, summarization, question answering, machine translation, etc.",
        "), since it opens the door to exploit the semantic relations among linguistic constituents.",
        "The properties of the semantically annotated corpora available have conditioned the type of research and systems that have been developed so far.",
        "Prop-Bank (Palmer et al., 2005) is the most widely used corpus for training SRL systems, probably because it contains running text from the Penn Treebank corpus with annotations on all verbal predicates.",
        "Also, a few evaluation exercises on SRL have been conducted on this corpus in the CoNLL-2004 and 2005 conferences.",
        "However, a serious criticisms to the PropBank corpus refers to the role set it uses, which consists of a set of numbered core arguments, whose semantic translation is verb-dependent.",
        "While Arg0 and Argl are intended to indicate the general roles of Agent and Theme, other argument numbers do not generalize across verbs and do not correspond to general semantic roles.",
        "This fact might compromise generalization and portability of SRL systems, especially when the training corpus is small.",
        "More recently, a mapping from PropBank numbered arguments into VerbNet thematic roles has been developed and a version of the PropBank corpus with thematic roles has been released (Loper et al., 2007).",
        "Thematic roles represent a compact set of verb-independent general roles widely used in linguistic theory (e.g., Agent, Theme, Patient, Recipient, Cause, etc.).",
        "We foresee two advantages of using such thematic roles.",
        "On the one hand, statistical SRL systems trained from them could generalize better and, therefore, be more robust and portable, as suggested in (Yi et al., 2007).",
        "On the other hand, roles in a paradigm like VerbNet would allow for inferences over the assigned roles, which is only possible in a more limited way with PropBank.",
        "In a previous paper (Zapirain et al., 2008), we presented a first comparison between the two previous role sets on the SemEval-2007 Task 17 corpus (Prad-han et al., 2007).",
        "The SemEval-2007 corpus only comprised examples about 50 different verbs.",
        "The results of that paper were, thus, considered preliminary, as they could depend on the small amount of data (both in training data and number of verbs) or the specific set of verbs being used.",
        "Now, we extend those experiments to the entire PropBank corpus, and we include two extra experiments on domain shifts (using the Brown corpus as test set) and on grouping VerbNet labels.",
        "More concretely, this paper explores two aspects of the problem.",
        "First, having in mind the claim that general thematic roles should be more robust to changing domains and unseen predicates, we study the performance of a state-of-the-art SRL system trained on either codification of roles and some specific settings, i.e. including/excluding verb-specific information, labeling unseen verb predicates, or domain shifts.",
        "Second, assuming that application scenarios would prefer dealing with general thematic role labels, we explore the best way to label a text with thematic roles, namely, by training directly on VerbNet roles or by using the PropBank SRL system and perform a posterior mapping into thematic roles.",
        "The results confirm our preliminary findings (Zapirain et al., 2008).",
        "We observe that the PropBank roles are more robust in all tested experimental conditions, i.e., the performance decrease is more severe for VerbNet.",
        "Besides, tagging first PropBank roles and then mapping into VerbNet roles is as effective as training and tagging directly on VerbNet, and more robust for domain shifts.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 contains some background on PropBank and VerbNetrole sets.",
        "Section 3 presents the experimental setting and the base SRL system used for the role set comparisons.",
        "In Section 4 the main comparative experiments on robustness are described.",
        "Section 5 is devoted to analyze the posterior mapping of PropBank outputs into VerbNet thematic roles, and includes results on domain-shift experiments using Brown as test set.",
        "Finally, Sections 6 and 7 contain a discussion of the results."

        "The PropBank corpus is the result of adding a semantic layer to the syntactic structures of Penn Treebank II (Palmer et al., 2005).",
        "Specifically, it provides information about predicate-argument structures to all verbal predicates of the Wall Street Journal section of the treebank.",
        "The role set is theory-neutral and consists of a set of numbered core arguments (Arg0, Argl, Arg5).",
        "Each verb has a frameset listing its allowed role labels and mapping each numbered role to an English-language description of its semantics.",
        "Different senses for a polysemous verb have different framesets, but the argument labels are semantically consistent in all syntactic alternations of the same verb-sense.",
        "For instance in \"Kevin broke [the window]Argi \" and in \"[The door]Argi broke into a million pieces\", for the verb broke.01, both Argl arguments have the same semantic meaning, that is \"broken entity\".",
        "Nevertheless, argument labels are not necessarily consistent across different verbs (or verb senses).",
        "For instance, the same Arg2 label is used to identify the Destination argument of a proposition governed by the verb send and the Beneficiary argument of the verb compose.",
        "This fact might compromise generalization of systems trained on Prop-Bank, which might be focusing too much on verb-specific knowledge.",
        "It is worth noting that the two most frequent arguments, Arg0 and Argl, are intended to indicate the general roles of Agent and Theme and are usually consistent across different verbs.",
        "However, this correspondence is not total.",
        "According to the study by (Yi et al., 2007), Arg0 corresponds to Agent 85.4% of the time, but also to Experiencer (7.2%), Theme (2.1%), and Cause (1.9%).",
        "Similarly, Argl corresponds to Theme in 47.0% of the occurrences but also to Topic (23.0%), Patient (10.8%), and Product (2.9%), among others.",

        "The classes are based on Levin's verb classes (Levin, 1993) and each contains a list of member verbs and a correspondence between the shared syntactic frames and the semantic information, such as thematic roles and selectional constraints.",
        "There are 23 thematic roles (Agent, Patient, Theme, Experiencer, Source, Beneficiary, Instrument, etc.)",
        "which, unlike the Prop-",
        "Bank numbered arguments, are considered as general verb-independent roles.",
        "This level of abstraction makes them, in principle, better suited (compared to PropBank numbered arguments) for being directly exploited by general NLP applications.",
        "But, VerbNet by itself is not an appropriate resource to train SRL systems.",
        "As opposed to PropBank, the number of tagged examples is far more limited in VerbNet.",
        "Fortunately, in the last years a twofold effort has been made in order to generate a large corpus fully annotated with thematic roles.",
        "Firstly, the SemLink resource (Loper et al., 2007) established a mapping between Prop-Bank framesets and VerbNet thematic roles.",
        "Secondly, the SemLink mapping was applied to a representative portion of the PropBank corpus and manually disambiguated (Loper et al., 2007).",

        "We first seek a basic reference of the comparative performance of the classifier on each role set.",
        "We devised two settings based on our dataset.",
        "In the first setting ('SemEval') we use all the available information provided in the corpus, including the verb senses in PropBank and VerbNet.",
        "This information was available both in the training and test, and was thus used as an additional feature by the classifier and to constrain further the possible arguments when searching for the most probable Viterbi path.",
        "We call this setting 'SemEval' because the SemEval-2007 competition (Pradhan et al., 2007) was performed using this configuration.",
        "Being aware that, in a real scenario, the sense information will not be available, we devised the second setting ('CoNLL'), where the hand-annotated verb sense information was discarded.",
        "This is the setting used in the CoNLL 2005 shared task (Carreras and Marquez, 2005).",
        "The results for the first setting are shown in the 'SemEval setting' rows of Table 1.",
        "The correct, excess, missed, precision, recall and Fi measures are reported, as customary.",
        "The significance intervals for Fi are also reported.",
        "They have been obtained with bootstrap resampling (Noreen, 1989).",
        "Fi scores outside of these intervals are assumed to be significantly different from the related F1 score (p < 0.05).",
        "The results for PropBank are slightly better, which is reasonable, as the number of labels that the classifier has to learn in the case of VerbNet should make the task harder.",
        "In fact, given the small difference, one could think that VerbNet labels, being more numerous, are easier to learn, perhaps because they are more consistent across verbs.",
        "In the second setting ('CoNLL setting' row in the same table) the PropBank classifier degrades slightly, but the difference is not statistically significant.",
        "On the contrary, the drop of 1.6 points for VerbNet is significant, and shows greater sensitivity to the absence of the sense information for verbs.",
        "One possible reason could be that the VerbNet classifier is more dependant on the argument filter (i.e., the 5th constraint in Section 3.2, which only allows roles that occur in the verbal frameset) used in the Viterbi search, and lacking the sense information makes the filter less useful.",
        "In fact, we have attested that the 5th constrain discard more than 60% of the possible candidates for VerbNet, making the task of the classifier easier.",
        "In order to test this hypothesis, we run the CoNLL setting with the 5th constraint disabled (that is, allowing any argument).",
        "The results in the 'CoNLL setting (no 5th)' rows of Table 1 show that the drop for PropBank is negligible and not significant, while the drop for VerbNet is more important, and statistically significant.",
        "Another view of the data is obtained if we compute the F1 scores for core arguments and adjuncts separately (last two columns in Table 1).",
        "The performance drop for PropBank in the first three rows is equally distributed on both core arguments and adjuncts.",
        "On the contrary, the drop for VerbNet roles is more acute in core arguments (3.7 points), while adjuncts with the 5th constraint disabled get results close to the SemEval setting.",
        "These results confirm that the information in the verbal frameset is more important in VerbNet than in PropBank, as only core arguments are constrained in the verbal framesets.",
        "The explanation could stem from the fact that current SRL systems rely more on syntactic information than pure semantic knowledge.",
        "While PropBank arguments Arg0-5 are easier to distinguish on syntactic grounds alone, it seems quite difficult to distinguish among roles like Theme and Topic unless we have access to the specific verbal frameset.",
        "This corresponds nicely with the performance drop for VerbNet when there is less information about the verb in the algorithm (i.e., sense or frameset).",
        "We further analyzed the results by looking at each of the individual core arguments and adjuncts.",
        "Table 2 shows these results on the CoNLL setting.",
        "The performance for the most frequent roles is similar and Patient (which get 75.46, 85.70 and 78.64 respectively).",
        "Finally, we grouped the results according to the frequency of the verbs in the training data.",
        "Table 3 shows that both PropBank and VerbNet get decreasing results for less frequent verbs.",
        "PropBank gets better results in all frequency ranges, except for the most frequent, which contains a single verb (say).",
        "Overall, the results on this section point out at the weaknesses of the VerbNet role set regarding robustness and generalization.",
        "The next sections examine further its behavior.",
        "In principle, the PropBank core roles (Arg0-4) get a different interpretation depending of the verb, that is, the meaning of each of the roles is described separately for each verb in the PropBank framesets.",
        "Still, the annotation criteria used with PropBank tried to make the two main roles (Arg0 and Arg1, which account for most of the occurrences) consistent across verbs.",
        "On the contrary, in VerbNet all roles are completely independent of the verb, in the sense that the interpretation of the role does not vary across verbs.",
        "But, at the same time, each verbal entry lists the possible roles it accepts, and the combinations allowed.",
        "This experiment tests the sensitivity of the two approaches when the SRL system encounters a verb which does not occur in the training data.",
        "In principle, we would expect the VerbNet semantic labels, which are more independent across verbs, to be more robust at tagging new predicates.",
        "It is worth noting that this is a realistic scenario, even for the verb-specific PropBank labels.",
        "Predicates which do not occur in the training data, but do have a Prop-Bank lexicon entry, could appear quite often in the text to be analyzed.",
        "For this experiment, we artificially created a test set for unseen verbs.",
        "We chose 50 verbs at random, and split them into 40 verbs for training and 10 for testing (yielding 13,146 occurrences for training and 2,723 occurrences for testing; see Table 4).",
        "The results obtained after training and testing the classifier are shown in the last rows in Table 1.",
        "Note that they are not directly comparable to the other results mentioned so far, as the train and test sets are smaller.",
        "Figures indicate that the performance of the PropBank argument classifier is considerably higher than the VerbNet classifier, with a ~15 point gap.",
        "This experiment shows that lacking any information about verbal head, the classifier has a hard time to distinguish among VerbNet roles.",
        "In order to confirm this, we performed the following experiment.",
        "In this experiment we want to test the sensitivity of the role sets when the classifier does not have any information of the verb predicate.",
        "We removed from the training and testing data all the features which make any reference to the verb, including, among others: the surface form, lemma and POS of the verb, and all the combined features that include the verb form (please, refer to (Zapirain et al., 2007) for a complete description of the feature set).",

        "It is worth noting that the adjunct labels get very similar performances in both PropBank and VerbNet cases.",
        "In fact, Table 1 in the last two rows shows very clearly that the performance drop is caused by the core arguments.",
        "The better robustness of the PropBank roles can be explained by the fact that, when creating Prop-Bank, the human PropBank annotators tried to be consistent when tagging Arg0 and Arg1 across verbs.",
