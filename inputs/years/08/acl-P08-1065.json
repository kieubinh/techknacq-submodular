        "Pronouncing an unfamiliar word is a task that is often accomplished by breaking the word down into smaller components.",
        "Even small children learning to read are taught to pronounce a word by \"sounding out\" its parts.",
        "Thus, it is not surprising that Letter-to-Phoneme (L2P) systems, which convert orthographic forms of words into sequences of phonemes, can benefit from subdividing the input word into smaller parts, such as syllables or morphemes.",
        "Marchand and Damper (2007) report that incorporating oracle syllable boundary information improves the accuracy of their L2P system, but they fail to emulate that result with any of their automatic syllabification methods.",
        "Demberg et al.",
        "(2007), on the other hand, find that morphological segmentation boosts L2P performance in German, but not in English.",
        "To our knowledge, no previous English orthographic syllabification system has been able to actually improve performance on the larger L2P problem.",
        "In this paper, we focus on the task of automatic orthographic syllabification, with the explicit goal of improving L2P accuracy.",
        "A syllable is a subdivision of a word, typically consisting of a vowel, called the nucleus, and the consonants preceding and following the vowel, called the onset and the coda, respectively.",
        "Although in the strict linguistic sense syllables are phonological rather than orthographic entities, our L2P objective constrains the input to orthographic forms.",
        "Syllabification of phonemic representation is in fact an easier task, which we plan to address in a separate publication.",
        "Orthographic syllabification is sometimes referred to as hyphenation.",
        "Many dictionaries provide hyphenation information for orthographic word forms.",
        "These hyphenation schemes are related to, and influenced by, phonemic syllabification.",
        "They serve two purposes: to indicate where words may be broken for end-of-line divisions, and to assist the dictionary reader with correct pronunciation (Gove, 1993).",
        "Although these purposes are not always consistent with our objective, we show that we can improve L2P conversion by taking advantage of the available hyphenation data.",
        "In addition, automatic hyphenation is a legitimate task by itself, which could be utilized in word editors or in synthesizing new trade names from several concepts.",
        "We present a discriminative approach to orthographic syllabification.",
        "We formulate syllabification as a tagging problem, and learn a discriminative tagger from labeled data using a structured support vector machine (SVM) (Tsochantaridis et al., 2004).",
        "With this approach, we reduce the error rate for English by 33%, relative to the best existing system.",
        "Moreover, we are also able to improve a state-of-the-art L2P system by incorporating our syllabification models.",
        "Our method is not language specific; when applied to German and Dutch, our performance is comparable with the best existing systems in those languages, even though our system has been developed and tuned on English only.",
        "The paper is structured as follows.",
        "After discussing previous computational approaches to the problem (Section 2), we introduce structured SVMs (Section 3), and outline how we apply them to orthographic syllabification (Section 4).",
        "We present our experiments and results for the syllabification task in Section 5.",
        "In Section 6, we apply our syllabification models to the L2P task.",

        "A structured support vector machine (SVM) is a large-margin training method that can learn to predict structured outputs, such as tag sequences or parse trees, instead of performing binary classification (Tsochantaridis et al., 2004).",
        "We employ a structured SVM that predicts tag sequences, called an SVM Hidden Markov Model, or SVM-HMM.",
        "This approach can be considered an HMM because the Viterbi algorithm is used to find the highest scoring tag sequence for a given observation sequence.",
        "The scoring model employs a Markov assumption: each tag's score is modified only by the tag that came before it.",
        "This approach can be considered an SVM because the model parameters are trained discrimi-natively to separate correct tag sequences from incorrect ones by as large a margin as possible.",
        "In contrast to generative HMMs, the learning process requires labeled training data.",
        "There are a number of good reasons to apply the structured SVM formalism to this problem.",
        "We get the benefit of discriminative training, not available in a generative HMM.",
        "Furthermore, we can use an arbitrary feature representation that does not require any conditional independence assumptions.",
        "Unlike a traditional SVM, the structured SVM considers complete tag sequences during training, instead of breaking each sequence into a number of training instances.",
        "Training a structured SVM can be viewed as a multi-class classification problem.",
        "Each training instance xi is labeled with a correct tag sequence yidrawn from a set of possible tag sequences Yi.",

        "Given a trained weight vector w, the SVM tags new instances Xi according to:",
        "A structured SVM finds a w that satisfies Equation 1, and separates the correct taggings by as large a margin as possible.",
        "The argmax in Equation 2 is conducted using the Viterbi algorithm.",

        "In practice, a structured distance term is added to the inequality in Equation 1 so that the required margin is larger for tag sequences that diverge further from the correct sequence.",
        "Also, slack variables are employed to allow a trade-off between training accuracy and the complexity of w, via a tunable cost parameter.",
        "For most structured problems, the set of negative sequences in Yi is exponential in the length of xi, and the constraints in Equation 1 cannot be explicitly enumerated.",

        "In this paper we apply structured SVMs to the syllabification problem.",

        "We use a linear kernel, and tune the SVM's cost parameter on a development set.",
        "The feature representation \\Jj consists of emission features, which pair an aspect of x with a single tag from y, and transition features, which count tag pairs occurring in y.",
        "With SVM-HMM, the crux of the task is to create a tag scheme and feature set that produce good results.",
        "In this section, we discuss several different approaches to tagging for the syllabification task.",
        "Subsequently, we outline our emission feature representation.",
        "While developing our tagging schemes and feature representation, we used a development set of 5K words held out from our CELEX training data.",
        "All results reported in this section are on that set.",
        "We have employed two different approaches to tagging in this research.",
        "Positional tags capture where a letter occurs within a syllable; Structural tags express the role each letter is playing within the syllable.",
        "Positional Tags",
        "The NB tag scheme simply labels every letter as either being at a syllable boundary (B), or not (N).",
        "Thus, the word immorally is tagged (N B N N B N B N N), indicating a syllable boundary after each B tag.",
        "This binary classification approach to tagging is implicit in several previous implementations (Daelemans and van den Bosch, 1992; Bouma, 2002), and has been done explicitly in both the orthographic (Demberg, 2006) and phoneme domains (van den Bosch, 1997).",
        "A weakness of NB tags is that they encode no knowledge about the length of a syllable.",
        "Intuitively, we expect the length of a syllable to be valuable information – most syllables in English contain fewer than four characters.",
        "We introduce a tagging scheme that sequentially numbers the N tags to impart information about syllable length.",
        "Under the Numbered NB tag scheme, immorally is annotated as (Nl B Nl N2BN1 B N1 N2).",
        "With this tag set, we have effectively introduced a bias in favor of shorter syllables: tags like N6, N7... are comparatively rare, so the learner will postulate them only when the evidence is particularly compelling.",
        "Structural Tags",
        "Numbered NB tags are more informative than standard NB tags.",
        "However, neither annotation system can represent the internal structure of the syllable.",
        "This has advantages: tags can be automatically generated from a list of syllabified words without even a passing familiarity with the language.",
        "However, a more informative annotation, tied to phono-tactics, ought to improve accuracy.",
        "Krenn (1997) proposes the ONC tag scheme, in which phonemes of a syllable are tagged as an onset, nucleus, or coda.",
        "Given these ONC tags, syllable boundaries can easily be generated by applying simple regular expressions.",
        "Unfortunately, it is not as straightforward to generate ONC-tagged training data in the orthographic domain, even with syllabified training data.",
        "Silent letters are problematic, and some letters can behave differently depending on their context (in English, consonants such as m, y, and l can act as vowels in certain situations).",
        "Thus, it is difficult to generate ONC tags for orthographic forms without at least a cursory knowledge of the language and its principles.",
        "For English, tagging the syllabified training set with ONC tags is performed by the following simple algorithm.",
        "In the first stage, all letters from the set {a, e, i, o, u} are marked as vowels, while the remaining letters are marked as consonants.",
        "Next, we examine all the instances of the letter y.",
        "If a y is both preceded and followed by a consonant, we mark that instance as a vowel rather than a consonant.",
        "In the second stage, the first group of consecutive vowels in each syllable is tagged as nucleus.",
        "All letters preceding the nucleus are then tagged as onset, while all letters following the nucleus are tagged as coda.",
        "Our development set experiments suggested that numbering ONC tags increases their performance.",
        "Under the Numbered ONC tag scheme, the single-syllable word stealth is labeled (O1 O2 N1 N2 C1 C2C3).",
        "A disadvantage of Numbered ONC tags is that, unlike positional tags, they do not represent syllable breaks explicitly.",
        "Within the ONC framework, we need the conjunction of two tags (such as an N1 tag followed by an O1 tag) to represent the division between syllables.",
        "This drawback can be overcome by combining ONC tags and NB tags in a hybrid Break ONC tag scheme.",
        "Using Break ONC tags, the word levity is annotated as (ONCBNB ON).",
        "The ( NB) tag indicates a letter is both part of the nucleus and before a syllable break, while the (N) tag represents a letter that is part of a nucleus but in the middle of a syllable.",
        "In this way, we get the best of both worlds: tags that encapsulate information about syllable structure, while also representing syllable breaks explicitly with a single tag.",
        "SVM-HMM predicts a tag for each letter in a word, so emission features use aspects of the input to help predict the correct tag for a specific letter.",
        "Consider the tag for the letter o in the word immorally.",
        "With a traditional HMM, we consider only that it is an o being emitted, and assess potential tags based on that single letter.",
        "The SVM framework is less restrictive: we can include o as an emission feature, but we can also include features indicating that the preceding and following letters are m and r respectively.",
        "In fact, there is no reason to confine ourselves to only one character on either side of the focus letter.",
        "After experimenting with the development set, we decided to include in our feature set a window of eleven characters around the focus character, five on either side.",
        "Figure 1 shows that performance gains level off at this point.",
        "Special beginning-and end-of-word characters are appended to words so that every letter has five characters before and after.",
        "We also experimented with asymmetric context windows, representing more characters after the focus letter than before, but we found that symmetric context windows perform better.",
        "Because our learner is effectively a linear classifier, we need to explicitly represent any important conjunctions of features.",
        "For example, the bigram bl frequently occurs within a single English syllable, while the bigram lb generally straddles two syllables.",
        "Similarly, a fourgram like tion very often",
        "Figure 1: Word accuracy as a function of the window size around the focus character, using unigram features on the development set.",
        "forms a syllable in and of itself.",
        "Thus, in addition to the single-letter features outlined above, we also include in our representation any bigrams, trigrams, four-grams, and five-grams that fit inside our context window.",
        "As is apparent from Figure 2, we see a substantial improvement by adding bigrams to our feature set.",
        "Higher-order n-grams produce increasingly smaller gains.",
        "In addition to these primary n-gram features, we experimented with linguistically-derived features.",
        "Intuitively, basic linguistic knowledge, such as whether a letter is a consonant or a vowel, should be helpful in determining syllabification.",
        "However, our experiments suggested that including features like these has no significant effect on performance.",

        "There are numerous instances where the two datasets differ in a perfectly reasonable manner (e.g. forging in NETtalk vs. forging in CELEX).",
        "However, we argue that NETtalk is a vastly inferior dataset.",
        "On a sample of 50 words, NETtalk agrees with Merriam-Webster's syllabifications in only 54% of instances, while CELEX agrees in 94% of cases.",
        "Moreover, NETtalk is riddled with truly bizarre syllabifications, such as be-aver, dishcloth and something.",
        "These syllabifications make generalization very hard, and are likely to complicate the L2P task we ultimately want to accomplish.",

        "This is an important result because it demonstrates that it is not sufficient to simply model a syllable's boundaries; we must also model a syllable's length or structure to achieve the best results.",
        "Given the similarity in word accuracy scores, it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the remaining three tags sets, but it does appear that there is an advantage to modeling syllable structure, as both ONC tag sets score better than the best NB set.",

        "Overall, our best tag set lowers the error rate by one-third, relative to SbA's performance.",

        "Note that none of these scores are directly comparable, because we did not use the same train-test splits as our competitors, just similar amounts of training and test data.",
        "Furthermore, when assembling random train-test splits, it is quite possible that words sharing the same lemma will appear in both the training and test sets.",

        "As we stated from the outset, one of our primary motivations for exploring orthographic syllabiication is the improvements it can produce in L2P systems.",
        "To explore this, we tested our model in conjunction with a recent L2P system that has been shown to predict phonemes with state-of-the-art word accuracy (Jiampojamarn et al., 2007).",
        "Using a model derived from training data, this L2P system irst divides a word into letter chunks, each containing one or two letters.",
        "A local classiier then predicts a number of likely phonemes for each chunk, with coni-dence values.",

        "Table 3: Word accuracy percentage on the letter-to-phoneme task with and without the syllabification information.",
        "To measure the improvement syllabiication can effect on the L2P task, the L2P system was trained with syllabiied, rather than unsyllabiied words.",
        "Otherwise, the execution of the L2P system remains unchanged.",
        "Data for this experiment is again drawn from the CELEX dictionary.",
        "In Table 3, we report the average word accuracy achieved by the L2P system using 10-fold cross-validation.",
        "We report L2P performance without any syllabiication information, with perfect dictionary syllabiication, and with our small learned models of syllabiication.",
        "L2P performance with dictionary syllabiication represents an approximate upper bound on the contributions of our system.",
