        "Discriminative reranking has become a popular technique for many NLP problems, in particular, parsing (Collins, 2000) and machine translation (Shen et al., 2005).",
        "Typically, this method first generates a list of top-n candidates from a baseline system, and then reranks this n-best list with arbitrary features that are not computable or intractable to compute within the baseline system.",
        "But despite its apparent success, there remains a major drawback: this method suffers from the limited scope of the n-best list, which rules out many potentially good alternatives.",
        "For example 41% of the correct parses were not in the candidates of ~30-best parses in (Collins, 2000).",
        "This situation becomes worse with longer sentences because the number of possible interpretations usually grows exponentially with the",

        "I am also grateful to Dan Gildea and Mark Johnson for inspirations, Eugene Charniak for help with his parser, and Wenbin Jiang for guidance on perceptron averaging.",

        "parsing exact N/A this work: forest-reranking exact on-the-fly sentence length.",
        "As a result, we often see very few variations among the n-best trees, for example, 50-best trees typically just represent a combination of5 to 6 binary ambiguities (since 2 < 50 < 2).",
        "Alternatively, discriminative parsing is tractable with exact and efficient search based on dynamic programming (DP) if all features are restricted to be local, that is, only looking at a local window within the factored search space (Taskar et al., 2004; McDonald et al., 2005).",
        "However, we miss the benefits of non-local features that are not representable here.",
        "Ideally, we would wish to combine the merits of both approaches, where an efficient inference algorithm could integrate both local and non-local features.",
        "Unfortunately, exact search is intractable (at least in theory) for features with unbounded scope.",
        "So we propose forest reranking, a technique inspired by forest rescoring (Huang and Chiang, 2007) that approximately reranks the packed forest of exponentially many parses.",
        "The key idea is to compute non-local features incrementally from bottom up, so that we can rerank the n-best subtrees at all internal nodes, instead of only at the root node as in conventional reranking (see Table 1).",
        "This method can thus be viewed as a step towards the integration of discriminative reranking with traditional chart parsing.",
        "Although previous work on discriminative parsing has mainly focused on short sentences (< 15 words) (Taskar et al., 2004; Turian and Melamed, 2007), our work scales to the whole Treebank, where we achieved an F-score of 91.7, which is a 19% error reduction from the 1-best baseline, and outperforms both 50-best and 100-best reranking.",
        "This result is also better than any previously reported systems trained on the Treebank."

        "Informally, a packed parse forest, or forest in short, is a compact representation of all the derivations (i.e., parse trees) for a given sentence under a context-free grammar (Billot and Lang, 1989).",
        "For example, consider the following sentence 0 I 1 saw 2 him 3 with 4 a 5 mirror 6 where the numbers between words denote string positions.",

        "These two derivations can be represented as a single forest by sharing common sub-derivations.",
        "Such a forest has a structure of a hypergraph (Klein and Manning, 2001; Huang and Chiang, 2005), where items like PP3;6 are called nodes, and deductive steps like (*) correspond to hyperedges.",
        "More formally, a forest is a pair (V, E), where V is the set of nodes, and E the set of hyperedges.",
        "For a given sentence wi:i = w1.. .",

        "Each hy-peredge e G E is a pair (tails(e), head(e)), where head(e) G V is the consequent node in the deductive step, and tails(e) G V* is the list of antecedent nodes.",
        "For example, the hyperedge for deduction (*) is notated:",
        "We also denote IN (v) to be the set of incoming hyperedges of node v, which represent the different ways of deriving v. For example, in the forest in Figure 1, IN(VPi;6) is {ei,e2}, with e2 = ((VBDi,2, NP2,6), VPi,6).",
        "We call |e| the arity of hyperedge e, which counts the number of tail nodes in e. The arity of a hypergraph is the maximum ar-ity over all hyperedges.",
        "A CKY forest has an arity of 2, since the input grammar is required to be binary branching (cf. Chomsky Normal Form) to ensure cubic time parsing complexity.",
        "However, in this work, we use forests from a Treebank parser (Char-niak, 2000) whose grammar is often flat in many productions.",
        "For example, the arity of the forest in Figure 1 is 3.",

        "Shown in Pseudocode 1, the perceptron algorithm makes several passes over the whole training data, and in each iteration, for each sentence Si, it tries to predict a best parse yi among the candidates cand(si) using the current weight setting.",
        "Intuitively, we want the gold parse yi* to be picked, but in general it is not guaranteed to be within cand (si), because the grammar may fail to cover the gold parse, and because the gold parse may be pruned away due to the limited scope of cand(si).",
        "So we define an oracle parse y+ to be the candidate that has the highest Parseval F-score with respect to the gold tree y *:",
        "ydcand (si)",

        "We will present a dynamic programming algorithm for this problem in Sec. 4.1.",
        "We also use a refinement called \"averaged parameters\" where the final weight vector is the average of weight vectors after each sentence in each iteration over the training data.",
        "This averaging effect has been shown to reduce overfitting and produce much more stable results (Collins, 2002).",
        "A key difference between n-best and forest reranking is the handling of features.",
        "In n-best reranking, all features are treated equivalently by the decoder, which simply computes the value of each one on each candidate parse.",
        "However, for forest reranking, since the trees are not explicitly enumerated, many features can not be directly computed.",
        "So we first classify features into local and non-local, which the decoder will process in very different fashions.",
        "We define a feature / to be local if and only if it can be factored among the local productions in a tree, and non-local if otherwise.",
        "For example, the Rule feature in Fig. 2(a) is local, while the Paren-tRule feature in Fig. 2(b) is non-local.",
        "It is worth noting that some features which seem complicated at the first sight are indeed local.",
        "For example, the WordEdges feature in Fig. 2(c), which classifies a node by its label, span length, and surrounding words, is still local since all these information are encoded either in the node itself or in the input sentence.",
        "In contrast, it would become non-local if we replace the surrounding words by surrounding POS (a) Rule (local) (b) ParentRule (non-local) (c) WordEdges (local) (d) NGramTree (non-local)",

        "For the former, we extend their domains from parses to hy-peredges, where f (e) returns the value of a local feature f G fL on hyperedge e, and its value on a parsey factors across the hyperedges (local productions), and we can pre-compute fL(e) for each e in a forest.",
        "Non-local features, however, can not be pre-computed, but we still prefer to compute them as early as possible, which we call \"on-the-fly\" computation, so that our decoder can be sensitive to them at internal nodes.",
        "For instance, the NGramTree feature in Fig. 2 (d) returns the minimum tree fragement spanning a bigram, in this case \"saw\" and \"the\", and should thus be computed at the smallest common ancestor of the two, which is the VP node in this example.",
        "Similarly, the ParentRule feature in Fig. 2 (b) can be computed when the S subtree is formed.",
        "In doing so, we essentially factor non-local features across subtrees, where for each subtree y' in a parse y, we define a unit feature f(y') to be the part of",
        "( y) that are computable within y', but not computable in any (proper) subtree of y'.",
        "Then we have:",
        "Intuitively, we compute the unit non-local features at each subtree from bottom-up.",
        "For example, for the binary-branching node Ai k in Fig. 3, the unit NGramTree instance is for the pair (wj_1, Wj) on the boundary between the two subtrees, whose smallest common ancestor is the current node.",
        "Other unit NGramTree instances within this span have already been computed in the subtrees, except those for the boundary words of the whole node, Wi and Wk-1, which will be computed when this node is further combined with other nodes in the future.",

        "We will use D(v) to denote the top derivations of node v, where is its 1-best derivation.",
        "We also use the notation (e, j) to denote the derivation along hyperedge e, using the jith sub-derivation for tail ui, so (e, 1) is the best derivation along e. The exact decoding algorithm, shown in Pseudocode 2, is an instance of the bottom-up Viterbi algorithm, which traverses the hypergraph in a topological order, and at each node v, calculates its 1-best derivation using each incoming hyperedge e G IN(v).",

        "For non-local features, we adapt cube pruning from forest rescoring (Chiang, 2007; Huang and Chiang, 2007), since the situation here is analogous to machine translation decoding with integrated language models: we can view the scores of unit nonlocal features as the language model cost, computed on-the-fly when combining sub-constituents.",
        "Shown in Pseudocode 3, cube pruning works bottom-up on the forest, keeping a beam of at most k derivations at each node, and uses the k-best parsing Algorithm 2 of Huang and Chiang (2005) to speed up the computation.",
        "When combining the subderivations along a hyperedge e to form a new subtree y' = ( e, j) , we also compute its unit non-local feature values fN((e, j)) (line 25).",
        "A priority queue (heap in Pseudocode 3) is used to hold the candidates for the next-best derivation, which is initialized to the set of best derivations along each hyper-edge (lines 7 to 9).",
        "Then at each iteration, we pop the best derivation (lines 12), and push its successors back into the priority queue (line 14).",
        "Analogous to the language model cost in forest rescoring, the unit feature cost here is a non-monotonic score in the dynamic programming backbone, and the derivations may thus be extracted out-of-order.",

The complexity of this algorithm is O(E + Vk log kN) (Huang and Chiang, 2005), where O(N) is the time for on-the-fly feature extraction for each subtree, which becomes the bottleneck in practice."

        "This improvement might look relatively small, but it is much harder to make a similar progress with n-best reranking.",
        "For example, even if we double the size of the n-best list to 100, the performance best oracle is only 0.5% higher than the 50-best one (see Fig. 4).",
        "In addition, the feature extraction step in 100-best reranking produces huge data files and takes 44 hours in total, though this part can be paral-lelized.",
        "On two CPUs, 100-best reranking takes 25 hours, while our forest-reranker can also finish in 26 hours, with a much smaller disk space.",
        "Indeed, this demonstrates the severe redundancies as another disadvantage of n-best lists, where many subtrees are repeated across different parses, while the packed forest reduces space dramatically by sharing common sub-derivations (see Fig. 4).",

        "Moreover, their technique is orthogonal to ours, and we suspect that replacing their n-best reranker by our forest reranker might get an even better performance.",
        "Plus, except for n-best rerank-ing, most discriminative methods require repeated parsing of the training set, which is generally im-pratical (Petrov and Klein, 200S).",
        "Therefore, previous work often resorts to extremely short sentences (< 15 words) or only looked at local features (Taskar et al., 2004; Henderson, 2004; Turian and Melamed, 200V).",
        "In comparison, thanks to the efficient decoding, our work not only scaled to the whole Treebank, but also successfully incorporated non-local features, which showed an absolute im-provementof 0.44% over that of local features alone."

        "We have presented a framework for reranking on packed forests which compactly encodes many more candidates than n-best lists.",

        "Our final result outperforms both 50-best and 100-best reranking baselines, and is better than any previously reported systems trained on the Treebank.",
        "We also devised a dynamic programming algorithm for forest oracles, an interesting problem by itself.",
