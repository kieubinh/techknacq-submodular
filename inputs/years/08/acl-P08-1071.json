        "User simulation has been widely used in different phases in spoken dialog system development.",
        "In the system development phase, user simulation is used in training different system components.",
        "For example, (Levin et al., 2000) and (Scheffler, 2002) exploit user simulations to generate large corpora for using Reinforcement Learning to develop dialog strategies, while (Chung, 2004) implement user simulation to train the speech recognizer and understanding components.",
        "While user simulation is considered to be more low-cost and time-efficient than experiments with human subjects, one major concern is how well the state-of-the-art user simulations can mimic human user behaviors and how well they can substitute for human users in a variety of tasks.",
        "(Schatzmann et al., 2005) propose a set of evaluation measures to assess the quality of simulated corpora.",
        "They find that these evaluation measures are sufficient to discern simulated from real dialogs.",
        "Since this multiple-measure approach does not offer a easily reportable statistic indicating the quality of a user simulation, (Williams, 2007) proposes a single measure for evaluating and rank-ordering user simulations based on the divergence between the simulated and real users' performance.",
        "This new approach also offers a lookup table that helps to judge whether an observed ordering of two user simulations is statistically significant.",
        "In this study, we also strive to develop a prediction model of the rankings of the simulated users' performance.",
        "However, our approach use human judgments as the gold standard.",
        "Although to date there are few studies that use human judges to directly assess the quality of user simulation, we believe that this is a reliable approach to assess the simulated corpora as well as an important step towards developing a comprehensive set of user simulation evaluation measures.",
        "First, we can estimate the difficulty of the task of distinguishing real and simulated corpora by knowing how hard it is for human judges to reach an agreement.",
        "Second, human judgments can be used as the gold standard of the automatic evaluation measures.",
        "Third, we can validate the automatic measures by correlating the conclusions drawn from the automatic measures with the human judgments.",
        "In this study, we recruit human judges to assess the quality of three user simulation models.",
        "Judges are asked to read the transcripts of the dialogs between a computer tutoring system and the simulation models and to rate the dialogs on a 5-point scale from different perspectives.",
        "Judges are also given the transcripts between human users and the computer tutor.",
        "We first assess human judges' abilities in distinguishing real from simulated users.",
        "We find that it is hard for human judges to reach good agreement on the ratings.",
        "However, these ratings give consistent ranking on the quality of the real and the simulated user models.",
        "Similarly, when we use previously proposed automatic measures to predict human judgments, we cannot reliably predict human ratings using a regression model, but we can consistently mimic human judges' rankings using a ranking model.",
        "We suggest that this ranking model can be used to quickly assess the quality of a new simulation model without manual efforts by ranking the new model against the old models."

        "For example, (Walker et al., 2001) train a ranking model that ranks the outputs of different language generation strategies based on human judges' rankings.",

        "In this section, we use a subset of the automatic measures proposed in (Schatzmann et al., 2005) that are applicable to our data to predict human judgments.",
        "Here, the human judgment on each dialog is calculated as the average of the two judges' ratings.",
        "We focus on predicting human judgments on the dialog level because these ratings represent the overall performance of the student models.",
        "We use six high-level dialog feature measures including the number of student turns (Sturn), the number of tutor turns (Tturn), the number of words per student turn (Swordrate), the number of words per tutor turn (Twordrate), the ratio of system/user words per dialog (WordRatio), and the percentage of correct answers (cRate).",
        "We use stepwise multiple linear regression to model the human judgments using the set of automatic features we listed above.",
        "The stepwise procedure automatically selects measures to be included in the model.",
        "For example, d_TUR is predicted as 3.65 – 0.08 * WordRatio – 3.21 * Swordrate, with an R-square of 0.12.",
        "The prediction models for d_QLT and d_PAT have similar low R-square values of 0.08 and 0.17, respectively.",
        "This result is not surprising because we only include the surface level automatic measures here.",
        "Also, these measures are designed for comparison between models instead of prediction.",
        "Thus, in Section 6.2, we build a ranking model to utilize the measures in their comparative manner.",
        "We train three ranking models to mimic human judges' rankings of the real and the simulated student models on the three dialog level questions using RankBoost, a boosting algorithm for ranking ((Freund et al., 2003), (Mairesse et al., 2007)).",
        "We briefly explain the algorithm using the same terminologies and equations as in (Mairesse et al., 2007), by building the ranking model for d_TUR as an example.",
        "In the training phase, the algorithm takes as input a group of dialogs that are represented by values of the automatic measures and the human judges' ratings on d_TUR.",
        "The RankBoost algorithm treats the group of dialogs as ordered pairs:",
        "x has a higher human rated score than y }",
        "Each dialog x is represented by a set of m indicator functions hs(x) (1 < s < m).",
        "For example:",
        "Here, the threshold of 0.47 is calculated by Rank-Boost.",
        "a is a parameter associated with each indicator function.",

        "The eval function returns 0 if (x, y) pair is ranked correctly, and 1 otherwise.",
        "In other words, LOSS score is the percentage of misordered pairs where the order of the predicted scores disagree with the order indicated by human judges.",
        "In the testing phase, the ranking score for every dialog is calculated by Equation 1.",
        "A baseline model which ranks dialog pairs randomly produces a LOSS of 0.5 (lower is better).",
        "While LOSS indicates how many pairs of dialogs are ranked correctly, our main focus here is to rank the performance of the four student models instead of individual dialogs.",
        "Therefore, we propose another Averaged Model Ranking (AMR) score.",
        "AMR is computed as the sum of the ratings of all the dialogs generated by one model averaged by the number of the dialogs.",
        "The four student models are then ranked based on their AMR scores.",
        "The chance to get the right ranking order of the four student models by random guess is 1/(41).",
        "Table 6 shows a made-up example to illustrate the two measures.",
        "reaU and real-2 are two dialogs generated by the real student model; ran J and ran 2 are two dialogs by the random model.",
        "The second and third column shows the human-rated score as the gold standard and the machine-predicted score in the testing phase respectively.",
        "The LOSS in this example is 1/6, because only the pair of real-2 and ran J is misordered out of all the 6 possible pair combinations.",
        "We then compute the AMR of the two models.",
        "According to human-rated scores, the real model is scored 0.75 (=(0.9+0.6)/2) while the random model is scored 0.3.",
        "When looking at the predicted scores, the real model is scored 0.65, which is also higher than the random model with a score of 0.4.",
        "We thus conclude that the ranking model ranks the two student models correctly according to the overall rating measure.",
        "We use both LOSS and AMR to evaluate the ranking models.",
        "First, we use regular 4-fold cross validation where we randomly hold out 25% of the data for testing and train on the remaining 75% of the data for 4 rounds.",
        "Both the training and the testing data consist of dialogs equally distributed among the four student models.",
        "However, since the practical usage of the ranking model is to rank a new model against several old models without collecting additional human ratings, we further test the algorithm by repeating the 4 rounds of testing while taking turns to hold out the dialogs from one model in the training data, assuming that model is the new model that we do not have human ratings to train on.",
        "The testing corpus still consists of dialogs from all four models.",
        "We call this approach the minus-one-model cross validation.",
        "Table 7 shows the LOSS scores for both cross validations.",
        "Using 2-tailed t-tests, we observe that the ranking models significantly outperforms the random baseline in all cases after Bonferroni correction (p < 0.05).",
        "When comparing the two cross validation results for the same question, we see more LOSS in the more difficult minus-one-model case.",
        "However, the LOSS scores do not offer a direct conclusion on whether the ranking model ranks the four student models correctly or not.",
        "To address this question, we use AMR scores to re-evaluate all cross validation results.",
        "Table 8 shows the human-rated and predicted AMR scores averaged over four rounds of testing on the regular cross validation results.",
        "We see that the ranking model gives the same rankings of the student models as the human judges on all questions.",
        "When applying AMR on the minus-one-model cross validation results, we see similar results that the ranking model reproduces human judges' rankings.",
        "Therefore, we suggest that the ranking model can be used to evaluate a new simulation model by ranking it against several old models.",
