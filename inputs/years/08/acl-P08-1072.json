        "Development of spoken dialog systems involves human language technologies which must cooperate to answer user queries.",
        "Since the performance in human language technologies such as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Natural Language Understanding (NLU) have been improved, this advance has made it possible to develop spoken dialog systems for many different application domains.",
        "Nevertheless, there are major problems for practical spoken dialog systems.",
        "One of them which must be considered by the Dialog Manager (DM) is the error propagation from ASR and NLU modules.",
        "In general, errors in spoken dialog systems are prevalent due to errors in speech recognition or language understanding.",
        "These errors can cause the dialog system to misunderstand a user and in turn lead to an inappropriate response.",
        "To avoid these errors, a basic solution is to improve the accuracy and robustness of the recognition and understanding processes.",
        "However, it has been impossible to develop perfect ASR and NLU modules because of noisy environments and unexpected input.",
        "Therefore, the development of robust dialog management has also been one of the most important goals in research on practical spoken dialog systems.",
        "In the dialog manager, a popular method to deal with these errors is to adopt dialog mechanisms for detecting and repairing potential errors at the conversational level (McTear et al., 2005; Torres et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2007).",
        "In human-computer communication, the goal of error recovery strategy is to maximize the user's satisfaction of using the system by guiding for the repair of the wrong information by human-computer interaction.",
        "On the other hand, there are different approaches to improve the robustness of dialog management using n-best hypotheses.",
        "Rather than Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), partially observable MDPs (POMDPs) potentially provide a much more powerful framework for robust dialog modeling since they consider n-best hypotheses to estimate the distribution of the belief state (Williams and Young, 2007).",
        "In recent, we proposed another data-driven approach for the dialog modeling called Example-based Dialog Modeling (EBDM) (Lee et al., 2006a).",
        "However, difficulties occur when attempting to deploy EBDM in practical spoken dialog systems in which ASR and NLU errors are frequent.",
        "Thus, this paper proposes a new method to improve the robustness of the EBDM framework using an agenda-based approach and n-best recognition hypotheses.",
        "We consider a domain-specific agenda to estimate the best dialog state and example because, in task-oriented systems, a current dialog state is highly correlated to the previous dialog state.",
        "We have also used the example-based error recovery approach to handle exceptional cases due to noisy input or unexpected focus shift.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",

        "An agenda-based approach for heuristics is presented in Section 4.",
        "Following that, we explain greedy selection with n-best hypotheses in Section 5.",
        "Section 6 describes the error recovery strategy to handle unexpected cases.",
        "Then, Section 7 provides the experimental results of a real user evaluation to verify our approach.",

        "In this paper, we are interested in exploring algorithms that would integrate this knowledge source for users to achieve domain-specific goals.",
        "We used an agenda graph whose hierarchy reflects the natural order of dialog control.",

        "Our approach is implemented based on Example-Based Dialog Modeling (EBDM) which is one of generic dialog modelings.",
        "We begin with a brief overview of the EBDM framework in this section.",
        "EBDM was inspired by Example-Based Machine Translation (EBMT) (Nagao, 1984), a translation system in which the source sentence can be translated using similar example fragments within a large parallel corpus, without knowledge of the language's structure.",
        "The idea of EBMT can be extended to determine the next system actions by finding similar dialog examples within the dialog corpus.",
        "The system action can be predicted by finding semantically similar user utterances with the dialog state.",
        "The dialog state is defined as the set of relevant internal variables that affect the next system action.",
        "EBDM needs to automatically construct an example database from the dialog corpus.",
        "Dialog Example DataBase (DEDB) is semantically indexed to generalize the data in which the indexing keys can be determined according to state variables chosen by a system designer for domain-specific applications (Figure 1).",
        "Each turn pair (user turn, system turn) in the dialog corpus is mapped to semantic instances in the DEDB.",
        "The index constraints represent the state variables which are domain-independent attributes.",
        "To determine the next system action, there are three processes in the EBDM framework as follows:",
        "• Query Generation: The dialog manager makes Structured Query Language (SQL)",
        "DialogCorpus",
        "DialogExample Database (DEDB)",

        "• Example Search: The dialog manager searches for semantically similar dialog examples in the DEDB given the current dialog state.",
        "If no example is retrieved, some state variables can be ignored by relaxing particular variables according to the level of importance given the dialog's genre and domain.",
        "• Example Selection: The dialog manager selects the best example to maximize the utterance similarity measure based on lexico-semantic similarity and discourse history similarity.",

        "The EBDM framework is a simple and powerful approach to rapidly develop natural language interfaces for multi-domain dialog processing (Lee et al., 2006b).",
        "However, in the context of spoken dialog system for domain-specific tasks, this framework must solve two problems: (1) Keeping track of the dialog state with a view to ensuring steady progress towards task completion, (2) Supporting n-best recognition hypotheses to improve the robustness of dialog manager.",

        "In other words, v corresponds to user goal state to achieve domain-specific subtask in its expected agenda.",
        "Each node includes three different components: (1) A precondition that must be true before the subtask is executed; (2) A description of the node that includes its label and identifier; and (3) Links to nodes that will be executed at the subsequent turn.",
        "For every edge ej = (vi, Vj), we defined a transition probability based on prior knowledge of dialog flows.",
        "This probability can be assigned based on empirical analysis of human-computer conversations, assuming that the users behave in consistent, goal-directed ways.",
        "Alternatively, it can be assigned manually at the discretion of the system developer to control the dialog flow.",
        "This heuristic has advantages for practical spoken dialog system because a key condition for successful task-oriented dialog system is that the user and system know which task or subtask is currently being executed.",
        "To exemplify, Figure 3 illustrates part of the agenda graph for PHOPE, a building guidance robot using the spoken dialog system.",
        "In Figure 3, G is represented by a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), where each link in the graph reflects a transition between one user goal state and the next.",
        "The set of paths in G represent an agenda designed by the system developer.",
        "We adapted DAG representation because it is more intuitive and flexible than hierarchical tree representation.",
        "The syntax for graph representation in our system is described by an XML schema (Figure 4).",
        "In the agenda graph G, each node v should hold relevant dialog examples corresponding to user goal states.",
        "Therefore, the dialog examples in DEDB are mapped to a user goal state when a precondition of the node is true.",
        "Initially, the root node of the DAG is the starting state, where there is no dialog example.",
        "Then, the attributes of each dialog example are examined via the preconditions of each user goal node by breadth-first traversal.",
        "If the precondition is true, the node holds relevant that may appear in the user's goal state.",
        "The method of selecting the best of these examples will be described in 5.",
        "Inspired by Collagen (Rich and Sidner, 1998; Lesh et al., 2001), we investigated a discourse interpretation algorithm to consider how the current user's goal can contribute to the current agenda in a focus stack according to Lochbaum's discourse interpretation algorithm (Lochbaum, 1998).",
        "The focus stack takes into account the discourse structure by keeping track of discourse states.",

        "The top on the focus stack is the previous node in this set.",
        "The focus stack is updated after every utterance.",
        "To interpret the type of the discourse state, this breaks down into five main cases of possible current node for an observed user's",

        "• CURRENTTASK: Repeating or modifying the observed goal on the current subtask (Current node).",
        "• PARENTTASK: Modifying the observation on the previous subtask (Parent node).",
        "Nodes in parentheses denote the topological position of the current node relative to the top node on the focus stack.",
        "If NEXT-TASK is selected, the current node is pushed to the focus stack.",
        "NEXT TASK covers totally focused behavior, i.e., when there are no unexpected focus shifts.",
        "This occurs when the current user utterance is highly correlated to the previous system utterance.",
        "The remaining four cases cover various types of discourse state.",
        "For example, NEWSUBTASK involves starting a new subtask to partially shift focus, thereby popping the previous goal off the focus stack and pushing a new user goal for the new subtask.",
        "NEW TASK, which is placed on the node linked to root node, involves starting a new task to complete a new agenda.",
        "Therefore, a dialog is restarted and the current node is pushed onto the focus stack with the current user goal as its first element.",
        "If none of the above cases holds, the discourse interpretation concludes that the current input should be rejected because we expect user utterances to be correlated to the previous turn in a task-oriented domain.",
        "Therefore, this interpretation does not contribute to the current agenda on the focus stack due to ASR and NLU errors that are due to noisy environments and unexpected input.",
        "These cases can be handled by using an error recovery strategy in Section 6.",
        "Figure 5 shows some examples of pseudo-codes used in the discourse interpretation algorithm to select the best node among possible next nodes.",
