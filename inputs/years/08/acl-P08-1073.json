        "Designing a spoken dialogue system is a time-consuming and challenging task.",
        "A developer may spend a lot of time and effort anticipating the potential needs of a specific application environment and then deciding on the most appropriate system action (e.g. confirm, present items,...).",
        "One of the key advantages of statistical optimisation methods, such as Reinforcement Learning (RL), for dialogue strategy design is that the problem can be formulated as a principled mathematical model which can be automatically trained on real data (Lemon and Pietquin, 2007; Frampton and Lemon, to appear).",
        "In cases where a system is designed from scratch, however, there is often no suitable in-domain data.",
        "Collecting dialogue data without a working prototype is problematic, leaving the developer with a classic chicken-and-egg problem.",
        "We propose to learn dialogue strategies by simulation-based RL (Sutton and Barto, 1998), where the simulated environment is learned from small amounts of Wizard-of-Oz (WOZ) data.",
        "Using WOZ data rather than data from real HumanComputer Interaction (HCI) allows us to learn optimal strategies for domains where no working dialogue system already exists.",
        "To date, automatic strategy learning has been applied to dialogue systems which have already been deployed using handcrafted strategies.",
        "In such work, strategy learning was performed based on already present extensive online operation experience, e.g. (Singh et al., 2002; Henderson et al., 2005).",
        "In contrast to this preceding work, our approach enables strategy learning in domains where no prior system is available.",
        "Optimised learned strategies are then available from the first moment of online-operation, and tedious handcrafting of dialogue strategies is omitted.",
        "This independence from large amounts of in-domain dialogue data allows researchers to apply RL to new application areas beyond the scope of existing dialogue systems.",
        "We call this method 'bootstrapping'.",
        "In a WOZ experiment, a hidden human operator, the so called \"wizard\", simulates (partly or completely) the behaviour of the application, while subjects are left in the belief that they are interacting with a real system (Fraser and Gilbert, 1991).",
        "That is, WOZ experiments only simulate HCI.",
        "We therefore need to show that a strategy bootstrapped from WOZ data indeed transfers to real HCI.",
        "Furthermore, we also need to introduce methods to learn useful user simulations (for training RL) from such limited data.",
        "The use of WOZ data has earlier been proposed in the context of RL.",
        "(Williams and Young, 2GG4) utilise WOZ data to discover the state and action space for MDP design.",
        "(Prommer et al., 2GG6) use WOZ data to build a simulated user and noise model for simulation-based RL.",
        "While both studies show promising first results, their simulated environment still contains many hand-crafted aspects, which makes it hard to evaluate whether the success of the learned strategy indeed originates from the WOZ data.",
        "(Schatzmann et al., 2GG7) propose to 'bootstrap' with a simulated user which is entirely hand-crafted.",
        "In the following we propose an entirely data-driven approach, where all components of the simulated learning environment are learned from WOZ data.",
        "We also show that the resulting policy performs well for real users."

        "Of the 793 wizard turns 22.3% were annotated as presentation strategies, resulting in 177 instances for learning, where the six wizards contributed about equal proportions.",

        "All other actions are left for optimisation.",
        "The structure of an information seeking dialogue system consists of an information acquisition phase, and an information presentation phase.",
        "For information acquisition the task of the dialogue manager is to gather 'enough' search constraints from the user, and then, 'at the right time', to start the information presentation phase, where the presentation task is to present 'the right amount' of information in the right way-either on the screen or listing the items verbally.",
        "What 'the right amount' actually means depends on the application, the dialogue context, and the preferences of users.",
        "For optimising dialogue strategies information acquisition and presentation are two closely interrelated problems and need to be optimised simultaneously: when to present information depends on the available options for how to present them, and vice versa.",
        "We therefore formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), relating states to actions in a hierarchical manner (see Figure 1): 4 actions are available for the information acquisition phase; once the action presentlnfo is chosen, the information presentation phase is entered, where 2 different actions for output realisation are available.",

        "We addressed two problems in the field of automatic optimization of dialogue strategies: learning effective dialogue strategies when no initial data or system exists, and evaluating the result with real users.",
        "We learned optimal strategies by interaction with a simulated environment which is bootstrapped from a small amount of Wizard-of-Oz data, and we evaluated the result with real users.",
        "The use of WOZ data allows us to develop optimal strategies for domains where no working prototype is available.",
        "The developed simulations are entirely data driven and the reward function reflects real user preferences.",
        "We compare the Reinforcement Learning-based strategy against a supervised strategy which mimics the (human) wizards' policies from the original data.",
        "This comparison allows us to measure relative improvement over the training data.",
        "Our results show that RL significantly outperforms SL in simulation as well as in interactions with real users.",
        "The RL-based policy gains on average 50-times more reward when tested in simulation, and almost 18-times more reward when interacting with real users.",
        "The human users also subjectively rate the RL-based policy on average 10% higher, and 49% higher for Task Ease.",
        "We also show that results obtained in simulation are comparable to results for real users.",
        "We conclude that a strategy trained from WOZ data via bootstrapping is transferable to real Human-Computer-Interaction.",
        "In future work will apply similar techniques to statistical planning for Natural Language Generation in spoken dialogue (Lemon, 2008; Janarthanam and Lemon, 2008), (see the EC FP7 CLASSic project: www.classic-project.org)."
