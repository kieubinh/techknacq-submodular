        "It provides a key feature that helps on more elaborated NLP tasks such as parsing and information extraction.",
        "Since the last decade, many high-performance chunking systems were proposed, such as, SVM-based (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001; Wu et al., 2006), Winnow (Zhang et al., 2002), voted-perceptrons (Carreras and Marquez, 2003), Transformation-Based Learning (TBL) (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1999; Megyesi, 2002) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) (Molina and Pla, 2002), Memory-based (Sang, 2002).",
        "State-of-the-art systems for English base noun phrase chunking and text chunking are based in statistical techniques (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001; Wu et al., 2006;",
        "Zhang et al., 2002).",
        "TBL is one of the most accurate rule-based techniques for phrase chunking tasks (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1999; Ngai and Florian, 2001; Megyesi, 2002).",
        "On the other hand, TBL rules must follow patterns, called templates, that are meant to capture the relevant feature combinations.",
        "The process of generating good templates is highly expensive.",
        "It strongly depends on the problem expert skills to build them.",
        "Even when a template set is available for a given task, it may not be effective when we change from a language to another (dos Santos and Oliveira, 2005).",
        "In this work, we apply Entropy Guided Transformation Learning (ETL) for phrase chunking.",
        "ETL is a new machine learning strategy that combines the advantages of Decision Trees (DT) and TBL (dos Santos and Milidiu, 2007a).",
        "The ETL key idea is to use decision tree induction to obtain feature combinations (templates) and then use the TBL algorithm to generate transformation rules.",
        "ETL produces transformation rules that are more effective than decision trees and also eliminates the need of a problem domain expert to build TBL templates.",
        "We evaluate the performance of ETL over four phrase chunking tasks: (1) English Base Noun Phrase (NP) chunking; (2) Portuguese NP chunking; (3) English Text Chunking; and (4) Hindi Text Chunking.",
        "Base NP chunking consists in recognizing non-overlapping text segments that contain NPs.",

        "The key idea of ETL is to use decision tree induction to obtain templates.",
        "Next, the TBL strategy is used to generate transformation rules.",
        "The proposed method is illustrated in the Fig. 1.",
        "Initial Classifier Learned Rules",
        "A combination of DT and TBL is presented in (Corston-Oliver and Gamon, 2003).",
        "The main difference between Corston-Oliver & Gamon work and the ETL strategy is that they extract candidate rules directly from the DT, and then use the TBL strategy to select the appropriate rules.",
        "Another difference is that they use a binary DT, whereas ETL uses a DT that is not necessarily binary.",
        "An evolutionary approach based on Genetic Algorithms (GA) to automatically generate TBL templates is presented in (Milidiu et al., 2007).",
        "Using a simple genetic coding, the generated template sets have efficacy near to the handcrafted templates for the tasks: English Base Noun Phrase Identification, Text Chunking and Portuguese Named Entities Recognition.",
        "The main drawback of this strategy is that the GA step is computationally expensive.",
        "If we need to consider a large context window or a large number of features, it can be infeasible.",
        "The remainder of this section is organized as follows.",
        "In section 2.1, we describe the DT learning algorithm.",
        "In section 2.2, the TBL algorithm is depicted.",
        "In section 2.3, we depict the process of obtaining templates from a decision tree decomposition.",
        "Finally, in section 2.4, we present a template evolution scheme that speeds up the TBL step.",
        "Decision tree learning is one of the most widely used machine learning algorithms.",
        "It performs a partitioning of the training set using principles of Information Theory.",
        "The learning algorithm executes a general to specific search of a feature space.",
        "The most informative feature is added to a tree structure at each step of the search.",
        "Information Gain Ratio, which is based on the data Entropy, is normally used as the informativeness measure.",
        "The objective is to construct a tree, using a minimal set of features, that efficiently partitions the training set into classes of observations.",
        "After the tree is grown, a pruning step is carried out in order to avoid overfitting.",
        "One of the most used algorithms for induction of a DT is the C4.5 (Quinlan, 1993).",
        "We use Quinlan's C4.5 system throughout this work.",
        "Transformation Based error-driven Learning (TBL) is a successful machine learning algorithm introduced by Eric Brill (Brill, 1995).",
        "It has since been used for several Natural Language Processing tasks, such as part-of-speech (POS) tagging (Brill, 1995), English text chunking (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1999; dos Santos and Milidiu, 2007b), spelling correction (Mangu and Brill, 1997), Portuguese appos-itive extraction (Freitas et al., 2006), Portuguese named entity extraction (Milidiu et al., 2006) and Portuguese noun-phrase chunking (dos Santos and Oliveira, 2005), achieving state-of-the-art performance in many of them.",
        "TBL uses an error correcting strategy.",
        "Its main scheme is to generate an ordered list of rules that correct classification mistakes in the training set, which have been produced by an initial classifier.",
        "The requirements of the algorithm are:",
        "• two instances of the training set, one that has been correctly labeled, and another that remains unlabeled;",
        "• an initial classifier, the baseline system, which classifies the unlabeled training set by trying to apply the correct class for each sample.",
        "In general, the baseline system is based on simple statistics of the labeled training set; and",
        "• a set of rule templates, which are meant to capture the relevant feature combinations that would determine the sample's classification.",
        "Concrete rules are acquired by instantiation of this predefined set of rule templates.",
        "• a threshold value, that is used as a stopping criteria for the algorithm and is needed to avoid overfitting to the training data.",
        "The learning method is a mistake-driven greedy procedure that iteratively acquires a set of transformation rules.",
        "The TBL algorithm can be depicted as follows:",
        "1.",
        "Starts applying the baseline system, in order to guess an initial classification for the unlabeled version of the training set;",
        "2.",
        "Compares the resulting classification with the correct one and, whenever a classification error is found, all the rules that can correct it are generated by instantiating the templates.",
        "This template instantiation is done by capturing some contextual data of the sample being corrected.",
        "Usually, a new rule will correct some errors, but will also generate some other errors by changing correctly classified samples;",

        "There are many ways to extract feature combinations from decision trees.",
        "In an path from the root to the leaves, more informative features appear first.",
        "Since we want to generate the most promising templates only, we just combine the more informative ones.",
        "The process we use to extract templates from a DT includes a depth-first traversal of the DT.",
        "For each visited node, we create a new template that combines its parent node template with the feature used to split the data at that node.",
        "This is a very simple decomposition scheme.",

        "In (Cur-ran and Wong, 2000), it is argued that we can better tune the training time vs. templates complexity trade-off by using an evolutionary template approach.",
        "The main idea is to apply only a small number of templates that evolve throughout the training.",
        "When training starts, templates are short, consisting of few feature combinations.",

        "The template evolution approach can be easily implemented by using template sets extracted from a DT.",
        "We implement this idea by successively training TBL models.",
        "Each model uses only the templates that contain feature combinations up to a given tree level.",
        "For instance, using the tree shown in Fig. 2, we have the following template sets for the three first training rounds:",
        "Using the template evolution strategy, the training time is decreased by a factor of five for the English text chunking task.",
        "This is a remarkable reduction, since we use an implementation of the fastTBL algorithm (Ngai and Florian, 2001) that is already a very fast TBL version.",
