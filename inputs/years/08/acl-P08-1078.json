        "Applied semantic inference is typically concerned with inferring a target meaning from a given text.",
        "For example, to answer \"Who wrote Idomeneo?",
        "\", Question Answering (QA) systems need to infer the target meaning 'Mozart wrote Idomeneo' from a given text \"Mozart composed Idomeneo\".",
        "Following common Textual Entailment terminology (Giampic-colo et al., 2007), we denote the target meaning by h (for hypothesis) and the given text by t.",
        "A typical applied inference operation is matching.",
        "Sometimes, h can be directly matched in t (in the example above, if the given sentence would be literally \"Mozart wrote Idomeneo\").",
        "Generally, the target meaning can be expressed in t in many different ways.",
        "Indirect matching is then needed, using inference knowledge that may be captured through rules, termed here entailment rules.",
        "In our example, 'Mozart wrote Idomeneo' can be inferred using the rule 'X compose Y – X write Y'.",
        "Recently, several algorithms were proposed for automatically learning entailment rules and paraphrases (viewed as bidirectional entailment rules) (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Shinyama et al., 2002; Szpektor et al., 2004; Sekine, 2005).",
        "A common practice is to try matching the structure of h, or of the left-hand-side of a rule r, within t. However, context should be considered to allow valid matching.",
        "For example, suppose that to find acquisitions of companies we specify the target template hypothesis (a hypothesis with variables) 'X acquire Y'.",
        "This h should not be matched in \"children acquire language quickly\", because in this context",
        "Y is not a company.",
        "Similarly, the rule 'X charge",
        "Y – X accuse Y' should not be applied to \"This store charged my account\", since the assumed sense of 'charge' in the rule is different than its sense in the text.",
        "Thus, the intended contexts for h and r and the context within the given t should be properly matched to verify valid inference.",
        "Context matching at inference time was often approached in an application-specific manner (Harabagiu et al., 2003; Patwardhan and Riloff, 2007).",
        "Recently, some generic methods were proposed to handle context-sensitive inference (Dagan et al., 2006; Pantel et al., 2007; Downey et al., 2007; Connor and Roth, 2007), but these usually treat only a single aspect of context matching (see Section 6).",
        "We propose a comprehensive framework for handling various contextual considerations, termed Contextual Preferences.",

        "As mentioned above, we follow the generic Textual Entailment (TE) setting, testing whether a target meaning hypothesis h can be inferred from a given text t. We allow h to be either a text or a template, a text fragment with variables.",
        "For example, \"The stock rose 8%\" entails an instantiation of the template hypothesis 'X gain Y'.",
        "Typically, h represents an information need requested in some application, such as a target predicate in IE.",
        "In this paper, we focus on parse-based lexical-syntactic representation of texts and hypotheses, and on the basic inference operation of matching.",
        "Following common practice (de Salvo Braz et al., 2005; Romano et al., 2006; Bar-Haim et al., 2007), h is syntactically matched in t if it can be embedded in t s parse tree.",
        "For template hypotheses, the matching induces a mapping between h s variables and their instantiation in t.",
        "Matching h in t can be performed either directly or indirectly using entailment rules.",
        "An entailment rule r: 'LHS – RHS' is a directional entailment relation between two templates.",
        "h is matched in t using r if LHS is matched in t and h matches RHS.",
        "In the example above, r: 'X rise Y – X gain Y' allows us to entail 'X gain Y', with \"stock\" and \"8%\" instantiating h's variables.",
        "We denote vars(z) the set of variables of z, where z is a template or a rule.",
        "When matching considers only the structure of hypotheses, texts and rules it may result in incorrect inference due to contextual mismatches.",
        "For example, an IE system may identify mentions of public demonstrations using the hypothesis h: ' X demonstrate .",
        "However, h should not be matched in \"Engineers demonstrated the new system\", due to a mismatch between the intended sense of 'demonstrate in h and its sense in t. Similarly, when looking for physical attack mentions using the hypothesis 'X attack Y , we should not utilize the rule r: 'X accuse Y – X attack Y', due to a mismatch between a verbal attack in r and an intended physical attack in h. Finally, r: ' X produce Y – X lay Y (applicable when X refers to poultry and Y to eggs) should not be matched in t: \"Bugatti produce the fastest cars\", due to a mismatch between the meanings of 'produce' in r and t. Overall, such incorrect inferences may be avoided by considering contextual information for t, h and r during their matching process.",
        "We propose the Contextual Preferences (CP) framework for addressing context at inference time.",
        "In this framework, the representation of an object z, where z may be a text, a template or an entailment rule, is enriched with contextual information denoted cp(z).",
        "This information helps constraining or disambiguating the meaning of z, and is used to validate proper matching between pairs of objects.",
        "We consider two components within cp(z): (a) a representation for the global (\"topical\") context in which z typically occurs, denoted cpg (z); (b) a representation for the preferences and constraints (\"hard\" preferences) on the possible terms that can instantiate variables within z, denoted cpv (z).",
        "For example, cpv('X produce Y – X lay Y') may specify that X s instantiations should be similar to \"chicken\" or \"duck\".",
        "Contextual Preferences are used when entailment is assessed between a text t and a hypothesis h, either directly or by utilizing an entailment-rule r. On top of structural matching, we now require that the Contextual Preferences of the participants in the inference will also match.",
        "When h is directly matched in t, we require that each component in cp(h) will be matched with its counterpart in cp(t).",
        "When r is utilized, we additionally require that cp(r) will be matched with both cp(t) and cp(h).",

        "Figure 1: The directional matching relationships between a hypothesis (h), an entailment rule (r) and a text (t) in the Contextual Preferences framework.",
        "components ofh, t and r.",
        "Like Textual Entailment inference, Contextual Preferences matching is directional.",
        "When matching h with t we require that the global context preferences specified by cpg (h) would subsume those induced by cpg (t), and that the instantiations of h's variables in t would adhere to the preferences in cpv (h) (since t should entail h, but not necessarily vice versa).",
        "For example, ifthe preferred global context of a hypothesis is sports, it would match a text that discusses the more specific topic of basketball.",
        "To implement the CP framework, concrete models are needed for each component, specifying its representation, how it is constructed, and an appropriate matching procedure.",
        "Section 3 describes the specific CP models that were implemented in this paper.",
        "The CP framework provides a generic view of contextual modeling in applied semantic inference.",
        "Mapping from a specific application to the generic framework follows the mappings assumed in the Textual Entailment paradigm.",
        "For example, in QA the hypothesis to be proved corresponds to the affirmative template derived from the question (e.g. h: 'X invented the PC' for \"Who invented the PC?\").",
        "Thus, cpg (h) can be constructed with respect to the question's focus while cpv (h) may be generated from the expected answer type (Moldovan et al., 2000; Harabagiu et al., 2003).",
