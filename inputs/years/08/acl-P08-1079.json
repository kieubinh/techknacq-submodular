        "Semantic resources can be very useful in many NLP tasks.",
        "Manual construction of such resources is labor intensive and susceptible to arbitrary human decisions.",
        "In addition, manually constructed semantic databases are not easily portable across text domains or languages.",
        "Hence, there is a need for developing semantic acquisition algorithms that are as unsupervised and language independent as possible.",
        "A fundamental type of semantic resource is that of concepts (represented by sets of lexical items) and their inter-relationships.",
        "While there is relatively good agreement as to what concepts are and which concepts should exist in a lexical resource, identifying types of important lexical relationships is a rather difficult task.",
        "Most established resources (e.g., WordNet) represent only the main and widely accepted relationships such as hyper-nymy and meronymy.",
        "However, there are many other useful relationships between concepts, such as noun-modifier and inter-verb relationships.",
        "Identifying and representing these explicitly can greatly assist various tasks and applications.",
        "There are already applications that utilize such knowledge (e.g., (Tatu and Moldovan, 2005) for textual entailment).",
        "One of the leading methods in semantics acquisition is based on patterns (see e.g., (Hearst, 1992; Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006)).",
        "The standard process for pattern-based relation extraction is to start with hand-selected patterns or word pairs expressing a particular relationship, and iteratively scan the corpus for co-appearances of word pairs in patterns and for patterns that contain known word pairs.",
        "This methodology is semi-supervised, requiring pre-specification of the desired relationship or hand-coding initial seed words or patterns.",
        "The method is quite successful, and examining its results in detail shows that concept relationships are often being manifested by several different patterns.",
        "In this paper, unlike the majority of studies that use patterns in order to find instances of given relationships, we use sets of patterns as the definitions of lexical relationships.",
        "We introduce pattern clusters, a novel framework in which each cluster corresponds to a relationship that can hold between the lexical items that fill its patterns' slots.",
        "We present a fully unsupervised algorithm to compute pattern clusters, not requiring any, even implicit, pre-specification of relationship types or word/pattern seeds.",
        "Our algorithm does not utilize preprocessing such as POS tagging and parsing.",
        "Some patterns may be present in several clusters, thus indirectly addressing pattern ambiguity.",
        "The algorithm is comprised of the following stages.",
        "First, we randomly select hook words and create a context corpus (hook corpus) for each hook word.",
        "Second, we define a meta-pattern using high frequency words and punctuation.",
        "Third, in each hook corpus, we use the meta-pattern to discover concrete patterns and target words co-appearing with the hook word.",
        "Fourth, we cluster the patterns in each corpus according to co-appearance ofthe target words.",
        "Finally, we merge clusters from different hook corpora to produce the final structure.",
        "We also propose a way to label each cluster by word pairs that represent it best.",
        "Since we are dealing with relationships that are unspecified in advance, assessing the quality of the resulting pattern clusters is non-trivial.",
        "Our evaluation uses two methods: SAT tests, and comparison to known relationships.",
        "We used instances of the discovered relationships to automatically generate analogy SAT tests in two languages, English and Russian.",
        "Human subjects answered these and real SAT tests.",
        "English grades were 80% for our test and 71% for the real test (83% and 79% for Russian), showing that our relationship definitions indeed reflect human notions of relationship similarity.",
        "In addition, we show that among our pattern clusters there are clusters that cover major known noun-compound and verb-verb relationships.",
        "In the present paper we focus on the pattern cluster resource itself and how to evaluate its intrinsic quality.",
        "In (Davidov and Rappoport, 2008) we show how to use the resource for a known task of a totally different nature, classification of relationships between nominals (based on annotated data), obtaining superior results over previous work.",
        "Section 2 discusses related work, and Section 3 presents the pattern clustering and labeling algorithm.",
        "Section 4 describes the corpora we used and the algorithm's parameters in detail.",
        "Sections 5 and 6 present SAT and comparison evaluation results.",
        "2 Related Work",
        "Extraction of relation information from text is a large sub-field in NLP.",
        "Major differences between pattern approaches include the relationship types sought (including domain restrictions), the degrees of supervision and required preprocessing, and evaluation method.",
        "There is a large body of related work that deals with discovery of basic relationship types represented in useful resources such as WordNet, including hyper-nymy (Hearst, 1992; Pantel et al., 2004; Snow et al., 2006), synonymy (Davidov and Rappoport, 2006; Widdows and Dorow, 2002) and meronymy (Berland and Charniak, 1999; Girju et al., 2006).",
        "Since named entities are very important in NLP, many studies define and discover relations between named entities (Hasegawa et al., 2004; Hassan et al., 2006).",
        "Work was also done on relations between verbs (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004).",
        "There is growing research on relations between nominals (Moldovan et al., 2004; Girju et al., 2007).",
        "While numerous studies attempt to discover one or more pre-specified relationship types, very little previous work has directly attempted the discovery of which main types of generic relationships actually exist in an unrestricted domain.",
        "Turney (2006) provided a pattern distance measure that allows a fully unsupervised measurement of relational similarity between two pairs of words; such a measure could in principle be used by a clustering algorithm in order to deduce relationship types, but this was not discussed.",
        "Unlike (Turney, 2006), we do not perform any pattern ranking.",
        "Instead we produce (possibly overlapping) hard clusters, where each pattern cluster represents a relationship discovered in the domain.",
        "Banko et al.",
        "(2007) and Rosenfeld and Feldman (2007) find relationship instances where the relationships are not specified in advance.",
        "They aim to find relationship instances rather than identify generic semantic relationships.",
        "Thus, their representation is very different from ours.",
        "In addition, (Banko et al., 2007) utilize supervised tools such as a POS tagger and a shallow parser.",
        "Davidov et al.",
        "(2007) proposed a method for unsupervised discovery of concept-specific relations.",
        "That work, like ours, relies on pattern clusters.",
        "However, it requires initial word seeds and targets the discovery of relationships specific for some given concept, while we attempt to discover and define generic relationships that exist in the entire domain.",
        "Studying relationships between tagged named entities, (Hasegawa et al., 2004; Hassan et al., 2006) proposed unsupervised clustering methods that assign given sets of pairs into several clusters, where each cluster corresponds to one of a known set of relationship types.",
        "Their classification setting is thus very different from our unsupervised discovery one.",
        "Several recent papers discovered relations on the web using seed patterns (Pantel et al., 2004), rules (Etzioni et al., 2004), and word pairs (Paşca et al., 2006; Alfonseca et al., 2006).",
        "The latter used the notion of hook which we also use in this paper.",
        "Several studies utilize some preprocessing, including parsing (Hasegawa et al., 2004; Hassan et al., 2006) and usage of syntactic (Suchanek et al., 2006) and morphological (Pantel et al., 2004) information in patterns.",
        "Several algorithms use manually-prepared resources, including WordNet (Moldovan et al., 2004; Costello et al., 2006) and Wikipedia (Strube and Ponzetto, 2006).",
        "In this paper, we do not utilize any language-specific preprocessing or any other resources, which makes our algorithm relatively easily portable between languages, as we demonstrate in our bilingual evaluation.",
        "Evaluation for hypernymy and synonymy usually uses WordNet (Lin and Pantel, 2002; Widdows and Dorow, 2002; Davidov and Rappoport, 2006).",
        "For more specific lexical relationships like relationships between verbs (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004), nominals (Girju et al., 2004; Girju et al., 2007) or meronymy subtypes (Berland and Charniak, 1999) there is still little agreement which important relationships should be defined.",
        "Thus, there are more than a dozen different type hierarchies and tasks proposed for noun compounds (and nominals in general), including (Nastase and Szpakowicz, 2003; Girju et al., 2005; Girju et al., 2007).",
        "There are thus two possible ways for a fair evaluation.",
        "A study can develop its own relationship definitions and dataset, like (Nastase and Szpakow-icz, 2003), thus introducing a possible bias; or it can accept the definition and dataset prepared by another work, like (Turney, 2006).",
        "However, this makes it impossible to work on new relationship types.",
        "Hence, when exploring very specific relationship types or very generic, but not widely accepted, types (like verb strength), many researchers resort to manual human-based evaluation (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004).",
        "In our case, where relationship types are not specified in advance, creating an unbiased benchmark is very problematic, so we rely on human subjects for relationship evaluation."

        "Our algorithm first discovers and clusters patterns in which a single ('hook') word participates, and then merges the resulting clusters to form the final structure.",
        "In this section we detail the algorithm.",
        "The algorithm utilizes several parameters, whose selection is detailed in Section 4.",
        "We refer to a pattern contained in our clusters (a pattern type) as a 'pattern' and to an occurrence of a pattern in the corpus (a pattern token) as a 'pattern instance'.",
        "As a first step, we randomly select a set of hook words.",
        "Hook words were used in e.g. (Alfonseca et al., 2006) for extracting general relations starting from given seed word pairs.",
        "Unlike most previous work, our hook words are not provided in advance but selected randomly; the goal in those papers is to discover relationships between given word pairs, while we use hook words in order to discover relationships that generally occur in the corpus.",
        "Only patterns in which a hook word actually participates will eventually be discovered.",
        "Hence, in principle we should select as many hook words as possible.",
        "However, words whose frequency is very high are usually ambiguous and are likely to produce patterns that are too noisy, so we do not select words with frequency higher than a parameter FC.",
        "In addition, we do not select words whose frequency is below a threshold FB, to avoid selection of typos and other noise that frequently appear on the web.",
        "We also limit the total number N of hook words.",
        "Our algorithm merges clusters originating from different hook words.",
        "Using too many hook words increases the chance that some of them belong to a noisy part in the corpus and thus lowers the quality of our resulting clusters.",
        "For each hook word, we now create a hook corpus, the set of the contexts in which the word appears.",
        "Each context is a window containing W words or punctuation characters before and after the hook word.",
        "We avoid extracting text from clearly unformatted sentences and our contexts do not cross paragraph boundaries.",
        "The size of each hook corpus is much smaller than that of the whole corpus, easily fitting into main memory; the corpus of a hook word occurring h times in the corpus contains at most 2hW words.",
        "Since most operations are done on each hook corpus separately, computation is very efficient.",
        "Note that such context corpora can in principle be extracted by focused querying on the web, making the system dynamically scalable.",
        "It is also possible to restrict selection of hook words to a specific domain or word type, if we want to discover only a desired subset of existing relationships.",
        "Thus we could sample hook words from nouns, verbs, proper names, or names of chemical compounds if we are only interested in discovering relationships between these.",
        "Selecting hook words randomly allows us to avoid using any language-specific data at this step.",
        "In order to reduce noise and to make the computation more efficient, we did not consider all contexts of a hook word as pattern candidates, only contexts that are instances of a specified meta-pattern type.",
        "Following (Davidov and Rappoport, 2006), we classified words into high-frequency words (HFWs) and content words (CWs).",
        "A word whose frequency is more (less) than FH (FC) is considered to be a HFW (CW).",
        "Unlike (Davidov and Rappoport, 2006), we consider all punctuation characters as HFWs.",
        "Our patterns have the general form [Prefix] CWi [Infix] CW2 [Postfix] where Prefix, Infix and Postfix contain only HFWs.",
        "To reduce the chance of catching CWj's that are parts of a multiword expression, we require Prefix and Postfix to have at least one word (HFW), while",
        "Infix is allowed to contain any number of HFWs (but recall that the total length of a pattern is limited by window size).",
        "A pattern example is 'such X as Y and'.",
        "During this stage we only allow single words to be in CW slots.",
        "For each of the hook corpora, we now extract all pattern instances where one CW slot contains the hook word and the other CW slot contains some other ('target') word.",
        "To avoid the selection of common words as target words, and to avoid targets appearing in pattern instances that are relatively fixed multiword expressions, we sort all target words in a given hook corpus by pointwise mutual information between hook and target, and drop patterns obtained from pattern instances containing the lowest and highest L percent of target words.",
        "We now have for each hook corpus a set of patterns.",
        "All of the corresponding pattern instances share the hook word, and some of them also share a target word.",
        "We cluster patterns in a two-stage process.",
        "First, we group in clusters all patterns whose instances share the same target word, and ignore the rest.",
        "For each target word we have a single pattern cluster.",
        "Second, we merge clusters that share more than S percent of their patterns.",
        "A pattern can appear in more than a single cluster.",
        "Note that clusters contain pattern types, obtained through examining pattern instances.",
        "The purpose of this stage is to create clusters of patterns that express generic relationships rather than ones specific to a single hook word.",
        "In addition, the technique used in this stage reduces noise.",
        "For each created cluster we will define core patterns and unconfirmed patterns, which are weighed differently during cluster labeling (see Section 3.6).",

        "4.",
        "If several clusters have the same set of core patterns merge them according to rules (i,ii).",
        "We start from the smallest clusters because we expect these to be more precise; the best patterns for semantic acquisition are those that belong to small clusters, and appear in many different clusters.",
        "At the end of this algorithm, we have a set of pattern clusters where for each cluster there are two subsets, core patterns and unconfirmed patterns.",
        "To label pattern clusters we define a hits measure that reflects the affinity of a given word pair to a given cluster.",

        "As an example, from one of the 15 clusters we have randomly selected the label (glass, water).",
        "The correct answer selected from the same cluster was (schoolbag, book).",
        "The three pairs randomly selected from the other 14 clusters were (war, death), (request, license) and (mouse, cat).",
        "The pair randomly selected from a cluster not among the 15 clusters was (milk, drink).",
        "Among the subjects' proposals for this question were (closet, clothes) and (wallet, money).",
        "We computed accuracy of SAT answers, and the correlation between answers for our questions and the real ones (Table 1).",
        "Three things are demonstrated about our system when humans are capable of selecting the correct answer.",
        "First, our clusters are internally coherent in the sense of expressing a certain relationship, because people identified that the pairs in the question header and in the correct answer exhibit the same relationship.",
        "Second, our clusters distinguish between different relationships, because the three pairs not expressing the same relationship as the header were not selected by the evaluators.",
        "Third, our cluster labeling algorithm produces results that are usable by people.",

        "We can see that for both languages, around 80% of the choices were correct (the random choice baseline is 20%).",
        "Our subjects are university students, so results higher than 57 are expected, as we can see from real SAT performance.",
        "The difference in grades between the two languages might be attributed to the presence of relatively hard and uncommon words.",
        "It also may result from the Russian test being easier because there is less verb-noun ambiguity in Russian.",
        "We have observed a high correlation between true grades and ours, suggesting that our automatically generated test reflects the ability to recognize analogies and can be potentially used for automated generation of SAT-like tests.",
        "The results show that our pattern clusters indeed mirror a human notion of relationship similarity and represent meaningful relationships.",
        "They also show that as intended, different clusters describe different relationships.",
        "To assess recall of separate pattern clusters, we have asked subjects to provide (if possible) an additional pair for each SAT question.",
        "On each such pair we have automatically extracted a set of pattern instances that capture this pair by using automated web queries.",
