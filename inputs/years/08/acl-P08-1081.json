        "Forum participants are not physically co-present, and thus reply may not happen immediately after questions are posted.",

        "In this paper, we address the problem of detecting the contexts and answers from forum threads for the questions identified in the same threads.",

        "It contains three question sentences, S3, S5 and S6.",
        "Sentences S1 and S2 are contexts of question 1 (S3).",
        "Sentence S4 is the context of questions 2 and 3, but not 1.",
        "Sentence S8 is the answer to question 3.",
        "(S4-S5-S10) is one example of question-context-answer triple that we want to detect in the thread.",
        "As shown in the example, a forum question usually requires contextual information to provide background or constraints.",
        "Moreover, it sometimes needs contextual information to provide explicit link to its answers.",
        "For example, S8 is an answer of question 1, but they cannot be linked with any common word.",
        "Instead, S8 shares word pet with S1, which is a context of question 1, and thus S8 could be linked with question 1 through S1.",
        "We call contextual information the context of a question in this paper.",
        "A summary of forum threads in the form of question-context-answer can not only highlight the main content, but also provide a user-friendly organization of threads, which will make the access to forum information easier.",
        "Another motivation of detecting contexts and answers of the questions in forum threads is that it could be used to enrich the knowledge base of community-based question and answering (CQA) services such as Live QnA and Yahoo!",
        "Answers, where context is comparable with the question description while question corresponds to the question title.",
        "For example, there were about 700,000 questions in the Yahoo!",
        "Answers travel category as of January 2008.",
        "We extracted about 3,000,000 travel related questions from six online travel forums.",
        "One would expect that a CQA service with large QA data will attract more users to the service.",
        "To enrich the knowledge base, not only the answers, but also the contexts are critical; otherwise the answer to a question such as How much is the taxi would be useless without context in the database.",
        "However, it is challenging to detecting contexts and answers for questions in forum threads.",
        "We assume the questions have been identified in a forum thread using the approach in (Cong et al., 2008).",
        "Although identifying questions in a forum thread is also nontrivial, it is beyond the focus of this paper.",
        "First, detecting contexts of a question is important and non-trivial.",
        "We found that 74% of questions in our corpus, which contain 1,064 questions from 579 forum threads about travel, need contexts.",
        "However, relative position information is far from adequate to solve the problem.",
        "For example, in our corpus 63% of sentences preceding questions are contexts and they only represent 34% of all correct contexts.",
        "To effectively detect contexts, the dependency between sentences is important.",
        "For example in Figure 1, both S1 and S2 are contexts of question 1.",
        "S1 could be labeled as context based on word similarity, but it is not easy to link S2 with the question directly.",
        "S1 and S2 are linked by the common word family, and thus S2 can be linked with question 1 through S1.",
        "The challenge here is how to model and utilize the dependency for context detection.",
        "Second, it is difficult to link answers with questions.",
        "In forums, multiple questions and answers can be discussed in parallel and are interweaved together while the reply relationship between posts is usually unavailable.",
        "To detect answers, we need to handle two kinds of dependencies.",
        "One is the dependency relationship between contexts and answers, which should be leveraged especially when questions alone do not provide sufficient information to find answers; the other is the dependency between answer candidates (similar to sentence dependency described above).",
        "The challenge is how to model and utilize these two kinds of dependencies.",
        "In this paper we propose a novel approach for detecting contexts and answers of the questions in forum threads.",
        "To our knowledge this is the first work on this.",
        "We make the following contributions:",
        "First, we employ Linear Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to identify contexts and answers, which can capture the relationships between contiguous sentences.",
        "Second, we also found that context is very important for answer detection.",
        "To capture the dependency between contexts and answers, we introduce Skip-chain CRF model for answer detection.",
        "We also extend the basic model to 2D CRFs to model dependency between contiguous questions in a forum thread for context and answer identification.",
        "Finally, we conducted experiments on forum data.",
        "Experimental results show that 1) Linear CRFs outperform SVM and decision tree in both context and answer detection; 2) Skip-chain CRFs outperform Linear CRFs for answer finding, which demonstrates that context improves answer finding; 3) 2D CRF model improves the performance of Linear CRFs and the combination of 2D CRFs and Skip-chain CRFs achieves better performance for context detection.",

        "One straightforward method of leveraging context is to detect contexts and answers in two phases, i.e. to first identify contexts, and then label answers using both the context and question information (e.g. the similarity between context and answer can be used as features in CRFs).",
        "The two-phase procedure, however, still cannot capture the non-local dependency between contexts and answers in a thread.",

        "We presented a new approach to detecting contexts and answers for questions in forums with good performance.",
        "We next discuss our experience not covered by the experiments, and future work.",
        "Since contexts of questions are largely unexplored in previous work, we analyze the contexts in our corpus and classify them into three categories: 1) context contains the main content of question while question contains no constraint, e.g. \"i will visit NY at Oct, looking for a cheap hotel but convenient.",
        "Any good suggestion?",
        "\"; 2) contexts explain or clarify part of the question, such as a definite noun phrase, e.g. 'We are going on the Taste ofParis.",
        "Does anyone know ifit is advisable to take a suitcase with us on the tour., where the first sentence is to describe the tour; and 3) contexts provide constraint or background for question that is syntactically complete, e.g. \"We are interested in visiting the Great Wall(and flying from London).",
        "Can anyone recommend a tour operator'\" In our corpus, about 26% questions do not need context, 12% questions need Type 1 context, 32% need Type 2 context and 30% Type 3.",
        "We found that our techniques often do not perform well on Type 3 questions.",
        "We observed that factoid questions, one of focuses in the TREC QA community, take less than 10% question in our corpus.",
        "It would be interesting to revisit QA techniques to process forum data.",
        "Other future work includes: 1) to summarize multiple threads using the triples extracted from individual threads.",
        "This could be done by clustering question-context-answer triples; 2) to use the traditional text summarization techniques to summarize the multiple answer segments; 3) to integrate the Question Answering techniques as features of our framework to further improve answer finding; 4) to reformulate questions using its context to generate more user-friendly questions for CQA services; and 5) to evaluate our techniques on more online forums in various domains."
