        "Paraphrase patterns are sets of semantically equivalent patterns, in which a pattern generally contains two parts, i.e., the pattern words and slots.",
        "For example, in the pattern \"X solves F', \"solves\" is the pattern word, while \"X\" and \"F' are slots.",
        "One can generate a text unit (phrase or sentence) by filling the pattern slots with specific words.",
        "Paraphrase patterns are useful in both paraphrase recognition and generation.",

        "We assume that if two English patterns are aligned with the same pattern in another language, they are likely to be paraphrase patterns.",
        "This assumption is an extension of the one presented in (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005), which was used for deriving phrasal paraphrases from bilingual corpora.",
        "Our method involves three steps: (1) corpus preprocessing, including English monolingual dependency parsing and English-foreign language word alignment, (2) aligned patterns induction, which produces English patterns along with the aligned pivot patterns in the foreign language, (3) paraphrase patterns extraction, in which paraphrase patterns are extracted based on a log-linear model.",

        "The results suggest that the performance of the method cannot be improved by constraining the extraction of pivot patterns.",
        "We sampled 500 pairs of correct paraphrase patterns extracted using our method and analyzed the types.",
        "We found that there are 5 types of paraphrase patterns, which include: (1) trivial change, such as changes of prepositions and articles, etc; (2) phrase replacement; (3) phrase reordering; (4) structural paraphrase, which contain both phrase replacements and phrase reordering; (5) adding or reducing information that does not change the meaning.",
        "Some statistics and examples are shown in Table 3.",
        "The paraphrase patterns are useful in NLP applications.",
        "Firstly, over 50% of the paraphrase patterns are in the type of phrase replacement, which can be used in IE pattern reformulation and sentence-level paraphrase generation.",
        "Compared with phrasal paraphrases, the phrase replacements in patterns are more accurate due to the constraints of the slots.",
        "The paraphrase patterns in the type of phrase reordering can also be used in IE pattern reformulation and sentence paraphrase generation.",
        "Especially, in sentence paraphrase generation, this type of paraphrase patterns can reorder the phrases in a sentence, which can hardly be achieved by the conventional MT-based generation method (Quirk et al., 2004).",
        "The structural paraphrase patterns have the advantages of both phrase replacement and phrase reordering.",
        "More paraphrase sentences can be generated using these patterns.",
        "The paraphrase patterns in the type of \"information + and -\" are useful in sentence compression and expansion.",
        "A sentence matching a long pattern can be compressed by paraphrasing it using shorter patterns.",
        "Similarly, a short sentence can be expanded by paraphrasing it using longer patterns.",
        "For the 3,000 pairs of test paraphrase patterns, we also investigate the number and type of the pattern slots.",
        "The results are summarized in Table 4 and 5.",
        "From Table 4, we can see that more than 92% of the paraphrase patterns contain only one slot, just like the examples shown in Table 3.",
        "In addition, about 7% of the paraphrase patterns contain two slots, such as \"give [NNJ] [NN^2]\" vs. \"give [NN-2] to [NNJ]\".",
        "This result suggests that our method tends to extract short paraphrase patterns, which is mainly because the data sparseness problem is more serious when extracting long patterns.",
