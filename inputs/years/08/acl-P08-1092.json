        "Producing biographies by hand is a labor-intensive task, generally done only for famous individuals.",
        "The process is particularly difficult when persons of interest are not well known and when information must be gathered from a wide variety of sources.",
        "We present an automatic, unsupervised, multi-document summarization (MDS) approach based on extractive techniques to producing biographies, answering the question \"Who is X?\"",
        "There is growing interest in automatic MDS in general due in part to the explosion of multilingual and multimedia data available online.",
        "The goal of MDS is to automatically produce a concise, well-organized, and fluent summary of a set of documents on the same topic.",
        "MDS strategies have been employed to produce both generic summaries and query-focused summaries.",
        "Due to the complexity of text generation, most summarization systems employ sentence-extraction techniques, in which the most relevant sentences from one or more documents are selected to represent the summary.",
        "This approach is guaranteed to produce grammatical sentences, although they must subsequently be ordered appropriately to produce a coherent summary.",
        "In this paper we describe a sentence-extraction based MDS procedure to produce biographies from online resources automatically.",

        "We further assume that these documents have been tagged with Named Entities (NE)s with coreferences resolved using a system such as NYU's 2005 ACE system (Grishman et al., 2005), which we used for our experiments.",
        "Our task is to produce a concise biography from these documents.",
        "First, we need to select the most 'important' biographical sentences for the target person.",
        "To do so, we first extract from the input documents all sentences that contain some reference to the target person according to the coreference assignment algorithm; this reference may be the target's name or a coreferential full NP or pronominal referring expression, such as the President or he.",
        "We call these sentences hypothesis sentences.",
        "We hypothesize that most 'biographical' sentences will contain a reference to the target.",
        "However, some of these sentences may be irrelevant to a biography; therefore, we filter them using a binary classifier that retains only 'biographical' sentences.",
        "These biographical sentences may also include redundant information; therefore, we cluster them and choose one sentence from each cluster to represent the information in that cluster.",
        "Since some of these sentences have more salient biographical information than others and since manually produced biographies tend to include information in a certain order, we reorder our summary sentences using an SVM regression model trained on biographies.",
        "Finally, the first reference to the target person in the initial sentence in the reordering is rewritten using the longest coreference in our hypothesis sentences which contains the target's full name.",
        "We then trim the output to a threshold to produce a biography of a certain length for evaluation against the DUC2004 systems."

      "text": [
        "One of the difficulties inherent in automatic biography generation is the lack of training data.",
        "One might collect training data by manually annotating a suitable corpus containing biographical and non-biographical data about a person, as in (Zhou et al., 2004).",
        "However, such annotation is labor intensive.",
        "To avoid this problem, we adopt an unsupervised approach.",
        "We use Wikipedia biographies as our corpus of 'biographical' sentences.",
        "We collect our 'non-biographical' sentences from the English newswire documents in the TDT4 corpus.",
        "While each corpus may contain positive and negative examples, we assume that most sentences in Wikipedia biographies are biographical and that the majority of TDT4 sentences are non-biographical.",

        "There are 16,906 biographies in Wikipedia that used this template.",
        "We next apply simple text processing techniques to clean the text.",
        "We select at most the first 150 sentences from each page, to avoid sentences that are not critically important to the biography.",
        "For each of these sentences we perform the following steps:",

        "There are 43 unique NE tags in our corpora, including PERJndividual, ORG Educational, and so on, and TIMEX tags for all dates.",
        "3.",
        "For each sentence, we replace each NE by its tag name and type ([name-type.subtype]) as assigned by the NYU tagger.",
        "This modified sentence we term a class-based/lexical sentence.",
        "4.",
        "Each non-pronominal referring expression (e.g., George W. Bush, the US president) that is tagged as coreferential with the target person is replaced by our own [TARGET_PER] tag and every pronoun P that refers to the target person is replaced by [TARGET_P], where P is the pronoun itself.",
        "This allows us to generalize our sentences while retaining a) the essential distinction between this NE (and its role in the sentence) and all other NEs in the sentence, and b) the form of referring expressions.",
        "5.",
        "Sentences containing no reference to the target person are assumed to be irrelevant and removed from the corpus, as are sentences with fewer than 4 tokens; short sentences are unlikely to contain useful information beyond the target reference.",
        "For example, given sentences from the Wikipedia biography of Martin Luther King, Jr. we produce class-based/lexical sentences as follows:",
        "Martin Luther King, Jr., was born on January 15, 1929, in Atlanta, Georgia.",
        "He was the son of Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr. and Alberta Williams King.",

        "We use the TDT4 corpus to identify non-biographical sentences.",
        "Again, we run NYU's 2005 ACE system to tag NEs and do coreference resolution on each news story in TDT4.",
        "Since we have no target name for these stories, we select an NE tagged as PERJndividual at random from all NEs in the story to represent the target person.",

        "Using the training data described above, we experimented with three different classification algorithms using the Weka machine learning toolkit (Witten et al., 1999): multinomial naive Bayes, SVM with linear kernel, and C4.5.",
        "Weka also provides a classification confidence score that represents how confident the classifier is on each classified sample, which we will make use of as well.",
        "Table 1 presents the classification results on our 4,216 held-out test-set sentences.",
        "These results are quite promising.",
        "However, we should note that they may not necessarily represent the successful classification of biographical vs. non-biographical sentences but rather the classification of Wikipedia sentences vs. TDT4 sentences.",
        "We will validate these results for our full systems in Section 5.",
        "Typically, redundancy removal is a standard component in MDS systems.",
        "In sentence-extraction based summarizers, redundant sentences are defined as those which include the same information without introducing new information and identified by some form of lexically-based clustering.",
        "We use an implementation of a single-link nearest neighbor clustering technique based on stem-overlap (BlairGoldensohn et al., 2004b) to cluster the sentences classified as biographical by our classifier, and then select the sentence from each cluster that maximizes the confidence score returned by the classifier as the representative for that cluster.",
        "It is essential for MDS systems in the extraction framework to choose the order in which sentences should be presented in the final summary.",
        "Presenting more important information earlier in a summary is a general strategy for most domains, although importance may be difficult to determine reliably.",
        "Similar to (Barzilay and Lee, 2004), we automatically learn how to order our biographical sentences by observing the typical order of presentation of information in a particular domain.",

        "Section 3) and lexical items; for example, the unigrams born, became, and [GPEState-or-Province], and the bigrams was born, [TARGETPER] died and [TARGETJ^ER] joined would be good candidates for such features.",
        "To minimize the dimensionality of our regression space, we constrained our feature choice to those features that are important to distinguish biographical sentences, which we term biographical terms.",
        "Since we want these biographical terms to impact the regression function, we define these to be phrases that consist of at least one lexical item that occurs in many biographies but rarely more than once in any given biography.",
        "We compute the biographical term score as in the following equation:",

        "For example, if the first sentence in the biography we have produced for Jimmy Carter is He was born in 1947 and a sentence not chosen for inclusion in our biography Jimmy Carter, former U.S. President, visited the University of California last year.",

        "This system significantly outperforms the top ranked this particularly learning algorithm on our task may be due to: (1) the nature of our feature space - n-gram frequencies are modeled properly by a multinomial distribution; (2) the simplicity of this classifier particularly given our large feature dimensionality; and (3) the robustness of naive Bayes with respect to noisy data: Not all sentences in Wikipedia biographies are biographical sentences and some sentences in TDT4 are biographical.",
        "While the SVM regression reordering component has a slight negative impact on the performance of the MNB system, the difference between the two versions is not significant.",

        "In this paper, we describe a MDS system for producing biographies, given a target name.",
        "We present an unsupervised approach using Wikipedia biography pages and a general news corpus (TDT4) to automatically construct training data for our system.",
        "We employ a NE tagger and a coreference resolution system to extract class-based and lexical features from each sentence which we use to train a binary classifier to identify biographical sentences.",
        "We also train an SVM regression model to reorder the sentences and then employ a rewriting heuristic to create the final summary.",
        "We compare versions of our system based upon three machine learning algorithms and two sentence reordering strategies plus a baseline.",
        "Our best performing system uses the multinomial naive Bayes (MNB) classifier with classifier confidence score reordering.",
        "However, our SVM regression reordering improves summaries produced by the other two classifiers and is preferred by human judges.",
        "We compare our MNB system on the DUC2004 biography task (task 5) to other DUC2004 systems and to human-generated summaries.",
        "Our system outperforms all DUC2004 systems significantly, according to ROUGE-L-1.5.5.",
        "When presented with summaries produced by our system and summaries produced by the best-performing (according to ROUGE scores) of the DUC2004 systems, human judges (majority vote of 3) prefer our system's biographies in 88.1% of cases.",
        "In addition to its high performance, our approach has the following advantages: It employs no manual annotation but relies upon identifying appropriately different corpora to represent our training corpus.",
        "It employs class-based as well as lexical features where the classes are obtained automatically from an ACE NE tagger.",
        "It utilizes automatic corefer-ence resolution to identify sentences containing references to the target person.",
        "Our sentence reordering approaches make use of either classifier confidence scores or ordering learned automatically from the actual ordering of sentences in Wikipedia biographies to determine the order of presentation of sentences in our summaries.",
        "Since our task is to produce concise summaries, one focus of our future research will be to simplify the sentences we extract before classifying them as biographical or non-biographical.",
        "This procedure should also help to remove irrelevant information from sentences.",
        "Recall that our SVM regression model for sentence ordering was trained using only biographical class-based/lexical items.",
        "In future, we would also like to experiment with more linguistically-informed features.",
        "While Wikipedia does not enforce any particular ordering of information in biographies, and while different biographies may emphasize different types of information, it would appear that the success of our automatically derived ordering procedures may capture some underlying shared view of how biographies are written.",
        "The same underlying views may also apply to domains such as organization descriptions or types of historical events.",
        "In future we plan to explore such a generalization of our procedures to such domains."
