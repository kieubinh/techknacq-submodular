        "In certain situations even the best automatic summarizers or professional writers can find it hard to write a good summary of a set of articles.",
        "If there is no clear topic shared across the input articles, or if they follow the development of the same event in time for a longer period, it could become difficult to decide what information is most representative and should be conveyed in a summary.",
        "Similarly, length requirements could predetermine summary quality – a short outline of a story might be confusing and unclear but a page long discussion might give an excellent overview of the same issue.",
        "Even systems that perform well on average produce summaries of poor quality for some inputs.",
        "For this reason, understanding what aspects of the input make it difficult for summarization becomes an interesting and important issue that has not been addressed in the summarization community untill now.",
        "In information retrieval, for example, the variable system performance has been recognized as a research challenge and numerous studies on identifying query difficulty have been carried out (most recently (Cronen-Townsend et al., 2002; Yom-Tov et al., 2005; Carmel et al., 2006)).",
        "In this paper we present results supporting the hypotheses that input topicality cohesiveness and summary length are among the factors that determine summary quality regardless ofthe choice ofsumma-rization strategy (Section 2).",
        "The data used for the analyses comes from the annual Document Understanding Conference (DUC) in which various summarization approaches are evaluated on common data, with new test sets provided each year.",
        "In later sections we define a suite of features capturing aspects of the topicality cohesiveness of the input (Section 3) and relate these to system performance, identifying reliable correlates of input difficulty (Section 4).",
        "Finally, in Section 5, we demonstrate that the features can be used to build a classifier predicting summarization input difficulty with accuracy considerably above chance level."

        "Generic multi-document summarization was featured as a task at the Document Understanding Conference (DUC) in four years, 2001 through 2004.",
        "In our study we use the DUC 2001 multi-document task submissions as development data for in-depth analysis and feature selection.",

        "Summaries of different",
        "iociation for Computational Linguistics",
        "lengths were produced by each system: 50, 100, 200 and 400 words.",
        "Each summary was manually evaluated to determine the extent to which its content overlaped with that of a human model, giving a coverage score.",
        "The content comparison was performed on a subsentence level and was based on elementary discourse units in the model summary.",
        "The coverage scores are taken as an indicator of difficultly of the input: systems achieve low coverage for difficult sets and higher coverage for easy sets.",
        "Since we are interested in identifying characteristics of generally difficult inputs rather than in discovering what types of inputs might be difficult for one given system, we use the average system score per set as indicator of general difficulty.",
        "Before attempting to derive characteristics of inputs difficult for summarization, we first confirm that indeed expected performance is influenced by the input itself.",
        "We performed analysis of variance for DUC 2001 data, with automatic system coverage score as the dependent variable, to gain some insight into the factors related to summarization difficulty.",
        "The results of the ANOVA with input set, summarizer identity and summary length as factors, as well as the interaction between these, are shown in Table 1.",
        "As expected, summarizer identity is a significant factor: some summarization strategies/systems are more effective than others and produce summaries with higher coverage score.",
        "More interestingly, the input set and summary length factors are also highly significant and explain more of the variability in coverage scores than summarizer identity does, as indicated by the larger values of the F statistic.",
        "Length The average automatic summarizer coverage scores increase steadily as length requirements are relaxed, going up from 0.50 for 50-word summaries to 0.76 for 400-word summaries as shown in Table 2 (second row).",
        "The general trend we observe is that on average systems are better at producing summaries when more space is available.",
        "The dif-",
        "'The routinely used tool for automatic evaluation ROUGE was adopted exactly because it was demonstrated it is highly correlated with the manual DUC coverage scores (Lin and Hovy, 2003a; Lin, 2004).",

        "N = 50, 100, 200, and 400.",
        "ferences are statistically significant only between 50-word and 200- and 400-word summaries and between 100-word and 400-word summaries.",
        "The fact that summary quality improves with increasing summary length has been observed in prior studies as well (Radev and Tam, 2003; Lin and Hovy, 2003b; Kolluru and Gotoh, 2005) but generally little attention has been paid to this fact in system development and no specific user studies are available to show what summary length might be most suitable for specific applications.",
        "In later editions of the DUC conference, only summaries of 100 words were produced, focusing development efforts on one of the more demanding length restrictions.",
        "The interaction between summary length and summarizer is small but significant (Table 1), with certain summarization strategies more successful at particular summary lengths than at others.",
        "Improved performance as measured by increase in coverage scores is observed for human summarizers as well (shown in the first row of Table 2).",
        "Even the baseline systems (first n words of the most recent article in the input or first sentences from different input articles) show improvement when longer summaries are allowed (performance shown in the third row of the table).",
        "It is important to notice that the difference between automatic system and baseline performance increases as the summary length increases – the difference between systems and baselines coverage scores is around 0.1 for the shorter 50- and 100-word summaries but 0.2 for the longer summaries.",
        "This fact has favorable implications for practical system developments because it indicates that in applications where somewhat longer summaries are appropriate, automatically produced summaries will be much more informative than a baseline summary.",
        "Table 1: Analysis of variance for coverage scores of automatic systems with input, summarizer, and length as factors.",
        "Input The input set itself is a highly significant factor that influences the coverage scores that systems obtain: some inputs are handled by the systems better than others.",
        "Moreover, the input interacts both with the summarizers and the summary length.",
        "This is an important finding for several reasons.",
        "First, in system evaluations such as DUC the inputs for summarization are manually selected by annotators.",
        "There is no specific attempt to ensure that the inputs across different years have on average the same difficulty.",
        "Simply assuming this to be the case could be misleading: it is possible in a given year to have \"easier\" input test set compared to a previous year.",
        "Then system performance across years cannot be meaningfully compared, and higher system scores would not be indicative of system improvement between the evaluations.",
        "Second, in summarization applications there is some control over the input for summarization.",
        "For example, related documents that need to summarized could be split into smaller subsets that are more amenable to summarization or routed to an appropriate summarization system than can handle this kind of input using a different strategy, as done for instance in (McKeown et al., 2002).",
        "Because of these important implications we investigate input characteristics and define various features distinguishing easy inputs from difficult ones.",
        "Before proceeding to the analysis of input difficulty in multi-document summarization, it is worth mentioning that our study is primarily motivated by system development needs and consequently the focus is on finding out what inputs are easy or difficult for automatic systems.",
        "Different factors might make summarization difficult for people.",

        "The correlation is highest for 200-word summaries, 0.77, which is also highly significant.",
        "For shorter summaries the correlation between human and system performance is not significant.",

        "The more similar the different documents in the input are to each other, the more likely there is repetition across documents at various granularities.",
        "Cosine similarity between the document vector representations is probably the easiest and most commonly used among the various similarity measures.",
        "We use tf*idf weights in the vector representations, with term frequency (tf) normalized by the total number of words in the document in order to remove bias resulting from high frequencies by virtue of higher document length alone.",

        "Lin and Hovy's idea was to automatically identify words that are descriptive for a cluster of documents on the same topic, such as the input to a multi-document summarizer.",

        "We have addressed the question of what makes the writing of a summary for a multi-document input difficult.",
        "Summary length is a significant factor, with all summarizers (people, machines and baselines) performing better at longer summary lengths.",
        "An exploratory analysis of DUC 2001 indicated that systems produce better summaries for cohesive inputs dealing with a clear topic (single event, subject and biographical sets) while non-cohesive sets about multiple events and opposing opinions are consistently of lower quality.",
        "We defined a number of features aimed at capturing input cohesiveness, ranging from simple features such as input length and size to more sophisticated measures such as input set entropy, KL divergence from a background corpus and topic signature terms based on log-likelihood ratio.",
        "Generally, easy to summarize sets are characterized by low entropy, small vocabulary, high average cosine and average topic signature overlaps, high KL divergence and a high percentage of the vocabulary consists of topic signature terms.",
        "Experiments with a logistic regression classifier based on the features further confirms that input cohesiveness is predictive of the difficulty it will pose to automatic summarizers.",
        "Several important notes can be made.",
        "First, it is important to develop strategies that can better handle non-cohesive inputs, reducing fluctuations in system performance.",
        "Most current systems are developed with the expectation they can handle any input but this is evidently not the case and more attention should be paid to the issue.",
        "Second, the interpretations of year to year evaluations can be affected.",
        "As demonstrated, the properties of the input have a considerable influence on summarization quality.",
        "If special care is not taken to ensure that the difficulty of inputs in different evaluations is kept more or less the same, results from the evaluations are not comparable and we cannot make general claims about progress and system improvements between evaluations.",
        "Finally, the presented results are clearly just a beginning in understanding of summarization difficulty.",
        "A more complete characterization of summarization input will be necessary in the future.",
