        "Simultaneous conversations seem to arise naturally in both informal social interactions and multi-party typed chat.",
        "Aoki et al.",
        "(2006)'s study of voice conversations among 8-10 people found an average of 1.76 conversations (floors) active at a time, and a maximum of four.",
        "In our chat corpus, the average is even higher, at 2.75.",
        "The typical conversation, therefore, is one which is interrupted frequently.",
        "Disentanglement is the clustering task of dividing a transcript into a set of distinct conversations.",
        "It is an essential prerequisite for any kind of higher-level dialogue analysis: for instance, consider the multiparty exchange in figure 1.",
        "Contextually, it is clear that this corresponds to two conversations, and Felicia's response \"excel(Chanel) Felicia: google works :) (Gale) Arlie: you guys have never worked in a factory before have you (Gale) Arlie: there's some real unethical stuff that goes on (Regine) hands Chanel a trophy (Arlie) Gale, of course ... thats how they make money (Gale) and people lose limbs or get killed (Felicia) excellent lent\" is intended for Chanel and Regine.",
        "A straightforward reading of the transcript, however, might interpret it as a response to Gale's statement immediately preceding.",
        "Humans are adept at disentanglement, even in complicated environments like crowded cocktail parties or chat rooms; in order to perform this task, they must maintain a complex mental representation of the ongoing discourse.",
        "Moreover, they adapt their utterances to some degree to make the task easier (O'Neill and Martin, 2003), which suggests that disentanglement is in some sense a \"difficult\" discourse task.",
        "Disentanglement has two practical applications.",
        "One is the analysis of pre-recorded transcripts in order to extract some kind of information, such as question-answer pairs or summaries.",
        "These tasks should probably take as as input each separate conversation, rather than the entire transcript.",
        "Another",

        "application is as part of a user-interface system for active participants in the chat, in which users target a conversation of interest which is then highlighted for them.",

        "(2003) created such a system for speech, which users generally preferred to a conventional system-when the disentanglement worked!",
        "Previous attempts to solve the problem (Aoki et al., 2006; Aoki et al., 2003; Camtepe et al., 2005; Acar et al., 2005) have several flaws.",
        "They cluster speakers, not utterances, and so fail when speakers move from one conversation to another.",
        "Their features are mostly time gaps between one utterance and another, without effective use of utterance content.",
        "Moreover, there is no framework for a principled comparison of results: there are no reliable annotation schemes, no standard corpora, and no agreed-upon metrics.",
        "We attempt to remedy these problems.",
        "We present a new corpus of manually annotated chat room data and evaluate annotator reliability.",
        "We give a set of metrics describing structural similarity both locally and globally.",
        "We propose a model which uses discourse structure and utterance contents in addition to time gaps.",

        "(2005) do give performance results, but only on synthetic data.",

        "Aoki et al.",
        "(2003) analyze each thirty-second segment of the transcript separately.",

        "Acar et al.",
        "(2005) attempt to deal with this problem by using a fuzzy algorithm to cluster speakers; this assigns each speaker a distribution over conversations rather than a hard assignment.",
        "However, the algorithm still deals with speakers rather than utterances, and cannot determine which conversation any particular utterance is part of.",
        "Another problem with these approaches is the information used for clustering.",

        "Acar et al.",
        "(2005) adds word repetition to their feature set.",
        "However, their approach deals with all word repetitions on an equal basis, and so degrades quickly in the presence of noise words (their term for words which shared across conversations) to almost complete failure when only 1/2 of the words are shared.",
        "To motivate our own approach, we examine some linguistic studies of discourse, especially analysis of multi-party conversation.",
        "O'Neill and Martin (2003) point out several ways in which multi-party text chat differs from typical two-party conversation.",
        "One key difference is the frequency with which participants mention each others' names.",
        "They hypothesize that mentioning is a strategy which participants use to make disentanglement easier, compensating for the lack of cues normally present in face-to-face dialogue.",
        "Mentions (such as Gale's comments to Ar-lie in figure 1) are very common in our corpus, occurring in 36% of comments, and provide a useful feature.",
        "Another key difference is that participants may create a new conversation (floor) at any time, a process which Sacks et al.",
        "(1974) calls schisming.",
        "During a schism, a new conversation is formed, not necessarily because of a shift in the topic, but because certain participants have refocused their attention onto each other, and away from whoever held the floor in the parent conversation.",
        "Despite these differences, there are still strong similarities between chat and other conversations such as meetings.",
        "Our feature set incorporates information which has proven useful in meeting segmentation (Galley et al., 2003) and the task of detecting addressees of a specific utterance in a meeting (Jovanovic et al., 2006).",
        "These include word repetitions, utterance topic, and cue words which can indicate the bounds of a segment."

        "Thus measuring 1-to-1 overlap with our annotations is a reasonable evaluation for computational models.",
        "However, we feel that the major source of disagreement is one that can be remedied in future annotation schemes: the specificity of the individual annotations.",

        "We use a maximum-entropy classifier (Daumé III, 2004) to decide whether a pair of utterances x and y are in same or different conversations.",
        "The most likely class is different, which occurs 57% of the time in development data.",
        "We describe the classifier's performance in terms of raw accuracy (correct decisions / total), precision and recall of the same class, and F-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall.",

        "Although there are a variety of approximations and local searches, we do not wish to investigate partitioning methods in this paper, so we simply use a greedy search.",
        "In this algorithm, we assign utterance j by examining all previous utterances i within the classifier's window, and treating the classifier's judgement – .5 as a vote for cluster (i).",
        "If the maximum vote is greater than 0, we set cluster(j) = argmaxc votec.",
        "Otherwise j is put in a new cluster.",
        "Greedy clustering makes at least a reasonable starting point for further efforts, since it is a natural online algorithm-it assigns each utterance as it arrives, without reference to the future.",
        "At any rate, we should not take our objective function too seriously.",
        "Although it is roughly correlated with performance, the high error rate of the classifier makes it unlikely that small changes in objective will mean much.",

        "This places it within the bounds of our human annotations (see table 1), toward the more general end of the spectrum.",
        "As a standard of comparison for our system, we provide results for several baselines-trivial systems which any useful annotation should outperform.",
        "All different Each utterance is a separate conversation.",
        "All same The whole transcript is a single conversation.",
        "Blocks of k Each consecutive group of k utterances is a conversation.",
        "Pause of k Each pause of k seconds or more separates two conversations.",
        "Speaker Each speaker's utterances are treated as a monologue.",
        "For each particular metric, we calculate the best baseline result among all of these.",
        "To find the best block size or pause length, we search over multiples of 5 between 5 and 300.",
        "This makes these baselines appear better than they really are, since their performance is optimized with respect to the test data.",
        "Our results, in table 3, are encouraging.",
        "On average, annotators agree more with each other than with any artificial annotation, and more with our model than with the baselines.",
        "For the 1-to-1 accuracy metric, we cannot claim much beyond these general results.",
        "The range of human variation is quite wide, and there are annotators who are closer to baselines than to any other human annotator.",
        "As explained earlier, this is because some human annotations are much more specific than others.",
        "For very specific annotations, the best baselines are short blocks or pauses.",

        "There is no overlap in the ranges; for every test annotation, agreement is highest with other annotator, then our model and finally the baselines.",
        "The most competitive baseline is one conversation per speaker, which makes sense, since if a speaker makes two comments in a four-utterance window, they are very likely to be related.",
        "The name mention features are critical for our model's performance.",
        "Without this feature, the classifier's development F-score drops from 71 to 56.",

        "On the other hand, mentions are not sufficient; with only name mention and time gap features, mean 1-to-1 is 38.54 and loc 3 is 67.14.",
        "For some utterances, of course, name mentions provide the only reasonable clue to the correct decision, which is why humans mention names in the first place.",
        "But our system is probably overly dependent on them, since they are very reliable compared to our other features."

        "Although our annotators are reasonably reliable, it seems clear that they think of conversations as a hierarchy, with digressions and schisms.",

        "We are also interested to see how well this feature set performs on speech data, as in (Aoki et al., 2003).",
        "Spoken conversation is more natural than text chat, but when participants are not face-to-face, disentanglement remains a problem.",
        "On the other hand, spoken dialogue contains new sources of information, such as prosody.",
        "Turn-taking behavior is also more distinct, which makes the task easier, but according to (Aoki et al., 2006), it is certainly not sufficient.",
        "Improving the current model will definitely require better features for the classifier.",
        "However, we also left the issue of partitioning nearly completely unexplored.",
        "If the classifier can indeed be improved, we expect the impact of search errors to increase.",
        "Another issue is that human users may prefer more or less specific annotations than our model provides.",
        "We have observed that we can produce lower or higher-entropy annotations by changing the classifier's bias to label more edges same or different.",
