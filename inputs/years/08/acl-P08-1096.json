        "Most of previous work adopts the mention-pair model, which recasts coreference resolution to a binary classification problem of determining whether or not two mentions in a document are co-referring (e.g. Aone and Bennett (1995); McCarthy and Lehnert (1995); Soon et al.",
        "(2001); Ng and Cardie (2002)).",
        "Although having achieved reasonable success, the mention-pair model has a limitation that information beyond mention pairs is ignored for training and testing.",
        "As an individual mention usually lacks adequate descriptive information of the referred entity, it is often difficult to judge whether or not two mentions are talking about the same entity simply from the pair alone.",
        "An alternative learning model that can overcome this problem performs coreference resolution based on entity-mention pairs (Luo et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2004b).",
        "Compared with the traditional mention-pair counterpart, the entity-mention model aims to make coreference decision at an entity level.",
        "Classification is done to determine whether a mention is a referent of a partially found entity.",
        "A mention to be resolved (called active mention henceforth) is linked to an appropriate entity chain (if any), based on classification results.",
        "One problem that arises with the entity-mention model is how to represent the knowledge related to an entity.",
        "In a document, an entity may have more than one mention.",
        "It is impractical to enumerate all the mentions in an entity and record their information in a single feature vector, as it would make the feature space too large.",
        "Even worse, the number of mentions in an entity is not fixed, which would result in variant-length feature vectors and make trouble for normal machine learning algorithms.",
        "A solution seen in previous work (Luo et al., 2004; Culotta et al., 2007) is to design a set of first-order features summarizing the information of the mentions in an entity, for example, \"whether the entity has any mention that is a name alias of the active mention?\"",
        "or \"whether most of the mentions in the entity have the same head word as the active mention?\"",
        "These features, nevertheless, are designed in an ad-hoc manner and lack the capability of describing each individual mention in an entity.",
        "In this paper, we present a more expressive entitymention model for coreference resolution.",
        "The model employs Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) to represent the relational knowledge of an active mention, an entity, and the mentions in the entity.",
        "On top of this, a set of first-order rules is automatically learned, which can capture the information of each individual mention in an entity, as well as the global information of the entity, to make coreference decision.",

        "These models aim to overcome the limitation that pairwise coreference decisions are made independently of each other.",
        "The simplest model conditions coref-erence on mention pairs, but enforces dependency by calculating the distance of a node to a partition (i.e., the probability that an active mention belongs to an entity) based on the sum of its distances to all the nodes in the partition (i.e., the sum of the probability of the active mention co-referring with the mentions in the entity).",
        "Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) has been applied to some natural language processing tasks, including parsing (Mooney, 1997), POS disambiguation (Cussens, 1996), lexicon construction (Claveau et al., 2003), WSD (Specia et al., 2007), and so on.",

        "examined the C4.5 algorithm which is widely used for the coreference resolution task.",
        "The first line of the table shows the baseline system that employs the traditional mention-pair model (MP) as described in Section 3.1.",
        "From the table, our baseline system achieves a recall of around 66%-68% and a precision of around 50%-60%.",
        "The overall F-measure 62.9% respectively.",
        "The results are comparable to those reported in (Ng, 2005) which uses similar features and gets an F-measure ranging in 50-60% for the same data set.",
        "As our system relies only on simple and knowledge-poor features, the achieved F-measure is around 2-4% lower than the state-of-the-art systems do, like (Ng, 2007) and (Yang and Su, 2007) which utilized sophisticated semantic or real-world knowledge.",
        "Since ILP has a strong capability in knowledge management, our system could be further improved if such helpful knowledge is incorporated, which will be explored in our future work.",
        "The second line of Table 4 is for the system that employs the entity-mention model (EM) with \"Any-X\" based entity features, as described in Section 3.2.",
        "We can find that the EM model does not show superiority over the baseline MP model.",
        "It achieves a higher precision (up to 2.6%), but a lower recall (2.9%), than MP.",
        "As a result, we only see ±0.4% difference between the F-measure.",
        "The results are consistent with the reports by Luo et al.",
        "(2004) that the entity-mention model with the \"Any-X\" first-order features performs worse than the normal mention-pair model.",
        "In our study, we also tested the \"Most-X\" strategy for the first-order features as in (Culotta et al., 2007), but got similar results without much difference (±0.5% F-measure) in performance.",
        "Besides, as with our entity-mention predicates described in Section 4.2, we also tried the \"All-X\" strategy for the entity-level agreement features, that is, whether all mentions in a partial entity agree in number and gender with an active mention.",
        "However, we found this bring no improvement against the \"Any-X\" strategy.",
        "As described, given an active mention mj, the MP model only considers the mentions between mj and its closest antecedent.",
        "By contrast, the EM model considers not only these mentions, but also their antecedents in the same entity link.",
        "We were interested in examining what if the MP model utilizes all the mentions in an entity as the EM model does.",
        "As shown in the third line of Table 4, such a solution damages the performance; while the recall is at the same level, the precision drops significantly (up to 12%) and as a result, the F-measure is even lower than the original MP model.",
        "This should be because a mention does not necessarily have direct corefer-ence relationships with all of its antecedents.",
        "As the MP model treats each mention-pair as an independent instance, including all the antecedents would produce many less-confident positive instances, and thus adversely affect training.",
        "The second block ofthe table summarizes the performance of the systems with ILP.",
        "We were first concerned with how well ILP works for the mention-pair model, compared with the normally used algorithm C4.5.",
        "From the results shown in the fourth line of Table 4, ILP exhibits the same capability in the resolution; it tends to produce a slightly higher precision but a lower recall than C4.5 does.",
        "Overall, it performs better in F-measure (1.8%) for Npaper, while slightly worse (<1%) for Nwire and BNews.",
        "These results demonstrate that ILP could be used as a good classifier learner for the mention-pair model.",
        "The fifth line of Table 4 is for the ILP based entity-mention model (described in Section 4.2).",
        "We can observe that the model leads to a better performance than all the other models.",
        "Compared with the system with the MP model (under ILP), the EM version is able to achieve a higher precision (up to 4.6% for BNews).",
        "Although the recall drops slightly (up to 1.8% for BNews), the gain in the precision could compensate it well; it beats the MP model in the overall F-measure for all three domains (2.3% for Nwire, 0.4% for Npaper, 1.4% for BNews).",
        "Especially, the improvement in NWire and BNews is statistically significant under a 2-tailed t test (p < 0.05).",
        "Compared with the EM model with the manually designed first-order feature (the second line), the ILP-based EM solution also yields better performance in precision (with a slightly lower recall) as well as the overall F-measure (1.0% - 1.8%).",
        "The improvement in precision against the mention-pair model confirms that the global information beyond a single mention pair, when being considered for training, can make coreference relations clearer and help classifier learning.",
        "The better performance against the EM model with heuristically designed features also suggests that ILP is able to learn effective first-order rules for the coreference resolution task.",
        "In Figure 1, we illustrate part of the rules produced by ILP for the entity-mention model (NWire domain), which shows how the relational knowledge of entities and mentions is represented for decision making.",
        "An interesting finding, as shown in the last rule of the table, is that multiple non-instantiated arguments (i.e. C and D) could possibly appear in the same rule.",
        "According to this rule, a pronominal mention should be linked with a partial entity which contains a named-entity and contains an indefinite NP in a subject position.",
        "This supports the claims in (Yang et al., 2004a) that coreferential information is an important factor to evaluate a candidate antecedent in pronoun resolution.",
        "Such complex logic makes it possible to capture information of multiple mentions in an entity at the same time, which is difficult to implemented in the mention-pair model and the ordinary entity-mention model with heuristic first-order features."

        "This paper presented an expressive entity-mention model for coreference resolution by using Inductive Logic Programming.",
        "In contrast to the traditional mention-pair model, our model can capture information beyond single mention pairs for both training and testing.",
        "The relational nature ofILP enables our model to explicitly express the relations between an entity and its mentions, and to automatically learn the first-order rules effective for the coreference resolution task.",
        "The evaluation on ACE data set shows that the ILP based entity-model performs better than the mention-pair model (with up to 2.3% increase in F-measure), and also beats the entity-mention model with heuristically designed first-order features.",
        "Our current work focuses on the learning model that calculates the probability of a mention belonging to an entity.",
        "For simplicity, we just use a greedy clustering strategy for resolution, that is, a mention is linked to the current best partial entity.",
        "In our future work, we would like to investigate more sophisticated clustering methods that would lead to global optimization, e.g., by keeping a large search space (Luo et al., 2004) or using integer programming (Denis and Baldridge, 2007).",
