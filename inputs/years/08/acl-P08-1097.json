        "When people communicate face-to-face, discourse cues are expressed simultaneously through multiple channels.",
        "Previous research has extensively studied how discourse cues correlate with lexico-syntactic and prosodic features (Hearst, 1994; Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1998; Passonneau and Litman, 1997); this work informs various text and speech processing applications, such as automatic summarization and segmentation.",
        "Gesture is another communicative modality that frequently accompanies speech, yet it has not been exploited for computational discourse analysis.",
        "This paper empirically demonstrates that gesture correlates with discourse structure.",
        "In particular, we show that automatically-extracted visual features can be combined with lexical cues in a statistical model to predict topic segmentation, a frequently studied form of discourse structure.",
        "Our method builds on the idea that coherent discourse segments are characterized by gestural cohesion; in other words, that such segments exhibit homogeneous gestural patterns.",
        "Lexical cohesion (Halliday and Hasan, 1976) forms the backbone of many verbal segmentation algorithms, on the theory that segmentation boundaries should be placed where the distribution of words changes (Hearst, 1994).",
        "With gestural cohesion, we explore whether the same idea holds for gesture features.",
        "The motivation for this approach comes from a series of psycholinguistic studies suggesting that gesture supplements speech with meaningful and unique semantic content (McNeill, 1992; Kendon, 2004).",
        "We assume that repeated patterns in gesture are indicative of the semantic coherence that characterizes well-defined discourse segments.",
        "An advantage of this view is that gestures can be brought to bear on discourse analysis without undertaking the daunting task of recognizing and interpreting individual gestures.",
        "This is crucial because coverbal gesture - unlike formal sign language - rarely follows any predefined form or grammar, and may vary dramatically by speaker.",
        "A key implementational challenge is automatically extracting gestural information from raw video and representing it in a way that can applied to discourse analysis.",
        "We employ a representation of visual codewords, which capture clusters of low-level motion patterns.",
        "For example, one codeword may correspond to strong left-right motion in the upper part of the frame.",
        "These codewords are then treated similarly to lexical items; our model identifies changes in their distribution, and predicts topic boundaries appropriately.",
        "The overall framework is implemented as a hierarchical Bayesian model, supporting flexible integration of multiple knowledge sources.",
        "Experimental results support the hypothesis that gestural cohesion is indicative of discourse structure.",
        "Applying our algorithm to a dataset of face-to-face dialogues, we find that gesture communicates unique information, improving segmentation performance over lexical features alone.",
        "The positive impact of gesture is most pronounced when automatically-recognized speech transcripts are used, but gestures improve performance by a significant margin even in combination with manual transcripts."

        "Gesture and discourse Much of the work on gesture in natural language processing has focused on multimodal dialogue systems in which the gestures and speech may be constrained, e.g. (Johnston, 1998).",
        "In contrast, we focus on improving discourse processing on unconstrained natural language between humans.",
        "This effort follows basic psychological and linguistic research on the communicative role of gesture (McNeill, 1992; Kendon, 2004), including some efforts that made use of automatically acquired visual features (Quek, 2003).",
        "We extend these empirical studies with a statistical model ofthe relationship between gesture and discourse segmentation.",
        "Hand-coded descriptions of body posture shifts and eye gaze behavior have been shown to correlate with topic and turn boundaries in task-oriented dialogue (Cassell et al., 2001).",
        "These findings are exploited to generate realistic conversational \"grounding\" behavior in an animated agent.",
        "The semantic content of gesture was leveraged - again, for gesture generation - in (Kopp et al., 2007), which presents an animated agent that is capable of augmenting navigation directions with gestures that describe the physical properties of landmarks along the route.",
        "Both systems generate plausible and human-like gestural behavior; we address the converse problem of interpreting such gestures.",
        "In this vein, hand-coded gesture features have been used to improve sentence segmentation, showing that sentence boundaries are unlikely to overlap gestures that are in progress (Chen et al., 2006).",
        "Features that capture the start and end of gestures are shown to improve sentence segmentation beyond lexical and prosodic features alone.",
        "This idea ofges-tural features as a sort of visual punctuation has parallels in the literature on prosody, which we discuss in the next subsection.",
        "Finally, ambiguous noun phrases can be resolved by examining the similarity of co-articulated gestures (Eisenstein and Davis, 2007).",
        "While noun phrase coreference can be viewed as a discourse processing task, we address the higher-level discourse phenomenon of topic segmentation.",
        "In addition, this prior work focused primarily on pointing gestures directed at preprinted visual aids.",
        "The current paper presents a new domain, in which speakers do not have access to visual aids.",
        "Thus pointing gestures are less frequent than \"iconic\" gestures, in which the form of motion is the principle communicative feature (McNeill, 1992).",
        "Non-textual features for topic segmentation Research on non-textual features for topic segmentation has primarily focused on prosody, under the assumption that a key prosodic function is to mark structure at the discourse level (Steedman, 1990; Grosz and Hirshberg, 1992; Swerts, 1997).",
        "The ultimate goal of this research is to find correlates of hierarchical discourse structure in phonetic features.",
        "Today, research on prosody has converged on prosodic cues which correlate with discourse structure.",
        "Such markers include pause duration, fundamental frequency, and pitch range manipulations (Grosz and Hirshberg, 1992; Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1998).",
        "These studies informed the development of applications such as segmentation tools for meeting analysis, e.g. (Tur et al., 2001; Galley et al., 2003).",
        "In comparison, the connection between gesture and discourse structure is a relatively unexplored area, at least with respect to computational approaches.",
        "One conclusion that emerges from our analysis is that gesture may signal discourse structure in a different way than prosody does: while specific prosodic markers characterize segment boundaries, gesture predicts segmentation through intra-segmental cohesion.",
        "The combination of these two modalities is an exciting direction for future research."

        "This section describes the process of building a representation that permits the assessment of gestural cohesion.",
        "The core signal-level features are based on spatiotemporal interest points, which provide a sparse representation of the motion in the video.",
        "At each interest point, visual, spatial, and kinematic characteristics are extracted and then concatenated into vectors.",
        "Principal component analysis (PCA) reduces the dimensionality to a feature vector of manageable size (Bishop, 2006).",
        "These feature vectors are then clustered, yielding a codebook of visual forms.",
        "This video processing pipeline is shown in Figure 1; the remainder of the section describes the individual steps in greater detail.",
        "Spatiotemporal interest points (Laptev, 2005) provide a sparse representation of motion in video.",
        "The idea is to select a few local regions that contain high information content in both the spatial and temporal dimensions.",
        "The image features at these regions should be relatively robust to lighting and perspective changes, and they should capture the relevant movement in the video.",
        "The set of spatiotemporal interest points thereby provides a highly compressed representation of the key visual features.",
        "Purely spatial interest points have been successful in a variety of image processing tasks (Lowe, 1999), and spatiotemporal interest points are beginning to show similar advantages for video processing (Laptev, 2005).",
        "The use of spatiotemporal interest points is specifically motivated by techniques from the computer vision domain of activity recognition (Efros et al., recognition is to classify video sequences into semantic categories: e.g., walking, running, jumping.",
        "As a simple example, consider the task of distinguishing videos of walking from videos of jumping.",
        "In the walking videos, the motion at most of the interest points will be horizontal, while in the jumping videos it will be vertical.",
        "Spurious vertical motion in a walking video is unlikely to confuse the classifier, as long as the majority of interest points move horizontally.",
        "The hypothesis of this paper is that just as such low-level movement features can be applied in a supervised fashion to distinguish activities, they can be applied in an unsupervised fashion to group co-speech gestures into perceptually meaningful clusters.",
        "The Activity Recognition Toolbox (Dollar et al., 2005) is used to detect spatiotemporal interest points for our dataset.",
        "This toolbox ranks interest points using a difference-of-Gaussians filter in the spatial dimension, and a set of Gabor filters in the temporal dimension.",
        "The total number of interest points extracted per video is set to equal the number of frames in the video.",
        "This bounds the complexity of the representation to be linear in the length of the video; however, the system may extract many interest points in some frames and none in other frames.",
        "Figure 2 shows the interest points extracted from a representative video frame from our corpus.",
        "Note that the system has identified high contrast regions of the gesturing hand.",
        "From manual inspection, the large majority of interest points extracted in our dataset capture motion created by hand gestures.",
        "Thus, for this dataset it is reasonable to assume that an interest point-based representation expresses the visual properties of the speakers' hand gestures.",
        "In videos containing other sources of motion, preprocessing may be required to filter out interest points that are extraneous to gestural communication.",
        "At each interest point, the temporal and spatial brightness gradients are constructed across a small space-time volume of nearby pixels.",
        "Brightness gradients have been used for a variety of problems in computer vision (Forsyth and Ponce, 2003), and provide a fairly general way to describe the visual appearance of small image patches.",
        "However, even for a small space-time volume, the resulting dimensionality is still quite large: a 10-by-10 pixel box across 5 video frames yields a 500-dimensional feature vector for each of the three gradients.",
        "For this reason, principal component analysis (Bishop, 2006) is used to reduce the dimensionality.",
        "The spatial location of the interest point is added to the final feature vector.",
        "This visual feature representation is substantially lower-level than the descriptions of gesture form found in both the psychology and computer science literatures.",
        "For example, when manually annotating gesture, it is common to employ a taxonomy of hand shapes and trajectories, and to describe the location with respect to the body and head (McNeill, 1992; Martell, 2005).",
        "Working withautomatic hand tracking, Quek (2003) automatically computes perceptually-salient gesture features, such as symmetric motion and oscillatory repetitions.",
        "In contrast, our feature representation takes the form of a vector of continuous values and is not easily interpretable in terms of how the gesture actually appears.",
        "However, this low-level approach offers several important advantages.",
        "Most critically, it requires no initialization and comparatively little tuning: it can be applied directly to any video with a fixed camera position and static background.",
        "Second, it is robust: while image noise may cause a few spurious interest points, the majority of interest points should still guide the system to an appropriate characterization of the gesture.",
        "In contrast, hand tracking can become irrevocably lost, requiring manual resets (Gavrila, 1999).",
        "Finally, the success of similar low-level interest point representations at the activity-recognition task provides reason for optimism that they may also be applicable to unsupervised gesture analysis.",
        "After extracting a set of low-dimensional feature vectors to characterize the visual appearance at each spatiotemporal interest point, it remains only to convert this into a representation amenable to a cohesion-based analysis.",
        "Using k-means clustering (Bishop, 2006), the feature vectors are grouped into codewords: a compact, lexicon-like representation of salient visual features in video.",
        "The number of clusters is a tunable parameter, though a systematic investigation of the role of this parameter is left for future work.",
        "Codewords capture frequently-occurring patterns of motion and appearance at a local scale - interest points that are clustered together have a similar visual appearance.",
        "Because most of the motion in our videos is gestural, the codewords that appear during a given sentence provide a succinct representation of the ongoing gestural activity.",
        "Distributions of codewords over time can be analyzed in similar terms to the distribution of lexical features.",
        "A change in the distribution of codewords indicates new visual kinematic elements entering the discourse.",
        "Thus, the codeword representation allows gestural cohesion to be assessed in much the same way as lexical cohesion."

        "For any given segmentation, the maximum-likelihood setting for p is found via a gradient-based search.",
        "This setting is then used to generate another segmentation, and the process is iterated until convergence, as in hard expectation-maximization.",

        "This research shows a novel relationship between gestural cohesion and discourse structure.",
        "Automatically extracted gesture features are predictive ofdis-course segmentation when used in isolation; when lexical information is present, segmentation performance is further improved.",
        "This suggests that gestures provide unique information not present in the lexical features alone, even when perfect transcripts are available.",
        "There are at least two possibilities for how gesture might impact topic segmentation: \"visual punctuation,\" and cohesion.",
        "The visual punctuation view would attempt to identify specific gestural patterns that are characteristic of segment boundaries.",
        "This is analogous to research that identifies prosodic signatures of topic boundaries, such as (Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1998).",
        "By design, our model is incapable of exploiting such phenomena, as our goal is to investigate the notion of gestural cohesion.",
        "Thus, the performance gains demonstrated in this paper cannot be explained by such punctuation-like phenomena; we believe that they are due to the consistent gestural themes that characterize coherent topics.",
        "However, we are interested in pursuing the idea of visual punctuation in the future, so as to compare the power of visual punctuation and gestural cohesion to predict segment boundaries.",
        "In addition, the interaction of gesture and prosody suggests additional possibilities for future research.",
        "The videos in the dataset for this paper are focused on the description of physical devices and events, leading to a fairly concrete set of gestures.",
        "In other registers of conversation, gestural form may be driven more by spatial metaphors, or may consist mainly of temporal \"beats.\"",
        "In such cases, the importance of gestural cohesion for discourse segmentation may depend on the visual expressivity of the speaker.",
        "We plan to examine the extensibility of gesture cohesion to more naturalistic settings, such as classroom lectures.",
        "Finally, topic segmentation provides only an outline of the discourse structure.",
        "Richer models of discourse include hierarchical structure (Grosz and Sid-ner, 1986) and Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and Thompson, 1988).",
        "The application of gestural analysis to such models may lead to fruitful areas of future research."
