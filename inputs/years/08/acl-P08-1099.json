        "This is accomplished by using generalized expectation criteria to express a preference for parameter settings in which the model's distribution on unlabeled data matches a target distribution.",

        "(2002) who present a method in which features are annotated with their associated majority labels and this information is used to bootstrap a parameterized text classification model.",
        "Unlike the model presented in this paper, they require some labeled data in order to train their model.",
        "This type of input information (features + majority label) is a powerful and flexible model for specifying alternative inputs to a classifier, and has been additionally used by Haghighi and Klein (2006).",
        "In that work, \"prototype\" features – words with their associated labels – are used to train a generative MRF sequence model.",
        "Their probability model can be formally described as:",
        "Although the partition function must be computed over all ( x, y) tuples, learning via EM in this model is possible because ofapproximations made in computing the partition function.",

        "Mann and McCallum (2007) introduce a special case of GE, label regularization, and demonstrate its effectiveness for training maximum entropy classifiers.",
        "In label regularization, the model prefers parameter settings in which the model's predicted label distribution on the unsupervised data match a target distribution.",
        "Note that supervision here consists of the the full distribution over labels (i.e. conditioned on the maximum entropy \"default feature\"), instead of simply the majority label.",
        "Druck et al.",
        "(2007) also use GE with full distributions for semi-supervised learning of maximum entropy models, except here the distributions are on labels conditioned on features.",
        "In Section 4 we describe how GE criteria can be applied to CRFs given conditional probability distributions of labels given features.",
        "Another recent method that has been proposed for training sequence models with constraints is Chang et al.",
        "(2007).",
        "They use constraints for approximate EM training of an HMM, incorporating the constraints by looking only at the top K most-likely sequences from a joint model of likelihood and the constraints.",
        "This model can be applied to the combination of labeled and unlabeled instances, but cannot be applied in situations where only labeled features are available.",
        "Additionally, our model can be easily combined with other semi-supervised criteria, such as entropy regularization.",
        "Finally, their model is a generative HMM which cannot handle the rich, non-independent feature sets that are available to a CRF.",
        "There have been relatively few different approaches to CRF semi-supervised training.",
        "One approach has been that proposed in both Miller et al.",
        "(2004) and Freitag (2004), uses distributional clustering to induce features from a large corpus, and then uses these features to augment the feature space of the labeled data.",
        "Since this is an orthogonal method for improving accuracy it can be combined with many of the other methods discussed above, and indeed we have obtained positive preliminary experimental results with GE criteria (not reported on here).",
        "Another method for semi-supervised CRF training is entropy regularization, initially proposed by Grandvalet and Bengio (2004) and extended to linear-chain CRFs by Jiao et al.",

        "High values of A fall into the minimal entropy trap, while low values of A have no effect on the model (see (Jiao et al., 2006) for an example).",
        "When some instances have partial labelings (i.e. labels for some of their tokens), it is possible to train CRFs via expected gradient methods (Salakhutdinov et al., 2003).",

        "(2007) for hidden-state conditional random fields, and can be equally applied to semi-supervised conditional random fields.",
        "Note, however, that labeling variables of a structured instance (e.g. tokens) is different than labeling features – being both more coarse-grained and applying supervision narrowly only to the individual subpart, not to all places in the data where the feature occurs.",
        "Finally, there are some methods that use auxiliary tasks for training sequence models, though they do not train linear-chain CRFs per se.",
        "Ando and Zhang (2005) include a cluster discovery step into the supervised training.",
        "Smith and Eisner (2005) use neighborhoods of related instances to figure out what makes found instances \"good\".",

        "Assuming that labeling one token in isolation takes the same time as labeling one token in a sequence, these results strongly support a new paradigm of labeling in which instead of annotating entire sentences, the human instead selects some key features of interest and labels tokens that have this feature.",
