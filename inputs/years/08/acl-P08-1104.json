        "Nowadays, team work plays a more important role than ever in problem solving.",
        "For instance, within an enterprise, people handle new problems usually by leveraging the knowledge of experienced colleagues.",
        "Similarly, within research communities, novices step into a new research area often by learning from well-established researchers in the research area.",
        "All these scenarios involve asking the questions like \"who is an expert on X?\"",
        "or \"who knows about X?\"",
        "Such questions, which cannot be answered easily through traditional document search, raise a new requirement of searching people with certain expertise.",
        "To meet that requirement, a new task, called expert search, has been proposed and studied intensively.",
        "For example, TREC 2005, 2006, and 2007 provide the task of expert search within the enterprise track.",
        "In the TREC setting, expert search is defined as: given a query, a ranked list of experts is returned.",
        "In this paper, we engage our study in the same setting.",
        "Many approaches to expert search have been proposed by the participants of TREC and other researchers.",
        "These approaches include metadata extraction (Cao et al., 2005), expert profile building (Craswell, 2001, Fu et al., 2007), data fusion (Maconald and Ounis, 2006), query expansion (Macdonald and Ounis, 2007), hierarchical language model (Petkova and Croft, 2006), and formal model generation (Balog et al., 2006; Fang et al., 2006).",
        "However, all of them conduct expert search with what we call a coarse-grained approach.",
        "The discovering and use of evidence for expert locating is carried out under a grain of document.",
        "With it, further improvements on expert search are hard to achieve.",
        "This is because different blocks (or segments) of electronic documents usually present different functions and qualities and thus different impacts for expert locating.",
        "In contrast, this paper is concerned with proposing a probabilistic model for fine-grained expert search.",
        "In fine-grained expert search, we are to extract and use evidence of expert search (usually blocks of documents) directly.",
        "Thus, the proposed probabilistic model incorporates evidence of expert search explicitly as a part of it.",
        "A piece of finegrained evidence is formally defined as a quadruple, <topic, person, relation, document>, which denotes the fact that a topic and a person, with a certain relation between them, are found in a specific document.",
        "The intuition behind the quadruple is that a query may be matched with phrases in various forms (denoted as topic here) and an expert candidate may appear with various name masks (denoted as person here), e.g., full name, email, or abbreviated names.",
        "Given a topic and person, relation type is used to measure their closeness and document serves as a context indicating whether it is good evidence.",
        "Our proposed model for fine-grained expert search results in an implementation of two stages.",
        "1) Evidence Extraction: document segments in various granularities are identified and evidences are extracted from them.",
        "For example, we can have segments in which an expert candidate and a queried topic co-occur within a same section of docu-ment-001: \"...later, Berners-Lee describes a semantic web search engine experience...\" As the result, we can extract an evidence by using same-section relation, i.e., <semantic web search engine, Berners-Lee, same-section, document-001>.",
        "2) Evidence Quality Evaluation: the quality (or reliability) of evidence is evaluated.",
        "The quality of a quadruple of evidence consists of four aspects, namely topic-matching quality, person-name-matching quality, relation quality, and document quality.",
        "If we regard evidence as link of expert candidate and queried topic, the four aspects will correspond to the strength of the link to query, the strength of the link to expert candidate, the type of the link, and the document context of the link respectively.",
        "All the evidences with their scores of quality are merged together to generate a single score for each expert candidate with regard to a given query.",
        "We empirically evaluate our proposed model and implementation on the W3C corpus which is used in the expert search task at TREC 2005 and 2006.",
        "Experimental results show that both explored evidences and evaluation of evidence quality can improve the expert search significantly.",
        "Compared with existing state-of-the-art expert search methods, the probabilistic model for fine-grained expert search shows promising improvement.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 surveys existing studies on expert search.",
        "Section 3 and Section 4 present the proposed probabilistic model and its implementation, respectively.",
        "Section 5 gives the empirical evaluation.",
