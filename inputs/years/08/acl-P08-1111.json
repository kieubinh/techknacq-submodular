        "This paper evaluates the LinGO Grammar Matrix, a cross-linguistic resource for the development of precision broad coverage grammars, by applying it to the Australian language Wambaya.",
        "Despite large typological differences between Wambaya and the languages on which the development of the resource was based, the Grammar Matrix is found to provide a significant jump-start in the creation of the grammar for Wambaya: With less than 5.5 person-weeks of development, the Wambaya grammar was able to assign correct semantic representations to 76% of the sentences in a naturally occurring text.",
        "While the work on Wambaya identified some areas of refinement for the Grammar Matrix, 59% of the Matrix-provided types were invoked in the final Wambaya grammar, and only 4% of the Matrix-provided types required modification."

        "Hand-built grammars are often dismissed as too expensive to build on the one hand, and too brittle on the other.",
        "Nevertheless, they are key to various NLP applications, including those benefiting from deep natural language understanding (e.g., textual inference (Bobrow et al., 2007)), generation of well-formed output (e.g., natural language weather alert systems (Lareau and Wanner, 2007)) or both (as in machine translation (Oepen et al., 2007)).",
        "Of particular interest here are applications concerning endangered languages: Endangered languages represent a case of minimal linguistic resources, typically lacking even moderately-sized corpora, let alone treebanks.",
        "In the best case, one finds well-crafted descriptive grammars, bilingual dictionaries, and a handful of translated texts.",
        "The methods of precision grammar engineering are well-suited to taking advantage of such resources.",
        "At the same time, the applications of interest in the context of endangered languages emphasize linguistic precision: implemented grammars can be used to enrich existing linguistic documentation, to build grammar checkers in the context of language standardization, and to create software language tutors in the context of language preservation efforts.",
        "The LinGO Grammar Matrix (Bender et al., 2002; Bender and Flickinger, 2005; Drellishak and Bender, 2005) is a toolkit for reducing the cost of creating broad-coverage precision grammars by prepackaging both a cross-linguistic core grammar and a series of libraries of analyses of cross-linguistically variable phenomena, such as major-constituent word order or question formation.",
        "The Grammar Matrix was developed initially on the basis of broad-coverage grammars for English (Flickinger, 2000) and Japanese (Siegel and Bender, 2002), and has since been extended and refined as it has been used in the development of broad-coverage grammars for Norwegian (Hellan and Haugereid, 2003), Modern Greek (Kordoni and Neu, 2005), and Spanish (Ma-rimon et al., 2007), as well as being applied to 42 other languages from a variety of language families in a classroom context (Bender, 2007).",
        "This paper aims to evaluate both the utility of the Grammar Matrix in jump-starting precision grammar development and the current state of its cross-linguistic hypotheses through a case study of a language typologically very different from any of the languages above: the non-Pama-Nyungan Australian language Wambaya (Nordlinger, 1998).",
        "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: ยง2 provides background on the Grammar Matrix and Wambaya, and situates the project with respect to related work.",
        "ยง3 presents the implemented grammar of Wambaya, describes its development, and evaluates it against unseen, naturally occurring text.",
        "ยง4 uses the Wambaya grammar and its development as one point ofreference to measure the usefulness and cross-linguistic validity of the Grammar Matrix.",

      "text": [
        "The LinGO Grammar Matrix is situated theoretically within Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG; Pollard and Sag, 1994), a lexicalist, constraint-based framework.",
        "Grammars in HPSG are expressed as a collection of typed feature structures which are arranged into a hierarchy such that information shared across multiple lexical entries or construction types is represented only on a single supertype.",
        "The Matrix is written in the TDL (type description language) formalism, which is interpreted by the LKB parser, generator, and grammar development environment (Copestake, 2002).",
        "It is compatible with the broader range of DELPH-IN tools, e.g., for machine translation (Lonning and Oepen, 2006), treebanking (Oepen et al., 2004) and parse selection (Toutanova et al., 2005).",
        "The Grammar Matrix consists of a cross-linguistic core type hierarchy and a collection of phenomenon-specific libraries.",
        "The core type hierarchy defines the basic feature geometry, the ways that heads combine with arguments and adjuncts, linking types for relating syntactic to semantic arguments, and the constraints required to compositionally build up semantic representations in the format of Minimal Recursion Semantics (Copestake et al., 2005; Flickinger and Bender, 2003).",
        "The libraries provide collections of analyses for cross-linguistically variable phenomena.",
        "The current libraries include analyses of major constituent word order (SOV, SVO, etc), sentential negation, coordination, and yes-no question formation.",
        "The Matrix is accessed through a web-based configuration system which elicits typological information from the user-linguist through a questionnaire and then outputs a grammar consisting of the Matrix core plus selected types and constraints from the libraries according to the specifications in the questionnaire.",
        "Wambaya is a recently extinct language of the West Barkly family from the Northern Territory in Australia (Nordlinger, 1998).",
        "Wambaya was selected for this project because of its typological properties and because it is extraordinarily well-documented by Nordlinger in her 1998 descriptive grammar.",
        "Perhaps the most striking feature of Wambaya is its word order: it is a radically non-configurational language with a second position auxiliary/clitic cluster.",
        "That is, aside from the constraint that verbal clauses require a clitic cluster (marking subject and object agreement and tense, aspect and mood) in second position, the word order is otherwise free, to the point that noun phrases can be non-contiguous, with head nouns and their modifiers separated by unrelated words.",
        "Furthermore, head nouns are generally not required: argument positions can be instantiated by modifiers only, or, if the referent is clear from the context, by no nominal constituent of any kind.",
        "It has a rich system of case marking, and ad-nominal modifiers agree with the heads they modify in case, number, and four genders.",
        "An example is (1) Ngaragana-nguja ngiy-a grog-PROP.IV.ACC 3.SG.NM.A-PST gujinganjanga-ni jiyawu ngabulu.",
        "mother.ii.ERG give milk.iv.ACC",
        "In (1), ngaragana-nguja ('grog-proprietive', or 'having grog') is a modifier of ngabulu milk.",
        "They agree in case (accusative) and gender (class IV), but they are not contiguous within the sentence.",
        "To relate such discontinuous noun phrases to appropriate semantic representations where 'having-",
        "and ACC and ERG indicate case.",
        "A stands for 'agent', PST for 'past', and PROP for 'proprietive'.",
        "grog' and 'milk' are predicated of the same entity requires a departure from the ordinary way that heads are combined with arguments and modifiers combined with heads in HPSG in general and in the Matrix in particular.",
        "In the Grammar Matrix, as in most work in HPSG, lexical heads record the dependents they require in valence lists (subj, comps, s pr).",
        "When a head combines with one of its arguments, the result is a phrase with the same valence requirements as the head daughter, minus the one corresponding to the argument that was just satisfied.",
        "In contrast, the project described here has explored a non-cancellation analysis for Wambaya: even after a head combines with one of its arguments, that argument remains on the appropriate valence list of the mother, so that it is visible for further combination with modifiers.",
        "In addition, heads can combine directly with modifiers of their arguments (as opposed to just modifiers of themselves).",
        "Argument realization and the combination of heads and modifiers are fairly fundamental aspects of the system implemented in the Matrix.",
        "In light of the departure described above, it is interesting to see to what extent the Matrix can still support rapid development of a precision grammar for Wambaya.",
        "There are currently many multilingual grammar engineering projects under active development, including ParGram, (Butt et al., 2002; King et al., 2007) .",
        "Among approaches to multilingual grammar engineering, the Grammar Matrix's distinguishing characteristics include the deployment of a shared core grammar for crosslinguistically consistent constraints and a series of libraries modeling varying linguistic properties.",
        "Thus while other work has successfully exploited grammar porting between typologically related languages (e.g., Kim et al., 2003), to my knowledge, no other grammar porting project has covered the same typological distance attempted here.",
        "The current project is also situated within a broader trend of using computational linguistics in the service of endangered language documentation (e.g., Robinson et al., 2007, see also www.emeld.org)."

        "With no prior knowledge of this language beyond its most general typological properties, we were able to develop in under 5.5 person-weeks of development time (210 hours) a grammar able to assign appropriate analyses to 91% of the examples in the development set.",
        "The 210 hours include 25 hours of an RA's time entering lexical entries, 7 hours spent preparing the development test suite, and 15 hours treebanking (using the LinGO Redwoods software (Oepen et al., 2004) to annotate the intended parse for each item).",
        "The remainder of the time was ordinary grammar development work.",
        "In addition, this grammar has relatively low ambiguity, assigning on average 11.89 parses per item in the development set.",

        "The non-branching nodes at the bottom of the tree represent the lexical rules which associate morphosyntactic information with a word according to its suffixes.",

        "The former is in some sense a measure of the usefulness of the Matrix, and the latter is a measure of its correctness.",

        "While further development of the Wambaya grammar might make use of some of the remaining 41% of the types, this work suggests that there is a substantial amount of information in the Matrix core type hierarchy which would better be stored as part of the typological libraries.",

        "The short development time required to create the Wambaya grammar presents a qualitative evaluation of the Grammar Matrix as a crosslinguistic resource, as one goal of the Grammar Matrix is to reduce the cost of developing precision grammars.",
        "The fact that a grammar capable of assigning valid analyses to an interesting portion of sentences from naturally occurring text could be developed in less than 5.5 person-weeks of effort suggests that this goal is indeed met.",
        "This is particularly encouraging in the case of endangered and other resource-poor languages.",
        "A grammar such as the one described here could be a significant aide in analyzing additional texts as they are collected, and in identifying constructions that have not yet been analyzed (cf. Baldwin et al., 2005)."

        "This paper has presented a precision, hand-built grammar for the Australian language Wambaya, and through that grammar a case study evaluation of the LinGO Grammar Matrix.",
        "True validation of the Matrix qua hypothesized linguistic universals requires many more such case studies, but this first test is promising.",
        "Even though Wambaya is in some respects very different from the well-studied languages on which the Matrix is based, the existing machinery otherwise worked quite well, providing a significant jump-start to the grammar development process.",
        "While the Wambaya grammar has a long way to go to reach the complexity and range of linguistic phenomena handled by, for example, the LinGO English Resource Grammar, it was shown to provide analyses of an interesting portion of a naturally occurring text.",
        "This suggests that the methodology of building such grammars could be profitably incorporated into language documentation efforts.",
        "The Grammar Matrix allows new grammars to directly leverage the expertise in grammar engineering gained in extensive work on previous grammars of better-studied languages.",
        "Furthermore, the design of the Matrix is such that it is not a static object, but intended to evolve and be refined as more languages are brought into its purview.",
        "Generalizing the core hierarchy and libraries of the Matrix to support languages like Wambaya can extend its typological reach and further its development as an investigation in computational linguistic typology."
