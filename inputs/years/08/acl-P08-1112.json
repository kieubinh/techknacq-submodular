        "The general framework for the extended EM algorithm with posterior constraints of this type was proposed by (Graca et al., 2008).",
        "Our contribution is a large scale evaluation of this methodology for word alignments, an investigation of how the produced alignments differ and how they can be used to consistently improve machine translation performance (as measured by BLEU score) across many languages on training corpora with up to hundred thousand sentences.",

        "This trend continues as we lower the amount of training data further.",
        "We see a similar trend with other corpora.",
        "Our next set of experiments look at our performance in both directions across our 6 corpora, when we have small to moderate amounts of training data: for the language pairs with more than 100,000 sentences, we use only the first 100,000 sentences.",

        "The small corpora for which our models do not perform as well as GIZA are the ones with a lot of rare words.",
        "We suspect that the reason for this is that we do not implement smoothing, which has been shown to be important, especially in situations with a lot of rare words.",

        "Results are after MERT optimization.",
        "The marks (++)and(+)denote that agreement with posterior decoding is better by 1 BLEU point and 0.25 BLEU points respectively than the best baseline HMM model; analogously for ( ), (-); while (^denotes smaller differences.",
        "For four of the corpora we have more than 100 thousand sentences.",
        "The performance of the systems on all the data is shown in Table 3.",
        "German is not included because MERT optimization did not complete in time.",
        "We see that even on over a million instances, our model sometimes performs better than GIZA model 4, and always performs better than the baseline HMM."
