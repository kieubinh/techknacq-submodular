        "There have been two approaches to finding such parenthetical translations.",
        "One is to assume that the English term eie2-en is given and use a search engine to retrieve text snippets containing eie2-enfrom predominately non-English web pages (Na-gata et al., 2001, Kwok et al., 2005).",
        "Another method (Cao et al., 2007) is to go through a non-English corpus and collect all instances that match the parenthetical pattern in (4).",

        "Extraction of parenthetical translations need only determine the first pre-parenthesis word aligned with an in-parenthesis word, whereas word alignment requires the respective linking of all such (pre,in)-parenthesis word pairs.",

        "Given these alignments, the left boundary of the translated Chinese term is simply the leftmost word that is linked to one of the English words.",

        "Word alignment is a well-studied topic in Machine Translation with many algorithms having been proposed (Brown et al., 1993; Och and Ney 2003).",
        "We used a modified version of one of the simplest word alignment algorithms called Competitive Linking (Melamed, 2000).",
        "The algorithm assumes that there is a score associated with each pair of words in a bi-text.",
        "It sorts the word pairs in descending order of their scores, selecting pairs based on the resultant order.",
        "A pair of words is linked if none of the two words were previously linked to any other words.",
        "The algorithm terminates when there are no more links to make.",
        "Tiedemann (2004) compared a variety of alignment algorithms and found Competitive Linking to have one of the highest precision scores.",
        "A disadvantage of Competitive Linking, however, is that the alignments are restricted word-to-word alignments, which implies that multi-word expressions can only be partially linked at best.",
        "We made a small change to Competitive Linking to allow consecutive sequence of words on one side to be linked to the same word on the other side.",
        "Specifically, instead of requiring both ei and f to have no previous linkages, we only require that at least one of them be unlinked and that (suppose ei is unlinked and fj is linked to ek) none of the words between ei and ek be linked to any word other than fj.",
        "We used cp (Gale and Church, 1991) as the link score in the modified competitive linking algorithm, although there are many other possible choices for the link scores, such as % (Zhang, S.",
        "and discriminatively trained weights (Taskar et al., 2005).",
        "The p statistics for a pair of words ei and fj is computed as a is the number of sentence pairs containing both ei a+b is the number of sentence pairs containing a+c is the number of sentence pairs containing f; d is the number of sentence pairs containing neither ei nor fj.",
        "The p score ranges from 0 to 1.",
        "We set a threshold at 0.001, below which the cp scores are treated as 0.",
        "Since only the last few Chinese words in a candidate pair are expected to be translated, there should be a preference for linking the words towards the end of the Chinese text.",
        "One advantage of Competitive Linking is that it is quite easy to introduce such preferences into the algorithm, by using the word positions to break ties of the c scores when sorting the word pairs.",
        "Many of the parenthetical translations involve proper names, which are often transliterated according to the sound.",
        "Word alignment algorithms have generally ignored syllable-level regularities in transliterated terms.",
        "Consider again the Shapiro example in the introduction section.",
        "There are numerous correct transliterations for the same English word, some of which are not very frequent.",
        "For example, the word E^mhappens to have a similar cp score with Shapiro as the word $ftM (fluency), which is totally unrelated to Shapiro but happened to have the same co-occurrence statistics in the (partially) parallel corpus.",
        "Previous approaches to parenthetical translations relied on specialized algorithms to deal with transliterations (Cao et al., 2007; Jiang et al., 2007; Wu and Chang, 2007).",
        "They convert Chinese words into their phonetic representations (Pinyin) and use the known transliterations in a bilingual dictionary to train a transliteration model.",
        "We adopted a simpler approach that does not require any additional resources such as pronunciation dictionaries and bilingual dictionaries.",
        "In addition to computing the c scores between words, we also compute the c scores of prefixes and suffixes of Chinese and English words.",
        "For both languages, the prefix of a word is defined as the first three bytes of the word and the suffix is defined as the last three bytes.",
        "Since we used UTF-8 encoding, the first and last three bytes of a Chinese word, except in very rare cases, correspond to the first and last Chinese character of the word.",
        "Table 4 lists the English prefixes and suffixes that have the highest c scores with the Chinese prefix Kand suffix'^.",
        "In our modified version of the competitive linking algorithm, the link score of a pair of words is the sum of the c scores of the words themselves, their prefixes and their suffixes.",
        "In addition to syllable-level correspondences in transliterations, the c scores of prefixes and suffixes can also capture correlations in morphologically composed words.",
        "For example, the Chinese prefix H (three) has a relatively high cp score with the English prefix tri.",
        "Such scores enable word alignments to be made that may otherwise be missed.",
        "Consider the following text snippet:",
        "The correct translation for triaziflam isHlf #tl|LM .",
        "However, the Chinese term is segmented as H + P|t + i^M.",
        "The association betweenH (three) and triaziflam is very weak because His a very frequent word, whereas triaziflam is an extremely rare word.",
        "With the addition of the c score between Hand tri, we were able to correctly establish the connection between triaziflam and H.",
        "It turns out to be quite effective to assume prefixes and suffixes of words consist of three bytes, despite its apparent simplicity.",
        "The benefit of c scores for prefixes and suffixes is not limited to morphemes that happen to be three bytes long.",
