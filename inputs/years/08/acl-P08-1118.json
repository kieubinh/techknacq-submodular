        "In this paper, we seek to understand the ways contradictions occur across texts and describe a system for automatically detecting such constructions.",

        "Consider applying a contradiction detection system to political candidate debates: by drawing attention to topics in which candidates have conflicting positions, the system could enable voters to make more informed choices between candidates and sift through the amount of available information.",
        "Contradiction detection could also be applied to intelligence reports, demonstrating which information may need further verification.",

        "We provide a definition of contradiction suitable for NLP tasks, as well as a collection of contradiction corpora.",
        "Analyzing these data, we find contradiction is a rare phenomenon that may be created in different ways; we propose a typology of contradiction classes and tabulate their frequencies.",
        "Contradictions arise from relatively obvious features such as antonymy, negation, or numeric mismatches.",
        "They also arise from complex differences in the structure of assertions, discrepancies based on world-knowledge, and lexical contrasts.",
        "(1) Police specializing in explosives defused the rockets.",
        "Some 100 people were working inside the plant.",
        "(2) 100 people were injured.",
        "This pair is contradictory: defused rockets cannot go off, and thus cannot injure anyone.",
        "Detecting contradictions appears to be a harder task than detecting entailments.",
        "Here, it is relatively easy to identify the lack of entailment: the first sentence involves no injuries, so the second is unlikely to be entailed.",
        "Most entailment systems function as weak proof theory (Hickl et al., 2006; MacCartney et al., 2006; Zan-zotto et al., 2007), but contradictions require deeper inferences and model building.",
        "While mismatching information between sentences is often a good cue of non-entailment (Vanderwende et al., 2006), it is not sufficient for contradiction detection which requires more precise comprehension of the consequences of sentences.",
        "Assessing event coreference is also essential: for texts to contradict, they must refer to the same event.",
        "The importance of event coreference was recognized in the MUC information extraction tasks in which it was key to identify scenarios related to the same event (Humphreys et al., 1997).",
        "Recent work in text understanding has not focused on this issue, but it must be tackled in a successful contradiction system.",

        "Contradictions may arise from a number of different constructions, some overt and others that are complex even for humans to detect.",
        "Analyzing contradiction corpora (see section 3.3), we find two primary categories of contradiction: (1) those occurring via antonymy, negation, and date/number mismatch, which are relatively simple to detect, and (2) contradictions arising from the use of factive or modal words, structural and subtle lexical contrasts, as well as world knowledge (WK).",

        "Our system is based on the stage architecture of the Stanford RTE system (MacCartney et al., 2006), but adds a stage for event coreference decision.",
        "The first stage computes linguistic representations containing information about the semantic content of the passages.",
        "The text and hypothesis are converted to typed dependency graphs produced by the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003; de Marneffe et al., 2006).",
        "To improve the dependency graph as a pseudo-semantic representation, collocations in WordNet and named entities are collapsed, causing entities and multiword relations to become single nodes.",
        "The second stage provides an alignment between text and hypothesis graphs, consisting of a mapping from each node in the hypothesis to a unique node in the text or to null.",
        "The scoring measure uses node similarity (irrespective of polarity) and structural information based on the dependency graphs.",
        "Similarity measures and structural information are combined via weights learned using the passive-aggressive online learning algorithm MIRA (Crammer and Singer, 2001).",
        "Alignment weights were learned using manually annotated RTE development sets (see Chambers et al., 2007).",
        "Contradiction features are extracted based on mismatches between the text and hypothesis.",
        "Therefore, we must first remove pairs of sentences which do not describe the same event, and thus cannot be contradictory to one another.",
        "In the following example, it is necessary to recognize that Pluto's moon is not the same as the moon Titan; otherwise conflicting diameters result in labeling the pair a contradiction.",
        "T: Pluto's moon, which is only about 25 miles in diameter, was photographed 13 years ago.",
        "H: The moon Titan has a diameter of 5100 kms.",
        "This issue does not arise for textual entailment: elements in the hypothesis not supported by the text lead to non-entailment, regardless of whether the same event is described.",
        "For contradiction, however, it is critical to filter unrelated sentences to avoid finding false evidence of contradiction when there is contrasting information about different events.",
        "Given the structure of RTE data, in which the hypotheses are shorter and simpler than the texts, one straightforward strategy for detecting coreferent events is to check whether the root of the hypothesis graph is aligned in the text graph.",
        "However, some RTE hypotheses are testing systems' abilities to detect relations between entities (e.g., John of IBM... â€“ John works for IBM).",
        "Thus, we do not filter verb roots that are indicative of such relations.",
        "As shown in table 4, this strategy improves results on RTE data.",
        "For real world data, however, the assumption of directionality made in this strategy is unfounded, and we cannot assume that one sentence will be short and the other more complex.",
        "Assuming two sentences of comparable complexity, we hypothesize that modeling topicality could be used to assess whether the sentences describe the same event.",
        "There is a continuum of topicality from the start to the end of a sentence (Firbas, 1971).",
        "We thus originally defined the topicality of an NP by nw where n is the nth NP in the sentence.",
        "Additionally, we accounted for multiple clauses by weighting each clause equally; in example 4 in table 1, Australia receives the same weight as Prime Minister because each begins a clause.",
        "However, this weighting was not supported empirically, and we thus use a simpler, unweighted model.",
        "The topicality score of a sentence is calculated as a normalized score across all aligned NPs.",
        "The text and hypothesis are topically related if either sentence score is above a tuned threshold.",
        "Modeling topicality provides an additional improvement in precision (table 4).",

        "One significant issue in contradiction detection is lack of feature generalization.",
        "This problem is especially apparent for items in category (2) requiring lexical and world knowledge, which proved to be the most difficult contradictions to detect on a broad scale.",
        "While we are able to find certain specific relationships in the development sets, these features attained only limited coverage.",
        "Many contradictions in this category require multiple inferences and remain beyond our capabilities:",
        "T: The Auburn High School Athletic Hall of Fame recently introduced its Class of 2005 which includes 10 members.",

        "Of the types of contradictions in category (2), we are best at addressing those formed via structural differences and factive/modal constructions as shown in table 6.",
        "For instance, we detect examples 5 and 6 in table 1.",
        "However, creating features with sufficient precision is an issue for these types of contradictions.",
        "Intuitively, two sentences that have aligned verbs with the same subject and different objects (or vice versa) are contradictory.",
        "This indeed indicates a contradiction 55% of the time on our development sets, but this is not high enough precision given the rarity of contradictions.",
        "Another type of contradiction where precision falters is numeric mismatch.",

        "Our system detects a mismatch between 32 percent and 12 percent, ignoring the fact that one refers to profit and the other to orders.",
        "Accounting for context requires extensive text comprehension; it is not enough to simply look at whether the two numbers are headed by similar words (grew and increase).",
        "This emphasizes the fact that mismatching information is not sufficient to indicate contradiction.",
        "As demonstrated by our 63% accuracy on Neg_test, we are reasonably good at detecting negation and correctly ascertaining whether it is a symptom of contradiction.",
        "Similarly, we handle single word antonymy with high precision (78.9%).",
        "Nevertheless, Harabagiu et al.",
        "'s performance demonstrates that further improvement on these types is possible; indeed, they use more sophisticated techniques to extract oppositional terms and detect polarity differences.",
        "Thus, detecting category (1) contradictions is feasible with current systems.",
        "While these contradictions are only a third of those in the RTE datasets, detecting such contradictions accurately would solve half of the problems found in the real corpus.",
        "This suggests that we may be able to gain sufficient traction on contradiction detection for real world applications.",
        "Even so, category (2) contradictions must be targeted to detect many of the most interesting examples and to solve the entire problem of contradiction detection.",
        "Some types of these contradictions, such as lexical and world knowledge, are currently beyond our grasp, but we have demonstrated that progress may be made on the structure and factive/modal types.",
