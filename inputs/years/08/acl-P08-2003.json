        "After having made substantial headway in factoid and list questions, researchers have turned their attention to more complex information needs that cannot be answered by simply extracting named entities like persons, organizations, locations, dates, etc.",
        "Unlike informationally-simple factoid questions, complex questions often seek multiple different types of information simultaneously and do not presupposed that one single answer could meet all of its information needs.",
        "For example, with complex questions like \"What are the causes of AIDS?\", the wider focus of this question suggests that the submitter may not have a single or well-defined information need and therefore may be amenable to receiving additional supporting information that is relevant to some (as yet) undefined informational goal.",
        "This type of questions require inferencing and synthesizing information from multiple documents.",
        "In Natural Language Processing (NLP), this information synthesis can be seen as a kind of topic-oriented, informative multi-document summarization, where the goal is to produce a single text as a compressed version of a set of documents with a minimum loss of relevant information.",
        "Recently, the graph-based method (LexRank) is applied successfully to generic, multi-document summarization (Erkan and Radev, 2004).",
        "A topic-sensitive LexRank is proposed in (Otterbacher et al., 2005).",
        "In this method, a sentence is mapped to a vector in which each element represents the occurrence frequency (TF*IDF) of a word.",
        "However, the major limitation of the TF*IDF approach is that it only retains the frequency of the words and does not take into account the sequence, syntactic and semantic information thus cannot distinguish between \"The hero killed the villain\" and \"The villain killed the hero\".",
        "The task like answering complex questions that requires the use of more complex syntactic and semantics, the approaches with only TF*IDF are often inadequate to perform fine-level textual analysis.",
        "In this paper, we extensively study the impact of syntactic and shallow semantic information in measuring similarity between the sentences in the random walk model for answering complex questions.",
        "We argue that for this task, similarity measures based on syntactic and semantic information performs better and can be used to characterize the relation between a question and a sentence (answer) in a more effective way than the traditional TF*IDF based similarity measures."

        "The denominators in both terms are for normalization.",
        "C is the set of all sentences in the collection.",
        "The value of the parameter d which we call \"bias\", is a trade-off between two terms in the equation and is set empirically.",

The tree fragments of a tree are all of its sub-trees which include at least one production with the restriction that no production rules can be broken into incomplete parts.",

        "For instance, although the two STs of Figure 1 share most of the subtrees rooted in the ST node, the kernel defined above computes no match.",
        "The critical aspect of the TK function is that the productions of two evaluated nodes have to be identical to allow the match of further descendants.",
