        "Knowledge maps consist of nodes containing rich concept descriptions interconnected using a limited set of relationship types (Holley and Dansereau, 1984).",
        "Learning research indicates that knowledge maps may be useful for learners to understand the macro-level structure of an information space (O'Donnell et al., 2002).",
        "Knowledge maps have also emerged as an effective computational infrastructure to support the automated generation of conceptual browsers.",
        "Such conceptual browsers appear to allow students to focus on the science content of large educational digital libraries (Sum-ner et al., 2003), such as the Digital Library for Earth System Education (DLESE.org).",
        "Knowledge maps have also shown promise as domain and student knowledge representations to support personalized learning interactions (de la Chica et al., 2008).",
        "In this paper we describe our progress towards the generation of science concept inventories as summaries of digital library collections.",
        "Such inventories provide the basis for the construction of knowledge maps useful both as computational knowledge representations and as learning resources for presentation to the student."

        "The resulting knowledge map consists of 564 concepts and 578 relationships.",
        "The concepts include 7,846 words, or 5% of the resources.",
        "Our experts relied on copying-and-pasting (58%) and paraphrasing (37%) to create most concepts.",
        "Only 5% of the concepts could not be traced directly to the original resources.",
        "Relationship types were used in a Zipf-like distribution with the top 2 relationship types each accounting for more than 10% of all relationships: elaborations (19%) and examples (14%).",
        "Analysis by an independent instructional expert indicates that this knowledge map provides adequate coverage of nationally-recognized educational goals on earthquakes and plate tectonics for high school learners using the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS)",
        "Benchmarks (Project 2061, 1993).",
        "Verbal protocol analysis shows that all experts used external sources to create the knowledge map, including their own expertise, other digital library resources, and the National Science Education Standards (NSES), a comprehensive collection of nationally-recognized science learning goals for K-12 students (National Research Council, 1996).",
        "We have examined sentence extraction agreement between experts using the prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted (PABA) kappa to account for prevalence of judgments and conflicting biases amongst experts (Byrt et al., 1993).",
        "The average PABA-kappa value of 0.62 indicates that experts substantially agree on sentence extraction from digital library resources.",
        "This level of agreement suggests that these concepts may serve as the reference summary to evaluate our system."

        "This feature computes the ratio of content to function words in a sentence.",
        "Function words are identified using a stopword list, and the feature only keeps sentences featuring more content words than function words.",

        "We report on ROUGE-1 (unigrams), ROUGE-2 (bigrams), ROUGE W-1.2 (weighted LCS), and ROUGE-S* (skip bigrams) as they have been shown to correlate well with human judgments for longer multi-document summaries (Lin, 2004).",
