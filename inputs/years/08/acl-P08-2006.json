        "Dialect classification systems have been employed to improve the performance for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) by employing dialect dependent acoustic and language models (Di-akoloukas et al., 1997) and for Rich Indexing of Spoken Document Retrieval Systems(Gray and Hansen 2005).",
        "(Huang and Hansen, 2005; 2006) focused on identifying pronunciation differences for dialect classification.",
        "In this study, unsupervised MFCC based GMM classifiers are employed for pronunciation modeling.",
        "However, English dialects differ in many ways other than pronunciation like Word Selection and Grammar, which cannot be modeled using frame based GMM acoustic information.",
        "For example, word selection differences between UK and US dialects such as - \"lorry\" vs. \"truck\", \"lift\", vs. \"elevator\", etc.",
        "Australian English has its own lexical terms such as tucker (food), outback (wilderness), etc (John Laver, 1994).",
        "N-gram language models are employed to address these problems.",
        "One additional factor in which dialects differ is in Semantics.",
        "For example, momentarily which means for a moments duration (UK) vs. in a minute or any minute now (US).",
        "The sentence \"This flight will be leaving momentarily\" could represent different time duration in US vs. UK dialects (John Laver, 1994).",
        "Latent Semantic Analysis is a technique that can distinguish these differences (Landauer et al.,1998).",
        "LSA has been shown to be effective for NLP based problems but has yet to be applied for dialect classification.",
        "Therefore, we develop an approach that uses a combination with n-gram language modeling and LSA processing to achieve effective language based dialect classification accuracy.",
        "Sec 4 explains the baseline acoustic classifier.",
        "Language classifiers are described in Sec 5 and the results which are presented in Sec 6 affirm that combining various sources of information significantly outperforms the traditional (or individual) techniques used for dialect classification."
