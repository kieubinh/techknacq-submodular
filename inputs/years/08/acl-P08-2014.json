        "Named entity (NE) transliteration is the process of transcribing a NE from a source language to a target language based on phonetic similarity between the entities.",
        "Figure 1 provides examples of NE transliterations in English Russian and Hebrew.",
        "Identifying transliteration pairs is an important component in many linguistic applications such as machine translation and information retrieval, which require identifying out-of-vocabulary words.",
        "In our settings, we have access to source language NE and the ability to label the data upon request.",
        "We introduce a new active sampling paradigm that aims to guide the learner toward informative samples, allowing learning from a small number of representative examples.",
        "After the data is obtained it is analyzed to identify repeating patterns which can be used to focus the training process of the model.",
        "Previous works usually take a generative approach, (Knight and Graehl, 1997).",
        "Other approaches exploit similarities in aligned bilingual corpora; for example, (Tao et al., 2006) combine two unsupervised methods.",
        "(Klementiev and Roth, 2006) bootstrap with a classifier used interchangeably with an unsupervised temporal alignment method.",
        "Although these approaches alleviate the problem of obtaining annotated data, other resources are still required, such as a large aligned bilingual corpus.",
        "The idea of selectively sampling training samples has been wildly discussed in machine learning theory (Seung et al., 1992) and has been applied successfully to several NLP applications (McCallum and Nigam, 1998).",
        "Unlike other approaches,our approach is based on minimizing the distance between the feature distribution of a comprehensive reference set and the sampled set."

        "Our framework works in several stages, as summarized in Algorithm 1.",
        "First, a training set consisting of NE transliteration pairs (ws, wt) is automatically generated using an active sample selection scheme.",
        "The sample selection process is guided by the Sufficient Spanning Features criterion (SSF) introduced in section 2.2, to identify informative samples in the source language.An oracle capable of pairing a NE in the source language with its counterpart in the target language is then used.",
        "Negative training samples are generated by reshuffling the terms in these pairs.",
        "Once the training data has been collected, the data is analyzed to identify repeating patterns in the data which are used to focus the training process by assigning weights to features corresponding to the observed patterns.",
        "Finally, a linear model is trained using a variation of the averaged perceptron (Freund and Schapire, 1998) algorithm.",
        "The remainder of this section provides details about these stages; the basic formulation of the transliteration model and the feature extraction scheme is described in section 2.1, in section 2.2 the selective sampling process is described and finally section 2.3 explains how learning is focused by using feature weights.",

        "The initial step in our framework is to generate a training set of transliteration pairs; this is done by pairing highly informative source language candidate NEs with target language counterparts.",
        "We developed a criterion for adding new samples, Sufficiently Spanning Features (SSF), which quantifies the sampled set ability to span the feature space.",
        "This is done by evaluating the L-1 distance between the frequency distributions of source language word fragments in the current sampled set and in a comprehensive set of source language NEs, serving as reference.",

Given a sample set S, we measure the L\\ distance between the distributions: distance (R,S) = J2ngeR I DR(ng) – DS(ng) | Samples decreasing the distance between the distributions were added to the training data.",
        "Given a set C of candidates for annotation, a sample ws £ C was added to the training set, if -ws = argminwecdistance(R, DS U {ws}).",
        "A sample set is said to have SSF, if the distance remains constant as more samples are added.",
        "The transliteration oracle is essentially a mapping between the named entities, i.e. given an NE in the source language it provides the matching NE in the target language.",
        "An automatic oracle was implemented by crawling through Wikipedia topic aligned document pairs.",
        "Given a pair of topic aligned documents in the two languages, the topic can be identified either by identifying the top ranking terms or by simply identifying the title of the documents.",
        "By choosing documents in Wikipedia's biography category we ensured that the topic of the documents is person NE.",
        "The feature extraction scheme we use generates features by coupling substrings from the two terms.",
        "Ideally, given a positive sample, it is desirable that paired substrings would encode phonetically similar or a distinctive context in which the two scripts correlate.",
        "Given enough positive samples, such features will appear with distinctive frequency.",
        "Taking this idea further, these features were recognized by measuring the co-occurrence frequency of substrings of up to two characters in both languages.",

        "§(fs, ft) is the number of occurrences of that feature in the positive sample set, and §(fL) is the number of occurrences of an individual substring, in any of the features extracted from positive samples in the training set.",
        "The result of this process is a weight table, in which, as we empirically tested, the highest ranking weights were assigned to features that preserve the phonetic correlation between the two languages.",
