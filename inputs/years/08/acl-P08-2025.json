        "Community Question Answering (CQA) has recently become a viable method for seeking information online.",
        "As an alternative to using generalpurpose web search engines, information seekers now have an option to post their questions (often complex, specific, and subjective) on Community QA sites such as Yahoo!",
        "Answers, and have their questions answered by other users.",
        "Hundreds ofmil-lions of answers have already been posted for tens of millions of questions in Yahoo!",
        "Answers.",
        "However, the success of obtaining satisfactory answers in the available CQA portals varies greatly.",
        "In many cases, the questions posted by askers go unanswered, or are answered poorly, never obtaining a satisfactory answer.",
        "In our recent work (Liu et al., 2008) we have introduced a general model for predicting asker satisfaction in community question answering.",
        "We found that previous asker history is a significant factor that correlates with satisfaction.",
        "We hypothesize that asker's satisfaction with contributed answers is largely determined by the asker expectations, prior knowledge and previous experience with using the CQA site.",
        "Therefore, in this paper we begin to explore how to personalize satisfaction prediction that is, to attempt to predict whether a specific information seeker will be satisfied with any of the contributed answers.",
        "Our aim is to provide a \"personalized\" recommendation to the user that they've got answers that satisfy their information need.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first exploration of personalizing prediction of user satisfaction in complex and subjective information seeking environments.",
        "While information seeker satisfaction has been studied in ad-hoc IR context (see (Kobayashi and Takeda, 2000) for an overview), previous studies have been limited by the lack of realistic user feedback.",
        "In contrast, we deal with complex information needs and community-provided answers, trying to predict subjective ratings provided by users themselves.",
        "Furthermore, while automatic complex QA has been an active area of research, ranging from simple modification to factoid QA technique (e.g., (Soricut and Brill, 2004)) to knowledge intensive approaches for specialized domains, the technology does not yet exist to automatically answer open domain, complex, and subjective questions.",
        "Hence, this paper contributes to both the understanding of complex question answering, and explores evaluation issues in a new setting.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "We describe the problem and our approach in Section 2, including our initial attempt at personalizing satisfaction prediction.",
        "We report results of a large-scale evaluation over thousands of real users and tens of thousands of questions in Section 3.",
        "Our results demonstrate that when sufficient prior asker history exists, even simple personalized models result in significant improvement over a general prediction model.",
        "We discuss our findings and future work in Section 4."

        "We first briefly review the life of a question in a QA community.",
        "A user (the asker) posts a question by selecting a topical category (e.g., \"History\"), and then enters the question and, optionally, additional details.",
        "After a short delay the question appears in the respective category list of open questions.",
        "At this point, other users can answer the question, vote on other users' answers, or interact in other ways.",
        "The asker may be notified of the answers as they are submitted, or may check the contributed answers periodically.",
        "If the asker is satisfied with any of the answers, she can choose it as best, and rate the answer by assigning stars.",
        "At that point, the question is considered as closed by asker.",
        "For more detailed treatment of user interactions in CQA see (Liu et al., 2008).",
        "If the asker rates the best answer with at least three out of five \"stars\", we believe the asker is satisfied with the response.",
        "But often the asker never closes the answer personally, and instead, after a period of time, the question is closed automatically.",
        "In this case, the \"best\" answer may be chosen by the votes, or alternatively by automatically predicting answer quality (e.g., (Jeon et al., 2006) or (Agichtein et al., 2008)).",
        "While the best answer chosen automatically may be of high quality, it is unknown if the asker's information need was satisfied.",
        "Based on our exploration we believe that the main reasons for not \"closing\" a question are a) the asker loses interest in the information and b) none of the answers are satisfactory.",
        "In both cases, the QA community has failed to provide satisfactory answers in a timely manner and \"lost\" the asker's interest.",
        "We consider this outcome to be \"unsatisfied\".",
        "We now define asker satisfaction more precisely:",
        "Definition 1 An asker in a QA community is considered satisfied iff: the asker personally has closed the question and rated the best answer with at least 3 \"stars\".",
        "Otherwise, the asker is unsatisfied.",
        "This definition captures a key aspect of asker satisfaction, namely that we can reliably identify when the asker is satisfied but not the converse.",
        "We now briefly review our ASP (Asker Satisfaction Prediction) framework that learns to classify whether a question has been satisfactorily answered, originally introduced in (Liu et al., 2008).",
        "ASP employs standard classification techniques to predict, given a question thread, whether an asker would be satisfied.",
        "A sample of features used to represent this problem is listed in Table 1.",
        "Our features are organized around the basic entities in a question answering community: questions, answers, question-answer pairs, users, and categories.",
        "In total, we developed 51 features for this task.",
        "A sample of the features used are listed in the Figure 1.",
        "• Question Features: Traditional question answering features such as the wh-type of the question (e.g., \"what\" or \"where\"), and whether the question is similar to other questions in the category.",
        "• Question-Answer Relationship Features: Overlap between question and answer, answer length, and number of candidate answers.",
        "We also use features such as the number of positive votes (\"thumbs up\" in Yahoo!",
        "Answers), negative votes (\"thumbs down\"), and derived statistics such as the maximum of positive or negative votes received for any answer (e.g., to detect cases of brilliant answers or, conversely, blatant abuse).",
        "• Asker User History: Past asker activity history such as the most recent rating, average past satisfaction, and number of previous questions posted.",
        "Note that only the information available about the asker prior to posting the question was used.",
        "• Category Features: We hypothesized that user behavior (and asker satisfaction) varies by topical question category, as recently shown in reference (Agichtein et al., 2008).",
        "Therefore we model the prior of asker satisfaction for the category, such as the average asker rating (satisfaction).",
        "• Text Features: We also include word unigrams and bigrams to represent the text of the question subject, question detail, and the answer content.",
        "Separate feature spaces were used for each attribute to keep answer text distinct from question text, with frequency-based filtering.",
        "Classification Algorithms: We experimented with a variety of classifiers in the Weka framework (Witten and Frank, 2005).",
        "In particular, we compared Support Vector Machines, Decision trees, and Boosting-based classifiers.",
        "SVM performed the best",
        "Table 1: Sample features: Question (Q), Question-Answer Relationship (QA), Asker history (UH), and Category (CA).",
        "of the three during development, so we report results using SVM for all the subsequent experiments.",
        "We now describe our initial attempt at personalizing the ASP framework described above to each asker:",
        "• ASP_Pers+Text: We first consider the naive personalization approach where we train a separate classifier for each user.",
        "That is, to predict a particular asker's satisfaction with the provided answers, we apply the individual classifier trained solely on the questions (and satisfaction labels) provided in the past by that user.",
        "• ASP.Group: A more robust approach is to train a classifier on the questions from the group of users similar to each other.",
        "Our current grouping was done simply by the number of questions posted, essentially grouping users with similar levels of \"activity\".",
        "As we will show below, text features only help for users with at least 20 previous questions.",
        "So, we only include text features for groups of users with at least 20 questions.",
        "Certainly, more sophisticated personalization models and user clustering methods could be devised.",
        "However, as we show next, even the simple models described above prove surprisingly effective."
