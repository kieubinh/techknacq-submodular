        "When designing a dialog manager for a spoken dialog system, we would ideally like to try different dialog management strategies on the actual user population that will be using the system, and select the one that works best.",
        "However, users are typically unwilling to endure this kind of experimentation.",
        "The next-best approach is to build a model of user behavior.",
        "That way we can experiment with the model as much as we like without troubling actual users.",
        "Of course, for these experiments to be useful, a high-quality user model is needed.",
        "The usual method of building a user model is to estimate it from transcribed corpora of human-computer dialogs.",
        "However, manually transcribing dialogs is expensive, and consequently these corpora are usually small and sparse.",
        "In this work, we propose a method of building user models that does not operate on manually transcribed dialogs, but instead uses dialogs that have been transcribed by an automatic speech recognition (ASR) engine.",
        "Since this process is error-prone, we cannot assume that the transcripts will accurately reflect the users' true actions and internal states.",
        "To handle this uncertainty, we employ an EM algorithm that treats this information as unobserved data.",
        "Although this approach does not directly employ manually transcribed dialogs, it does require a confusion model for the ASR engine, which is estimated from manually transcribed dialogs.",
        "The key benefit is that the number of manually transcribed dialogs required to estimate an ASR confusion model is much smaller, and is fixed with respect to the complexity of the user model.",
        "Many works have estimated user models from transcribed data (Georgila et al., 2006; Levin et al., 2000; Pietquin, 2004; Schatzmann et al., 2007).",
        "Our work is novel in that we do not assume we have access to the correct transcriptions at all, but rather have a model of how errors are made.",
        "EM has previously been applied to estimation of user models: (Schatzmann et al., 2007) cast the user's internal state as a complex hidden variable and estimate its transitions using the true user actions with EM.",
        "Our work employs EM to infer the model of user actions, not the model of user goal evolution."

      "text": [
        "Before we can estimate a user model, we must define a larger model of human-computer dialogs, of which the user model is just one component.",
        "In this section we give a general description of our dialog model; in Section 3 we instantiate the model for a voice-controlled telephone directory.",
        "We adopt a probabilistic dialog model (similar to (Williams and Young, 2007)), depicted schematically as a graphical model in Figure 1.",
        "Following the convention for graphical models, we use directed edges to denote conditional dependencies among the variables.",
        "In our dialog model, a dialog transcript x consists of an alternating sequence of system actions and observed user actions: x = (So, Alo, Si, All,...).",
        "Here St denotes the system action, and At the output of the ASR engine when applied to the true user action At.",
        "A dialog transcript x is generated by our model as follows: At each time t, the system action is St and the unobserved user state is Ut.",
        "The user state indicates the user's hidden goal and relevant dialog history which, due to ASR confusions, is known with certainty only to the user.",
        "Conditioned on (St, Ut), the user draws an unobserved action At from a distribution Pr(At | St, Ut; 0) parameterized by an unknown parameter 0.",
        "For each user action At, the ASR engine produces a hypothesis At of what the user said, drawn from a distribution Pr(At | At), which is the ASR confusion model.",
        "The user state Ut is updated to Ut+1 according to a deterministic distribution Pr(Ut+1 | St+1,Ut, At,At).",
        "The system outputs the next system action St+1 according to its dialog management policy.",
        "Concretely, the values of St, Ut, At and At are all assumed to belong to finite sets, and so all the conditional distributions in our model are multinomials.",
        "Hence 0 is a vector that parameterizes the user model according to Pr(At = a | St = s, Ut = u; 0) = 0as«.",
        "The problem we are interested in is estimating 0 given the set of dialog transcripts X, Pr(At | At) and Pr(Ut+1 | St+1, Ut, At, At).",
        "Here, we assume that Pr(At | At) is relatively straightforward to estimate: for example, ASR models that rely a simple confusion rate and uniform substitutions (which can be estimated from small number of transcriptions) have been used to train dialog systems which outperform traditional systems (Thomson et al., 2007).",
        "Further, Pr(Ut+1 | St+1, Ut, At, At) is often deterministic and tracks dialog history relevant to action selection – for example, whether the system correctly or incorrectly confirms a slot value.",
        "Here we assume that it can be easily hand-crafted.",
        "Formally, given a set of dialog transcripts X, our goal is find a set of parameters 0* that maximizes the",
        "Figure 1: A probabilistic graphical model of a human-computer dialog.",
        "The boxed variables are observed; the circled variables are unobserved.",
        "log-likelihood of the observed data, i.e.,",
        "Unfortunately, directly computing 0* in this equation is intractable.",
        "However, we can efficiently approximate 0* via an expectation-maximization (EM) procedure (Dempster et al., 1977).",
        "For a dialog transcript x, let y be the corresponding sequence of unobserved values: y = (U0, A0, U1, A1,...).",
        "Let Y be the set of all sequences of unobserved values corresponding to the data set X.",
        "Given an estimate 0(t-1), a new estimate 0(t) is produced by",
        "The expectation in this equation is taken over all possible values for Y.",
        "Both the expectation and its maximization are easy to compute.",
        "This is because our dialog model has a chainlike structure that closely resembles an Hidden Markov Model, so a forward-backward procedure can be employed (Ra-biner, 1990).",
        "Under fairly mild conditions, the sequence 0(0), 0(1),... converges to a stationary point estimate of 0* that is usually a local maximum."

        "To control the size of the model, we first assumed that the user's intended callee does not change during the call, which allows us to group many user actions together into generic placeholders e.g. At = FirstNameLastName.",
        "After doing this, there were a total of 13 possible values for At and At, and 14 values for St.",
        "The user state consists of three bits: one bit indicating whether the system has correctly recognized the callee's name, one bit indicating whether the system has correctly recognized the callee's \"phone type\" (office or cell), and one bit indicating whether the user has said the callee's geographic location (needed for disambiguation when several different people share the same name).",
        "The deterministic distribution Pr(Ut+1 | St+1, Ut, At, At) simply updates the user state after each dialog turn in the obvious way.",
        "For example, the \"name is correct\" bit of Ut+1is set to 0 when St+1 is a confirmation of a name which doesn't match At.",
        "Recall that the user model is a multinomial distribution Pr(At | St, Ut; 0) parameterized by a vector 0.",

        "The ASR confusion model was estimated by transcribing 50 randomly chosen dialogs from the training set in Section 4.2 and calculating the frequency with which the ASR engine recognized Alt such that Alt = At.",

        "So in this set of experiments, we chose a reasonable, hand-crafted value for 0, and then generated synthetic dialogs by following the probabilistic process depicted in Figure 1.",
