        "It is widely agreed that extraction of named entity (henceforth, denoted as NE) is an important subtask for various NLP applications.",
        "Various machine learning approaches such as maximum en-tropy(Uchimoto et al., 2000), decision list(Sassano and Utsuro, 2000; Isozaki, 2001), and Support Vector Machine(Yamada et al., 2002; Isozaki and Kazawa, 2002) were investigated for extracting NEs.",
        "All of them require a corpus whose NEs are annotated properly as training data.",
        "However, it is difficult to obtain an enough corpus in the real world, because there are increasing the number of NEs like personal names and company names.",
        "For example, a large database of organization names(Nichigai Associates, 2007) already contains 171,708 entries and is still increasing.",
        "Therefore, a robust method to extract NEs including unfamiliar words which do not occur or occur few times in a training corpus is necessary.",
        "This paper proposes a novel method of extracting NEs which contain unfamiliar morphemes using a large unannotated corpus, in order to resolve the above problem.",
        "The proposed method consists of two steps.",
        "The first step is to assign the most similar and familiar morpheme to each unfamiliar morpheme based on their context vectors calculated from a large unannotated corpus.",
        "The second step is to employ traditional machine learning approaches using both features of original morphemes and features of similar morphemes.",
