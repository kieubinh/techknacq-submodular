        "Language models, i.e. models that assign probabilities to sequences of words, have been proven useful in a variety of applications including speech recognition and machine translation (Bahl et al., 1983; Brown et al., 1990).",
        "More recently, good results on lexical substitution and word sense disambiguation using language models have also been reported (Yuret, 2007).",
        "The recently introduced Web 1T 5-gram dataset (Brants and Franz, 2006) contains the counts of word sequences up to length five in a 10 word corpus derived from publicly accessible Web pages.",
        "As this corpus is several orders of magnitude larger than the ones used in previous language modeling studies, it holds the promise to provide more accurate domain independent probability estimates.",
        "However, naive application of the well-known smoothing methods do not realize the full potential of this dataset.",
        "In this paper I present experiments with modifications and combinations of various smoothing methods using the Web 1T dataset for model building and the Brown corpus for evaluation.",
        "I describe a new smoothing method, Dirichlet-Kneser-Ney (DKN), that combines the Bayesian intuition of MacKay and Peto (1995) and the improved back-off estimation of Kneser and Ney (1995) and gives significantly better results than the baseline Kneser-Ney discounting.",

        "Let abc represent an n-gram where a is the first word, c is the last word, and b represents zero or more words in between.",
        "One way to estimate Pr(c|ab) is to look at the number of times word c has followed the previous n – 1 words ab, where C(x) denotes the number of times x has been observed in the training corpus.",
        "This is the maximum likelihood (ML) estimate.",
        "Unfortunately it does not work very well because it assigns zero probability to n-grams that have not been observed in the training corpus.",
        "To avoid the zero probabilities, we take some probability mass from the observed n-grams and distribute it to unobserved n-grams.",
        "Such redistribution is known as smoothing or discounting.",
        "Most existing smoothing methods can be expressed in one of the following two forms:",
        "Equation 2 describes the so-called interpolated models and Equation 3 describes the back-off models.",
        "The highest order distributions a(c|ab) and ///(c|ab) are typically discounted to be less than the ML estimate so we have some leftover probability for the c words unseen in the context ab.",

        "The back-off weights 7(ab) are computed to make sure the probabilities are normalized.",
