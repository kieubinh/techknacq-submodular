        "The use of similar techniques for English-to-Arabic SMT requires recombination of the target side into valid surface forms, which is not a trivial task.",
        "In this paper, we present an initial set of experiments on English-to-Arabic SMT.",

        "The only previous work on English-to-Arabic SMT that we are aware of is by Sarikaya and Deng (2007).",
        "It uses shallow segmentation, and does not make use of contextual information.",
        "The emphasis of that work is on using Joint Morphological-Lexical Language Models to rerank the output.",
        "Most of the related work, though, is on Arabic-to-English SMT.",
        "Lee (2004) uses a trigram language model to segment Arabic words.",
        "She then proceeds to deleting or merging some of the segmented morphemes in order to make the segmented Arabic source align better with the English target.",
        "Habash and Sadat (2006) use the Arabic morphological analyzer MADA (Habash and Rambow, 2005) to segment the Arabic source; they propose various segmentation schemes.",
        "Both works show that the improvements obtained from segmentation decrease as the corpus size increases.",
        "As will be shown later, we observe the same trend, which is due to the fact that the model becomes less sparse with more training data.",
        "There has been work on translating from English to other morphologically complex languages.",
        "Koehn and Hoang (2007) present Factored Translation Models as an extension to phrase-based statistical machine translation models.",
        "Factored models allow the integration of additional morphological features, such as POS, gender, number, etc.",
        "at the word level on both source and target sides.",
        "The tighter integration of such features was claimed to allow more explicit modeling of the morphology, and is better than using preprocessing and post-processing techniques.",

        "As mentioned in Section 1, Arabic has a relatively rich morphology.",
        "In addition to being inflected for gender, number, voice and case, words attach to various clitics for conjunction (w+ 'and'), the definite article (Al+ 'the'), prepositions (e.g. b+ 'by/with', l+ 'for', k+ 'as'), possessive pronouns and object pronouns (e.g. +ny 'me/my', +hm 'their/them').",
        "For example, the verbal form wsnsAEdhm and the nominal form wbsyAratnA can be decomposed as follows:",
        "Also, Arabic is usually written without the diacritics that denote the short vowels, and different sources write a few characters inconsistently.",
        "These issues create word-level ambiguity.",
        "Due to the word-level ambiguity mentioned above, but more generally, because a certain string of characters can, in principle, be either an affixed morpheme or part of the base word, morphological decomposition requires both word-level linguistic information and context analysis; simple pattern matching is not sufficient to detect affixed morphemes.",
        "To perform pre-translation morphological decomposition of the Arabic source, we use the morphological analyzer MADA.",
        "MADA uses SVM-based classifiers for features (such as POS, number and gender, etc.)",
        "to choose among the different analyses of a given word in context.",
        "We first normalize the Arabic by changing final ' Y' to 'y' and the various forms of Alifhamza to bare Alif.",
        "We also remove diacritics wherever they occur.",
        "We then apply one of two morphological decomposition schemes before aligning the training data:",
        "1.",
        "S1 : Decliticization by splitting off each conjunction clitic, particle, definite article and pronominal clitic separately.",
        "Note that plural and subject pronoun morphemes are not split.",
        "2.",
        "S2: Same as S1, except that the split clitics are glued into one prefix and one suffix, such that any given word is split into at most three parts: prefix+ stem +suffix.",
        "For example the word wlAwlAdh ( and for his kids ) is segmented to w+ l+ AwlAd +P:3MS according to S1, and to wl+ AwlAd +P:3MS according to S2.",
        "As mentioned above, both training and decoding use segmented Arabic.",
        "The final output of the decoder must therefore be recombined into a surface form.",
        "This proves to be a non-trivial challenge for a number of reasons:",
        "1.",
        "Morpho-phonological Rules: For example, the feminine marker p at the end of a word changes to 't' when a suffix is attached to the word.",
        "So syArp +P:1S recombines to syArty ('my car')",
        "2.",
        "Letter Ambiguity: The character Y (Alf mqSwrp) is normalized to 'y'.",
        "In the recombination step we need to be able to decide whether a final 'y' was originally a 'Y'.",
        "For example, mdy +P:3MS recombines to mdAh",
        "its extent , since the y is actually a Y; but fy +P:3MS recombines to fyh 'in it'.",
        "3.",
        "Word Ambiguity: In some cases, a word can recombine into 2 grammatically correct forms.",
        "One example is the optional insertion of nwn AlwqAyp (protective 'n'), so the segmented word lkn +O:1S can recombine to either lknny or lkny, both grammatically correct.",
        "To address these issues, we propose two recombination techniques:",
        "1.",
        "R: Recombination rules defined manually.",
        "To resolve word ambiguity we pick the grammatical form that appears more frequently in the training data.",
        "To resolve letter ambiguity we use a unigram language model trained on data where the character Y had not been normalized.",
        "We decide on the non-normalized from of the y by comparing the unigram probability of the word with y to its probability with Y .",
        "2.",
        "T: Uses a table derived from the training set that maps the segmented form of the word to its original form.",
        "If a segmented word has more than one original form, one of them is picked at random.",
        "The table is useful in recombining words that are split erroneously.",
        "For example, qrDAy, a proper noun, gets incorrectly segmented to qrDAn +P:1S which makes its recombination without the table difficult.",
        "For the Factored Translation Models experiment, the factors on the English side are the POS tags and the surface word.",
        "On the Arabic side, we use the surface word, the stem and the POS tag concatenated to the segmented clitics.",
        "For example, for the word wlAwlAdh ( and for his kids ), the factored words are AwlAd and w+l+N+P:3MS.",
        "We use two language models: a trigram for surface words and a 7-gram for the POS+clitic factor.",
        "We also use a generation model to generate the surface form from the stem and POS+clitic, a translation table from POS to POS+clitics and from the English surface word to the Arabic stem.",
        "If the Arabic surface word cannot be generated from the stem and POS+clitic, we back off to translating it from the English surface word."
