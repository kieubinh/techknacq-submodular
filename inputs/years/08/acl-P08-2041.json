        "Currently, most of the phrase-based statistical machine translation (PBSMT) models (Marcu and Wong, 2002; Koehn et al., 2003) adopt full matching strategy for phrase translation, which means that a phrase pair (/, e) can be used for translating a source phrase /, only if / = /.",
        "Due to lack of generalization ability, the full matching strategy has some limitations.",
        "On one hand, the data sparseness problem is serious, especially when the amount of the bilingual data is limited.",
        "On the other hand, for a certain source text, the phrase table is redundant since most of the bilingual phrases cannot be fully matched.",
        "In this paper, we address the problem of translation of unseen phrases, the source phrases that are not observed in the training corpus.",
        "The alignment template model (Och and Ney, 2004) enhanced phrasal generalizations by using words classes rather than the words themselves.",
        "But the phrases are overly generalized.",
        "The hierarchical phrase-based model (Chiang, 2005) used hierarchical phrase pairs to strengthen the generalization ability of phrases and allow long distance reorder-ings.",
        "However, the huge grammar table greatly increases computational complexity.",

        "(2006) used paraphrases of the trainig corpus for translating unseen phrases.",
        "But they only found and used the semantically similar phrases.",
        "Another method is to use multi-parallel corpora (Cohn and Lapata, 2007; Utiyama and Isahara, 2007) to improve phrase coverage and translation quality.",
        "This paper presents a partial matching strategy for translating unseen phrases.",
        "When encountering unseen phrases in a source sentence, we search partially matched phrase pairs from the phrase table.",
        "Then we keep the translations of the matched part and translate the unmatched part by word substitution.",

        "Note that in order to improve search efficiency, we only consider the partially matched phrases with the same length.",
        "In our experiments, we use a matching threshold a to tune the precision of partial matching.",

        "Furthermore, this constraint can sharply decrease the computational complexity since there is no need to search the whole phrase table.",

        "In this paper, we incorporate the partial matching strategy into the state-of-the-art PBSMT system, Moses.",
        "Given a source sentence, Moses firstly uses the full matching strategy to search all possible translation options from the phrase table, and then uses a beam-search algorithm for decoding.",
        "Therefore, we do incorporation by performing partial matching for phrase translation before decoding.",
        "The advantage is that the main search algorithm need not be changed.",

        "Then the newly constructed translations are stored as translation options.",
