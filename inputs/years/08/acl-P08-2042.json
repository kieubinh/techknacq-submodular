        "The algorithm, originally proposed for unsupervised learning of allophonic variations within a given phoneme set, has been adapted to learn without any knowledge of the phonemes.",
        "An evaluation methodology is also proposed, whereby the state-sequence that aligns to a test utterance is transduced in an automatic manner to a phoneme-sequence and compared to its manual transcription.",

        "Statistical models learnt from data are extensively used in modern automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems.",
        "Transcribed speech is used to estimate conditional models of the acoustics given a phoneme-sequence.",
        "The phonemic pronunciation of words and the phonemes of the language, however, are derived almost entirely from linguistic knowledge.",
        "In this paper, we investigate whether the phonemes may be learnt automatically from the speech signal.",
        "Automatic learning of phoneme-like units has significant implications for theories of language acquisition in babies, but our considerations here are somewhat more technological.",
        "We are interested in developing ASR systems for languages or dialects",
        "* This work was partially supported by National Science Foundation Grants No IIS-0534359 and OISE-0530118.",
        "for which such linguistic knowledge is scarce or nonexistent, and in extending ASR techniques to recognition of signals other than speech, such as manipulative gestures in endoscopic surgery.",
        "Hence an algorithm for automatically learning an inventory of intermediate symbolic units – intermediate relative to the acoustic or kinematic signal on one end and the word-sequence or surgical act on the other – is very desirable.",
        "Except for some early work on isolated word/digit recognition (Paliwal and Kulkarni, 1987; Wilpon et al., 1987, etc), not much attention has been paid to automatic derivation of sub-word units from speech, perhaps because pronunciation lexicons are now available in languages of immediate interest.",
        "What has been investigated is automatically learning allophonic variations of each phoneme due to co-articulation or contextual effects (Takami and Sagayama, 1992; Fukada et al., 1996); the phoneme inventory is usually assumed to be known.",
        "The general idea in allophone learning is to begin with an inventory of only one allophone per phoneme, and incrementally refine the inventory to better fit the speech signal.",
        "Typically, each phoneme is modeled by a separate HMM.",
        "In early stages of refinement, when very few allophones are available, it is hoped that \"similar\" allophones of a phoneme will be modeled by shared HMM states, and that subsequent refinement will result in distinct states for different allophones.",
        "The key therefore is to devise a scheme for successive refinement of a model shared by many allophones.",
        "In the HMM setting, this amounts to simultaneously refining the topology and the model parameters.",
        "A successive state splitting (SSS) algorithm to achieve this was proposed by Takami and Sagayama (1992), and enhanced by Singer and Ostendorf (1996).",
        "Improvements in phoneme recognition accuracy using these derived allophonic models over phonemic models were obtained.",
        "In this paper, we investigate directly learning the allophone inventory of a language from speech without recourse to its phoneme set.",
        "We begin with a one-state HMM for all speech sounds and modify the SSS algorithm to successively learn the topology and parameters of HMMs with even larger numbers of states.",
        "States sequences through this HMM are expected to correspond to allophones.",
        "The most likely state-sequence for a speech segment is interpreted as an \"allophonic labeling\" of that speech by the learnt model.",
        "Performance is measured by mapping the resultant state-sequence to phonemes.",
        "One contribution of this paper is a significant improvement in the efficacy of the SSS algorithm as described in Section 2.",
        "It is based on observing that the improvement in the goodness of fit by up to two consecutive splits of any of the current HMM states can be evaluated concurrently and efficiently.",
        "Choosing the best subset of splits from among these is then cast as a constrained knapsack problem, to which an efficient solution is devised.",
        "Another contribution of this paper is a method to evaluate the accuracy of the resulting \"allophonic labeling,\" as described in Section 3.",
        "It is demonstrated that if a small amount of phonetically transcribed speech is used to learn a Markov (bigram) model of state-sequences that arise from each phone, an evaluation tool results with which we may measure phone recognition accuracy, even though the HMM labels the speech signal not with phonemes but merely a state-sequence.",
        "Section 4 presents experimental results, where the performance accuracies with different learning setups are tabulated.",
        "We also see how as little as 5 minutes of speech is adequate for learning the acoustic units."

        "Note that the key computational steps are the forloop of Step 2 and the re-estimation of Step 3.",
        "Modifications to the ML-SSS Algorithm: We made the following modifications that are favorable in terms of greater speed and larger search space, thereby yielding a gain in likelihood that is potentially greater than the original ML-SSS.",

        "Here it really means all the speech.",
        "merged back in different ways to produce 3, 2 or 1 HMM states.",
        "There are 6 ways to end up with 3 states, and 7 to end up with 2 states.",
        "Retain for further consideration the 4 state split of s, the best merge back to 3 states among the 6 ways, the best merge back to 2 states among the 7 ways, and the merge back to 1 state.",

        "Reduce the number of states from 4N to N+A by optimally merging back quartets that cause the least loss in log-likelihood of the speech.",
        "HMM size, retrain the HMM and go to Step 2.",
        "Observe that the 4-state split of Figure 1 permits a slight lookahead in our scheme in the sense that the goodness of a contextual or temporal split of two different states can be compared in the same iteration with two consecutive splits of a single state.",
        "Also, the split/merge statistics for a state are gathered in our modified SSS assuming that the other states have already been split, which facilitates consideration of concurrent state splitting.",
        "If s1;..., sm are merged into s, the loss of log-likelihood in Step 4 is:",
        "Finally, in selecting the best A states to add to the HMM, we consider many more ways of splitting the N original states than SSS does.",
        "E.g. going up from N = 6 to N+A = 9 HMM states could be achieved by a 4-way split of a single state, a 3-way split of one state and 2-way of another, or a 2-way split of three distinct states; all of them are explored in the process of merging from 4N = 24 down to 9 states.",
        "Yet, like SSS, no original state s is permitted to merge with another original state s'.",
        "This latter restriction leads to an O(N) algorithm for finding the best states to merge down.",
        "Details of the algorithm are ommited for the sake of brevity.",
        "In summary, our modified ML-SSS algorithm can leapfrog by A states at a time, e.g. A = aN, compared to the standard algorithm, and it has the benefit of some lookahead to avoid greediness."
