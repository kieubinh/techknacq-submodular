        "Recent studies of natural language parsing have shown a clear and steady shift of focus from pure syntactic analyses to more semantically informed structures.",
        "As a result, we have seen an emerging interest in parser evaluation based on more theory-neutral and semantically informed representations, such as dependency structures.",
        "Some approaches have even tried to acquire semantic representations without full syntactic analyses.",
        "The so-called shallow semantic parsers build basic predicate-argument structures or label semantic roles that reveal the partial meaning of sentences (Carreras and Marquez, 2005).",
        "Manually annotated lexical semantic resources like PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005), VerbNet (Kipper-Schuler, 2005), or FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) are usually used as gold standards for training and evaluation of such systems.",
        "In the meantime, various existing parsing systems are also adapted to provide semantic information in their outputs.",
        "The obvious advantage in such an approach is that one can derive more fine-grained representations which are not typically available from shallow semantic parsers (e.g., modality and negation, quantifiers and scopes, etc.).",
        "To this effect, various semantic representations have been proposed and used in different parsing systems.",
        "Generally speaking, such semantic representations should be capable of embedding shallow semantic information (i.e., predicate-argument or semantic roles).",
        "However, it is non-trivial to map even the basic predicate-arguments between different representations.",
        "This becomes a barrier to both sides, making the cross-fertilization of systems and resources using different semantic representations very difficult.",
        "In this paper, we present a machine learning approach towards mapping between deep and shallow semantic representations.",
        "More specifically, we use Bayesian networks to acquire a statistical model that enriches the Minimal Recursion Semantics structures produced by the English Resource Grammar (ERG) (Flickinger, 2002) with VerbNet-like semantic roles.",
        "Evaluation results show that the mapping from MRS to semantic roles is reliable and beneficial to deep parsing."

        "The first set of features used to find corresponding lexical semantic roles for the MRS predicate arguments are taken from Robust MRS (RMRS) structures (Copestake, 2006).",
        "The general idea of the process is to traverse the bag of elementary predications looking for the verbs in the parsed sentence.",
        "When a verb is found, then its arguments are taken from the rarg tags and alternatively from the in-g conjunctions related to the verb.",

        "the obtained features for expect are shown in Table 1.",
        "The SEMI role labels are based mainly on syntactic characteristics of the verb.",
        "We employed the data provided by the PropBank and VerbNet projects to extract lexical semantic information.",

        "The process of RMRS feature extraction was applied and a new verb dependency trees dataset was created.",
        "To obtain a correspondence between the SEMI role labels and the PropBank (or VerbNet) role labels, a procedure which maps these labellings for each utterance and verb found in the corpus was implemented.",
        "Due to the possible semantic roles that subjects and objects in a sentence could bear, the mapping between SEMI roles and VerbNet role labels is not one-to-one.",
        "The general idea of this alignment process is to use the words in a given utterance which are selected by a given role label, both a SEMI and a PropBank one.",
        "With these words, a naive assumption was applied that allows a reasonable comparison and alignment of these two sources of information.",
        "The naive assumption considers that if all the words selected by some SEMI label are found in a given PropBank (VerbNet) role label, then we can deduce that these labels can be aligned.",
        "An important constraint is that all the SEMI labels must be exhausted.",
        "An additional constraint is that ARG1, ARG2 or ARG3 SEMI labels cannot be mapped to ARGM PropBank labels.",
