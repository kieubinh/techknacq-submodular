        "Still, the achieved accuracy is comparable to the best systems presented in recent academic competitions (i.e., Document Understanding Conference (DUC)).",

        "In this paper, we propose a simple method for effectively generating query-based multi-document summaries without any complex processing steps.",
        "It only involves sentence splitting, filtering candidate sentences and computing the word frequencies in the documents of a cluster, topic description and the topic title.",
        "We use a machine learning technique called regression SVM, as proposed by (Li et al., 2007).",
        "For the feature selection we use a new model selection technique called Least Angle Regression (LARS) (Efron et al., 2004).",
        "Even though machine learning approaches dominated the field of summarization systems in recent DUC competitions, not much effort has been spent in finding simple but effective features.",
        "Exceptions are the SumBasic system that achieves reasonable results with only one feature (i.e., word frequency in document clusters) (Nenkova and Vanderwende, 2005).",
        "Our approach goes beyond SumBasic by proposing an even more powerful feature that proves to be the best predictor in all three recent DUC corpora.",
        "In order to prove that our feature is more predictive than other features we provide a rigorous feature analysis by employing LARS.",
        "Scalability is normally not considered when different summarization systems are compared.",
        "Processing time of more than several seconds per summary should be considered unacceptable, in particular, if you bear in mind that using such a system should help a user to process lots of data faster.",
        "Our focus is on selecting the minimal set of features that are computationally less expensive than other features (i.e., full parse).",
        "Since FastSum can rely on a minimal set of features determined by LARS, it can process 1250 news documents in 60 seconds.A comparison test with the MEAD system showed that FastSum is more than 4 times faster."

        "We use a machine learning approach to rank all sentences in the topic cluster for summarizability.",
        "We use some features from Microsoft's PYTHY system (Toutonova et al., 2007), but added two new features, which turned out to be better predictors.",
        "First, the preprocessing module carries out tok-enization and sentence splitting.",
        "We also created a sentence simplification component which is based on a few regular expressions to remove unimportant components of a sentence (e.g., As a matter of fact,).",
        "This processing step does not involve any syntactic parsing though.",
        "For further processing, we ignore all sentences that do not have at least two exact word matches or at least three fuzzy matches with the topic description.",
        "Features are mainly based on word frequencies of words in the clusters, documents and topics.",
        "A cluster contains 25 documents and is associated with a topic.",
        "The topic contains a topic title and the topic descriptions.",
        "The topic title is list of key words or phrases describing the topic.",
        "The topic description contains the actual query or queries (e.g., Describe steps taken and worldwide reaction prior to introduction of the Euro on January 1, 1999.",
        ").",
        "The features we used can be divided into two sets; word-based and sentence-based.",
        "Word-based features are computed based on the probability ofwords for the different containers (i.e., cluster, document, topic title and description).",
        "At runtime, the different probabilities of all words in a candidate sentence are added up and normalized by length.",
        "Sentence-based features include the length and position of the sentence in the document.",
