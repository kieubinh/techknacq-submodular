        "The focus in English parsing research in recent years has moved from Wall Street Journal parsing to improving performance on other domains.",
        "Our research aim is to improve parsing performance on text which is mildly ungrammatical, i.e. text which is well-formed enough to be understood by people yet which contains the kind of grammatical errors that are routinely produced by both native and non-native speakers of a language.",
        "The intention is not to detect and correct the error, but rather to ignore it.",
        "Our approach is to introduce grammatical noise into WSJ sentences while retaining as much of the structure of the original trees as possible.",
        "These sentences and their associated trees are then used as training material for a statistical parser.",
        "It is important that parsing on grammatical sentences is not harmed and we introduce a parse-probability-based classifier which allows both grammatical and ungrammatical sentences to be accurately parsed."

      "heading": "2. Background",
      "text": [
        "Various strategies exist to build robustness into the parsing process: grammar constraints can be relaxed (Fouvry, 2003), partial parses can be concatenated to form a full parse (Penstein Rose and Lavie, 1997), the input sentence can itself be transformed until a parse can be found (Lee et al., 1995), and mal-rules describing particular error patterns can be included in the grammar (Schneider and McCoy, 1998).",
        "For a parser which tends to fail when faced with ungrammatical input, such techniques are needed.",
        "The overgeneration associated with a statistical data-driven parser means that it does not typically fail on ungrammatical sentences.",
        "However, it is not enough to return some analysis for an ungrammatical sentence.",
        "If the syntactic analysis is to guide semantic analysis, it must reflect as closely as possible what the person who produced the sentence was trying to express.",
        "Thus, while statistical, data-driven parsing has solved the robustness problem, it is not clear that it is has solved the accurate robustness problem.",
        "The problem of adapting parsers to accurately handle ungrammatical text is an instance of the domain adaptation problem where the target domain is grammatically noisy data.",
        "A parser can be adapted to a target domain by training it on data from the new domain - the problem is to quickly produce high-quality training material.",
        "Our solution is to simply modify the existing training material so that it resembles material from the noisy target domain.",
        "In order to tune a parser to syntactically ill-formed text, a treebank is automatically transformed into an ungrammatical treebank.",
        "This transformation process has two parts: 1. the yield of each tree is transformed into an ungrammatical sentence by introducing a syntax error; 2. each tree is minimally transformed, but left intact as much as possible to reflect the syntactic structure of the original \"intended\" sentence prior to error insertion.",
        "Artificial ungrammati-calities have been used in various NLP tasks (Smith and Eisner, 2005; Okanohara and Tsujii, 2007)",
        "The idea of an automatically generated ungrammatical treebank was proposed by Foster (2007).",
        "Foster generates an ungrammatical version of the WSJ treebank and uses this to train two statistical parsers.",
        "The performance of both parsers significantly improves on the artificially created ungrammatical test data, but significantly degrades on the original grammatical test data.",
        "We show that it is possible to obtain significantly improved performance on ungrammatical data without a concomitant performance decline on grammatical data."

        "Generating Noisy Sentences We apply the error introduction procedure described in detail in Foster (2007).",
        "Errors are introduced into sentences by applying the operations of word substitution, deletion and insertion.",
        "These operations can be iteratively applied to generate increasingly noisy sentences.",
        "We restrict our attention to ungrammatical sentences with a edit-distance of one or two words from the original sentence, because it is reasonable to expect a parser's performance to degrade as the input becomes more ill-formed.",
        "The operations of substitution, deletion and insertion are not carried out entirely at random, but are subject to some constraints derived from an empirical study of ill-formed English sentences (Foster, 2005).",
        "Three types of word substitution errors are produced: agreement errors, real word spelling errors and verb form errors.",
        "Any word that is not an adjective or adverb can be deleted from any position within the input sentence, but some part-of-speech tags are favoured over others, e.g. it is more likely that a determiner will be deleted than a noun.",
        "The error creation procedure can insert an arbitrary word at any position within a sentence but it has a bias towards inserting a word directly after the same word or directly after a word with the same part of speech.",
        "The empirical study also influences the frequency at which particular errors are introduced, with missing word errors being the most frequent, followed by extra word errors, real word spelling errors, agreement errors, and finally, verb form errors.",
        "Table 1 shows examples of the kind of ill-formed sentences that are produced when we apply the procedure to Wall Street Journal sentences.",
        "Generating Trees for Noisy Sentences The tree structures associated with the modified sentences are also modified, but crucially, this modification is minimal, since a truly robust parser should return an analysis for a mildly ungrammatical sentence that remains as similar as possible to the analysis it returns for the original grammatical sentence.",
        "Assume that (1) is an original treebank tree for the sentence A storm is brewing.",
        "Example (2) is then the tree for the ungrammatical sentence containing an is/it confusion.",
        "No part of the original tree structure is changed apart from the yield.",
        "An example of a missing word error is shown in (3) and (4).",
        "A pre-terminal dominating an empty node is introduced into the tree at the point where the word has been omitted.",
        "An example of an extra word error is shown in (5), (6) and (7).",
        "For this example, two ungrammatical trees, (6) and (7), are generated because there are two possible positions in the original tree where the extra word can be inserted which will result in a tree with the yield He likes of the cake and which will not result in the creation of any additional structure."

        "For 4 of the 20 sections in WSJ2-21 , we apply the noise introduction procedure to its own output to create even noisier data.",
        "Our first development set is a noisy version of WSJ00, Noisy00, produced by applying the noise introduction procedure to the 1,921 sentences in WSJ00.",

        "If the sentence is classified as ungrammatical, a version of the parser that has been trained on ungrammatical data is employed.",

        "(2007), the decision tree features are part-of-speech n-gram frequency counts, with n ranging from 2 to 7 and with a subset of the BNC as the frequency reference corpus.",
        "The decision tree is trained on the original WSJ2-21 and the ungrammatical WSJ2-21 .",
        "In the E2prob experiment, the input sentence is parsed with two parsers, the original parser (the E0 parser) and the parser trained on ungrammatical material (either the E1error or the E1mixed parser).",
        "A very simple classifier is used to decide which parser output to choose: if the E1 parser returns a higher parse probability for the most likely tree than the E0 parser, the E1 parser output is returned.",
        "Otherwise the E0 parser output is returned.",
        "The baseline E0 results are in the first column of Table 2.",
        "As expected, the performance of a parser trained on well-formed input degrades when faced with ungrammatical input.",
        "It is also not surprising that its performance is worse on Noisiest00 (-8.8% f-score) than it is on Noisy00 (-4.3%) since the Nois-iest00 sentences contain two errors rather than one.",
        "The E1 results occupy the second and third columns of Table 2.",
        "An up arrow indicates a statistically significant improvement over the baseline results, a down arrow a statistically significant decline and a dash a change which is not statistically significant (p < 0.01).",
        "Training the parser on ungrammatical data has a positive effect on its performance on Noisy00 and Noisiest00 but has a negative effect on its performance on WSJ00.",
        "Training on a combination ofgrammatical and ungrammatical material gives the best results for all three development sets.",
        "Therefore, for the E2 experiments we use the E1mixed parser rather than the E1error parser.",
        "The E2 results are shown in the last two columns of Table 2 and the accuracy of the two classifiers in Table 3.",
        "Over the three test sets, the E2prob classifier outperforms the E2ngram classifier.",
        "Both classifiers misclassify approximately 45% of the Noisy00 sentences.",
        "However, the sentences misclassified by the E2prob classifier are those that are handled well by the E0 parser, and this is reflected in the parsing results for Noisy00.",
