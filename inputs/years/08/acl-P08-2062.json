        "Discourse processing has emerged as a highly relevant source of information for applications such as information extraction and automatic summarisation (Taboada and Mann (2006) outline this and further applications).",
        "But discourse structures cannot always be described completely, either due to genuine ambiguity (Stede, 2004) or to the limitations of a discourse parser.",
        "In either case, only partial information on discourse structure is available.",
        "To handle such information, underspecification formalisms can be used.",
        "Underspecification was originally introduced in computational semantics to model structural ambiguity without disjunctively enumerating the readings, and later applied to discourse parsing (Gardent and Webber, 1998; Schilder, 2002).",
        "However, while the existing algorithms for underspecification processing work well for semantic structures, they were not designed for discourse structures, which can be much larger.",
        "Indeed, it has never been shown that underspecified discourse reprentations (UDRs) can be processed efficiently, since the general-purpose implementations are too slow for that task.",
        "In this paper, we present a new way to implement and process discourse underspecifcation in terms of regular tree grammars (RTGs).",
        "RTGs are used as an underspecifcation formalism in semantics (Koller et al., 2008).",
        "We show how to compute RTGs for discourse from dominance-based under-specifed representations more effciently (by a typical factor of 100) than before.",
        "Furthermore, we show how weighted RTGs can be used to represent constraints and preferences on the discourse structure.",
        "Taking all these results together, we show for the frst time how the globally optimal discourse representation based on some preference model can be computed effciently from an UDR."

        "The NTs in the grammar correspond to subgraphs in the dominance graph: The NT {1;7} represents the subgraph {1,2,3,4,5,6,7} (i.e. the whole graph); the NT { 1 } represents the subgraph containing only the fragment 1; and so forth.",
