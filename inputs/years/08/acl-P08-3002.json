        "Parentheticals are constructions that typically occur embedded in the middle of a clause.",
        "They are not part of the main predicate-argument structure of the sentence and are marked by special punctuation (e.g. parentheses, dashes, commas) in written texts, or by special intonation in speech.",
        "Syntactically, parentheticals can be realized by many different constructions, e.g.: appositive relative clauses (1a), non-restrictive relative clauses (1b), participial clauses (1c) or subordinate clauses (1d).",
        "(1) a The new goal of the Voting Rights Act [more minorities in political office -] is laudable.",
        "(wsj1137) b GE, [which vehemently denies the government's allegations,] denounced Mr. Greenfield's suit.",
        "(wsj0617)",
        "c But most businesses in the Bay area, [including Silicon Valley,] weren't greatly affected.",
        "(wsj1930)",
        "d So far, [instead of teaming up,] GE Capital staffers and Kidder investment bankers have bickered.",
        "(wsj0604)",
        "A common characteristics of parentheticals is that they express information that is not central to the meaning of the overall message conveyed by a text or spoken utterance and since they are specifically marked by punctuation or intonation, they allow the reader to distinguish between more and less important parts of the message.",
        "By structuring information this way, parentheticals make it easier for readers to decode the message conveyed by a text.",
        "Consider for example the following message that has been expressed by two different texts: one without parentheticals (2a) and one that contains two parentheticals (2b).",
        "(2) a Eprex is used by dialysis patients who are anaemic.",
        "Prepulsid is a gastrointestinal drug.",
        "Eprex and Prepulsid did well overseas.",
        "b Eprex, [used by dialysis patients who are anaemic,] and Prepulsid, [a gastrointestinal drug,] did well overseas.",
        "(wsj1156)",
        "Parentheticals have been much studied in linguistics ( see (Dehe and Kavalova, 2007), (Burton-Roberts, 2005) for a recent overview) but so far they have received less attention in computational linguistics.",
        "Only a few studies have attempted a computational analysis of parentheticals, the most recent ones being (Bonami and Godard, 2007) who give an underspecified semantics account of evaluative adverbs in French and (Siddharthan, 2002) who develops a statistical tool for summarisation that separates parentheticals from the sentence they are embedded in.",
        "Both of these studies are limited in their scope as they focus on a very specific type of parentheticals.",
        "From the perspective of natural language generation (NLG), as far as we know, nobody has attempted to give a principled account of parentheti-cals, even though these constructions contribute to the easy readability of generated texts, and therefore could significantly enhance the performance of NLG systems (Scott and Souza, 1990).",
        "Most existing natural language generation systems use rhetorical structure to construct a text plan and map arguments of rhetorical relations onto individual sentences or clauses.",
        "As a result, the arguments of the same rhetorical relation will always occur immediately next to each other, although the surface realization of individual arguments may vary and a clause may appear syntactically embedded within the preceding clause.",
        "This linear succession of rhetorical relations and their arguments makes the generated text appear monotonous and staccato.",
        "As commonly mentioned by style manuals, using different kinds of clause-combining strategies (e.g. semicolons, dash-interpolations, appositives) shows a clearer writing style.",
        "The goal of this research is to give a principled account of parenthetical constructions and incorporate its findings into a natural language generation system."

      "heading": "2. System Architecture",
      "text": [
        "We propose an integrated generation architecture for this purpose which uses a Tree Adjoining Grammar (Joshi, 1987) to represent linguistic information at all levels, including syntax, rhetorical structure and document structure.",
        "Our approach is to make the elementary trees in the grammar as complex as possible, so that constraints on which trees can be combined with each other will be localized in the trees themselves.",
        "By incorporating information about rhetorical structure and document structure into the trees, we are extending the domain of locality of elementary trees as much as possible and this allows the generator to keep the global operations for combining trees as simple as possible.",
        "This approach has been referred to as the 'Complicate Locally, Simplify Globally' principle (Joshi, 2004).",
        "The input to the generator is a set of rhetorical relations and semantic formulas.",
        "For each formula the system selects a set of trees from the grammar, resulting in a number ofpossible tree sets associated with the input.",
        "The next step is to filter out sets of trees that will not lead to a possible realization.",
        "In the current implementation this is achieved by a version of polarity filtering where we associate not only the syntactic categories of root, substitution and foot nodes with a positive or negative value (Gardent and Kow, 2006) but also add the semantic variable associated with these nodes.",
        "The values summed up by polarity filtering are [node, semantic variable] pairs, which represent restrictions on possible syntactic realizations of semantic (or rhetorical) arguments.",
        "Parentheticals often pose a problem for polarity filtering because in many cases there is a shared element between the parenthetical and its host, which normally occurs twice in non-parenthetical realizations of the same input, but only once when there is a parenthetical.",
        "(e.g., in (2a) the NP 'Eprex' occurs twice, but only once in (2b)).",
        "In order to allow for this variation, when summing up the values for substitution and root nodes we consider multiple occurrences of NP substitution nodes associated with the same semantic variable as if they were a single instance.",
        "This results in one or more NP substitution nodes left empty at the end of the derivation, which are then filled with a pronoun by a referring expression module at the final stage of the generation process."
