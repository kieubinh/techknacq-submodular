        "Proper processing is especially relevant in news, where multiple disparate events may be described within one news article, and it is necessary to identify the separate timepoints of each event.",
        "Event descriptions may be confined to one sentence, which we establish as our text unit, or be spread over many, thus forcing us to assign all sentences an activity time.",
        "However, only 20%-30% of sentences contain an explicit temporal expression, thus leaving the vast majority of sentences without temporal information.",
        "A similar proportion is reported in Mani et al.",
        "(2003), with only 25% of clauses containing explicit temporal expressions.",
        "The sparsity of these expressions poses a real challenge.",
        "Therefore, a method for efficiently and accurately utilizing temporal expressions to infer activity times for the remaining 70%-80% of sentences with no temporal information is necessary.",
        "This paper proposes a domain-independent machine-learning based approach to assign activity times to events in news without deferring to the publication date.",
        "Posing the problem in an information retrieval framework, we model events by applying topic models to news, providing a way to automatically distribute temporal information to all sentences.",

        "To address the aforementioned issues of sparsity while relieving dependence on article structure, we treat event discovery as a clustering problem.",
        "Clustering methods have previously been used for event identification (Hatzivassiloglou et al., 2000; Sid-dharthan et al., 2004).",
        "After a topic model of news text is created, sentences are clustered into topics where each topic represents a specific event.",
        "This allows us to utilize all available temporal information in each cluster to distribute to all the sentences within that cluster, thus allowing for assigning ofac-tivity times to sentences without explicit temporal expressions.",
        "Our key assumption is that similar sentences describe the same event.",
        "Our approach is based on information retrieval techniques, so we subsequently use the standard language of text collections.",
        "We may refer to sentences, or clusters of sentences created from a topic model as 'documents', and a collection of sentences, or collection of clusters of sentences from one or more news articles as a 'corpus'.",
        "We use Latent Dirich-let Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003), a generative model for describing collections of text corpora, which represents each document as a mixture over a set of topics, where each topic has associated with it a distribution over words.",
        "Topics are shared by all documents in the corpus, but the topic distribution is assumed to come from a Dirichlet distribution.",
        "LDA allows documents to be composed of multiple topics with varying proportions, thus capturing multiple latent patterns.",
        "Depending on the words present in each document, we associate it with one of N topics, where N is the number of latent topics in the model.",
        "We assign each document to the topic which has the highest probability of having generated that document.",
        "We expect document similarity in a cluster to be fairly high, as evidenced by document modeling performance in Blei et al.",
        "(2003).",
        "Since each cluster is a collection of similar documents, with our assumption that similar documents describe the same event, we conclude that each cluster represents a specific event.",
        "Thus, if at least one sentence in an event cluster contains an explicit temporal expression, we can distribute that activity time to other sentences in the cluster using an inference algorithm we explain in the next section.",

        "For the purposes of this experiment we took the union of the possible dates mentioned in a sentence as acceptable activity times, thus both the report statement date and the date mentioned in the report are correct activity times for the sentence.",
        "Future work will investigate whether we can discriminate between these two dates.",
        "Our approach relies on prior automatic linguistic processing of the articles by the Proteus system (Gr-ishman et al., 2005).",
        "The articles are annotated with time expression tags, which assign values to both absolute \"July 16, 2006\" and relative \"now\" temporal expressions.",
        "Although present, our approach does not currently use activity time ranges, such as \"past 2 weeks\" or \"recent days\".",
        "The articles are also given entity identification tags, which assigns a unique intra-article id to entities of the types specified in the ACE 2005 evaluation.",
        "For example, both \"they\" - an anaphoric reference - and \"police officers\" are recognized as referring to the same real-world entity.",
        "From this point on unless otherwise noted, reference to news articles indicates one of the three sets of news articles, not the complete set.",
        "We begin by breaking news articles into their constituent sentences, which are our 'documents', the collection of them being our 'corpus', and indexing the documents.",
        "We use the bag-of-words assumption to represent each document as an unordered collection of words.",
        "This allows the representation of each document as a word vector.",

        "Accordingly, we combine the feature vector representations of the single sentences in an event cluster into one feature vector, forming an aggregate of all their features.",
        "Although at this stage we have everything we need to infer activity times, our approach allows incorporating information from multiple articles.",
        "To represent events over multiple articles, we suggest two methods for Inter-Article (IRA) topic modeling.",
        "The first, IRA.1, is to combine the articles and treat them as one large article.",
        "This allows processing as described in IAA, with the exception that event clusters may contain sentences from multiple articles.",
        "The second, IRA.2, builds on IAA models of single articles and uses them to construct an IRA model.",
        "The IRA.2 model is constructed over a corpus of documents containing event clusters, allowing a grouping of event clusters from multiple articles.",
        "Event clusters may now be composed of sentences describing the same event from multiple articles, thus increasing our pool of explicit temporal expressions available for inference.",
        "To accurately infer activity times of all sentences, it is crucial to properly utilize the available temporal expressions in the event clusters formed in the IRA or IAA models.",
        "Our proposed inference algorithm is a starting point for further work.",
        "We use the most frequent activity time present in an event cluster as the value to assign all the sentences in that event cluster.",

        "If there is no majority time and no tie in the event cluster, then each of the sentences with a temporal expression retains its activity time, but no information is distributed to the other sentences.",

        "Future work will explore a richer feature set, including such features as cross-document entity identification information, linguistic features, and outside semantic knowledge to increase robustness of the feature vectors.",
        "Finally, the optimal model parameters are currently selected by an oracle, however, we hope to further evaluate our approach on a larger dataset in order to determine how to automatically select the optimal parameters."

        "This paper presented a novel approach for inferring activity times for all sentences in a text.",
        "We demonstrate we can produce reasonable event representations in an unsupervised fashion using LDA, posing event discovery as a clustering problem, and that event clusters can further be used to distribute temporal information to the sentences which lack explicit temporal expressions.",
        "Our approach achieves 90%, 88.7%, and 68.7% accuracy, outperforming the baseline set forth in two cases.",
        "Although differences prevent a direct comparison, Mani and Wilson (2000) achieved an accuracy of 59.4% on 694 verb occurrences using their baseline method, Fi-latova and Hovy (2001) achieved 82% accuracy on time-stamping clauses for a single type of event on accuracy in their algorithm for computing a reference time for 2069 clauses.",
        "Future work will improve upon the majority criteria used in the inference algorithm, on creating more accurate event representations, and on determining optimal model parameters automatically."
