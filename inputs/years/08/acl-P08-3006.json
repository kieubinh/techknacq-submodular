        "One-on-one tutoring has been shown to be a very effective form of instruction (Bloom, 1984).",
        "The research community is working on discovering the characteristics of tutoring.",
        "One of the goals is to understand the strategies tutors use, in order to design effective learning environments and tools to support learning.",
        "Among the tools, particular attention is given to Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs), which are sophisticated software systems that can provide personalized instruction to students, in some respect similar to one-on-one tutoring (Beck et al., 1996).",
        "Many of these systems have been shown to be very effective (Evens and Michael, 2006; Van Lehn et al., 2005; Di Eugenio et al., 2005; Mitrovic et al., 2004; Person et al., 2001).",
        "In many experiments, ITSs induced learning gains higher than those measured in a classroom environment, but lower than those obtained with one-on-one interactions with human tutors.",
        "The belief of the research community is that knowing more about human tutoring would help improve the design of ITSs.",
        "In particular, the effective use of natural language might be a key element.",
        "In most of the studies mentioned above, systems with more sophisticated language interfaces performed better than other experimental conditions.",
        "An important form of student-tutor interaction is feedback.",
        "Negative feedback can be provided by the tutor in response to students' mistakes.",
        "An effective use of negative feedback can help the student correct a mistake and prevent him/her from repeating the same or a similar mistake again, effectively providing a learning opportunity to the student.",
        "Positive feedback is usually provided in response to some correct input from the student.",
        "Positive feedback can help students reinforce the correct knowledge they already have, or successfully integrate new knowledge, if the correct input provided by the student was originated by a random or tentative step.",
        "The goal of this study is to assess the relevance of positive feedback in tutoring, and build a computational model of positive feedback that can be implemented in ITSs.",
        "Even though some form of positive feedback is present in many successful ITSs, the predominant type of feedback generated by those systems is negative feedback, as those systems are designed to react to students mistakes.",
        "To date, there is no systematic study of the role of positive feedback in ITSs in the literature.",
        "However, there is an increasing amount of evidence that suggests that positive feedback may be very important in enhancing students' learning.",
        "In a detailed study in a controlled environment and domain, the letter pattern extrapolation task, Corrigan-Halpern (2006) found that subjects given positive feedback performed better in an assessment task than subjects receiving negative feedback.",
        "In another study on the same domain, Lu (2007) found that the ratio of the positive over negative messages in her corpus of expert tutoring dialogues is about 4 to 1, and the ratio is even higher in the messages presented by her successful ITS modeled after an expert tutor, being about 10 to 1.",
        "In the dataset subject of this study, which is on a completely different domain – Computer Science data structures – such a high ratio of positive over negative feedback messages still holds, in the order of about 8 to 1.",
        "In a recent study, Barrow et al.",
        "(2008) showed that a version of their SQL-Tutor enriched with positive feedback generation helped students learn faster than another version of the same system delivering negative feedback only.",
        "What might be the educational value of positive feedback in ITSs?",
        "First of all, positive feedback may be an effective motivational technique (Lepper et al., 1997).",
        "Positive feedback can also have cognitive value.",
        "In a problem solving setting, the student can make a tentative (maybe random) step towards the correct solution.",
        "At this point, positive feedback from the tutor may be important in helping the student consolidate this step and learn from it.",
        "Some researchers outlined the importance of self-explanation in learning (Chi, 1996; Renkl, 2002).",
        "Positive feedback has the potential to improve self-explanation, in terms of quantity and effectiveness.",
        "Another issue is how students perceive and accept feedback (Weaver, 2006), and, in the case of automated tutoring systems, whether students read feedback messages at all (Heift, 2001).",
        "Positive feedback might also make students more willing to accept help and advice from the tutor."

        "Also, the interaction with a computer system is mostly student-driven, whereas our human protocols show a clear predominance of the tutor in the conversation.",
        "In the CS protocols, on average, 94% of the words belong to the tutor, and most of the tutors' discourse is some form of direct instruction.",
        "On the other hand, the interaction with the system will mostly consist of actions that students make to solve the problems that they will be asked to solve, with few interventions from the system.",
        "An interesting analysis that could be done on the logs is the discovery of sequential patterns using data mining algorithms, such as MS-GSP (Liu, 2006).",
        "Such patterns could then be regressed against learning outcomes, in order to assess their correlation with learning.",
        "After the relevant features are discovered, a computational model of positive feedback will be built and integrated into iList.",
        "The model will encode knowledge extracted with machine learning approaches, and such knowledge will inform a discourse planner, responsible of organizing and generating appropriate positive feedback.",
        "The choiche of the specific machine learning and discourse planning methods will require extensive empirical investigation.",
        "Specifically, among the different machine learning methods, some are able to provide some sort of human-readable symbolic model, which can be inspected to gain some insights on how the model works.",
        "Decision trees and association rules belong to this category.",
        "Other methods provide a less readable, black-box type of models, but they may be very useful and effective as well.",
        "Examples of such methods include Neural Networks and Markov Models.",
        "The ultimate goal of this research is to get both an effective model and to gain insights on tutoring.",
        "Thus, both classes of machine learning methods will be tried, with the goal of finding a balance between model effectiveness and model readability.",
        "Finally, the system with enhanced feedback capabilities will be deployed and evaluated."
