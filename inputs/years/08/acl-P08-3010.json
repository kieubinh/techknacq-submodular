        "A growing body of research focuses therefore on automatic acquisition of lexical resources from text corpora.",
        "One useful type of lexical information for NLP is the number and type of the arguments of predicates.",
        "These are typically expressed in simple syntactic frames called subcategorization frames (SCFs).",
        "SCFs can be useful for many NLP applications, such as parsing (John Carroll and Briscoe, 1998) or information extraction (Surdeanu et al., 2003).",
        "Automatic acquisition of SCFs has therfore been an active research area since the mid-90s (Manning, 1993; Brent, 1993; Briscoe and Carroll, 1997).",
        "Comprehensive subcategorization information is currently not available for most languages.",
        "French is one of these languages: although manually built syntax dictionaries do exist (Gross, 1975; van den Eynde and Mertens, 2006; Sagot et al., 2006) none of them are ideal for computational use and none also provide frequency information important for statistical NLP.",
        "We developed ASSCI, a system capable of extracting large subcategorization lexicons for French verbs from raw corpus data.",
        "Our system is based on a approach similar to that of the well-known Cambridge subcategorization acquisition system for English (Briscoe and Carroll, 1997; Preiss et al., 2007).",
        "The main difference is that unlike the Cambridge system, our system does not employ a set of predefined SCF types, but learns the latter dynamically from corpus data.",
        "We have recently used ASSCI to acquire LexSchem - a large subcategorization lexicon for French verbs - from a raw journalistic corpus.",
        "and have made the resulting resource freely available to the community on the web (Messiant et al., 2008).",
        "We describe our SCF acquisition system in section 2 and explain the acquisition of a large subcat-egorization lexicon for French and its evaluation in section 3.",

        "Previous experiments focussed on a limited set of verbs (Chesley and Salmon-Alt, 2006), or were based on treebanks or on substantial manual work (Gross, 1975;KupsC, 2007).",
        "The system works in three steps:",
        "1. verbs and surrounding phrases are extracted from parsed corpus data;",
        "2. tentative SCFs are built dynamically, based on morpho-syntactic information and relations between the verb and its arguments;",
        "3. a statistical filter is used to filter out incorrect frames.",
        "When aiming to build a large lexicon for general language, the input data should be large, balanced and representative enough.",
        "Our system tags and lemmatizes input data using TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994) and then syntactically analyses it using Syn-tex (Bourigault et al., 2005).",
        "The TreeTagger is a statistical, language independent tool for the automatic annotation of part-of-speech and lemma information.",

        "This is ideal for us since no lexical information should be used when the task is to acquire it.",

        "Because our aim was to acquire a large general lexicon, we require the minimum of 200 occurrences per each verb we analysed using this system.",
        "3267 verbs were found with more than 200 occurrences in the corpus.",
        "From the data for these verbs, we induced 286 distinct SCF types.",
        "We have made the extracted lexicon freely available on the web (http://www-lipn.univ-paris13.",
        "fr/~messiant/lexschem.html) under the LGPL-LR (Lesser General Public License For Linguistic Resources) license.",
        "An interface which enables viewing the SCFs acquired for each verb and the verbs taking different SCFs is also available at the same address.",

        "Direct evaluation of subcategorization acquisition performance against a gold standard based on a manmade dictionary is not ideal (see e.g. (Poibeau and Messiant, 2008)).",
        "However, this method is still the easiest and fastest way to get an idea of the performance of the system.",
        "We built a gold standard using the SCFs found in the Tresor de la Langue Française Informatise (TFLI), a large French dictionary available on the web.",
        "We evaluated 25 verbs listed in Appendix to evaluate our system.",
        "These verbs were chosen for their heterogeneity in terms of semantic and syntactic features, but also because of their varied frequency in the corpus (from 200 to 100.000 occurences).",
        "We calculated type precision, type recall and F-measure for these 25 verbs.",
        "We obtain the best results (0.822 precision, 0.587 recall and 0.685 f-measure) with the MLE threshold of 0.032 (see fig-",

        "A simple threshold on the relative frequencies improves the results dramatically (ASSCI-1).",
        "Each step of the acquisition process generates errors.",
        "For example, some nouns are tagged as a verb by TreeTagger (e.g., in the phrase \"Le programme d'armement (weapons program)\", \"programme\" is tagged verb).",
        "Syntex generates errors when identifying dependencies: in some cases, it fails to identify relevant dependencies; in other cases incorrect dependencies are generated.",
        "The SCF builder is another source of error because of the ambiguity or the lack of sufficient information to build some frames (e.g. those involving pronouns).",
        "Finally, the filtering module rejects some correct SCFs and accept some incorrect ones.",
        "We could reduce these errors by improving the filtering method or refining the thresholds.",
        "Many of the errors involve intransitive SCFs.",
        "We tried to address this problem with an INTRANS-specific threshold which is higher than others (see the results for ASSCI-2).",
        "This improves the precision of the system slightly but does not substantially reduce the number of false negatives.",
        "The intransitive form of verbs is very frequent in corpus data but it doesn't appear in the gold standard.",
        "A better evaluation (e.g., a gold standard based on manual analysis of the corpus data and annotation for SCFs) should not yield these errors.",
        "In other cases (e.g. interpolated clauses), the parser is incapable of finding the dependencies.",
        "In subsequent work we plan to use an improved version of Syntex which deals with this problem.",
        "Our results (ASSCI-2) are similar with those obtained by the only directly comparable work for",
        "French (Chesley and Salmon-Alt, 2006) (0.87 precision and 0.54 recall).",
        "However, the lexicons show still room for improvement, especially with recall.",
        "In addition to the improvements in the method and evaluation suggested above, we plan to evaluate whether lexicons resulting from our system are useful for NLP tasks and applications.",

        "Most previous subcategorization lexicons for French were built manually.",

        "This dictionary is not easy to employ for NLP use but work in progress is aimed at addressing this problem (Gardent et al., 2005).",
        "The Lefff is a morphological and syntactic lexicon that contains partial subcategorization information (Sagot et al., 2006), while Dicovalence is a manually built valency dictionnary based on the pronominal approach (van den Eynde and Blanche-Benveniste, 1978; van den Eynde and Mertens, 2006).",
        "There are also lexicons built using semi-automatic approaches e.g., the acquisition of subcategorization information from treebanks (Kupsc, 2007).",
        "Experiments have been made on the automatic acquisition of subcategorization frames since mid 1990s (Brent, 1993; Briscoe and Carroll, 1997).",
        "The first experiments were performed on English but since the beginning of 2000s the approach has been successfully applied to various other languages.",
        "For example, (Schulte im Walde, 2002) has induced a subcategorization lexicon for German verbs from a lexicalized PCFG.",
        "Our approach is quite similar to the work done in Cambridge.",
        "The Cambridge system has been regularly improved and evaluated; and it represents the state-of-the-art perfomance on the task (Briscoe and Carroll, 1997; Korhonen et al., 2000; Preiss et al., 2007).",
        "In the latest paper, the authors show that the method can be successfully applied to acquire SCFs not only for verbs but also for nouns and adjectives (Preiss et al., 2007).",
        "A major difference between these related works and ours is the fact that we do not use a predefined set of SCFs.",
        "Of course, the number of frames depends on the language, the corpus, the domain and the information taken into account (for example, (Preiss et al., 2007) used a list of 168 predefined frames for English which abstract over lexically-governed prepositions).",
        "As far as we know, the only directly comparable work on subcategorization acquisition for French is (Chesley and Salmon-Alt, 2006) who propose a method for acquiring SCFs from a multi-genre corpus in French.",
        "Their work relies on the VISL parser which have an \"unevaluated (and potentially high) error rate\" while our system relies on Syntex which is, according to the EASY evaluation campaign, the best parser for French (as evaluated on general newspaper corpora).",
        "Additionally, we acquired a large subcategorization lexicon (available on the web) (286 distinct SCFs for 3267 verbs) whereas (Chesley and Salmon-Alt, 2006) produced only 27 SCFs for 104 verbs and didn't produce any lexicon for public release."
