        "Many research organisations organise their websites as a tree (e.g., department pages – research group pages – researcher pages).",
        "Individual researchers take responsibility for maintaining their own web pages and, in addition, researchers are organised into research groups that also maintain a web page.",
        "In this framework, information easily gets outdated, and publications lists generally stay more up-to-date than research summaries.",
        "Also, as individuals maintain their own web pages, connections between researchers in the organisation are often hard to find; a surfer then needs to move up and down the tree hierarchy to browse the profiles of different people.",
        "Browsing is also difficult because individual web pages are organised differently, since standardised stylesheets are often considered inappropriate for diverse organisations.",
        "Research summary pages using stylesheets can offer alternative methods of information access and browsing, aiding navigation and providing different views for different user needs, but these are time-consuming to create and maintain by hand.",
        "We are exploring the idea of automatically generated and updated web pages that accurately reflect the research interests being pursued within a research institution.",
        "We take as input existing personal pages from the Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge, that contain publication lists in html.",
        "In our automatically generated pages, content (a research summary) is extracted from publication titles, and hence stays up-to-date provided individual researchers maintain their publication lists.",
        "Note that publication information is increasingly available through other sources, such as Google Scholar.",
        "We aim to format information in a way that facilitates browsing; a screen shot is shown in Figure 1 for the researcher Frank Stajano, who is a member of the Security and DTG research groups.",
        "The left of the page contains links to researchers of the same research groups and the middle contains a research profile in the form of lists of key phrases presented in five year intervals (by publication date).",
        "In addition, the right of the page contains a list of recommendations: other researchers with similar research interests.",
        "Web pages for research groups are created by summarising the research profiles of individual members.",
        "In addition, we present a novel interactive visualisation that we have developed for displaying collaborations with the rest of the world.",
        "In this paper we describe our methodology for identifying terms, clustering them and then creating research summaries (§2) and a generative summariser of collaborations (§4) that plugs into a novel visualisation (§3).",

        "There are four elements that each sentence contains – names of researchers in research group, names of researchers at location, terms that summarise the collaboration, and years of collaboration.",
        "Our summaries are produced by an iterative process of clustering and summarising.",
        "In the first step, terms (key phrases) are extracted from all the papers that have co-authors in the location.",
        "Each term is tagged with the year(s) of publication and the names of researchers involved.",
        "These terms are then clustered based on the similarity of words in the terms and the similarity of their authors.",
        "Each such cluster contributes one sentence to the summary.",
        "The clustering process is pragmatic; the four sentence per summary limit means that at most four clusters should be formed.",
        "This means coarser clustering (fewer and larger clusters) for locations with many collaborations and finer-grained (more and smaller clusters) for locations with fewer collaborations.",
        "The next step is to generate a sentence from each cluster.",
        "In this step, the terms in a sentence cluster are reclustered according to their date tag.",
        "then each time period is realised separately within the sentence, for example:",
        "Lawrence C Paulson collaborated with Cristiano Longo and Giampaolo Bella from 1997 to 2003 on 'formal verification', 'industrial payment and non-repudiation protocol', 'kerberos authentication system' and 'secrecy goals' and in 2006 on 'cardholder registration in Set' and 'accountability protocols'.",
        "To make the summaries more readable, lists of conjunctions are restricted to a maximum length of four.",
        "Terms are incorporated into the list in decreasing order of frequency of occurrence.",
        "Splitting the sentence above into two time periods allows for the inclusion of more terms, without violating the restriction on list length.",
        "This form of sentence splitting is also pragmatic and is performed more aggressively in summaries with fewer sentences, having the effect of making short summaries slightly longer.",
        "Another method for increasing the number of terms is by aggregating similar terms.",
        "In the example below, three terms (video mail retrieval, information retrieval and document retrieval) are aggregated into one term.",
        "Thus six terms have made it to the clause, while keeping to the four terms per list limit.",
        "In the mid 1990s, K Sparck Jones, S J Young and M G Brown collaborated with J T Foote on 'video mail, information and document retrieval', 'cambridge/olivetti retrieval system', 'multimedia documents' and 'broadcast news'.",

        "Our summarisation strategy mirrors the multi-document summarisation strategy of Barzilay (2003), where sentences in the input documents are clustered according to their similarity.",
        "Larger clusters represent information that is repeated more often; hence the size of a cluster is indicative of importance.",
        "The novelty of our application is that this strategy has been used at a sub-sentential level, to summarise terms that are then used to generate sentences.",
        "While there has been research on generative summarisation, much of this has been focused on sentence extraction followed by some rewrite operation (e.g., sentence shortening (Vanderwende et al., 2007; Zajic et al., 2006; Conroy et al., 2004), aggregation (Barzilay, 2003) or reference regeneration (Siddharthan et al., 2004; Nenkova and McKeown, 2003)).",
        "In contrast, our system does not extract sentences at all; rather, it extracts terms from paper titles and our summaries are produced by clustering, summarising, aggregating and generalising over sets of terms and people.",
        "Our space constraints are dictated by by our visualisation interface, and our program employs pragmatic clustering and generalisation based on the amount of information it needs to summarise."
