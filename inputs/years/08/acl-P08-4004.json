      "heading": "1. Introduction",
      "text": [
        "In the last 20 years, a number of tools have been developed to facilitate the human annotation of text.",
        "These have been necessary where software for automatic annotation has not been available, e.g., for linguistic patterns which are not easily identified by machine, or for languages without sufficient linguistic resources.",
        "The vast majority of these annotation tools have been developed for particular projects, and have thus not been readily adaptable to different annotation problems.",
        "Often, the annotation scheme has been built into the software, or the software has been limited in that they allow only certain types of annotation to take place.",
        "A small number of systems have however been developed to be general purpose text annotation systems, e.g., MMAX-2 (Müller and Strube 2006), GATE (Cunningham et al. 2002), WordFreak (Morton and LaCivita 2003) and Knowtator (Ogren 2006).",
        "With the exception of the last of these however, these systems are generally aimed at technically advanced users.",
        "WordFreak, for instance, requires writing of Java code to adapt to a different annotation scheme.",
        "Users of MMAX-2 need to edit XML by hand to provide annotation schemes.",
        "Gate allows editing of annotation schemes within the tool, but it is a very complex system, and lacks clear documentation to help the novice user become competent.",
        "The UAM CorpusTool is a text annotation tool primarily aimed at the linguist or computational linguist who does not program, and would rather spend their time annotating text than learning how to use the system.",
        "The software is thus designed from the ground up to support typical user workflow, and everything the user needs to perform annotation tasks is included within the software."

      "heading": "2. The Project Window",
      "text": [
        "In the majority of cases, the annotator is interested in annotating a range of texts, not just single texts.",
        "Additionally, in most cases annotation at multiple linguistic levels is desired (e.g., classifying the text as a whole, tagging sections of text by function (e.g., abstract, introduction, etc.",
        "), tagging sentences/clauses, and tagging participants in clauses.",
        "To overcome the complexity of dealing with multiple source files annotated at multiple levels, the main window of the CorpusTool is thus a window for project management (see Figure 1).",

        "This window allows the user to add new annotation layers to the project, and edit/extend the annotation scheme for each layer (by clicking on the \"edit\" button shown with each layer panel).",

        "The scheme is edited graphically, adding, renaming, moving or deleting features, adding new sub-distinctions, etc.",
        "See Figure 3.",
        "An important feature of the tool is that any change to the coding scheme is automatically propagated throughout all files annotated at this layer.",
        "For instance, if a feature is renamed in the scheme editor, it is also renamed in all annotation files.",
        "The user can also associate a gloss with each tag, and during annotation, the gloss associated with each feature can be viewed to help the coder determine which tag to assign.",

        "When the user creates a new segment (by swiping text) or selects an existing segment, the space below the text window shows controls to select the tags to assign to this segment.",
        "Tags are drawn from the tag scheme for the current layer.",
        "Since the tag hierarchy allows cross-classification, multiple tags are assigned to the segment.",
        "CorpusTool allows for partially overlapping segments, and embedding of segments.",
        "Annotated texts are stored using stand-off XML, one file per source text and layer.",
        "See Figure 4 for a sample.",
        "The software does not currently input from or export to any of the various text encoding standards, but will be extended to do so as it becomes clear which standards users want supported.",
        "Currently the tool only supports assigning tags to text.",

        "Searches can also retrieve segments \"containing\" segments.",
        "One can also search for segments containing a string.",
        "Where a lexicon is provided (currently only English), users can search for segments containing lexical patterns, for instance, clause containing 'be% @participle' would return all clause segments containing any inflection of 'be' immediately followed by any participle verb (i.e. most of the passive clauses).",
        "Since dictionaries are used, the text does not need to be pre-tagged with a POS tagger, which may be unreliable on texts of a different nature to those on which the tagger was trained.",

        "Since stand-off annotation is used for both text and image, much of the code-base is common between the two applications.",
        "The major differences are: i) a different annotation widget is used for text selection than for image selection; ii) segments in text are defined by a tuple: (startchar, endchar), while image segments are defined by a tuple of points ( (startx,starty), (endx,endy)), and iii) search in images is restricted to tag searching, while text can be searched for strings and lexical patterns."

        "Future work will add structural tagging, including co-reference linking, rhetorical structuring and syntactic structuring.",
        "The use of the tool is rapidly spreading: in the first 15 months of availability, the tool has been downloaded 17GG times, to 11GG distinct CPUs (with only minimal advertisement).",
