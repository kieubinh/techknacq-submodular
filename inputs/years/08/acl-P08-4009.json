        "This paper describes the online demo of the QuALiM Question Answering system (http://demos.inf.ed.ac.uk:8080/qualim/).",
        "We will refrain from describing QuALiM's answer finding strategies-our work on QuALiM has been described in several papers in the last few years, especially Kaisser and Becker (2004) and Kaisser et al.",
        "(2006) are suitable to get an overview over the system-but concentrate on one new feature that was developed especially for this web demo: In order to improve user benefit, answers are supplemented with relevant passages from the online encyclopedia Wikipedia.",
        "We see two main benefits:",
        "1.",
        "Users are presented with additional information closely related to their actual information need and thus of potential high interest.",
        "2.",
        "The returned text passages present the answer in context and thus help users to validate the answer-there always will be the odd case where a system returns a wrong result.",
        "Historically, our system is web-based, receiving its answers by querying major search engines and post processing their results.",
        "In order to satisfy TREC requirements-which require participants to return the ID of one document from the AQUAINT corpus that supports the answer itself (Voorhees, 2004)-we already experimented with answer projection strategies in our TREC participations in recent years.",
        "For this web demo we use Wikipedia instead of the AQUAINT corpus for several reasons:",
        "1.",
        "QuALiM is an open domain Question Answering system and Wikipedia is an \"open domain\" Encyclopedia; it aims to cover all areas of interest as long as they are of some general interest.",
        "2.",
        "Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia.",
        "Other than the AQUAINT corpus, there are no legal problems when using it for a public demo.",
        "3.",
        "Wikipedia is frequently updated, whereas the AQUAINT corpus remains static and thus contains a lot of outdated information.",
        "Another advantage of Wikipedia is that the information contained is much more structured.",
        "As we will see, this structure can be exploited to improve performance when finding answers or-as in our case-projecting answers."

      "text": [
        "In the fields of Question Answering and Web Search, the issue how answers/results should be presented is a vital one.",
        "Nevertheless, as of today, the majority of QA system-which a few notable exceptions, e.g. MIT's START (Katz et al., 2002)-are",
        "Figure 1: Screenshot of QuALiM's response to the question \"How many Munros are there in Scotland?\"",
        "The green bar to the left indicates that the system is confident to have found the right answer, which is shown in bold: \"284\".",
        "Furthermore, one Wikipedia paragraph which contains additional information of potential interest to the user is displayed.",
        "In this paragraph the sentence containing the answer is highlighted.",
        "This display of context also allows the user to validate the answer.",
        "still experimental and research-oriented and typically only return the answer itself.",
        "Yet it is highly doubtful that this is the best strategy.",
        "Lin et al.",
        "(2003) performed a study with 32 computer science students comparing four types of answer context: exact answer, answer-in-sentence, answer-in-paragraph, and answer-in-document.",
        "Since they were interested in interface design, they worked with a system that answered all questions correctly.",
        "They found that 53% of all participants preferred paragraph-sized chunks, 23% preferred full documents, 20% preferred sentences, and one participant preferred exact answer.",
        "Web search engines typically show results as a list of titles and short snippets that summarize how the retrieved document is related to the query terms, often called query-biased summaries (Tombros and Sanderson, 1998).",
        "Recently, Kaisser et al.",
        "(2008) conducted a study to test whether users would prefer search engine results of different lengths (phrase, sentence, paragraph, section or article) and whether the optimal response length could be predicted by human judges.",
        "They find that judges indeed prefer different response lengths for different types of queries and that these can be predicted by other judges.",
        "In this demo, we opted for a slightly different, yet related approach: The system does not decide on one answer length, but always presents a combination of three different lengths to the user (see Figure 1): The answer itself (usually a phrase), is presented in bold.",
        "Additionally, a paragraph relating the answer to the question is shown, and in this paragraph one sentence containing the answer is highlighted.",
        "Note also, that each paragraph contains a link that takes the user to the Wikipedia article, should he/she want to know more about the subject.",
        "The intention behind this mode of presentation is to prominently display the piece of information the user is most interested in, but also to present context information and to furthermore provide options for the user to find out more about the topic, should he/she want to."

        "We use Lucene (Hatcher and Gospodnetic, 2004) to index the publically available Wikipedia dumps (see http://download.wikimedia.org/).",
        "The text inside the dump is broken down into paragraphs and each paragraph functions as a Lucene document.",
        "The data of each paragraph is stored in three fields: Title, which contains the title of the Wikipedia article the paragraph is from, Headers, which lists the title and all section and subsection headings indicating the position of the paragraph in the article and Text, which stores the text of the article.",
        "An example can be seen in Table 1.",
        "As mentioned, QuALiM finds answers by querying major search engines.",
        "After post processing, a list of answer candidates, each one associated with a confidence value, is output.",
        "For the question \"Who is Tom Cruise married to?",
        "\", for example, we get:",
        "The way we find supporting paragraphs for these answers is probably best explained by giving an example.",
        "Figure 3 shows the Lucene query we use for the mentioned question and answer candidates.",
        "(The numbers behind the terms indicate query weights.)",
        "As can be seen, we initially build two separate queries for the Headers and the Text fields (compare Table 1).",
        "In a later processing step, both queries are combined into a single query using Lucene's MultipleFieldQueryCreator class.",
        "Note also that both answer candidates (\"Katie Holmes\" and \"Nicole Kidman\") are included in this one query.",
        "This is done because of speed issues: In our setup, each query takes up roughly two seconds of processing time.",
        "The complexity and length of a query on the other hand has very little impact on speed.",
        "The type of question influences the query building process in a fundamental manner.",
        "For the question \"When was Franz Kafka born?\"",
        "and the correct answer \"July 3, 1883\", for example, it is reasonable to search for an article with title \"Franz Kafka\" and to expect the answer in the text on that page.",
        "For the question \"Who invented the automobile?\"",
        "on the other hand, it is more reasonable to search the information on a page called \"Karl Benz\" (the answer to the question).",
        "In order to capture this behaviour we developed a set of rules that for different type of questions, increases or decreases constituents' weights in either the Headers or the Text field.",
        "Additionally, during question analysis, certain question constituents are marked as either Topic or Focus (see Moldovan et al., (1999)).",
        "For the earlier example question \"Tom Cruise\" becomes the Topic while \"married\" is marked Focus.",
        "These also influence constituents' weights in the different fields:",
        "• Constituents marked as Topic are generally expected to be found in the Headers field.",
        "After all, the topic marks what the question is about.",
        "In a similar manner, titles and subtitles help to structure an article, assisting the user to navigate to the place where the relevant information is most likely to be found: A paragraph's titles and subtitles indicate what the paragraph is about.",
        "• Constituents marked as Focus are generally expected to be found in the text, especially if they are verbs.",
        "The focus indicates what the question asks for, and such information can usually rather be expected in the text than in titles or subtitles.",
        "Figure 3 also shows that, if we recognize named entities (especially person names) in the question or answer strings, we once include each named entity as a quoted string and additionally add the words it contains separately.",
        "This is to boost documents which contain the complete name as used in the question or the answer, but also to allow documents which contain variants of these names, e.g. \"Thomas Cruise Mapother IV\".",
        "The formula to determine the exact boost factor for each query term is complex and a matter of ongoing development.",
        "It additionally depends on the following criteria:",
        "• Named entities receive a higher weight.",
        "• Capitalized words or constituents receive a higher weight.",
        "• The confidence value associated with the answer candidate influences the boost factor.",
