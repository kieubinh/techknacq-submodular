        "Self-training methods Self-training methods use the labeled data to train an initial model and then use that model to label the unlabeled data and retrain a new model.",
        "We will examine in detail the co-training method of Blum and Mitchell [2], including the assumptions it makes, and two applications of co-training to NLP data.",
        "Another popular self-training method treats the labels of the unlabeled data as hidden and estimates a single model from labeled and unlabeled data.",
        "We explore new methods in this framework that make use of declarative linguistic side information to constrain the solutions found using unlabeled data [3].",
        "Graph regularization methods Graph regularization methods build models based on a graph on instances, where edges in the graph indicate similarity.",
        "The regularization constraint is one of smoothness along this graph.",
        "We wish to find models that perform well on the training data, but we also regularize so that unlabeled nodes which are similar according to the graph have similar labels.",
        "For this section, we focus in detail on the Gaussian fields method of Zhu etal.",
        "[4].",
        "Structural learning Structural learning [1] uses un-labeled data to find a new, reduced-complexity hypothesis space by exploiting regularities in feature space via unlabeled data.",
        "If this new hypothesis space still contains good hypotheses for our supervised learning problem, we may achieve high accuracy with much less training data.",
        "The regularities we use come in the form of lexical features that function similarly for prediction.",
        "This section will focus on the assumptions behind structural learning, as well as applications to tagging and sentiment analysis."
