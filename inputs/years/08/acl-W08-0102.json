        "The fundamental task for any spoken dialogue system is to determine how to respond at any given time to a user's utterance.",
        "The challenge of understanding and correctly responding to a user's natural language utterance is formidable even when the words have been perfectly transcribed.",
        "However, dialogue system designers face a greater challenge because the speech recognition hypotheses which serve as input to the natural language understanding components of a system are often quite errorful; indeed, it is not uncommon to find word error rates of 20-30% for many dialogue systems under development in research labs.",
        "Such high error rates often arise due to the use of out-of-vocabulary words, noise, and the increasingly large vocabularies of more capable sys-",

        "tems which try to allow for greater naturalness and variation in user input.",
        "Traditionally, dialogue systems have relied on confidence scores assigned by the speech recognizer to detect speech recognition errors.",
        "In a typical setup, the dialogue system will choose to either accept (that is, attempt to understand and respond to) or reject (that is, respond to the user with an indication of non-understanding) an utterance by thresholding this confidence score.",
        "Stating the problem in terms of choosing whether or not to accept a particular utterance for processing, however, misses the larger picture.",
        "From the user's perspective, what is truly important is whether or not the system's response to the utterance is correct.",
        "Sometimes, an errorful recognition hypothesis may result in a correct response if, for example, proper names are correctly recognized; conversely, a near-perfect hypothesis may evoke an incorrect response.",
        "In light of this, the problem at hand is better formulated as one of assigning a confidence score to a system's candidate response which reflects the probability that the response is an acceptable one.",
        "If the system can't formulate a response in which it has high confidence, then it should clarify, indicate non-understanding, and/or provide appropriate help.",
        "In this paper, we present a method for assigning confidence scores to candidate system responses by making use not only of features obtained from the speech recognizer, but also of features culled from the process of generating a candidate system response, and derived from the distribution of candidate responses themselves.",

        "each hypothesis on the recognizer's N-best list.",
        "We then train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to identify acceptable responses.",
        "When given a novel utterance, candidate responses are ranked with scores output from the SVM.",
        "Based on the scores, the system can then either respond with the highest-scoring candidate, or reject all of the candidate responses and respond by indicating non-understanding.",
        "Part of the motivation for focusing our efforts on selecting a system response, rather than a recognition hypothesis, can be demonstrated by counting the number of unique responses which can be derived from an N-best list.",
        "Figure 1 plots the mean number of unique system responses, parses, and recognition hypotheses given a particular maximum N-best list length; it was generated using the data described in section 3.",
        "Generally, we observe that about half as many unique parses are generated as recognition hypotheses, and then half again as many unique responses.",
        "Since many hypotheses evoke the same response, there is no value in discriminating among these hypotheses.",
        "Instead, we should aim to gain information about the quality of a response by pooling knowledge gleaned from each hypothesis evoking that response.",
        "We expect a similar trend of multiple hypotheses mapping to a single parse in any dialogue system where parses contain a mixture of key syntactic and semantic structure – as is the case here – or where they contain only semantic information (e.g., slot/value pairs).",
        "Parsers which retain more syntactic structure would likely generate more unique parses, however many of these parses would probably map to the same system response since a response doesn't typically hinge on every syntactic detail of an input utterance.",
        "The remainder of our discussion proceeds as follows.",
        "In section 2 we place the method presented here in context in relation to other research.",
        "In section 3, we describe the City Browser multimodal dialogue system, and the process used to collect data from users' interactions with the system.",
        "We then turn to our techniques for annotating the data in section 4 and describe the features which are extracted from the labeled data in section 5.",

        "There has been much research into deriving utterance-level confidence scores based on features derived from the process of speech recognition.",
        "The baseline utterance-level confidence module we make use of in this paper was introduced in (Hazen et al., 2002); we use a subset of the recognizer-derived features used by this module.",
        "In it, confidence scores are derived by training a linear projection model to differentiate utterances with high word error rates.",
        "The utterance-level confidence scores are used to decide whether or not the entire utterance should be accepted or rejected, while the decision as to how to respond is left out of the classification process.",
        "Of course, most other recognizers make use of utterance or hypothesis level confidence scores as well; see, for example (San-Segundo et al., 2000; Chase, 1997).",
        "(Litman et al., 2000) demonstrate the additional use of prosodic features in deriving confidence scores, and transition the problem from one ofword error rate to one involving concept error rate, which is more appropriate in the context of spoken dialogue systems.",
        "However, they consider only the top recognition hypothesis.",
        "nicky, 2001) all of which demonstrate the utility of training a classifier with features derived from the natural language and dialogue management components of a spoken dialogue system to better predict the quality of speech recognition results.",
        "The work described in (Gabsdil and Lemon, 2004) is especially relevant, because, as in our experiments, the dialogue system of interest provides for map-based multimodal dialogue.",
        "Indeed, we view the experiments presented here as extending and validating the techniques developed by Gabsdil and Lemon.",
        "Our work is novel, however, in that we reframe the problem as choosing among system responses, rather than among recognizer hypotheses.",
        "By recasting the problem in these terms, we are able to integrate information from all recognition hypotheses which contribute to a single response, and to extract distributional features from the set of candidate responses.",
        "Another key difference is that our method produces confidence scores for the candidate responses themselves, while the cited methods produce a decision as to whether an utterance, or a particular recognition hypothesis, should be accepted, rejected, or (in some cases), ignored by the dialogue system.",
        "In addition, because of the small size of the dataset used in (Gabsdil and Lemon, 2004), the authors were limited to testing their approach with leave-one-out cross validation, which means that, when testing a particular user's utterance, other utterances from the same user also contributed to the training set.",
        "Their method also does not provide for optimizing a particular metric – such as F-measure – although, it does solve a more difficult 3-class decision problem.",
        "Finally, another key difference is that we make use of an n-gram language model with a large vocabulary of proper names, whereas theirs is a context-free grammar with a smaller vocabulary.",
        "(Niemann et al., 2005) create a dialogue system architecture in which uncertainty is propagated across each layer of processing through the use of probabilities, eventually leading to posterior probabilities being assigned to candidate utterance interpretations.",
        "Unlike our system, in which we train a single classifier using arbitrary features derived from each stage of processing, each component (recognizer, parser, etc) is trained separately and must be capable of assigning conditional probabilities to its output given its input.",
        "The method hinges on probabilistic inference, yet it is often problematic to map a speech recognizer's score to a probability as their approach requires.",
        "In addition, the method is evaluated only in a toy domain, using a few sample utterances."

        "We then demonstrated a framework for assigning confidence scores to those responses, by using the scores output by an SVM trained to discriminate between acceptable and unacceptable responses.",
        "The classifier was trained using a set of features derived from the speech recognizer, culled from the generation of each response, and calculated based on each response's distribution.",
        "We tested our methods using data collected by users interacting with the City Browser multimodal dialogue system, and showed that they lead to a significant improvement over a baseline which makes an acceptance decision based on an utterance-level recognizer confidence score.",
        "The technique developed herein could be refined in several ways.",
        "First and foremost, it may well be possible to find additional features with discriminatory power.",
        "Also, the decision as to whether or not to choose the top-scoring response could potentially be improved by choosing a more appropriate metric than F-measure as the objective function, or perhaps by using a second classifier at this stage.",
