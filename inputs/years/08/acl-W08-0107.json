        "Dialogue system researchers are active in investigating ways of detecting and recovering from error, including determining when to provide confirmations or rejections, or how to handle cases of complete non-understanding (Bohus and Rudnicky, 2005a; Bohus and Rudnicky, 2005b; Skantze, 2005).",

        "One approach to studying how humans manage errors of understanding is to view conversation as a joint activity, in which grounding, or the process of adding material to the common ground between speakers, plays a central role (Clark and Schaefer, 1989).",

        "Table 12 shows the results, broken down by the Standalone types of evidence, which could occur by themselves (Submit, Repeat Back, Resubmit, Acknowledge, and Request Repair), the Additional types of evidence, which only occurred with other types of evidence (Move On and Use), and the Silence-Related Lack of Understanding type of evidence.",
        "Each of these showed acceptable levels of agreement, with the exception of the Kappa for the additional evidence.",
        "The low score on the additional evidence is probably due to the fact that Move On judgments depend on a strong understanding of the domain-specific task structure, as described in section 3.6; to a lesser extent Use judgments tend to rely on an understanding of the scenario as well.",
        "This highlights the fact that for most ofthe evidence of understanding (all except for Move On and Use), agreement can be reached with a non-expert annotator.",
        "The results of the inter-annotator agreement test were merged into the larger 1222-markable corpus, to create a consensus human-annotated corpus.",
        "This was used in the next test, to identify whether an algorithm can automatically identify evidence.",
        "We authored a set of rules to identify evidence of understanding based on the order in which CGUs were introduced into the common ground, the identity of the speaker who introduced them, and the semantic interpretations.",
        "The rules were then applied to the 1222-markable corpus, and the resulting identifications were then compared to the identifications made by the human annotators.",
        "The results are shown in Table 13.",
        "The respectable agreement and kappa values indicate that it is possible for an algorithm to reliably identify evidence.",
        "Finally, we explored whether humans could reliably agree on whether a given material's groundedness had increased or decreased after a given turn.",
        "We studied this because we are not here claiming that humans explicitly model degrees of grounded-ness or perform a computation to compare a given material with something they had grounded previously.",
        "It is more likely that humans track evidence, determine whether material is more or less grounded than it was before, and check whether it has reached a grounding criterion.",
        "A dialogue system need not be tied to human behavior to be effective, so given these human behaviors, we are interested in whether computer algorithms can be built to produce useful results in terms oftask completion and human-realistic behavior.",
        "For this reason we evaluate the model ofdegrees ofgrounding based on how human-realistic its ability to identify whether a CGU's degree of groundedness has increased or decreased, and in future work study whether a system implementation performs acceptably in terms oftask completion and managing human-realistic grounding behavior.",
        "To perform the test of whether degree increase or decrease could be reliable detected, we annotated a subset of the corpus with a non-domain expert.",
        "For a set of CGUs, we tracked the sequence of evidence that was provided to ground that CGU.",
        "Before and after each item of evidence, we asked the annotators to determine whether the CGU was more or less grounded than it was the turn before.",
        "We also developed a set of rules based on the definition of the degrees of groundedness defined in section 4 to determine after each utterance whether a CGU's degree of groundedness had increased or decreased from the utterance before.",
        "We then compared the results of that set of rules with human-consensus judgments about degree increase and decrease.",
        "The results are shown in Table 14, indicating that humans could reliably agree among themselves, and a rule-based algorithm could reliably agree with the human consensus judgments."

        "For example, (Clark and Schaefer, 1989) describe \"continued attention\" as another possibility, which was not available with the radio modality used in this study.",
        "Furthermore, it is a feature of this domain that Resubmit evidence generally indicates lack of understanding; in general conversation, it is not true that the repeated mention of material indicates that it is not understood, so a \"Follow-Up\" evidence is likely, as are variations of \"Use.\"",
        "To explore these questions, we are extending work to other domains, and are currently focusing on one in which virtual humans are used for a questioning task.",
