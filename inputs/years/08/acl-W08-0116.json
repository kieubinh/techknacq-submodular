        "Spontaneously generated dialogue, whether naturally occurring or task-oriented, rarely sticks to accepted rules of grammar or even politeness.",
        "Interruptions, ungrammatical utterances and grunts or other noises are found in the majority of contributions in dialogue corpora.",
        "One reason for this is the ubiquitous use of ellipsis; the omission of words or phrases from a contribution which can be inferred or extracted from previous contributions.",
        "Ellipsis is optional; the full constituent could serve communication as well as the elliptical version.",
        "Where ellipsis occurs across speakers i.e., one participant makes (elliptical) use of another's contribution, it provides a direct index of the mutual-accessibility of the current conversational context (cf. Healey et.",
        "al.",
        "2007; Eshghi and Healey, 2007).",
        "In some cases elliptical contributions are obvious, as in the polar response 'yeah', signifying that a question has been heard, understood and considered; however, there are degrees of complexity that would seem to require a close understanding of what another participant is referring to.",
        "It is this issue of mutual-accessibility or 'grounding' that we propose can be investigated through the quantification of elliptical phenomena.",
        "These phenomena are, we propose, also related to the way referring expressions can contract over repeated use.",
        "(e.g. Schober and Clark, 1989; Wilkes-Gibbs and Clark, 1992).",
        "The approach taken in Clark et al.",
        "'s 'collaborative theory' is that as mutual understanding increases, dialogue contributions become shorter as referring terms become part of the common ground.",
        "Clark and Krych (2004) note that various elliptical phrases can be used to establish common ground, from continuers ('uh-huh', 'yeah') or assessments ('gosh') to establishing shared attention through deictic expressions such as 'this', 'that', 'here' and 'there'.",
        "Healey et al.",
        "(2007) demonstrated the basic concept and viability of quantifying ellipsis phenomena as a quantitative index of mutual-accessibility of context.",
        "They showed that the frequency of use of cross-speaker elliptical expressions in online chat varies systematically depending on whether communication is 'local' i.e. within a single chat room or 'remote'.",
        "However, the coding of ellipsis in this study did not follow an explicit protocol.",
        "It relied mainly on the distinctions made by Fernandez et al.",
        "(2004) but specific measures of reliability and validity were not calculated.",

        "In this paper we present an ellipsis coding protocol that provides a set of coding categories and we report the inter-rater reliability scores that have been obtained with it.",
        "In order to simplify coding and increase reliability, categories suggested by Fernandez et al.",
        "have been collapsed into broader ones.",
        "It should be pointed out that we are not, in general, trying to produce an accurate or definitive analysis of ellipsis.",
        "The protocol is rather the product of contending with the compromise between robust coding categories and linguistic elegance.",
        "The categories presented here are generally ordered in terms of occurrence in order to assist the coder.",
        "A contribution to dialogue may contain more than one type of elliptical utterance; contributions are not assigned to one mutually exclusive category.",
        "Rather, coders are able to use the protocol to label any part of a dialogue that is elliptical."
