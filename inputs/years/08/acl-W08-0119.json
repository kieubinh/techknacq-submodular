        "Conventional spoken dialogue systems operate by finding the most likely interpretation of each user input, updating some internal representation of the dialogue state and then outputting an appropriate response.",
        "Error tolerance depends on using confidence thresholds and where they fail, the dialogue manager must resort to quite complex recovery procedures.",
        "Such a system has no explicit mechanisms for representing the inevitable uncertainties associated with speech understanding or the ambiguities which naturally arise in interpreting a user's intentions.",
        "The result is a system that is inherently fragile, especially in noisy conditions or where the user is unsure of how to use the system.",
        "It has been suggested that Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) offer a natural framework for building spoken dialogue systems which can both model these uncertainties and support policies which are robust to their effects (Young, 2002; Williams and Young, 2007a).",
        "The key idea of the POMDP is that the underlying dialogue state is hidden and dialogue management policies must therefore be based not on a single state estimate but on a distribution over all states.",
        "Whilst POMDPs are attractive theoretically, in practice, they are notoriously intractable for anything other than small state/action spaces.",
        "Hence, practical examples of their use were initially restricted to very simple domains (Roy et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2001).",
        "More recently, however, a number of techniques have been suggested which do allow POMDPs to be scaled to handle real world tasks.",
        "The two generic mechanisms which facilitate this scaling are factoring the state space and performing policy optimisation in a reduced summary state space (Williams and Young, 2007a; Williams and",
        "Young, 2007b).",
        "Based on these ideas, a number of real-world POMDP-based systems have recently emerged.",
        "The most complex entity which must be represented in the state space is the user's goal.",
        "In the Bayesian Update of Dialogue State (BUDS) system, the user's goal is further factored into conditionally independent slots.",
        "The resulting system is then modelled as a dynamic Bayesian network (Thomson et al., 2008).",
        "A similar approach is also developed in (Bui et al., 2007a; Bui et al., 2007b).",
        "An alternative approach taken in the Hidden Information State (HIS) system is to retain a complete representation of the user's goal, but partition states into equivalence classes and prune away very low probability partitions (Young et al., 2007; Thomson et al., 2007; Williams and Young, 2007b).",
        "Whichever approach is taken, a key issue in a real POMDP-based dialogue system is its ability to be robust to noise and that is the issue that is addressed in this paper.",
        "Using the HIS system as an exemplar, evaluation results are presented for a real-world tourist information task using both simulated and real users.",
        "The results show that a POMDP system can learn noise robust policies and that N-best outputs from the speech understanding component can be exploited to further improve robustness.",
        "The paper is structured as follows.",
        "Firstly, in Section 2 a brief overview of the HIS system is given.",
        "Then in Section 3, various POMDP training regimes are described and evaluated using a simulated user at differing noise levels.",
        "Section 4 then presents results from a trial in which users conducted various tasks over a range of noise levels.",
        "Finally, in Section 5, we discuss our results and present our conclusions."

        "A POMDP-based dialogue system is shown in Figure 1 where sm denotes the (unobserved or hidden) machine state which is factored into three components: the last user act au, the user's goal su and the dialogue history sd.",
        "Since sm is unknown, at each time-step the system computes a belief state such that the probability of being in state sm given belief state b is b(sm).",
        "Based on this current belief state b, the machine selects an action am, receives a reward r(sm,am), and transitions to a new (unobserved) state sm, where sm depends only on sm and am.",
        "The machine then receives an observation o' consisting of an N-best list of hypothesised user actions.",
        "Finally, the belief distribution b is updated based on o and am as follows:",
        "where k is a normalisation constant (Kaelbling et al., 1998).",
        "The first term on the RHS of (1) is called the observation model and the term inside the summation is called the transition model.",
        "Maintaining this belief state as the dialogue evolves is called belief monitoring.",
        "Speech Understanding",
        "Speech Generation",
        "At each time step t, the machine receives a reward r(bt, am,t) based on the current belief state bt and the selected action am,t.",
        "Each action am,t is determined by a policy n(bt) and building a POMDP system involves finding the policy n* which maximises the discounted sum R of the rewards where At is a discount coefficient.",
        "In the HIS system, user goals are partitioned and initially, all states sue Su are regarded as being equally likely and they are placed in a single partition p0.",
        "As the dialogue progresses, user inputs result in changing beliefs and this root partition is repeatedly split into smaller partitions.",
        "This splitting is binary, i.e. p – > {p',p – p'} with probability P(p'\\p).",
        "By replacing sm by its factors (su, au, sd) and making reasonable independence assumptions, it can be shown (Young et al., 2007) that in partitioned form (l) becomes observation model user action model",

        "The user action model allows the observation probability that is conditioned on a'u to be scaled by the probability that the user would speak a'u given the partition p' and the last system prompt am.",
        "In the current implementation of the HIS system, user dialogue acts take the form act(a = v) where act is the dialogue type, a is an attribute and v is its value [for example, request(food=Chinese)].",
        "The user action model is then approximated by where T(•) denotes the type of the dialogue act and M() denotes whether or not the dialogue act matches the current partition p .",
        "The dialogue model is a deterministic encoding based on a simple grounding model.",
        "It yields probability one when the updated dialogue hypothesis (i.e., a specific combination of p', aU, sd and am) is consistent with the history and zero otherwise.",
        "Policy representation in POMDP-systems is nontrivial since each action depends on a complex probability distribution.",
        "One of the simplest approaches to dealing with this problem is to discretise the state space and then associate an action with each discrete grid point.",
        "To reduce quantisation errors, the HIS model first maps belief distributions into a reduced summary space before quantising.",
        "This summary space consists of the probability of the top two hypotheses plus some status variables and the user act type associated with the top distribution.",
        "Quantisation is then performed using a simple distance metric to find the nearest grid point.",
        "Actions in summary space refer specifically to the top two hypotheses, and unlike actions in master space, they are limited to a small finite set: greet, ask, explicit .confirm, implicit .confirm, select.confirm, offer, inform, find-alternative, queryjnore, goodbye.",
        "A simple heuristic is then used to map the selected next system action back into the full master belief space.",
        "The dialogue manager is able to support negations, denials and requests for alternatives.",
        "When the selected summary action is to offer the user a venue, the summary-to-master space mapping heuristics will normally offer a venue consistent with the most likely user goal hypothesis.",
        "If this hypothesis is then rejected its belief is substantially reduced and it will no longer be the top-ranking hypothesis.",
        "If the next system action is to make an alternative offer, then the new top-ranking hypothesis may not be appropriate.",
        "For example, if an expensive French restaurant near the river had been offered and the user asks for one nearer the centre of town, any alternative offered should still include the user's confirmed desire for an expensive French restaurant.",
        "To ensure this, all of the grounded features from the rejected hypothesis are extracted and all user goal hypotheses are scanned starting at the most likely until an alternative is found that matches the grounded features.",
        "For the current turn only, the summary-to-master space heuristics then treat this hypothesis as if it was the top-ranking one.",
        "If the system then offers a venue based on this hypothesis, and the user accepts it, then, since system outputs are appended to user inputs for the purpose of belief updating, the alternative hypothesis will move to the top, or near the top, of the ranked hypothesis list.",

        "The combination of each p, au and updated sd forms a new dialogue hypothesis hk whose beliefs are evaluated using (3).",

        "To train a policy, a user simulator is used to generate responses to system actions.",
        "It has two main components: a User Goal and a User Agenda.",
        "At the start of each dialogue, the goal is randomly initialised with requests such as \"name\", \"addr\", \"phone\" and constraints such as \"type=restaurant\", \"food=Chinese\", etc.",
        "The agenda stores the dialogue acts needed to elicit this information in a stack-like structure which enables it to temporarily store actions when another action of higher priority needs to be issued first.",
        "This enables the simulator to refer to previous dialogue turns at a later point.",
        "To generate a wide spread of realistic dialogs, the simulator reacts wherever possible with varying levels of patience and arbitrariness.",
        "In addition, the simulator will relax its constraints when its initial goal cannot be satisfied.",
        "This allows the dialogue manager to learn negotiation-type dialogues where only an approximate solution to the user's goal exists.",
        "Speech understanding errors are simulated at the dialogue act level using confusion matrices trained on labelled dialogue data (Schatzmann et al., 2007).",
        "When training a system to operate robustly in noisy conditions, a variety of strategies are possible.",
        "For example, the system can be trained only on noise-free interactions, it can be trained on increasing levels of noise or it can be trained on a high noise level from the outset.",
        "A related issue concerns the generation of grid points and the number of training iterations to perform.",
        "For example, allowing a very large number of points leads to poor performance due to over-fitting of the training data.",
        "Conversely, having too few point leads to poor performance due to a lack of discrimination in its dialogue strategies.",
        "After some experimentation, the following training schedule was adopted.",
        "Training starts in a noise free environment using a small number ofgrid points and it continues until the performance of the policy levels off.",
        "The resulting policy is then taken as an initial policy for the next stage where the noise level is increased, the number of grid points is expanded and the number of iterations is increased.",
        "This process is repeated until the highest noise level is reached.",
        "This approach was motivated by the observation that a key factor in effective reinforcement learning is the balance between exploration and exploitation.",
        "In POMDP policy optimisation which uses dynamically allocated grid points, maintaining this balance is crucial.",
        "In our case, the noise introduced by the simulator is used as an implicit mechanism for increasing the exploration.",
        "Each time exploration is increased, the areas of state-space that will be visited will also increase and hence the number of available grid points must also be increased.",
        "At the same time, the number of iterations must be increased to ensure that all points are visited a suf- £ ficient number of times.",
        "In practice we found that around 750 to 1000 grid points was sufficient and the total number of simulated dialogues needed for training was around 100,000.",
        "A second issue when training in noisy conditions is whether to train on just the 1-best output from the simulator or train on the N-best outputs.",
        "A limiting factor here is that the computation required for N-best training is significantly increased since the rate of partition generation in the HIS model increases exponentially with N. In preliminary tests, it was found that when training with 1-best outputs, there was little difference between policies trained entirely in no noise and policies trained on increasing noise as described above.",
        "However, policies trained on 2-best using the incremental strategy did exhibit increased robustness to noise.",
        "To illustrate this, Figures 3 and 4 show the average dialogue success rates and rewards for 3 different policies, all trained on 2-best: a hand-crafted policy (hdc), a policy trained on noise-free conditions (noise_free) and a policy trained using the incremental scheme described above (increm).",
        "Each policy was tested using 2-best output from the simulator across a range of error rates.",

        "If it contains sufficient grounded keys to match 1 to 3 database entities, then offer is selected.",

        "The overall results on real data collected from the user trial clearly indicate increased robustness by the HIS system.",
        "We would have liked to be able to plot performance and success scores as a function of noise level or speech understanding error rate, but there is great variability in these kinds of complex real-world dialogues and it transpired that the trial data was insufficient to enable any statistically meaningful presentation of this form.",
        "We estimate that we need at least an order of magnitude more trial data to properly investigate the behaviour of such systems as a function of noise level.",
        "The trial described here, including transcription and analysis consumed about 30 man-days of effort.",
        "Increasing this by a factor of 10 or more is not therefore an option for us, and clearly an alternative approach is needed.",
        "We have also reported results of subjective success rate and opinion scores based on data obtained from subjects after each trial.",
        "The results were only weakly correlated with the measured performance and success rates.",
        "We believe that this is partly due to confusion as to what constituted success in the minds of the subjects.",
        "This suggests that for subjective results to be meaningful, measurements such as these will only be really useful if made on live systems where users have a real rather than imagined information need.",
        "The use of live systems would also alleviate the data sparsity problem noted earlier.",
        "Finally and in conclusion, we believe that despite the difficulties noted above, the results reported in this paper represent a first step towards establishing the POMDP as a viable framework for developing spoken dialogue systems which are significantly more robust to noisy operating conditions than conventional state-based systems."
