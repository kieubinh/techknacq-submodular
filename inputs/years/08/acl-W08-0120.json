        "The complexity problem of POMDP comes from updating beliefs that are out of the user's intention, and from calculating the reward of system actions that do not satisfy user's objective.",

        "A POMDP is defined as a tuple that consists of six substates: (S, A, P, R, Q, O) where S is a set of state, A is a set of action, P is a transition probability P(s \\s,a), R is a reward function R(s,a,s'), Q is a set of observation and O is an observation model P(o\\s,a).",
        "The current state is not deterministic in a POMDP framework while it is determined as a specific state in a Markov decision process (MDP) framework.",
        "In a POMDP, the probability distribution over all states s ^S, which is referred as a belief state b(s), is maintained instead of deterministic state.",
        "At each time instant t, the system chooses an action a ^A, and this causes the system to move from current state s to next state s with the transition probability P(s' \\s,a).",
        "Then, the system is granted a reward R(s,a) while the system receives an observation o with probability of P(o\\s',a).",
        "The system computes the belief state in the next time instance b '(s') as a following:",
        "where k is a normalizing factor.",
        "This process is referred as belief update.",
        "Optimizing a POMDP policy is a process of finding a mapping function from belief states to actions that maximizes the expected reward.",
        "The system should compute a value function over belief spaces to find optimized actions.",
        "However, unlike as in a MDP, each value in a POMDP is a function of an entire probability distribution and belief spaces are very complex, so that a POMDP has a scale problem of computing the exact value function.",
        "A POMDP for spoken dialog system is well formulated in (Williams and Young, 2007).",

        "In a slot-filling dialog system, the user's goal can be represented as a fully-filled frame in which all slots of the frame contain values specified by the user's intention.",
        "Therefore, if a dialog system has W slots and each slot can have a value among V candidates, then VW user goals can be represented as frames.",
        "This means that the number of user goals is related exponentially to the number of slots.",
        "This number of user goals is intractable in practical dialog systems.",
        "Therefore, a method is needed to reduce the size of the state space rather than maintaining all belief states.",
        "To do this, we developed a frame-based belief state representation in which the system dynamically groups set of equivalent states to a highlevel frame state.",
        "Frame state, which is a similar concept to the partition in the hidden information state (HIS) approach (Young et al., 2007) represents the indistinguishable classes of user's goals.",
        "The biggest difference between frame-based representation and partition-based representation is that the former uses only user input to split the frame state, whereas the latter uses the user input and external ontology rules such as a prior probability for belief of split partition.",
        "Therefore, the frame-based representation has relatively high domain portability because it does not need that kind of external domain dependent information.",

        "First, if the user's input [A=a] fills the slot of the root frame state f0, then it splits into two frame states: f1, which includes all user goal states with the slot A having 'a' as a value; and {f0-f1}, which is the relative complement of f1.",
        "Next, if the user's input [B=b] is entered to the system, each frame f1 and {f0-f1} is split into smaller frame states.",
