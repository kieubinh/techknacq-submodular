        "Consider the following excerpt from a dialog about designing a remote control for a television (the opinion targets - what the opinions are about - are shown in italics).",
        "(1) D:: And I thought not too edgy and like a box, more kind of hand-held not as computery, yeah, more organic shape I think.",
        "Simple designs, like the last one we just saw, not too many buttons",
        "Speaker D expresses an opinion in favor of a design that is simple and organic in shape, and against an alternative design which is not.",
        "Several individual opinions are expressed in this passage.",
        "The first is a negative opinion about the design being too edgy and box-like, the next is a positive opinion toward a hand-held design, followed by a negative opinion toward a computery shape, and so on.",
        "While we believe that recognizing individual expressions of opinions, their properties, and components is important, we believe that discourse interpretation is needed as well.",
        "It is by understanding the passage as a discourse that we see edgy, like a box, computery, and many buttons as descriptions of the type of design D does not prefer, and hand-held, organic shape, and simple designs as descriptions of the type he does.",
        "These descriptions are not in general synonyms/antonyms of one another; for example, there are hand-held \"computery\" devices and simple designs that are edgy.",
        "The unison/opposition among the descriptions is due to how they are used in the discourse.",
        "This paper focuses on such relations between the targets of opinions in discourse.",
        "Specifically, we propose opinion frames, which consist of two opinions which are related by virtue of having united or opposed targets.",
        "We believe that recognizing opinion frames will provide more information for NLP applications than recognizing their individual components alone.",
        "Further, if there is uncertainty about any one of the components, we believe opinion frames are an effective representation incorporating discourse information to make an overall coherent interpretation (Hobbs, 1979; Hobbs, 1983).",
        "To our knowledge, this is the first work to extend a manual annotation scheme to relate opinions in the discourse.",
        "In this paper, we present opinion frames, and motivate their usefulness through examples.",
        "Then we provide an annotation scheme for capturing these opinion frames.",
        "Finally we perform fine-grained annotation studies to measure the human reliability in recognizing of these opinion frames.",
        "Opinion frames are presented in Section 2, our annotation scheme is described in Section 3, the inter-annotator agreement studies are presented in Section 4, related work is discussed in Section 5, and conclusions are in Section 6."

        "If we are able to recognize the best overall set of opinion frames for the passage, the polarity ambiguities will be resolved.",
        "On the other hand, evidence for non-reinforcing opinions would suggest other frames, potentially resulting in different interpretations of polarity and relations among targets.",

        "For instance, in the example below, speaker D initially sets up an alternative between speech recognition and buttons as a possible interface for navigation.",
        "But later, speaker A re-frames the choice as between having speech recognition only and having both options.",
