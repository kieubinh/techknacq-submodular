        "Human computer dialogue is a wide research area in Artificial Intelligence.",
        "Computer dialogue is now used at production stage for applications such as tutorial dialogue - that helps teaching students (Freedman, 2000) - task-oriented dialogue - that achieves a particular, limited task, such as booking a trip (Allen et al., 2000) - and chatbot dialogue (Levy et al., 1997) - that is used within entertainment and help systems.",
        "None of these approaches use persuasion as a mechanism to achieve dialogue goals.",
        "However, research towards the use of persuasion in Human Computer Interactions has spawned around the field of natural argumentation (Norman and Reed, 2003).",
        "Similarly research on Embodied Conversational Agents (ECA) (Bickmore and Picard, 2005) is also attempting to improve the persuasiveness of agents with persuasion techniques; however, it concentrates on the visual representation of the interlocutor rather than the dialogue management.",
        "Previous research on human computer dialogue has rarely focused on persuasive techniques (Guerini, Stock, and Zancanaro, 2004, initiated some research in that field).",
        "Our dialogue management system applies a novel method, taking advantage of persuasive and argumentation techniques to achieve persuasive dialogue.",
        "According to the cognitive dissonance theory (Festinger, 1957), people will try to minimise the discrepancy between their behaviour and their beliefs by integrating new beliefs or distorting existing ones.",
        "In this paper, we approach persuasion as a process shaping user's beliefs to eventually change their behaviour.",
        "The presented dialogue management system has been developed to work on known limitations of current dialogue systems:",
        "The impression of lack of control is an issue when the user is interacting with a purely task-oriented dialogue system (Farzanfar et al., 2005).",
        "The system follows a plan to achieve the particular task, and the user's dialogue moves are dictated by the planner and the plan operators.",
        "The lack of empathy of computers is also a problem in human-computer interaction for applications such as health-care, where persuasive dialogue could be applied (Bickmore and Giorgino, 2004).",
        "The system does not respond to the user's personal and emotional state, which sometimes lowers the user's implication in the dialogue.",
        "However, existing research (Klein, Moon, and Picard, 1999) shows that a system that gives appropriate response to the user's emotion can lower frustration.",
        "In human-human communication, these limitations reduce the effectiveness of persuasion (Stiff and Mongeau, 2002).",
        "Even if the response towards the computer is not always identical to the one to humans, it seems sensible to think that persuasive dialogue systems can be improved by applying known findings from human-human communication.",
        "The dialogue management architecture described in this paper (see Figure 1) addresses these dialogue management issues by using a novel layered approach to dialogue management, allowing the mixing of techniques from task-oriented dialogue management and chatbot techniques (see Section 4).",

        "The planning component's role is to guarantee the consistency of the dialogue and the achievement of the persuasive goals.",
        "In state-of-the-art task-oriented dialogue management systems, the planner provides instructions for a surface realizer (Green and Lehman, 2002), responsible of generating the utterance corresponding to the plan step.",
        "Our approach is different to allow more reactivity to the user and give a feeling of control over the dialogue.",
        "In this layered approach, the reactive component provides a direct reaction to the user input, generating one or more utterances for a given plan step, allowing for reactions to user's counter arguments as well as backchannel and chitchat phases without cluttering the plan.",
        "Experimental results show that this layered approach allows the user to feel more comfortable in the dialogue while preserving the dialogue consistency provided by the planner.",

        "This relational model is comparable to the argumentation framework proposed by Dung (1995), but stores more information about each argument for reasoning within the planning and reactive component (see Section 4.2).",
        "Each fact in this model represents a belief to be introduced to the user.",
        "For example, when the dialogue tries to achieve the goal reorder (flashlight > air.map): the system wants the user to believe that the \"flashlight\" item should be ranked higher than the \"air_map\" item.",
        "The argumentation model describes the argumentation process that is required to introduce this new belief: the system first has to make sure the user believes in rate dower (air.map) and rate Jtigher(flashlight).",
        "Lower level facts (see Figure 2) are the goal facts of the dialogue, the ones the system chooses as dialogue goals, according to known user beliefs and the system's goal beliefs (e.g. according to the ranking the system is trying to defend).",
        "The facts in the middle of the hierarchy are intermediate facts that need to be asserted during the dialogue.",
        "The toplevel facts are world knowledge: facts that require minimum defense and can be easily grounded in the dialogue.",
        "The planning component's task is to find a plan using the argumentation model to introduce the required facts in the user's belief to support the persuasive goals.",
        "The plan is describes a path in the argumentation model beliefs hierarchy that translates to argumentation segments in the dialogue.",
        "In our current evaluation method, the goal of the dialogue is to change the user's beliefs about the items so that the user eventually changes the ranking.",
        "At the beginning of the dialogue, the ranking of the system is chosen and persuasive goals are computed for the dialogue.",
        "These persuasive goals correspond to the lower level facts in the argumentation model - like lLreorder(flashlight > airjnap)\" in our previous example.",

        "The planning component can also use two non-argumentative operators, do.greetings and do .farewells, that are placed respectively at the beginning and the end of the dialogue plan to open and close the session.",

        "However, it should not be mistaken for a surface language realizer.",
        "The reactive component's task, when realizing the operator, is to decide how to present the particular argumentation operator and its parameters to the user according to the dialogue context and the user's reaction to the argument.",
        "This reactive process is described in the following sections.",
        "Each step of the plan describes the general topic of a dialogue segment.",
        "A dialogue segment is a set of utterances from the system and from the user that are related to a particular argument.",
        "For example, in the Desert Scenario, the operator ground(can(helpatnight, item(flashlight))) may result in the following set of utterances:",
        "S(ystem) I think the flashlight could",

        "It could be useful then.",
        "In this example, the ground operator has been realized by the reactive component in two different utterances to react to the user's interaction.",
        "The goal of the reactive component is to make the user feel that the system understands what has been said.",
        "It is also important to avoid replanning as it tries to defend the arguments chosen in the plan.",
        "As described in Section 4.2, the planner relies on the argumentation model to create a dialogue plan.",
        "Encoding all possible defenses and reactions to the user directly in this model will explode the search space of the planner and require careful authoring to avoid planning inconsistencies .",
        "In addition, predicting at the planning level what counter arguments a user is likely to make requires a prior knowledge of the user's beliefs.",
        "At the beginning of a one-off dialogue, it is not possible to make prior assumptions on the user's beliefs; the system has a shallow knowledge ofthe user's beliefs and will discover them as the dialogue goes.",
        "Hence, it is more natural to author a reactive dialogue that will respond to the user's counter arguments as they come and extends the user beliefs model as it goes.",
        "In our architecture if the user is disagreeing with an argument, the plan is not revised directly; if possible, the reactive component selects new, contextually appropriate, supporting facts for the current plan operator.",
        "It can do this multiple consecutive local repairs if the user needs more convincing and the domain model provides enough defenses.",
        "This allows for a simpler planning framework.",
        "In addition, when available, and even if the user agrees with the current argument, the reactive component can also choose from a set of \"dialogue smoothing\" or backchannel utterances to make the dialogue feel more natural.",
        "Here is an example from the Desert Scenario:",
        "S We don't have much water, we need to be rescued as soon as possible.",
        "(from plan step: user.world(goalfbe found))) S I am glad we agree, (backchannel)",
        "S There is a good chance that the rescue team already knows our whereabouts.",

        "(from plan step:",
        "usejworld( rescue Jcnowsjwhere .you jare))",
        "The reactive component needs to detect if the user is agreeing to its current argument or resisting the new fact that is presented.",
        "Because the dialogue management system was developed from the perspective of a system that could be easily ported to different domains, choice was made to use a domain independent and robust agreement/disagreement detection.",
        "The agreement/disagreement detection is based on an utterance classifier.",
        "The classifier is a cascade of binary Support Vector Machines (SVM) (Vapnik, 2000) trained on the ICSI Meeting corpus (Janinetal., 2003).",
        "The corpus contains 8135 spurts annotated with agreement/disagreement information Hillard, Ostendorf, and Shriberg (2003).",
        "A multi-class SVM classifier is trained on local features of the spurts such as a) the length of the spurt, b) the first word of the spurt, c) the bigrams of the spurts, and d) part of speech tags.",
        "The classification achieves an accuracy of 83.17% with an N-Fold 4 ways split cross validation.",
        "Additional results and comparison with state-of-the-art are available in Appendix A.",
        "During the dialogue, the classifier is applied on each of the user's utterances, trying to determine if the user is agreeing or disagreeing with the system.",
        "According to this labelling, the strategies described in section 4.3.1 and 4.3.3 are applied.",
        "The reactive component will attempt local repairs to the plan by defending the argumentation move chosen by the planning component.",
        "However, there are cases when the user will still not accept an argument.",
        "In these cases, imposing the belief to the user is counter-productive and the current goal belief should be dropped from the plan.",
        "For each utterance chosen by the reactive component, the belief model of the user is updated to represent the system knowledge of the user's beliefs.",
        "Every time the user agrees to an utterance from the system, the belief model is extended with a new belief; in the previous example, when the user says \"I see, it could be useful then.",
        "\", the system detects an agreement (see the Section 4.3.2) and extends the user's beliefs model with the belief: can(helpatnight, item(flashlight)).",
        "The agreement is then followed by a local repair, since the user doesn't disagree with the statement made, the system also extends the belief model with beliefs relevant to the content of the local repair, thus learning more about the user's belief model.",
        "As a result of this process, when the system decides to revise the plan, the planning component does not start from the same beliefs state as previously.",
        "In effect, the system is able to learn user's beliefs based on the agreement/disagreement with the user, it can therefore make a more effective use of the argumentation hierarchy to find a better plan to achieve the persuasive goals.",
        "Still, there are some cases when the planning component will be unable to find a new plan from the current belief state to the goal belief state - this can happen when the planner has exhausted all its argumentative moves for a particular sub-goal.",
        "In these cases, the system has to make concessions and drop the persuasive goals that it cannot fulfil.",
        "By dropping goals, the system will lower the final persuasiveness, but guarantees not coercing the user.",
        "Utterance generation is made at the reactive component level.",
        "In the current version of the dialogue management system, the utterance generation is based on an extended version of Alicebot AIML",
        "AIML is an XML language that provides a pattern/template generation model mainly used for chatbot systems.",
        "An AIML bot defines a set of categories that associate a topic, the context of the previous bot utterance (called that in the AIML terminology), a matching pattern that will match the last user utterance and a generation template.",
        "The topic, matching and that field define matching patterns that can contain * wildcards accepting any to-ken(s) of the user utterance (e.g. HELLO * would match any utterance starting by \"Hello\").",
        "They are linked to a generation template that can reuse the tokens matched by the patterns wildcards to generate an utterance tailored to the user input and the dialogue context.",
        "For the purpose of layered dialogue management, the AIML language has been extended to include more features: 1) A new pattern slot has been introduced to link a set of categories to a particular argumentation operator; 2) Utterances generations are linked to the belief they are trying to introduce to the user and if an agreement is detected, this belief is added to the user belief model.",
        "For example, a set of matching categories for the Desert Scenario could be:",
        "Plan operator: use_world (goal (survive) )",
        "Category 1 : Pattern *",
        "Template Surviving is our priority, do you want to hear about my desert survival insights?",

        "Let me tell you of what I think of desert survival, ok?",
        "These three categories can be used to match the user reaction during the dialogue segment corresponding to the plan operator: usejworld(goal(survive)).",
        "Category 1 is used as the initiative taking generation.",
        "It will be the first one to be used when the system comes from a previously finished step.",
        "Categories 2-3 are all \"defenses\" that support Category 1.",
        "They will be used to react to the user if no agreement is detected from the last utterances.",
        "For example, if the user says \"what kind of survival insights??\"",
        "as a reply to the generation from Category 1, a disagreement is detected and the reactive component will have a contextualised answer as given by category 2 whose that pattern matches the last utterance from the system, the pattern pattern matches the user utterance.",
        "The dialogue management system uses 187 categories tailored to the Desert Scenario as well as 3737 general categories coming from the Alice chatbot and used to generate the dialogue smoothing utterances.",
        "Developing domain specific reactions is a tedious and slow process that was iteratively achieved with Wizard of OZ experiments with real users.",
        "In these experiments, users were told they were going to have a dialogue with another human in the Desert Scenario context.",
