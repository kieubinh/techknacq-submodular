        "We propose to use user simulation for testing during the development of a sophisticated dialog system.",
        "While the limited behaviors of the state-of-the-art user simulation may not cover important aspects in the dialog system testing, our proposed approach extends the functionality of the simulation so that it can be used at least for the early stage testing before the system reaches stable performance for evaluation involving human users.",
        "The proposed approach includes a set of evaluation measures that can be computed automatically from the interaction logs between the user simulator and the dialog system.",
        "We first validate these measures on human user dialogs using user satisfaction scores.",
        "We also build a regression model to estimate the user satisfaction scores using these evaluation measures.",
        "Then, we apply the evaluation measures on a simulated dialog corpus trained from the real user corpus.",

        "Spoken dialog systems are being widely used in daily life.",
        "The increasing demands of such systems require shorter system development cycles and better automatic system developing techniques.",
        "As a result, machine learning techniques are applied to learn dialog strategies automatically, such as reinforcement learning (Singh et al., 2002; Williams & Young, 2007), supervised learning (Henderson et",
        "This study was conducted when the author was an intern at Bosch RTC.",
        "al., 2005), etc.",
        "These techniques require a significant amount of training data for the automatic learners to sufficiently explore the vast space of possible dialog states and strategies.",
        "However, it is always hard to obtain training corpora that are large enough to ensure that the learned strategies are reliable.",
        "User simulation is an attempt to solve this problem by generating synthetic training corpora using computer simulated users.",
        "The simulated users are built to mimic real users' behaviors to some extent while allowing them to be programmed to explore unseen but still possible user behaviors.",
        "These simulated users can interact with the dialog systems to generate large amounts of training data in a low-cost and time-efficient manner.",
        "Many previous studies (Scheffler, 2002; Pietquin, 2004) have shown that the dialog strategies learned from the simulated training data outperform the hand-crafted strategies.",
        "There are also studies that use user simulation to train speech recognition and understanding components (Chung, 2004).",
        "While user simulation is largely used in dialog system training, it has only been used in limited scope for testing specific dialog system components in the system evaluation phase (Lopez-Cozar et al., 2003; Filisko and Seneff, 2006).",
        "This is partly because the state-of-the-art simulated users have quite limited abilities in mimicking human users' behaviors and typically over-generate possible dialog behaviors.",
        "This is not a major problem when using simulated dialog corpus as the training corpus for dialog strategy learning because the over-generated simulation behaviors would only provide the machine learners with a broader dialog state space to explore (Ai et al., 2007).",
        "However, realistic user behaviors are highly desired in the testing phase because the systems are evaluated and adjusted based on the analysis of the dialogs generated in this phase.",
        "Therefore, we would expect that these user behaviors are what we will see in the final evaluation with human users.",
        "In this case, any over-generated dialog behaviors may cause the system to be blamed for untargeted functions.",
        "What is more, the simulated users cannot provide subjective user satisfaction feedback which is also important for improving the systems.",
        "Since it is expensive and time-consuming to test every version of the system with a significant amount of paid subjects, the testing during the development is typically constrained to a limited number of users, and often, to repeated users who are colleagues or developers themselves.",
        "Thus, the system performance is not always optimized for the intended users.",
        "Our ultimate goal is to supplement human testing with simulated users during the development to speed up the system development towards desired performance.",
        "This would be especially useful in the early development stage, since it would avoid conducting tests with human users when they may feel extremely frustrated due to the malfunction of the unstable system.",
        "As a first attempt, we try to extend the state-of-the-art user simulation by incorporating a set of new but straightforward evaluation measures for automatically assessing the dialog system performance.",
        "These evaluation measures focus on three basic aspects of task-oriented dialog systems: understanding ability, efficiency, and the appropriateness of the system actions.",
        "They are first applied on a corpus generated between a dialog system and a group of human users to demonstrate the validity of these measures with the human users' satisfaction scores.",
        "Results show that these measures are significantly correlated with the human users' satisfactions.",
        "Then, a regression model is built to predict the user satisfaction scores using these evaluation measures.",
        "We also apply the regression model on a simulated dialog corpus trained from the above real user corpus, and show that the user satisfaction scores estimated from the simulated dialogs do not differ significantly from the real users' satisfaction scores.",
        "Finally, we conclude that these evaluation measures can be used to assess the system performance based on the estimated user satisfaction."

        "(Levin et al., 2000) add constraints to the bigram model to accept the expected dialog acts only.",
        "However, their basic assumption of making the next user's action dependent only on the system's previous action is oversimplified.",
        "Later, many studies model more comprehensive user behaviors by adding user goals to constrain the user actions (Scheffler, 2002; Piet-quin, 2004).",
        "These simulated users mimic real user behaviors in a statistical way, conditioning the user actions on the user goals and the dialog contexts.",

        "An agenda contains multiple ordered items, each of which consists of the number of constraints and the specific constraints to be included in each user utterance.",
        "During the dialog, the simulated user updates its list of goals by removing the constraints that have been understood by the system.",
        "It also removes from its agenda the unnecessary actions that are related to the already filled goals while adding new actions.",
        "New actions are added according to the last system's question (such as requesting the user to repeat the last utterance) as well as the simulated user's current goals.",
        "The actions that address the last system's question are given higher priorities then other actions in the agenda.",
        "For example, if the dialog system fails to understand the last user utterance and thus requests a clarification, the simulated user will satisfy the system's request before moving on to discuss a new constraint.",
        "The simulated user updated the agenda with the new actions after each user turn.",
        "The current simulated user interacts with the system on the word level.",
        "It generates a string of words by instantiating its current action using predefined templates derived from previously collected corpora with real users.",

        "Human-human dialog is a process to reach mutual understandings between the dialog partners by exchanging information through the dialog.",
        "This information exchanging process also takes place in the interaction between users and spoken dialog systems.",
        "In a task-oriented conversation, the dialog system's major task is to understand the users' needs in order to provide the right service.",
        "In the information-state update framework, the system continuously updates its information-states during the dialog while the users are conveying their requirements.",
        "If a misunderstanding occurs, there would be a mismatch between the users' requirements and the system's understandings.",
        "Thus, the error recovery dialog is needed to fix the mismatches.",

        "We hypothesize that the higher the understandingAgreement is, the better the system performs, and thus the more the user is satisfied.",
        "The matches of understandings can be calculated automatically from the user simulation and the system logs.",

        "Previous studies (E.g., Walker et al., 1997) use a corpus level semantic accuracy measure (semanti-cAccuracy) to capture the system's understanding ability.",
        "SemanticAccuracy is defined in the standard way as the total number of correctly understood constraints divided by the total number of constraints mentioned in the entire dialog.",
        "The un-derstandingAgreement measure we introduce here is essentially the averaged per-sentence semantic accuracy, which emphasizes the utterance level perception rather than a single corpus level average.",
        "The intuition behind this new measure is that it is better for the system to always understand something to keep a conversation going than for the system to understand really well sometimes but really bad at other times.",
        "We compute both measures in our experiments for comparison.",
        "Efficiency is another important measure of the system performance.",
        "A standard efficiency measure is the number of dialog turns.",
        "However, we would like to take into account the user's dialog strategy because how the user specifies the restaurant selection constraints has a certain impact on the dialog pace.",
        "Comparing two situations where one user specifies the three constraints of selecting a restaurant in three separate utterances, while another user specifies all the constraints in one utterance, we will find that the total number of dialog turns in the second situation is smaller assuming perfect understandings.",
        "Thus, we propose to use the ratio between the number of turns in the perfect understanding situation and the number of turns in practice (efficiencyRatio) to measure the system efficiency.",
        "The larger the efficiencyRatio is, the closer the actual number of turns is to the perfect understanding situation.",
        "In the example in Table 2, because the user chose to specify all the constraints in one utterance, the dialog length would be 2 turns in perfect understanding situation (excluding the last user turn which is always \"I'm done\").",
        "However, the actual dialog length is 6 turns.",
        "Thus, the efficiencyRatio is 2/6.",
        "Since our task scenarios always contain three constraints, we can calculate the length of the error-free dialogs based on the user's strategy.",
        "When the user specifies all constraints in the first utterance, the ideal dialog will have only 2 turns; when the user specifies two constraints in one utterance and the other constraints in a separate utterance, the ideal dialog will have 4 turns; when the user specifies all constraints one by one, the ideal dialog will have 6 turns.",
        "Thus, in the simulation environment, the length of the ideal dialog can be calculated from the simulated users' agenda.",
        "Then, the efficiencyRatio can be calculated automatically.",
        "We manually computed this measure for the real users' dialogs.",
        "Similarly, in order to compare with previous studies, we also investigate the total number of dialog turns (dialogTurns) proposed as the efficiency measure (E.g., Môller et al., 2007).",
        "This measure aims to evaluate the appropriateness of the system actions.",
        "The definition of appropriateness can vary on different tasks and different system design requirements.",
        "For example, some systems always ask users to explicitly confirm their utterances due to high security needs.",
        "In this case, an explicit confirmation after each user utterance is an appropriate system action.",
        "However, in other cases, frequent explicit confirmations may be considered as inappropriate because they may irritate the users.",
        "In our task domain, we define the only inappropriate system action to be providing information based on misunderstood user requirements.",
        "In this situation, the system is not aware of its misunderstanding error.",
        "Instead of conducting an appropriate error-recovering dialog, the system provides wrong information to the user which we hypothesize will decrease the user's satisfaction.",
        "We use the percentage of appropriate system actions out of the total number of system actions (percentAppropriate) to measure the appropriateness of system actions.",
        "In the example in Table 2, only the first system action is inappropriate in all 3 system actions.",
        "Thus, the percent system action appropriateness is 2/3.",
        "Since we can detect the system's misunderstanding and the system's action in the simulated dialog environment, this measure can be calculated automatically for the simulated dialogs.",
        "For the real user corpus, we manually coded the inappropriate system utterances.",
        "Note that the definition of appropriate action we use here is fairly loose.",
        "This is partly due to the simplicity of our task domain and the limited possible system/user actions.",
        "Nevertheless, there is also an advantage of the loose definition: we do not bias towards one particular dialog strategy since our goal here is to find some general and easily measurable system performance factors that are correlated with the user satisfaction."

        "A set of good evaluation measures should be sensible to subtle system changes.",
        "We assess the differentiating power of the evaluation measures using the dialog corpus collected during the dry-runs.",

        "For each improvement stage, we compute the values for the three evaluation measures averaging across all dialogs from all users.",

        "The simulated corpus consists of 180 dialogs from 20 simulated users, which is of the same size as the real user corpus.",

        "Using two-tailed t-test at significance level p<0.05, we observe that there are no statistically significant differences between the two pools of scores.",

        "User simulation has been increasingly used in generating large corpora for using machine learning techniques to automate dialog system design.",
        "However, user simulation has not been used much in testing dialog systems.",
        "There are two major concerns: 1. we are not sure how well the state-of-the-art user simulation can mimic realistic user behaviors; 2. we do not get important feedback on user satisfaction when replacing human users with simulated users.",
        "In this study, we suggest that while the simulated users might not be mature to use in the final system evaluation stage, they can be used in the early testing stages of the system development cycle to make sure that the system is functioning in the desired way.",
        "We further propose a set of evaluation measures that can be extracted from the simulation logs to assess the system performance.",
        "We validate these evaluation measures on human user dialogs and examine the differentiating power of these measures.",

        "We also apply the evaluation measures on a simulation corpus trained from the real user dialogs.",
        "We show that the user satisfaction scores estimated on the simulated dialogs do not significantly differ statistically from the real users' satisfaction scores.",
        "Therefore, we suggest that the estimated user satisfaction can be used to assess the system performance while testing with simulated users.",
