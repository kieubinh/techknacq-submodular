        "One of the goals in developing dialogue systems that users find appealing and natural is to endow the systems with natural and contextually appropriate output.",
        "This encompasses a broad range of research issues.",
        "The one we address in this paper pertains to style in the interpersonal dimension: does using personal vs. impersonal style of system output have an effect on dialogue system users, in particular, on their judgments about the system and on the way they formulate their input to the system?",
        "We define the personal/impersonal style dichotomy as reflecting primarily a distinction with respect to agentivity: personal style involves the explicit realization of an agent, whereas impersonal style avoids it.",
        "In the simplest way it is manifested by the presence of explicit reference to the dialogue participants (typically by means of personal pronouns) vs. its absence, respectively.",
        "More generally, active voice and finite verb forms are typical for personal style, whereas impersonal style often, though not exclusively, employs passive constructions or infinite verb forms:",
        "(1) Typical personal style constructions:",
        "a. I found 20 albums.",
        "b.",
        "You have 20 albums.",
        "c. Please search for albums by The Beatles.",
        "(2) Typical impersonal style constructions:",

        "c. The database contains 20 albums.",
        "d. 20 albums found.",
        "The designer of a dialogue system has the choice to make it manifest (its own and the user's) agen-tivity linguistically through the use of personal constructions or not.",
        "Previous experiments with simulated systems have shown that a natural language interface with a synthesized voice should not say \"I\" (Nass and Brave, 2005) and that users align the style of their input to that of the system output (Brennan and Ohaeri, 1994).",
        "(See Section 2 for more detail.)",
        "The dialogue system sammie developed in the talk project (Becker et al., 2007) can use either personal or impersonal output style.",
        "In personal style, it generates constructions making explicit reference to the agent (both the user and the system itself), such as (1a-1c); in impersonal style, it avoids explicit reference to any agent, as in (2a-2d).",
        "The system can be set either to use one style consistently throughout a dialogue session, or to align to the user's style, i.e., mimic the user's style on a turn-by-turn basis.",
        "Inspired by the earlier results obtained with simulated systems (Nass and Brave, 2005; Brennan and",
        "Ohaeri, 1994), we ran an experiment to test the effects of style manipulation in the sammie system.",
        "In this paper, we compare two versions of the system, one using consistently the personal output style and the other the impersonal style.",
        "We designed our experiment to test (i) whether the users' judgments of the system's usability and performance differ among the system versions using the personal vs. impersonal style, and (ii) whether users align to the system style.",
        "In Section 2 we review previous experiments concerning the effect of system output style on users' judgments and style.",

        "(Nass and Brave, 2005) address the issue whether a voice interface should say \"I\" by investigating several dimensions of user attitudes to their simulated system with a synthetic vs. recorded voice.",
        "Generally, agents that use \"I\" are perceived more like a person than those that do not.",
        "However, systems tend to be more positively rated when consistent with respect to such parameters as personality, gender, ontology (human vs. machine), etc.",
        "A system with a recorded voice is perceived as more humanlike and thus entitled to the use of \"I\", whereas a synthetic-voice interface is not perceived as human enough to use \"I\" to refer to itself (Nass et al., 2006).",
        "Another question is whether system output style influences users' input formulation, as would be expected due to the phenomenon of alignment, which is generally considered a basic principle in natural language dialogue (Garrod and Pickering, 2004).",
        "Experiments targeting human-human conversation show that in spite of the variety of linguistic expressions available, speakers in spontaneous dialogues tend to express themselves in similar ways at lexical and syntactic levels.",
        "For example, the surface form of a question can affect the format of the answer: the question \"What time do you close?\"",
        "will more likely get the response \"Five o'clock\" than\"At five o'clock\".",
        "On the other hand, \"At five o'clock\" is a more probable answer to \"At what time do you close?\"",
        "(Levelt and Kelter, 1982).",
        "There is evidence that alignment happens automatically as a result of priming, e.g., (Hadelich et al., 2004) for lexical alignment.",
        "Lexical and syntactic alignment is present in human-computer interaction, too.",
        "(Brennan, 1996) suggested that users adopt system's terms to avoid errors, expecting the system to be inflexible.",
        "However, recent experiments show that alignment in human-computer interaction is also automatic and its strength is comparable to that in human-human communication (Branigan et al., 2003; Pearson et al., 2006).",
        "Early results concerning users' alignment to system output style in the interpersonal dimension are reported in (Brennan and Ohaeri, 1994): They distinguish three styles: anthropomorphic (the system refers to itself using first person pronouns, like in (1a) above, fluent (complete sentences, but no self-reference) and telegraphic, like (2d).",
        "They found no difference in users' perception of the system's intelligence across the different conditions.",
        "However, they observed that the anthropomorphic group was more than twice as likely to refer to the computer using the second person pronoun \"you\" and it used more indirect requests and conventional politeness then the other groups.",
        "They concluded that the anthropomorphic style is undesirable for dialogue systems because it encourages more complex user input which is harder to recognize and interpret.",
        "The described experiments used either the Wizard-of-Oz paradigm (Brennan, 1996) or preprogrammed system output (Branigan et al., 2003; Nass and Brave, 2005) and involved written communication.",
        "Such methods allow one to test assumptions about idealized human-computer interaction.",
        "The purpose of our experiment was to test whether similar effects arise in an interaction with an actual dialogue system, which may be plagued, among other factors, by speech recognition problems."

        "We did not find any significant influence of system output style on users' attitudes.",
        "The only index with a weak tendency in the predicted direction is perceived humanness ofthe system (t(25)=1.64, p=.06 (one-tailed); see Figure 2).",
        "This goes in line with the earlier observation that an interface that refers to itself by means of a personal pronoun is perceived to be more human-like than one that does",
        "Figure 3: Distribution chart for syntactic construction types in user utterances depending on system output style not (Nass and Brave, 2005).",
        "The next issue we investigated was whether the users formulated their input differently with the personal vs. impersonal system version.",
        "For each dialogue session, we calculated the percentage of utterances containing the feature of interest relative to the total number of user utterances in the session.",
        "First we analyzed the distribution of personal, impersonal and telegraphic constructions across the personal and impersonal style conditions.",

        "4.",
        "In the impersonal style condition we found a significantly lower proportion of verb-containing utterances than utterances in telegraphic form (t(13)=3.5, p=0.00 (one-tailed)).",
        "But in the personal style condition there was no statistically significant difference (t(13)=0.7, p=0.25 (one-tailed)).",

        "We expected to find more personal pronouns in personal than in impersonal style condition (Brennan and Ohaeri, 1994).",

        "Another prediction based on (Brennan and Ohaeri, 1994) was to find more politeness markers in the personal style.",
        "However, the analysis showed that participants in the personal style condition did not use significantly more politeness markers than those in the impersonal style condition (t(20)=1.06, p=0.15 (one-tailed)).",
        "Finally, (Brennan and Ohaeri, 1994) predicted that personal style, being more flexible, might cause more speech recognition problems than input in impersonal style.",

        "Contrary to expectations, we also did not find any significant effect of stylemanipulation on the number of personal pronouns, nor on the number of politeness markers.",
        "Since alignment can also be seen as a process of gradual adjustment among dialogue participants in the course of their interaction, we were interested in whether participants tended to converge to using particular constructions as their session with the system progressed.",
        "For each participant we divided the transcribed conversation in two halves.",
        "Using paired samples t-test, we compared the proportion of personal, impersonal and telegraphic constructions in the first and second halves of the conversations for both style conditions.",

      "text": [
        "We presented the results of an experiment with the in-car multimodal dialogue system sammie, aimed to test whether we obtain effects similar to earlier findings concerning the influence of system output style in the interpersonal dimension on the users' subjective judgments of a system (Nass and Brave, 2005) as well as their formulation of input (Bren-nan and Ohaeri, 1994).",
        "Although our results are not conclusive, they point at a range of issues for further research.",
        "Regarding users' attitudes to the system, we found no significant difference among the styles.",
        "This is similar to (Brennan and Ohaeri, 1994) who found no difference in intelligence attributed to the system by the users, but it is at odds with the earlier finding that a synthetic voice interface was judged to be more useful when avoiding self-reference by personal pronouns (Nass and Brave, 2005).",
        "Whereas (Brennan and Ohaeri, 1994) used a flight reservation dialogue system, (Nass and Brave, 2005) used a phone-based auction system which read out an introduction and five object descriptions.",
        "There are two points to note: First, the subjects were exposed to system output that was a read out continuous text rather than turns in an interaction.",
        "This may have reinforced the activation of particular style features.",
        "Second, the auction task may have sensi-bilized the subjects to the distinction between subjective (the system's) vs. objective information presentation, and thus make them more sensitive to whether the system presents itself as an active agent or not.",
        "Regarding the question whether users align their style to that of the system, where previous experiments showed strong effects of alignment (Brennan and Ohaeri, 1994), our experiment shows some effects, but some of the results seem conflicting.",
        "On the one hand, subjects interacting with the personal style version of the system used more personal constructions than those interacting with the impersonal style version.",
        "However, subjects in either condition did not show any significant difference with respect to the use of impersonal constructions or telegraphic forms.",
        "We also found a higher proportion of telegraphic constructions than verb-containing ones within the impersonal style condition, but no such difference in the personal style.",
        "Finally, when we consider alignment over time, we find no change in construction usage in the personal style, whereas we find a decrease in the use of personal constructions in the impersonal style.",
        "That there is no difference in the use of telegraphic constructions across conditions is not surprising.",
        "Being just phrasal sentence fragments, these constructions are neutral with respect to style.",
        "But why does there seem to be an alignment effect for personal constructions and not for others?",
        "One way of explaining this is that (some of) the constructions that we counted as impersonal are common in both styles.",
        "Besides their deliberate use as means to avoid explicit reference to oneself, the constructions typical for impersonal style also have their normal, neutral usage, and therefore, some ofthe utterances that we have classified as impersonal style might just be neutral formulations, rather than cases of distancing or \"de-agentivization\".",
        "However, we could not test this hypothesis, because we have not found a way to reliably distinguish between neutral and marked, truly impersonal utterances.",
        "This is an issue requiring further work.",
        "The difference between our results concerning alignment and those of (Brennan and Ohaeri, 1994) is not likely to be due to a difference in the degree of interactivity (as with (Nass and Brave, 2005)).",
        "We now comment on other differences between our systems, which might have contributed to the differences in results.",
        "One aspect where we differ concerns our distinction between personal and impersonal style, both in the implementation of the sammie system and in the experiment: We include the presence/absence of agentivity not only in the system's reference to itself (akin to (Nass and Brave, 2005) and (Bren-nan and Ohaeri, 1994)), but also in addressing the user.",
        "This concept of the personal/impersonal distinction was inspired by such differences observed in a study of instructional texts in several languages (Kruijff et al., 1999), where the latter dimension is predominant.",
        "The present experiment results make it pertinent that more research into the motives behind expressing or suppressing agentivity in both dimensions is needed.",
        "Apart from the linguistic design of the system's output, other factors influence users' behavior and perception of the system, and thus might confound experiment results, e.g., functionality, design, ergonomics, speech synthesis and speech recognition.",
        "Earlier experiments reported in (Nass and Brave, 2005) suggest that a system with synthesized speech should be more positively rated when it does not refer to itself as an active agent by personal constructions.",
        "Whereas the system used by (Brennan and Ohaeri, 1994) used written interaction, we used the mary text-to-speech synthesis system (Schroder and Trouvain, 2003) with an MBROLA diphone synthesizer, which produces an acceptable though not outstanding output quality.",
        "But as discussed earlier, contrary to (Nass and Brave, 2005) we have not observed a difference in the users' attitudes depending on style.",
        "It thus remains an open issue what effect speech output quality has on on the users' attitudes and alignment behavior.",
        "Regarding a possible influence of speech recognition on our results, we performed a post-hoc analysis (Kruijff-Korbayova et al., 2008), which did not reveal significant differences in user attitudes or alignment behavior depending on better or worse speech recognition performance experienced by the users.",
        "A future experiment should address the possibility of an interaction between system style and speech recognition performance as both factors might be influencing the user simultaneously.",
        "One radical difference between our experiment and the earlier ones is that the users of our system are occupied by the driving task, and therefore only have a limited cognitive capacity left to devote to the interaction with the system.",
        "This may make them less susceptible to the subtleties of style manipulation than would be the case if they were free of other tasks.",
        "A possible future experiment could address this issue by including a non-driving condition.",
        "Finally, as we pointed out in the introduction, the sammie system can also be used in an style-alignment mode, where it mimics the user's style on turn-to-turn basis.",
        "We plan to present experimental results comparing the alignment-mode with the fixed personal/impersonal style in a future publication."
