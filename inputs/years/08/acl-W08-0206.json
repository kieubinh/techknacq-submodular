        "In the past two decades, there has been tremendous progress in natural language processing (NLP) and NLP techniques have been applied to various real-world applications such as internet/intranet search and information extraction.",
        "Consequently, there has been an increasing demand from the industry for people with special training in NLP.",
        "To meet the demand, the University of Washington recently launched a new Professional Masters Program in Computational Linguistics (CLMA).",
        "To earn the master's degree, students must take nine courses and complete a final project.",
        "The detail of the program can be found in (Bender et al., 2008).",
        "One of the required courses is LING572 (Advanced statistical methods in NLP), a course that I have been teaching every year for the past three years.",
        "During the process and especially in Year 3, I have made many changes to course content, assignments, and the usage of discussion board.",

        "NLP), and LING573 (NLP Systems and Applications).",
        "LING570 and LING571 are organized by NLP tasks (e.g., language model, POS tagging, Named-entity tagging, chunking for LING570, and parsing, semantics and discourse for LING571); LING572 is organized by machine learning methods; LING573 is the place where students use the knowledge learned in LING570-572 to build NLP systems for some real applications (e.g., question answering and information extraction).",

        "It would be impossible to cover all the major machine learning (ML) algorithms in one quarter; therefore, one of the decisions that I made from the very beginning is that the course would focus on major classification algorithms and spend only one week showing how these algorithms can be applied to sequence labeling problems.",
        "I believe that once students have a solid grasp of these algorithms, it would be easy for them to learn algorithms for other kinds of learning problems (e.g., regression, clustering, and ranking).",
        "The next question is what classification algorithms should be included in the syllabus.",
        "Table 1 shows the topics covered each year and the number of sessions spent on each topic.",
        "The topics can be roughly divided into three units: (1) supervised learning, (2) semi-and unsupervised learning, and (3) other related topics.",
        "The teaching plan for Year 1 turned out to be too ambitious.",
        "For instance, six supervised algorithms were covered in four weeks (i.e., 8 sessions) and four semi-/unsupervised algorithms were covered in 2.5 weeks.",
        "Such a tight schedule did not leave sufficient time for students to digest all the important concepts and equations.",
        "In Year2, I reducedthe amountoftime spentonUnit (2).",
        "For instance, I spent only one session discussing the main ideas in the EM algorithm, without going through the details of the mathematic deduction and special cases of the algorithm such as the backward-forward algorithm and the inside-outside algorithm.",
        "Other changes were made to other units, as shown in the second column of Table 1.",
        "In the first two years, my lecturing style was similar to the tutorials given at major NLP conferences (e.g., ACL) in that I covered a lot of material in a short period of time and expected students to digest all the details after class.",
        "This approach did not work very well because our students came from very diverse backgrounds (e.g., linguistics, literature, computer science) and many of them were not familiar with mathematic concepts (e.g., Lagrangian, dual problem, quadratic programming, hill climbing) that are commonly used in machine learning.",
        "Most of the students were also new to NLP, taking only one quarter of NLP-related courses before taking",
        "LING572.",
        "Based on this observation, I made major changes to the syllabus in Year 3: I reduced the lecture ma-",

        "terial and spent more time on discussion and illustrative examples.",
        "For example, on average 1.25 sessions were spent on a supervised algorithm in Year 2 and that number increased to 2.17 sessions in Year 3.",
        "I also added one session on information theory, which provides theoretic foundation for many learning methods.",
        "Because of this change, some important topics had to be cut, as shown in the last column of Table 1.",
        "Fortunately, I was able to incorporate some of the removed topics to two other courses (i.e., LING570 and a seminar on semi-and unsupervised learning) that I was teaching in the same year.",
        "The feedback from students indicated that the new course plan for Year 3 was more effective than the ones for the previous two years.",
        "Another change I made was that I divided the teaching material into three types: (1) the essential knowledge that students should fully understand, (2) more advanced topics that students should be aware of but do not have to understand all the details, and (3) related topics that are not covered in class but are available on additional slides for people who want to learn more by themselves.",
        "Taking MaxEnt as an example, Type (1) includes the maximum entropy principle, the modeling, GIS training, and decoding; Type (2) includes regularization and the math-ematic proof that shows the relation between maximum likelihood and maximum entropy as provided in (Ratnaparkhi, 1997), and Type (3) includes L-BFGS training and the similarity between SVM and MaxEnt with regularization (Klein, 2007).",
        "Making this distinction helps students focus on the most essential part of the algorithms and at the same time provides additional material for more advanced students.",

        "One challenge of teaching a statistic NLP course is the lack of good textbooks on the subject; as a result, most of the reading material come from conference and journal papers.",
        "The problem is that many of the algorithms covered in class were originally proposed in non-NLP fields such as machine learning and applied mathematics, and the original papers are often heavy in mathematical proofs and rarely refer to the NLP tasks that our students are familiar with.",
        "On the other hand, NLP papers that apply these algorithms to NLP tasks often assume that the readers are already familiar with the algorithms and consequently do not explain the algorithms in detail.",
        "Because it is hard to find a suitable paper to cover all the theoretic and application aspects of a learning algorithm, I chose several papers for each algorithm and specified the sections that the students should focus on.",
        "For instance, for Maximum Entropy, I picked (Berger et al., 1996; Ratnaparkhi, 1997) for the basic theory, (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) for an application (POS tagging in this case), and (Klein and Manning, 2003) for more advanced topics such as optimization and smoothing.",
        "For the more sophisticated learning methods (e.g., MaxEnt and SVM), it is very important for students to read the assigned papers beforehand.",
        "However, some students choose not to do so for various reasons; meanwhile, other students might spend too much time trying to understand everything in the papers.",
        "To address this problem, in Year 3 I added five reading assignments, one for each of the following topics: information theory, Naive Bayes, MaxEnt, SVM, and TBL.",
        "Each assignment consists of simple questions such as the one in Appendix A.",
        "Students were asked to turn in their answers to the questions before class.",
        "Although the assignments were very simple, the effect was obvious as students started to ask in-depth questions even before the topics were covered in class."

      "text": [
        "In addition to the reading assignments mentioned above, students also have weekly assignments.",
        "For the sake of clarity, we divide the latter into two types, written and programming assignments, depending on whether programming is required.",
        "Significant changes have been made to both types, as explained below.",
        "In Year 1, there were three written and six programming assignments.",
        "The written assignments were mainly on mathematic proof, and one example is given in Appendix B.",
        "The programming assignments asked students to use the following existing packages to build NLP systems.",

        "To complete the assignments, the students needed to study some functions in the source code to understand exactly how the learning algorithms were implemented in the packages.",
        "They would then write pre-and post-processing tools, create data files, and build an end-to-end system for a particular NLP task.",
        "They would then present their work in class and write a final paper to report their findings.",
        "In Year 2 I made two major changes to the assignments.",
        "First, I reduced the number of written assignments on theoretic proof.",
        "While such assignments strengthen students' mathematic capability, they were very challenging to many students, especially the ones who lacked mathematics and statistics training.",
        "The assignments were also not as effective as programming assignments in understanding the basic concepts for the learning algorithms.",
        "The second major change was to replace the three packages mentioned above with Mallet (McCallum, 2002), a well-known package in the NLP field.",
        "Mallet is a well-designed package that contains almost all the learning methods covered in the course such as Naive Bayes, decision tree, MaxEnt, boosting, and bagging; once the training and test data were put into the Mallet data format, it was easy to run all these methods and compared the results.",
        "For the programming assignments, in addition to reading certain Mallet functions to understand how the learning methods were implemented, the students were also asked to extend the package in various ways.",
        "For instance, the package includes a text-user-interface (TUI) class called Vec-tors2Classify.java, which produces a classifier from the training data, uses the classifier to classify the test data, compares the results with gold standard, and outputs accuracy and the confusion matrix.",
        "In one assignment, students were asked to first separate the code for training and testing, and then add the beam search to the latter module so that the new code would work for sequence labeling tasks.",
        "While using Mallet as a black box is straightforward, extending it with additional functionality is much more difficult.",
        "Because the package did not have a detailed document that explained how its main classes should be used, I spent more than a week going through hundreds of classes in Mallet and wrote a 11-page guide based on my findings.",
        "While the guide was very helpful, many students still struggled with the assignments, especially the ones who were not used to navigating through other people's code and/or who were not familiar with Java, the language that Mallet was written in.",
        "To address these problems, in Year 3, we changed the focus of the assignments: instead of studying and extending Mallet code, students would create their own package from scratch and use Mallet only as a reference.",
        "For instance, in one assignment, students would implement the two Naive Bayes models as described in (McCallum and Nigam, 1998) and compare the classification results with the results produced by the Mallet Naive Bayes learner.",
        "In the beam search assignment, students' code would include modules that read in the model produced by Mallet and calculate P (y | x) for a test instance x and a class label y.",
        "Because the code no longer needed to call Mallet functions, students were free to use whatever language they were comfortable with and could treat Mallet as a black box.",
        "The complete assignments are shown in Appendix C. In summary, students implemented six learners (Naive Bayes, kNN, Decision Tree, MaxEnt, SVM, TBL), beam search, and the code for feature selection.",

        "While the workload was demanding, about 90% of students completed the assignments successfully.",
        "Several factors contribute to the success:",
        "• All the learners were evaluated on the same classification task.",
        "The input and output data format were very similar across different learners; as a result, the code that handled input and output could be reused, and the classification results of different learners could be compared directly.",
        "• I restricted the scope of the assignments so that they were doable in a week.",
        "For instance, the complexity of a TBL learner highly depends on the form of the transformations and the type of learning problem.",
        "In the TBL assignment, the learner was used to handle classification problems and the transformation had the form ifa feature is present in an instance, change the class label from A to B.",
        "Implementing such a learner was much easier than implementing a learner (e.g., fnTBL) that use more complex transformations to handle sequence labeling problems.",
        "• Efficiency is an important issue, and there are often differences between algorithms on paper and the code that implements the algorithms.",
        "To identify those differences and potential pitfalls that students could run into, I completed all the assignments myself at least a week before the assignments were due, and shared some of my findings in class.",
        "I also told students the kind of results to be expected, and encouraged students to discuss the results and implementation tricks on the discussion board.",
        "Implementing machine learning algorithms is often an art, as there are many ways to improve efficiency.",
        "Two examples are given below.",
        "While such tricks are well-known to NLP researchers, they are often new to students and going through them in class can help students to speed up their code significantly.",
        "The trainer for TBL",
        "As described in (Brill, 1995), a TBL trainer picks one transformation in each iteration, applies it to the training data, and repeats the process until no more good transformations can be found.",
        "To choose the best transformation, a naive approach would enumerate all the possible transformations, for each transformation go through the data once to calculate the net gain, and choose the transformation with the highest net gain.",
        "This approach is very inefficient as the data have to be scanned through multiple times.",
        "A much better implementation would be to go through the training data only once, and for each feature in each training instance, update the net gains of the corresponding transformations accordingly.Students were also encouraged to read (Ngai and Florian, 2001), which proposed another efficient implementation of TBL.",
        "The decoder for Naive Bayes",
        "In the multivariate Bernoulli event model for the text classification task (McCallum and Nigam, 1998), at the test time the class for a document d is chosen according to Eq (1).",
        "If we calculate P(d|c) according to Eq (2), as given in the paper, we have to go through all the features in the feature set F. However, as shown in Eq (3) and (4), the first product in Eq (3), denoted as Z(c) in Eq (4), is a constant with respect to d and can be calculated beforehand and stored with each c. Therefore, to classify d, we only need to go through the features that are present in d. Implementing Eq (4) instead of Eq (2) reduces running time tremendously."

        "Furthermore, some students feel more comfortable posting to a discussion board than raising the questions in class or emailing the instructor.",
        "Therefore, I provided a discussion board each time LING572 was offered and the board was linked to the course website.",
        "However, the board was not used as much as I had hoped in the first two years.",
        "In Year 3, I took a more proactive approach: first, I reminded students several times that emails to me should be reserved only for confidential questions and all the non-confidential questions should be posted to the discussion board.",
        "They should also check the discussion board at least daily and they were encouraged to reply to their classmates' questions if they knew the answers.",
        "Second, if a student emailed me any questions that should go to the discussion board, I would copy the questions to the board and ask the sender to find my answers there.",
        "Third, I checked the board several times per day and most of the questions raised there were answered within an hour if not sooner.",
        "As a result, there was a significant increase of the usage of the board, as shown in Table 2.",
        "For instance, compared to Year 2, the average number of posts per student in Year 3 more than quadrupled, and at the same time the number of emails I received from the students was cut by 65%.",

        "Interestingly, although the amount of time spent on the course in Y2 and Y3 was about the same, the students in Y3 felt the assigned work was more reasonable than the students in Y2.",
        "This highlights the importance of choosing appropriate assignments based on students' background.",
        "Also, while the lecture material was cut substantially over the years, students in Y3 felt that they learned more than the students in Y1 and Y2, implying that it is more beneficial to cover a small number of learning methods in depth than to hurry through a large number of topics."

        "• A common pitfall for course design is being overambitious with the course plan.",
        "What matters the most is not how much material is covered in class, but how much students actually digest.",
        "• When using journal/conference papers as reading material, it is often better to select multiple papers and specify the sections in the papers that are most relevant.",
        "Giving reading assignments would encourage students to read papers before class and provide guidelines as what questions they should focus on.",
        "• Adding new functionality to an existing package is often difficult if the package is very complex and not well-documented.",
        "Therefore, this kind of assignments should be avoided if possible.",
        "In contrast, students often learn more from implementing the methods from scratch than from reading other people's source code.",
        "• Implementing ML methods is an art, and pointing out various tricks and potential obstacles beforehand would help students tremendously.",
