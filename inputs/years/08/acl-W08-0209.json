        "While the commonly used textbooks describe established and mainstream research methods for each topic in detail, more recent research papers are usually omitted.",
        "By using such papers as the bases for programming assignments – instantiated in the framework described earlier – and exam questions, students can gain important insights into how new solutions to existing problems are formulated; insights that can only come from a hands-on approach to problem solving."

        "Designing an introductory level natural language processing course for a class of first year computer science and linguistics graduate students is a challenging task.",
        "It is important to strive for balance between breadth and depth – it is important not only to introduce the students to a variety of language processing techniques and applications but also to provide sufficient detail about each.",
        "However, we claim that there is another important requirement for a successful implementation of such a course.",
        "Like any other graduate-level course offered to first year students, it should encourage them to approach solutions to problems as researchers.",
        "In order to meet such a requirement, the course should have two important dimensions:",
        "In this paper, we describe our attempts to engineer such a course.",
        "In section 2, we describe the specific goals we had in mind for such a course and how it differs from the previous version of the introductory course we taught at our institution.",
        "Section 3 discusses how we fully integrated an open-source programming framework into our curriculum and used it for programming assignments as well as in-class sessions.",
        "In a similar vein, section 4 describes our preliminary efforts to combine interesting research ideas for various topics with the framework above.",
        "We also have definite plans to expand the course curriculum to take more novel ideas from recent NLP literature for each topic and adapt them to instructive hands-on assignments.",
        "Furthermore, we are developing extensions and add-ons for the programming framework that we plan to contribute to the project.",

        "• A Uniform Programming Framework.",
        "The",
        "previous version of our introductory course took a more fragmented approach and used different programming languages and tools for different assignments.",
        "For example, we used an in-house HMM library written in C for any HMM-based assignments and Perl for some other assignments.",
        "As expected, such an approach requires students to familiarize themselves with a different programming interface for each assignment and discourages students to explore on their own.",
        "To address this concern, we chose the Python (Python, 2007) programming language and the Natural Language Toolkit (Loper and Bird, 2002), written entirely in Python, for all our assignments and programming tasks.",
        "We discuss our use of NLTK in more detail in the next section.",
        "• Real-world Data & Corpora.",
        "In our previous course, students did not have access to any of the corpora that are used in actual NLP research.",
        "We found this to be a serious shortcoming and wanted to ensure that our new curriculum allowed students to use real corpora for evaluating their programming assignments.",
        "• Exposure to Research.",
        "While we had certainly made it a point to introduce recent research work in our lectures for all topics in the previous course, we believed that a much",
        "richer integration was required in order to allow a more realistic peek into NLP research.",
        "• Satisfying a Diverse Audience.",
        "We wanted the curriculum to appeal to both computer science and linguistics students since they the course was cross-listed in both departments.",
        "• Continuing Interest.",
        "A large number of the students enrolled in the course were undecided about what research area to pursue.",
        "We wanted to present a fair picture of what NLP research actually entails and encourage any interested students to take the more advanced part of the course being offered later in the year."

        "We use the Python programming language and NLTK as our programming framework for the curriculum.",
        "Python is currently one of the most popular programming languages – it is fully object oriented and multi-platform, natively supports high-level dynamic data types such as lists and hashes (termed dictionaries in Python), has very readable syntax and, most importantly, ships with an extensive standard library for almost every conceivable task.",
        "Although Python already has most of the functionality needed to perform very simple NLP tasks, its still not powerful enough for most standard ones.",
        "This is where the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) comes in.",
        "NLTK, written entirely in Python, is a collection of modules and corpora, released under an open-source license, that allows students to learn and conduct research in NLP (Bird et al., 2008).",
        "The most important advantage of using NLTK is that it is entirely self-contained.",
        "Not only does it provide convenient functions and wrappers that can be used as building blocks for common NLP tasks, it also provides raw and preprocessed versions of standard corpora used frequently in NLP literature.",
        "Together, Python and NLTK constitute one of the most potent tools for instruction of NLP (Madnani, 2007) and allow us to develop hands-on assignments that can appeal to a broad audience including both linguistics and computer science students.",
        "Figure 1: An Excerpt from the output of a Python script used for an in-class exercise demonstrating the simplicity of the Python-NLTK combination.",
        "In order to illustrate the simplicity and utility of this tool to the students, we went through an in-class exercise at the beginning of the class.",
        "The exercise asked the students to solve the following simple language processing problem:",
        "Find the frequency of occurrences of the following words in the state-of-the-union addresses of the last 6 American Presidents: war, peace, economy & aid.",
        "Also draw histograms for each word.",
        "We then went through a step-by-step process of how one would go about solving such a problem.",
        "The solution hinged on two important points:",
        "(a) NLTK ships with a corpus of the last 50 years of state-of-the-union addresses and provides a native conditional frequency distribution object to easily keep track of conditional counts.",
        "(b) Drawing a histogram in Python is as simple as the statement print '#'*n where n is the count for each query word.",
        "Given these two properties, the Python solution for the problem was only 20 lines long.",
        "Figure 1 shows an excerpt from the output of this script.",
        "This exercise allowed us to impress upon the students that the programming framework for the course is simple and fun so that they may start exploring it on their own.",
        "We describe more concrete instances of NLTK usage in our curriculum below.",
        "Hidden Markov Models (Rabiner, 1989) have proven to be a very useful formalism in NLP and have been used in a wide range of problems, e.g., parsing, machine translation and part-of-speech (POS) tagging.",
        "In our previous curriculum, we had employed an in-house C++ implementation of HMMs for our assignments.",
        "As part of our new curriculum, we introduced Markov models (and HMMs) in the context of POS tagging and in a much more hands-on fashion.",
        "To do this, we created an assignment where students were required to implement Viterbi decoding for an HMM and output the best POS tag sequence for any given sentence.",
        "There were several ways in which NLTK made this extremely simple:",
        "• Since we had the entire source code of the HMM module from NLTK available, we factored out the part of the code that handled the HMM training, parameterized it and provided that to students as a separate module they they could use to train the HMMs.",
        "Such refactoring not only allows for cleaner code boundaries but it also allows the students to use a variety of training parameters (such as different forms of smoothed distributions for the transition and emission probabilities) and measure their effects with little effort.",
        "Listing 1 shows how the refactoring was accomplished: the training code was put into a separate module called hmmtrainer and automatically called in the",
        "Listing 1: A skeleton of the refactored NLTK HMM code used to build a hands-on HMM assignment",

        "main hmm class when instantiating it.",
        "The students had to write the code for the decode and tag methods of this class.",
        "The HMM training was setup to be able to use a variety of smoothed distributions, e.g. Lidstone, Laplace etc., all available from NLTK.",
        "• NLTK ships with the tokenized and POS tagged version of the Brown corpus – one of the most common corpora employed for corpus linguistics and, in particular, for evaluating POS taggers.",
        "We used Section A of the corpus for training the HMMs and asked the students to evaluate their taggers on Section B.",
        "Another advantage of this assignment was that the if students were interested in how the supervised training process actually worked, they could simply examine the hmmtrainer module that was also written entirely in Python.",
        "An assignment with such characteristics in our previous course would have required knowledge of C++, willingness to wade through much more complicated code and would certainly not have been as instructive.",
        "Another topic where we were able to leverage the strengths of both NLTK and Python was when introducing the students to finite state automata.",
        "Previously, we only discussed the fundamentals of finite state automata in class and then asked the students to apply this knowledge to morphological parsing by using PC-Kimmo (Koskenniemi, 1983).",
        "However, working with PC-Kimmo required the students to directly fill entries in transition tables",
        "Listing 2: An illustration of the simple finite state transducer interface in NLTK",
        "from nltk_contrib.fst import fst",
        "f = fst.FST('test' ) #instantiate f .initial_state = 1 # set initial",
        "using a very rigid syntax.",
        "In the new curriculum, we could easily rely on the finite state module that ships with NLTK to use such automata in a very natural way as shown in Listing 2.",
        "With such an easy to use interface, we could concentrate instead on the more important concepts underlying the building and cascading of transducers to accomplish a language processing task.",
        "As our example task, we asked the students to implement the Soundex Algorithm, a phonetic algorithm commonly used by libraries and the Census Bureau to represent people's names as they are pronounced in English.",
        "We found that not only did the students easily implement such a complex transducer, they also took the time to perform some analysis on their own and determine the shortcomings of the Soundex algorithm.",
        "This was only possible because of the simple interface and short development cycle provided by the Python-NLTK combination.",
        "In addition, NLTK also provides a single method that can render the transducer as a postscript or image file that can prove extremely useful for debugging.",
        "In our new version of the course, we consciously chose to use primarily open-source technologies in the curriculum.",
        "We feel that it is important to say a few words about this choice: an open-source project not only allows instructors to examine the source code and re-purpose it for their own use (as we did in section 3.1) but it also encourages students to delve deep into the programming framework if they are curious about how something works.",
        "In fact, a few of our students actually discovered subtle idiosyncrasies and bugs in the NLTK source while exploring on their own, filed bug reports where necessary and shared the findings with the entire class.",
        "This experience allowed all students to understand the challenges of language processing.",
        "More importantly, we believe an open-source project fosters collaboration in the community that it serves.",
        "For example, a lot of the functionality of NLTK hinges on important technical contributions, such as our SRILM interface described in section 6, from the large academic NLP community that can be used by any member of the community for research and for teaching."

      "text": [
        "Besides employing a uniform programming framework that the students could pick up easily and learn to explore on their own, the other important goal of the new curriculum was to incorporate ideas and techniques from interesting NLP research publications into assignments and exams.",
        "The motivation, of course, was to get our students to think about and possibly even implement these ideas.",
        "Since we cannot discuss all instances in the curriculum where we leveraged research publications (due to space considerations), we only discuss two such instances in detail below.",
        "The first topic for which we constructed a more open-ended research-oriented assignment was lexical semantics.",
        "We focused, in particular, on the WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) database.",
        "WordNet is a very popular lexical database and has been used extensively in NLP literature over the years.",
        "In the previous course, our assignment on lexical semantics asked the students to use the online interface to WordNet to learn the basic concept of a synset and the various relations that are defined over synsets such as hyponymy, hypernymy etc.",
        "A very simple change would have been to ask the students to use the WordNet interface included with NLTK to perform the same analysis.",
        "However, we thought that a more interesting assignment would be to explore the structure of the four WordNet taxonomies (Noun, Verb, Adjective and Adverb).",
        "This taxonomy can be simplified and thought of as a directed acyclic graph G = (V, E) where each synset u e V is a node and each edge (u, v) e E represents that v is a hypernym of u.",
        "Given such a graph, some very interesting statistics can be computed about the topology of WordNet itself (Devitt and Vogel, 2004).",
        "In our assignment, we asked the students to use the NLTK WordNet interface to compute some of these statistics automatically and answer some interesting questions:",
        "(a) What percentage of the nodes in the Noun taxonomy are leaf nodes?",
        "(b) Which are the nine most general root nodes in the Noun taxonomy and what is the node distribution across these roots?",
        "(c) Compute the branching factor (number of descendants) for each node in the Noun taxonomy both including and excluding leaf nodes.",
        "What percentage of nodes have a branching factor less than 5?",
        "Less than 20?",
        "Does this tell something you about the shallowness/depth of the taxonomy?",
        "(d) If we plot a graph with the number of senses of each verb in the Verb taxonomy against its polysemy rank, what kind of graph do we get?",
        "What conclusion can be drawn from this graph?",
        "(e) Compare the four taxonomies on average polysemy, both including and excluding monose-mous words.",
        "What conclusions can you draw from this?",
        "Of course, the assignment also contained the usual questions pertaining to the content of the WordNet database rather than just its structure.",
        "We believe that this assignment was much more instructive because not only did it afford the students a close examination into the usage as well as structure of a valuable NLP resource, but also required them to apply their knowledge of graph theory.",
        "The second instance where we used a research paper was when writing the HMM question for the final exam.",
        "We thought it would be illuminating to ask the students to apply what they had learned in class about HMMs to an instance of HMM used in an actual NLP scenario.",
        "For this purpose, we chose the HMM described in (Miller et al., 1999) and as shown in Figure 2.",
        "As part of the question, we ex-",
        "Figure 2: An HMM used and described in a popular research publication formed the basis of a question in the final exam.",
        "plained the information retrieval task: generate a ranked list of documents relevant to a user query U = (ui), where the rank of the document D is based on the probability P(D isrelevant|U).",
        "We further explained that by applying Bayes' theorem to this quantity and assuming a uniform prior over document selection, the only important quantity was the probability of the query U being generated by a relevant document D, or P(U| D is relevant).",
        "The rest of the question demonstrated how this generative process could be modeled by the HMM in Figure 2:",
        "• Start at the initial state qS.",
        "• Transition with the probability a0 to state qDwhich represents choosing a word directly from document D OR transition with probability ai to state qcE which represents choosing a word from \"General English\", i.e., a word unrelated to the document but that occurs commonly in other queries.",
        "• If in state qD, emit the current, say ith, query word either directly from document D with emission probability bqD (ui).",
        "Otherwise, if in state qGE, emit the current query word from \"General English\" with emission probability",
        "bqGE (ui).",
        "• Transition to the end state qE.",
        "• If we have generated all the words in the query, then stop here.",
        "If not, transition to qS and repeat.",
        "Given this generative process, we then asked the students to answer the following questions:",
        "(a) Derive a simplified closed-form expression for the posterior probability P (U |D is relevant) in terms of the transition probabilities |ao,a1} and the emissions probabilities {bqD(ui),bqGE(ui)}.",
        "You may assume that U = (ui)n=i.",
        "(b) What HMM algorithm will you use to compute P(U| D is relevant) when implementing this model?",
        "(c) How will you compute the maximum likelihood estimate for the emission probability",
        "(d) What about bqGE(ui) ?",
        "Is it practical to compute the actual value of this estimate?",
        "What reasonable approximation might be used in place of the actual value?",
        "This question not only required the students to apply the concepts of probability theory and HMMs that they learned in class but also to contemplate more open-ended research questions where there may be no one right answer.",
        "For both these and other instances where we used ideas from research publications to build assignments and exam questions, we encouraged the students to read the corresponding publications after they had submitted their solutions.",
