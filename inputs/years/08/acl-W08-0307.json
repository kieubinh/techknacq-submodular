        "Additionally, word order differences, especially those spanning long distances and/or including multiple levels of reordering, are a challenge for SMT decoding.",
        "Two improvements are presented here.",
        "First, we reduce the number of noisy alignments by using the idea that chunks, like raw words, have a translation correspondence in the source and target sentences.",
        "Hence, word links are constrained (i.e., noisy links are pruned) using chunk information.",
        "Second, we introduce rewrite rules which can handle both short/medium and long distance reorder-ings as well as different degrees ofrecursive application.",
        "We build our rules with two different linguistic annotations, (local) POS tags and (long-spanning) chunk tags.",
        "Despite employing an N-gram-based SMT system, the methods described here can also be applied to any phrase-based SMT system.",

        "Arabic is a morpho-syntactically complex language with many differences from English.",
        "We describe here three prominent syntactic features of Arabic that are relevant to Arabic-English translation and that motivate some of our decisions in this work.",
        "First, Arabic words are morphologically complex containing clitics whose translations are represented separately in English and sometimes in a different order.",
        "For instance, possessive pronominal enclitics are attached to the noun they modify in Arabic but their translation precedes the English translation of the noun: kitAbu+hu 'book+his â€“ his book.",
        "Other clitics include the definite article Al+ ' the , the conjunction w+ ' and and the preposition l+ ' of/for , among others.",
        "We use the Penn Arabic Treebank tokenization scheme which splits three classes of clitics only.",
        "This scheme is compatible with the chunker we use (Diab et al., 2004).",
        "Secondly, Arabic verb subjects may be: pro-dropped (verb conjugated), pre-verbal (SVO), or post-verbal (VSO).",
        "The VSO order is quite challenging in the context of translation to English.",
        "For small noun phrases (NP), small phrase pairs in a phrase table and some degree of distortion can easily move the verb to follow the NP.",
        "But this becomes much less likely with very long NPs that exceed the size of phrases in a phrase table.",
        "Finally, Arabic adjectival modifiers typically follow their nouns (with a small exception of some superlative adjectives).",
        "For example, rajul Tawiyl (lit.",
        "man tall) translates as 'a tall man\\",
        "These three syntactic features of Arabic-English translation are not independent of each other.",
        "As we reorder the verb and the subject NP, we also have to reorder the NP s adjectival components.",
        "This brings new challenges to previous implementations of N-gram based SMT which had worked with language pairs that are more similar than Arabic and English, e.g., Spanish and English.",
