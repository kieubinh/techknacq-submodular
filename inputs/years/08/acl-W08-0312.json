        "Automatic Metrics for MT evaluation have been receiving significant attention in recent years.",
        "Evaluating an MT system using such automatic metrics is much faster, easier and cheaper compared to human evaluations, which require trained bilingual evaluators.",
        "The most commonly used MT evaluation metric in recent years has been IBM's BLEU metric (Pa-pineni et al., 2002).",
        "BLEU is fast and easy to run, and it can be used as a target function in parameter optimization training procedures that are commonly used in state-of-the-art statistical MT systems (Och, 2003).",
        "Various researchers have noted, however, various weaknesses in the metric.",
        "Most notably, BLEU does not produce very reliable sentence-level scores.",
        "METEOR , as well as several other proposed metrics such as GTM (Melamed et al., 2003), TER (Snover et al., 2006) and CDER (Leusch et al., 2006) aim to address some of these weaknesses.",
        "Meteor , initially proposed and released in 2004 (Lavie et al., 2004) was explicitly designed to improve correlation with human judgments of MT quality at the segment level.",
        "Previous publications on",
        "Meteor (Lavie et al., 2004; Banerjee and Lavie, 2005; Lavie and Agarwal, 2007) have described the details underlying the metric and have extensively compared its performance with BLEU and several other MT evaluation metrics.",
        "In (Lavie and Agar-wal, 2007), we described the process of tuning free parameters within the metric to optimize the correlation with human judgments and the extension of the metric for evaluating translations in languages other than English.",
        "This paper provides a brief technical description of METEoR and describes our experiments in retuning the metric for improving correlation with the human rankings of translation hypotheses corresponding to a single source sentence.",
        "Our experiments show significant improvement in correlation as a result of retuning which shows the importance of having a metric tunable to different testing conditions.",

        "If more than one reference translation is available, the translation is scored against each reference independently, and the best scoring pair is used.",
        "Given a pair of strings to be compared, Meteor creates a word alignment between the two strings.",
        "An alignment is mapping between words, such that every word in each string maps to at most one word in the other string.",
        "This alignment is incrementally produced by a sequence of word-mapping modules.",
        "The \"exact\" module maps two words if they are exactly the same.",

        "The \"WN synonymy\" module maps two words if they are considered synonyms, based on the fact that they both belong to the same \"synset\" in WordNet.",
        "The word-mapping modules initially identify all possible word matches between the pair of strings.",
        "We then identify the largest subset of these word mappings such that the resulting set constitutes an alignment as defined above.",
        "If more than one maximal cardinality alignment is found, Meteor selects the alignment for which the word order in the two strings is most similar (the mapping that has the least number of \"crossing\" unigram mappings).",
        "The order in which the modules are run reflects word-matching preferences.",
        "The default ordering is to first apply the \"exact\" mapping module, followed by \"porter stemming\" and then \"WN synonymy\".",
        "Once a final alignment has been produced between the system translation and the reference translation, the Meteor score for this pairing is computed as follows.",
        "Based on the number of mapped unigrams found between the two strings (m), the total number of unigrams in the translation (t) and the total number of unigrams in the reference (r), we calculate unigram precision P = m/t and unigram recall R = m/r.",
        "We then compute a parametrized harmonic mean of P and R (van Rijsbergen, 1979):",
        "Precision, recall and Fmean are based on singleword matches.",
        "To take into account the extent to which the matched unigrams in the two strings are in the same word order, Meteor computes a penalty for a given alignment as follows.",
        "First, the sequence of matched unigrams between the two strings is divided into the fewest possible number of \"chunks\" such that the matched unigrams in each chunk are adjacent (in both strings) and in identical word order.",
        "The number of chunks (ch) and the number of matches ( m) is then used to calculate a fragmentation fraction: frag = ch/m.",
        "The penalty is then computed as:",
        "The value of y determines the maximum penalty (0 < y < 1).",
        "The value of (3 determines the functional relation between fragmentation and the penalty.",
        "Finally, the Meteor score for the alignment between the two strings is calculated as:",

        "Based on that finding, in WMT-08, only ranking judgments are being collected from the human judges.",
        "The current version of Meteor uses parameters optimized towards maximizing the Pearson's correlation with human judgments of adequacy scores.",
        "It is not clear that the same parameters would be optimal for correlation with human rankings.",

        "This score can be converted to rankings trivially by assuming that a higher score indicates a better hypothesis.",

        "M-BLEU , however, doesn't shows any improvements in this case.",
