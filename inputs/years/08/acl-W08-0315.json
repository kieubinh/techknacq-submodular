        "The TALP-UPC 2008 translation system, besides the bilingual translation model, which consists of a 4-gram LM of tuples with Kneser-Ney discounting (estimated with SRI Language Modeling Toolkit), implements a log-linear combination of five additional feature models:",

        "• a source-to-target lexicon model and a target-to-source lexicon model, these models use word-to-word IBM Model 1 probabilities (Och and Ney, 2004) to estimate the lexical weights for each tuple in the translation table.",
        "Decisions on the particular LM configuration and smoothing technique were taken on the minimal-perplexity and maximal-BLEU bases.",
        "The decoder (called MARIE), an open source tool, implementing a beam search strategy with distortion capabilities was used in the translation system.",
