        "The Cambridge University Engineering Department statistical machine translation system follows the Transducer Translation Model (Kumar and Byrne, 2005; Kumar et al., 2006), a phrase-based generative model of translation that applies a series of transformations specified by conditional probability distributions and encoded as Weighted Finite State Transducers (Mohri et al., 2002).",
        "The main advantages of this approach are its modularity, which facilitates the development and evaluation of each component individually, and its implementation simplicity which allows us to focus on modeling issues rather than complex decoding and search algorithms.",
        "In addition, no special-purpose decoder is required since standard WFST operations can be used to obtain the 1-best translation or a lattice of alternative hypotheses.",
        "Finally, the system architecture readily extends to speech translation, in which input ASR lattices can be translated in the same way as for text (Mathias and Byrne, 2006).",
        "This paper reviews the first participation of CUED in the ACL Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation in 2008.",
        "It is organised as follows.",
        "Firstly, section 2 describes the system architecture and its main components.",
        "Section 3 gives details of the development work conducted for this shared task and results are reported and discussed in section 4.",
        "Finally, in section 5 we summarise our participation in the task and outline directions for future work."

        "Under the Transducer Translation Model, the generation of a target language sentence tJ starts with the generation of a source language sentence s{ by the source language model PG(s{).",
        "Next, the source language sentence is segmented into phrases according to the unweighted uniform phrasal segmentation model PW(uK,K|s{).",
        "This source phrase sequence generates a reordered target language phrase sequence according to the phrase translation and reordering model PR(xK|uK).",
        "Next, target language phrases are inserted into this sequence according to the insertion model P$(vR|xK, uK).",
        "Finally, the sequence of reordered and inserted target language phrases are transformed to word sequences tJ under the target phrasal segmentation model Pq (tJ |v R).",
        "These component distributions together form a joint distribution over the source and target language sentences and their possible intermediate phrase sequences as P(tJ, v R, xK, uK, s{).",
        "In translation under the generative model, we start with the target sentence tJ in the foreign language and search for the best source sentence s[.",
        "Encoding each distribution as a WFST leads to a model of translation as the series of compositions in which T is an acceptor for the target language sentence and L is the word lattice oftranslations obtained during decoding.",
        "The most likely translation s[ is the path in L with least cost.",
        "The TTM reordering model associates a jump sequence with each phrase pair.",
        "For the experiments described in this paper, the jump sequence is restricted such that only adjacent phrases can be swapped; this is the MJ1 reordering model of (Kumar and Byrne, 2005).",
        "Although the reordering probability for each pair of phrases could be estimated from word-aligned parallel data, we here assume a uniform reordering probability p tuned as described in section 3.1.",
        "Figure 1 shows how the MJ1 reordering model for a pair of phrases xl and x2 is implemented as a WFST.",

        "CUED participated in two of the WMT shared task tracks: French^English and Spanish^English.",

        "For Europarl translation, most of the additional English language model training data incorporated into the 5-gram rescoring step is out-of-domain and so does not substantially improve the scores.",
        "Rescoring yields an average gain of just +0.5 BLEU points.",
        "Translation quality is significantly lower in both language pairs for the new news2008 set.",
        "Two factors may account for this.",
        "The first is the change in domain and the fact that no training or development set was available for the News translation task.",
        "Secondly, the use of a much freer translation in the single News reference, which makes it difficult to obtain a good BLEU score.",
        "However, the second-pass 5-gram language model rescoring gains are larger than those observed in the Europarl sets, with approximately +1.7 BLEU points for each language pair.",
        "The additional in-domain newswire data clearly helps to improve translation quality.",
        "Finally, we use a simple 3-gram casing model trained on the true-case workshop distributed language model data, and apply the SRILM disambig tool to restore true-case for our final submissions.",
        "With respect to the lower-cased scores, true-casing drops around 1.0 BLEU in the Europarl task, and around 1.7 BLEU in the News Commentary and News tasks."
