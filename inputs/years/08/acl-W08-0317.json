        "Research in statistical machine translation (SMT) increasingly makes use of linguistic analysis in order to improve performance.",
        "By including abstract categories, such as lemmas and parts-of-speech (POS), in the models, it is argued that systems can become better at handling sentences for which training data at the word level is sparse.",
        "Such categories can be integrated in the statistical framework using factored models (Koehn et al., 2007).",
        "Furthermore, by parsing input sentences and restructuring based on the result to narrow the structural difference between source and target language, the current phrase-based models can be used more effectively (Collins et al., 2005).",
        "German differs structurally from English in several respects (see e.g. Collins et al., 2005).",
        "In this work we wanted to look at one particular aspect of restructuring, namely splitting of German compounds, and evaluate its effect in both translation directions, thus extending the initial experiments reported in Holmqvist et al.",
        "(2007).",
        "In addition, since",
        "German is much richer in morphology than English, we wanted to test the effects of using a sequence model for German based on morphologically sub-categorized parts-of-speech.",
        "All systems have been specified as extensions of the Moses system provided for the Shared Task."

        "For both English and German we used the part-of-speech tagger TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994) to obtain",
        "POS-tags.",
        "The German POS-tags from TreeTagger were refined by adding morphological information from a commercial dependency parser, including case, number, gender, definiteness, and person for nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives and determiners in the cases where both tools agreed on the POS-tag.",
        "If they did not agree, the POS-tag from TreeTagger was chosen.",

        "Compounding is common in many languages, including German.",
        "Since compounding is highly productive it increases vocabulary size and leads to sparse data problems.",
        "Compounds in German are formed by joining words, and in addition filler letters can be inserted or letters can be removed from the end of all but the last word of the compound (Langer, 1998).",
        "We have chosen to allow simple additions of letter(s) (-s, -n, -en, -nen, -es, -er, -ien) and simple truncations (-e, -en, -n).",
        "Example of compounds with additions and truncations can be seen in (1).",

        "b. Kirchhof (Kirche + Hof) graveyard",
        "Noun and adjective compounds are split by a modified version of the corpus-based method presented by Koehn and Knight (2003).",
        "First the German language model data is POS-tagged and used to calculate frequencies of all nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs and the negative particle.",
        "Then, for each noun and adjective all splits into these known words from the corpus, allowing filler additions and truncations, are considered, choosing the splitting option with the highest arithmetic mean of the frequencies of its parts.",
        "A length limit of each part was set to 4 characters.",
        "For adjectives we restrict the number of parts to maximum two, since they do not tend to have multiple parts as often as nouns.",
        "In addition we added a stop list with 14 parts, often mistagged, that gave rise to wrong adjective splits, such as arische ('Aryan') in konsularische ('consular').",
        "As Koehn and Knight (2003) points out, parts of compounds do not always have the same meaning as when they stand alone, e.g. Grundrechte ('basic rights'), where the first part, Grund, usually translates as foundation, which is wrong in this compound.",
        "To overcome this we marked all compound parts but the last, with the symbol '#'.",
        "Thus they are handled as separate words.",
        "Parts of split words also receive a special POS-tag, based on the POS of the last word of the compound, and the last part receives the same POS as the full word.",
        "We also split words containing hyphens based on the same algorithm.",
        "Their parts receive a different POS-tag, and the hyphens are left at the end of all but the last part.",
        "For translation into German, the translation output contains split compounds, which need to be merged.",
        "An algorithm for merging has been proposed by Popovic et al.",
        "(2006) using lists of compounds and their parts.",
        "This method cannot merge unseen compounds, however, so instead we base merging on POS.",
        "If a word has a compound-POS, and the following word has a matching POS, they are merged.",
        "If the next POS does not match, a hyphen is added to the word, allowing for coordinated compounds as in(2).",

        "The main difference of our system in relation to the baseline system of the Shared Task is the pre-and post-processing described above, the use of a POS factor, and an additional sequence model on POS.",
        "We also modified the tuning to include compound merging, and used a smaller corpus, 600 sentences picked evenly from the dev2006 corpus, for tuning.",
        "We use the Moses decoder (Koehn et al., 2007) and",
        "SRILM language models (Stolcke, 2002).",
        "We used POS as an output factor, as can be seen in Figure 1.",
        "Using additional factors only on the target side means that only the training data need to be POS-tagged, not the tuning data or translation input.",
        "However, POS-tagging is still performed for German as input to the preprocessing step.",
        "As Figure 1 shows we have two sequence models.",
        "A 5-gram language model based on surface form using Kneser-Ney smoothing and in addition a 7-gram sequence model based on POS using Witten-Bell smoothing.",
        "The training corpus was filtered to sentences with 2^40 words, resulting in a total of 1054688 sentences.",

        "News data.",
        "The news data were submitted to see how well a pure out-of-domain system could perform.",
        "In the preprocessing step compounds were split.",
        "This was done for training, tuning and translation.",
        "In addition German contracted prepositions and determiners, such as zum from zu dem ( 'to the ' ), when identified as such by the tagger, were split.",
        "All features of the German to English system were used, and in addition more fine-grained German POS-tags that were sub-categorized for morphological features.",
        "This was done for training, tuning and sequence models.",
        "At translation time no preprocessing was needed for the English input, but a post-processing step for the German output is required, including the merging of compounds and contracted prepositions and determiners.",
        "The latter was done in connection with uppercasing, by training an instance of Moses on a lower cased corpus with split contractions and an upper-cased corpus with untouched contractions.",
        "The tuning step was modified so that merging of compounds were done as part of the tuning.",
        "For comparison, we constructed a baseline according to the shared-task description, but with smaller tuning corpus, and the same sentence filtering for the translation model as in the submitted system, using only sentences of length 2-40.",
        "In addition we constructed a factored baseline system, with POS as an output factor and a sequence model for POS.",
        "Here we only used the original POS-tags from TreeTagger, no additional morphology was added for German.",
        "Case-sensitive Bleu scores (Papineni et al., 2002) for the Europarl devtest set (test2007) are shown in table 1.",
        "We can see that the submitted system performs best, and that the factored baseline is better than the pure baseline, especially for translation into English.",
        "Bleu scores for News Commentary (nc-test2007) are shown in Table 2.",
        "Here we can also see that the submitted system is the best.",

        "The quality ofcompound translations were analysed manually.",
        "The first 100 compounds that could be found by the splitting algorithm were extracted from the Europarl reference text, test2007, together with their English translations.",
        "System translations were compared to the annotated compounds and classified into seven categories: correct, alternative good translation, correct but different form, part of the compound translated, no direct equivalent, wrong and untranslated.",
