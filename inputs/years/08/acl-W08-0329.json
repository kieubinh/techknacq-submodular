        "Confusion network decoding has been applied in combining outputs from multiple machine translation systems.",
        "The earliest approach in (Bangalore et al., 2001) used edit distance based multiple string alignment (MSA) (Durbin et al., 1988) to build the confusion networks.",
        "The recent approaches used pairwise alignment algorithms based on symmetric alignments from a HMM alignment model (Matusov et al., 2006) or edit distance alignments allowing shifts (Rosti et al., 2007).",
        "The alignment method described in this paper extends the latter by incrementally aligning the hypotheses as in MSA but also allowing shifts as in the TER alignment.",
        "The confusion networks are built around a \"skeleton\" hypothesis.",
        "The skeleton hypothesis defines the word order of the decoding output.",
        "Usually, the 1-best hypotheses from each system are considered as possible skeletons.",
        "Using the pairwise hypothesis alignment, the confusion networks are built in two steps.",
        "First, all hypotheses are aligned against the skeleton independently.",
        "Second, the confusion networks are created from the union of these alignments.",
        "The incremental hypothesis alignment algorithm combines these two steps.",
        "All words from the previously aligned hypotheses are available, even if not present in the skeleton hypothesis, when aligning the following hypotheses.",
        "As in (Rosti et al., 2007), confusion networks built around all skeletons are joined into a lattice which is expanded and re-scored with language models.",
        "System weights and language model weights are tuned to optimize the quality of the decoding output on a development set.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "The incremental TER alignment algorithm is described in Section 2.",
        "Experimental evaluation comparing the incremental and pairwise alignment methods are presented in Section 3 along with results on the WMT08 Europarl test sets.",
        "Conclusions and future work are presented in Section 4."

        "The incremental hypothesis alignment is based on an extension of the TER algorithm (Snover et al., 2006).",
        "The extension allows using a confusion network as the reference.",
        "First, the algorithm finds the minimum edit distance between the hypothesis and the reference network by considering all word arcs between two consecutive nodes in the reference network as possible matches for a hypothesis word at that position.",
        "Second, shifts of blocks of words that have an exact match somewhere else in the network are tried in order to find a new hypothesis word order with a lower TER.",
        "Each shifted block is considered a single edit.",
        "These two steps are executed iteratively as a greedy search.",
        "The final alignment between the reordered hypothesis and the reference network may include matches, substitutions, deletions, and insertions.",
        "The confusion networks are built by creating a simple confusion network from the skeleton hypothesis.",
        "If the skeleton hypothesis has N words, the initial network has arcs and nodes.",
        "Each arc has a set of system specific confidence scores.",
        "The score for the skeleton system is set to and the confidences for other systems are set to zeros.",
        "For each non-skeleton hypothesis, a TER alignment against the current network is executed as described above.",
        "Each match found will increase the system specific word arc confidence by 1/(1 + k) where k is the rank of the hypothesis in that system's iV-best list.",
        "Each substitution will generate a new word arc at the corresponding position in the network.",
        "The word arc confidence for the system is set to 1 / (1+k) and the confidences for other systems are set to zeros.",
        "Each deletion will generate a new NULL word arc unless one exists at the corresponding position in the network.",
        "The NULL word arc confidences are adjusted as in the case of a match or a substitution depending on whether the NULL word arc exists or not.",
        "Finally, each insertion will generate a new node and two word arcs at the corresponding position in the network.",
        "The first word arc will have the inserted word with the confidence set as in the case of a substitution and the second word arc will have a NULL word with confidences set by assuming all previously aligned hypotheses and the skeleton generated the NULL word arc.",
        "After all hypotheses have been added into the confusion network, the system specific word arc confidences are scaled to sum to one over all arcs between each set of two consecutive nodes.",
        "Other scores for the word arc are set as in (Rosti et al., 2007).",
        "The incremental hypothesis alignment guarantees that insertions between a hypothesis and the current confusion network are always considered when aligning the following hypotheses.",
        "This is not the case in any pairwise hypothesis alignment algorithm.",
        "During the pairwise hypothesis alignment, an identical word in two hypotheses may be aligned as an insertion or a substitution in a different position with respect to the skeleton.",
        "This will result in undesirable repetition and lower confidence for that word in the final confusion network.",
        "Also, multiple insertions are not handled implicitly.",
        "For example, three hypotheses \"I like balloons\", \"I like big blue balloons\", and \"I like blue kites\" might be aligned by the pairwise alignment, assuming the first as the skeleton, as follows:",
        "which results in the confusion network shown in Figure 1.",
        "The number of hypotheses proposing each word is shown in parentheses.",
        "The alignment between the skeleton and the second hypothesis has two consecutive insertions \"big blue\" which are not available for matching when the third hypothesis is aligned against the skeleton.",
        "Therefore, the word \"blue\" appears twice in the confusion network.",
        "If many hypotheses have multiple insertions at the same location with respect to the skeleton, they have to be treated as phrases or a secondary alignment process has to be applied.",

        "It should be noted that the final confusion network depends on the order in which the hypotheses are added.",
        "The experiments so far have indicated that different alignment order does not have a significant influence on the final combination results as measured by the automatic evaluation metrics.",
        "Usually, aligning the system outputs in the decreasing order of their TER scores on the development set yields the best scores.",
        "The extended TER algorithm can also be used to estimate an oracle TER in a confusion network by aligning the reference translations against the confusion network.",
        "The oracle hypotheses can be extracted by finding a path with the maximum number of matches.",
