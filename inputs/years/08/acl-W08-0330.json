        "Standard automatic metrics are reference-based; that is, they compare system-produced translations against human-translated references produced for the same source.",
        "Since there is usually no single best way to translate a sentence, each MT output should be compared against many references.",
        "On the other hand, creating multiple human references is itself a costly process.",
        "For many naturally occurring datasets (e.g., parallel corpora) only a single reference is readily available.",
        "The focus of this work is on developing automatic metrics for sentence-level evaluation with at most one human reference.",
        "One way to supplement the single human reference is to use pseudo references, or sentences produced by off-the-shelf MT systems, as stand-ins for human references.",
        "However, since pseudo references may be imperfect translations themselves, the comparisons cannot be fully trusted.",
        "Previously, we have taken a learning-based approach to develop a composite metric that combines measurements taken from multiple pseudo references (Albrecht and Hwa, 2007).",
        "Experimental results suggested the approach to be promising; but those studies did not consider how well the metric might generalize across multiple years and different languages.",
        "In this paper, we investigate the applicability of the pseudo-reference metrics under these more general conditions.",
        "Using the WMT06 Workshop shared-task results (Koehn and Monz, 2006) as training examples, we train a metric that evaluates new sentences by comparing them against pseudo references produced by three off-the-shelf MT systems.",
        "We apply the learned metric to sentences from the WMT07 shared-task (Callison-Burch et al., 2007b) and compare the metric's predictions against human judgments.",
        "We find that additional pseudo references improve correlations for automatic metrics."

      "text": [
        "The ideal evaluation metric reports an accurate distance between an input instance and its gold standard, but even when comparing against imperfect standards, the measured distances may still convey some useful information - they may help to triangulate the input's position relative to the true gold standard.",
        "In the context of sentence-level MT evaluations, the challenges are two-fold.",
        "First, the ideal quantitative distance function between a translation hypothesis and the proper translations is not known; current automatic evaluation metrics produce approximations to the true translational distance.",
        "Second, although we may know the qualitative goodness of the MT systems that generate the pseudo references, we do not know how imperfect the pseudo references are.",
        "These uncertainties make it harder to establish the true distance between the input hypothesis and the (unobserved) acceptable gold standard translations.",
        "In order to combine evidence from these uncertain observations, we take a learning-based approach.",
        "Each hypothesis sentence is compared with multiple pseudo references using multiple metrics.",
        "Representing the measurements as a set of input features and using human-assessed MT sentences as training examples, we train a function that is optimized to correlate the features with the human assessments in the training examples.",
        "Specifically, for each input sentence, we compute a set of 18 kinds of reference-based measurements for each pseudo reference as well as 26 monolingual fluency measurements.",
        "The full set of measurements then serves as the input feature vector into the function, which is trained via support vector regression.",
        "The learned function can then be used as an evaluation metric itself: it takes the measurements of a new sentence as input and returns a composite score for that sentence.",
        "The approach is considered successful if the metric's predictions on new test sentences correlate well with quantitative human assessments.",
        "Like other learned models, the metric is expected to perform better on data that are more similar to the training instances.",
        "Therefore, a natural question that arises with a metric developed in this manner is: how well does it generalize?"

        "To better understand the capability of metrics that compare against pseudo-references, we consider the following aspects:",
        "The role of learning Standard reference-based metrics can also use pseudo references; however, they would treat the imperfect references as gold standard.",
        "In contrast, the learning process aims to determine how much each comparison with a pseudo reference might be trusted.",
        "To observe the role of learning, we compare trained metrics against standard reference-based metrics, all using pseudo references.",
        "The amount vs. types of training data The success of any learned model depends on its training experiences.",
        "We study the trade-off between the size of the training set and the specificity of the training data.",
        "We perform experiments comparing a metric trained from a large pool of heterogeneous training examples that include translated sentences from multiple languages and individual metrics trained from particular source languages.",
        "The role of a single human reference Previous studies have shown the importance of comparing against multiple references.",
        "The approach in this paper attempts to approximate multiple human references with machine-produced sentences.",
        "Is a single trustworthy translation more useful than multiple imperfect translations?",
        "To answer this question, we compare three different reference settings: using just a single human reference, using just the three pseudo references, and using all four references."

        "For the experiments reported in this paper, we used human-evaluated MT sentences from past shared-tasks of the WMT 2006 and WMT 2007.",
        "The data consists of outputs from German-English, Spanish-English, and French-English MT systems.",
        "The outputs are translations from two corpora: Europarl and news commentary.",
        "System outputs have been evaluated by human judges on a 5-point scale (Callison-Burch et al., 2007a).",
        "We have normalized scores to reduce biases from different judges (Blatz et al., 2003).",
        "We experimented with using four different subsets of the WMT2006 data as training examples: only German-English, only Spanish-English, only French-English, all 06 data.",
        "The metrics are trained using support vector regression with a Gaussian kernel as implemented in the SVM-Light package (Joachims, 1999).",
        "The SVM parameters are tuned via grid-search on development data, 20% of the full training set that has been reserved for this purpose.",
        "We used three MT systems to generate pseudo references: Systran, GoogleMT , and Moses (Koehn et al., 2007).",
        "We chose these three systems because they are widely accessible and because they take relatively different approaches.",
        "Moreover, although they have not all been human-evaluated in the past WMT shared tasks, they are well-known for producing good translations.",
        "A metric is evaluated based on its Spearman rank correlation coefficient between the scores it gave to the evaluative dataset and human assessments for the same data.",
        "The correlation coefficient is a real number between -1, indicating perfect negative correlations, and +1, indicating perfect positive correlations.",
        "Two standard reference-based metrics, BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), are used for comparisons.",
        "BLEU is smoothed (Lin and Och, 2004), and it considers only matching up to bigrams because this has higher correlations with human judgments than when higher-ordered n-grams are included."

        "Each cell shows the correlation coefficient between the human judgments and a metric (column) that uses a particular kind of references (row) for some evaluation data set (block row).",
        "The role of learning With the exception of the German-English data, the learned metrics had higher correlations with human judges than the baselines, which used standard metrics with a single human reference.",
        "On the other hand, results suggest that pseudo references often also improve correlations for standard metrics.",
        "This may seem counterintuitive because we can easily think of cases in which pseudo references hurt standard metrics (e.g., use poor outputs as pseudo references).",
        "We hypothesize that because the pseudo references came from high-quality MT systems and because standard metrics are based on simple word matches, the chances for bad judgments (input words matched against pseudo reference, but both are wrong) are relatively small compared to chances for good judgments.",
        "We further hypothesize that the learned metrics would be robust against the qualities of the pseudo reference MT systems.",
        "The amount vs. types of training data Comparing the three metrics trained from single language datasets against the metric trained from all of WMT06 dataset, we see that the learning process benefitted from the larger quantity of training examples.",
        "It may be the case that the MT systems for the three language pairs are at a similar stage ofmaturity such that the training instances are mutually helpful.",
        "The role of a single human reference Our results reinforce previous findings that metrics are more reliable when they have access to more than a single human reference.",
        "Our experimental data suggests that a single human reference often may not be as reliable as using three pseudo references alone.",
        "Finally, the best correlations are achieved by using both human and pseudo references."
