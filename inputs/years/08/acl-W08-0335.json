        "Chinese word segmentation (CWS) is a necessary step in Chinese-English statistical machine translation (SMT).",
        "The research on CWS independently from SMT has been conducted for decades.",
        "As an evidence, the CWS evaluation campaign, the Sighan",
        "Bakeoff (Emerson, 2005),, has been held four times since 2004.",
        "However, works on relations between CWS and SMT are scarce.",
        "Generally, two factors need to be considered in constructing a CWS system.",
        "The first one is the specifications for CWS, i.e., the rules or guidelines for word segmentation, and the second one is the CWS methods.",
        "There are many CWS specifications used by different organizations.",
        "Unfortunately, these organizations do not seem to have any intention of reaching a unified specification.",
        "More than five or six specifications have been used in the four Sighan Bakeoffs.",
        "There is also significant disagreement on the specifications, although much of their contents is the same.",
        "One of the aims of this work was therefore to establish whether inconsistencies in specifications significantly affect the quality of SMT.",
        "The second factor is CWS methods.",
        "We grouped all of the CWS methods into two classes: the class without out-of-vocabulary (OOV) recognition and the class with OOV recognition, represented by the dictionary-based CWS and the CRF-based CWS, respectively.",
        "Out-of-vocabulary recognition may have two-sided effects on SMT performance.",
        "The CRF-based CWS that supports OOV recognition produces word segmentations with a higher F-score, but a huge number of new words recognized correctly and incorrectly that can incur data sparseness in training the SMT models.",
        "On the other hand, the dictionary-based approach that does not support OOV recognition produced a lower F-score, but with a relatively weak data spareness problem.",
        "Which approach produces a better SMT result is our research interest in this work.",
        "The performance of CWS is usually measured by the F-score, while that of SMT is measured using the BLEU score.",
        "Does a CWS with a higher F-score produce a better translation?",
        "In this paper we answer this question by comparing F-scores with BLEU scores.",
        "In this work, we also propose approaches to make use of all the Sighan training data regardless of the specifications.",
        "Two methods are proposed: (1) a simple combination of all the training data, and (2) implementing linear interpolation of multiple translation models.",
        "Linear interpolation is widely used in language modeling for speech recognition.",
        "We interpolated multiple translation models generated by the CWS schemes and found our approaches were very effective in improving the translations.",
        "2 CWS specifications and corpora from the second Sighan Bakeoff",
        "A Chinese word is composed of one or more characters.",
        "There are no spaces between the words.",
        "Automatic word segmentation is required for machine translation.",
        "Usually a specification is needed to carry out word segmentation.",
        "Unfortunately, there are many different versions of specifications.",
        "Different tasks give rise to different requirements and the CWS specifications must be adjusted accordingly.",
        "For example, shorter segmentation has been shown to be better for speech recognition.",
        "A composite word (numbers, dates, times, etc.)",
        "is split into characters even if it is one word defined by linguists.",
        "In contrast, longer segmentation is preferred for named entity recognition consisting of longer character sequences, such as the name of people, places, and organizations.",
        "This work investigated four well-known specifications created by four different organizations: Academia Sinica (AS), City University of Hong Kong (CITYU), Microsoft Research (Beijing) (MSR), and Beijing University (PKU).",
        "These specs were used in the second Sighan Bakeoff (Emerson, 2005).",
        "When we compared the four specifications and the manual segmentations in the Sighan Bakeoff training data, we found there were many inconsistencies among the four specifications.",
        "Some examples are shown in Table 1 and 2.",
        "For instance, the AS and PKU specifications are distinct in splitting both Chinese and English names.",
        "We also found the MSR specification generated more composite words and grouped longer character sequences into a word.",
        "Using this specification could generate tens of thousands of new words, which can cause data sparseness for SMT.",
        "In addition to using the four specifications, we also downloaded the training and test corpora of the second Sighan Bakeoff.",
        "We used each of the training corpora provided to create a CWS scheme and evaluated the performance of the schemes on our test data.",

        "SMT is a very complicated system to study.",
        "Its response to CWS schemes is intractable and it is very hard to use one or two measures to describe the relationship between CWS and SMT, in a similar way to describing the relationship between the alignment error rate (AER) and SMT (Fraser and Marcu, 2007).",
        "The CWS and SMT are related by a series of factors such as the specifications, OOVs, lexicons, and F-scores.",
        "None of these factors can be directly related to the SMT.",
        "While we have completed many experiments, based on changing the CWS specifications and methods used, to determine the relationship between CWS and SMT, we have not established any overwhelming rules.",

        "Firstly, the F-score is not a reliable guide to SMT quality.",
        "A very high F-score may produce the lowest quality translations, as was found for the MSRSEG.",
        "Secondly, it is better to design a specification with smaller word units to reduce data sparseness.",
        "Specifications like those for MSR will produce an inferior translation.",
        "Thirdly, do not use a huge lexicon for word segmentation.",
        "A huge lexicon will result in data sparseness and segmentation complexity.",
        "And lastly, using multiple word segmentation results and approaches does work.",
        "We used two approaches that combined multiple word segmentation - dict-hybrid and feature integration - and both improved the translations significantly.",
        "The BLEU scores in our experiments were relatively low in comparison with current state-of-the art results.",
        "However, our system was very similar to the system (Koehn et al., 2005) that gave a BLEU score of 24.3, comparable to ours.",
