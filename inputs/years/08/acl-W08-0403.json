        "There are two major elements accounting for such an improvement: namely the incorporation of phrasal translation structures adopted from widely applied phrase-based models (Och and Ney, 2004) to handle local fluency, and the engagement of synchronous context-free grammars (SCFG), which enhances the generative capacity of the underlying model that is limited by finite-state machinery.",

        "Following Chiang (Chiang, 2007), we note the following distinction between these two classes:",
        "• Linguistically syntax-based: models that utilize structures defined over linguistic theory and annotations (e.g., Penn Treebank), and SCFG rules are derived from parallel corpus that is guided by explicitly parsing on at least one side of the parallel corpus.",
        "Examples among others are (Yamada and Knight, 2001) and (Galley et",
        "al., 2004).",
        "• Formally syntax-based: models are based on hierarchical structures of natural language but synchronous grammars are automatically extracted from parallel corpus without any usage of linguistic knowledge or annotations.",
        "Examples include Wu's (Wu, 1997) ITG and Chiang's hierarchical models (Chiang, 2007).",
        "While these two often resemble in appearance, from practical viewpoints, there are some distinctions in training and decoding procedures differentiating formally syntax-based models from linguistically syntax-based models.",
        "First, the former has no dependency on available linguistic theory and annotations for targeting language pairs, and thus the training and rule extraction are more efficient.",
        "Secondly, the decoding complexity of the former is lower , especially when integrating a n-gram based",
        "'The complexity is dominated by synchronous parsing and boundary words keeping.",
        "Thus binary SCFG employed in formally syntax-based systems help to maintain efficient CKY decoding.",

        "language model, which is a key element to ensure translation output quality.",
        "On the other hand, available linguistic theory and annotations could provide invaluable benefits in grammar induction and scoring, as shown by recent progress on such models (Galley et al., 2006).",
        "In contrast, formally syntax-based grammars often lack explicit linguistic constraints.",
        "In this paper, we propose a scheme to enrich formally syntax-based models with linguistically syntactic knowledge.",
        "In other words, we maintain our grammar to be based on formal syntax on surface, but incorporate linguistic knowledge into our models to leverage syntax theory and annotations.",
        "Our goal is two-fold.",
        "First, how to score SCFG rules whose general abstraction forms are unseen in the training data is an important question to answer.",
        "In hierarchical models, Chiang (Chiang, 2007) utilizes heuristics where certain assumptions are made on rule distributions to obtain relative frequency counts.",
        "We intend to explore if additional linguistically parsing information would be beneficial to improve the scoring of formally syntactic SCFG grammars.",
        "Secondly, we note that SCFG-based models often come with an excessive memory consumption as its rule size is an order of magnitude larger compared to phrase-based models, which challenges its practical deployment for online real-time translation tasks.",
        "Furthermore, formal syntax rules are often redundant as they are automatically extracted without linguistic supervision.",
        "Therefore, we are motivated to study approaches to further score and rank formal syntax rules based on syntax-inspired methods, and eventually to prune unnecessary rules without loss of performance in general.",
        "In our study, we propose a linguistically-motivated method to train prior derivation models for formally syntax-based translation.",
        "In this framework, prior derivation models can be viewed as a smoothing of rule translation models, addressing the weakness of the baseline model estimation that relies on relative counts obtained from heuristics.",
        "First, we apply automatic parsers to obtain syntax annotations on the English side of the parallel corpus.",
        "Next, we extract tree fragments associated with phrase pairs, and measure similarity between such tree fragments using kernel methods (Collins and Duffy, 2002; Moschitti, 2006).",
        "Finally, we score and rank rules based on their minimal cluster similarity of their nonterminals, which is used to compute the prior distribution of hypothesis derivations during decoding for improved translation.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "We start with a brief review of some related work in Sec. 2.",

        "In particular, formally syntax-based models explore hierarchical structures of natural language and utilize only a unified nonterminal symbol X in the grammar, where ~ is the one-to-one correspondence between X 's in 7 and a, which is indicated by under-scripted co-indices on both sides.",

        "We thereby obtain a new rule.",
        "We limit the number of nonterminals in each rule no more than two, thus ensuring the rank of SCFG is two.",
        "To reduce rule size and spurious ambiguity, we apply constraints described in (Chiang, 2007).",
        "In addition, we require that the sub-phrases being abstracted by correspondent nonterminals have to be aligned together in the original phrase pair, which significantly reduces the number of rules.",

        "Moreover, such a prior distribution can also be used to rank and prune SCFG rules to reduce memory usage for online translation systems based on syntax-based models.",
        "Although the experiments in this paper are conducted for prior derivation models on source side in an English-to-Chinese task, we are interested in applying this to foreign-to-English models as well.",
