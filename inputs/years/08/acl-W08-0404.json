        "Effective handling of large and diverse inventories of feature functions is one of the most pressing open problems in machine translation.",
        "While minimum error training (Och, 2003) has by now become a standard tool for interpolating a small number of aggregate scores, it is not well suited for learning in high-dimensional feature spaces.",
        "At the same time, although recent years have seen considerable progress in development of general methods for large-scale prediction of complex outputs (Bakir et al., 2007), their application to language translation has presented considerable challenges.",
        "Several studies have shown that large-margin methods can be adapted to the special complexities of the task (Liang et al., 2006; Tillmann and Zhang, 2006; Cowan et al., 2006).",
        "However, the capacity of these algorithms to improve over state-of-the-art baselines is currently limited by their lack of robust dimensionality reduction.",
        "Performance gains are closely tied to the number and variety of candidate features that enter into the model, and increasing the size of the feature space not only slows down training in terms of the number of iterations required for convergence, but can also considerably reduce decoding speed, leading to runtime costs that may be unacceptable in industrial settings.",
        "Vector space regression has shown impressive performance in other tasks involving string-to-string mappings (Cortes et al., 2007), but its application to language translation presents a different set of open problems (Wang et al., 2007).",
        "Other promising formalisms, which have not yet produced end-to-end systems competitive with standard baselines, include the approach due to Turian et al. (2006), the hidden-state synchronous grammar-based exponential model studied by Blunsom et al. (2008), and a similar model incorporating target-side n-gram features proposed in",
        "Subotin (2008).",
        "Taken together the results of these studies point to a striking overarching conclusion: the humble relative frequency estimate of phrase-based models makes for a surprisingly strong baseline.",
        "The present paper investigates a family of models that capitalize on this practical insight to allow efficient optimization of weights for a virtually unlimited number of features.",
        "We take as a point of departure the observation that the essential translation model scores comprising standard decoding decision rules can be recovered as special cases of a more general family of models.",
        "As we discuss below, they are equal to maximum likelihood solutions for locally normalized \"piecewise\" approximations to sentence-level probabilities, where word alignment is used to determine the subset of features observed in each training example.",
        "The cases for which such solutions have a closed form correspond to particular restrictions placed on the feature space.",
        "Thus, relative frequency phrase models can be obtained by limiting the feature space to indicator functions for the phrase pairs consistent with an alignment.",
        "By removing unnecessary restrictions we restore the full flexibility of local exponential models, including their ability to use features depending on arbitrary aspects of the source sentence and its annotation.",
        "The availability of robust algorithms for dimensionality reduction with l\\ regularizers (Ng, 2004) means that we can start with a virtually unlimited number of candidate features and negotiate the tradeoff between translation quality and decoding speed in a way appropriate for a given setting.",
        "A further attractive property of locally normalized models is the modest computational cost of their training and ease of its parallelization.",
        "This is particularly so for the models we concentrate on in this paper, defined so that parameter estimation decomposes into a large number of small optimization subproblems which can be solved independently.",
        "Several variants of these models beyond relative frequencies have appeared in the literature before.",
        "Maximum entropy estimation for translation of individual words dates back to Berger et al. (1996), and the idea of using multi-class classifiers to sharpen predictions normally made through relative frequency estimates has been recently reintroduced under the rubric of word sense disambiguation and generalized to substrings (Chan et al. 2007;",
        "Carpuat and Wu 2007a; Carpuat and Wu 2007b).",
        "Maximum entropy models for non-lexicalized reordering rules for a phrase-based system with CKY decoding has been described by Xiong et al. (2006).",
        "Some of our experiments, where exponential models conditioned on the source sentence and its parse annotation are associated with all rewrite rules in a hierarchical phrase-based system (Chiang, 2007) and all word-level probabilities in standard lexical models, may be seen as a synthesis of these ideas.",
        "The broader perspective of viewing the product of such local probabilities as a particular approximation of sentence-level likelihood points the way beyond multi-class classification, and this type of generalization is the main original contribution of the present work.",
        "Training a classifier to predict the target phrase for every source phrase is equivalent to conjoining all contextual features of the model with an indicator function for the surface form of some rule in the grammar.",
        "We can also use features based on less specific representation of a rule.",
        "Of particular importance for machine translations are representations which generalize reordering information beyond identity of individual words - a type of generalization that presents a challenge in hierarchical phrase-based translation.",
        "With generalized local models this can be accomplished by adding features tracking only ordering patterns of rules.",
        "We experiment with a case of such models which allows us to preserve decomposition of parameter estimation into independent subproblems.",
        "Besides varying the structure of the feature space, we can also extend the range of normalization for the exponential models beyond target phrases co-occurring with a given source phrase in the phrase table.",
        "This choice is especially natural for richly inflected languages, since it enables us to model multiple levels of morphological representation at once and estimate probabilities for rules whose surface forms have not been observed in training.",
        "We apply a simple variant of this approach to Arabic-English lexical models.",
        "Experimental results across eight test sets in two language pairs support the intuition that features conjoined with indicator functions for surface forms of rules yield higher gains for test sets with better coverage in training data, while features based on less specific representations become more useful for test sets with lower baselines.",
        "The types of features explored in this paper represent only a small portion of available options, and much practical experimentation remains to be done, particularly in order to find the most effective extensions of the feature space beyond multiclass classification.",
        "However, the results reported here show considerable promise and we believe that the flexibility of these models combined with their computational efficiency makes them potentially valuable as an extension for a variety of systems using translation models with local conditional probabilities and as a feature selection method for globally trained models."

        "The weight of the rule in the \"reverse\" phrase model would then be computed as",
        "When used to score a translation hypothesis corresponding to some synchronous parse tree T , the phrase model may be conceived as an approximation of the probability of a target sentence Y given a source sentence X",
        "Although there is nothing in current learning theory that would prompt one to expect that expressions of this form should be effective, their surprisingly strong performance in machine translation in an empirical observation borne out by many studies.",
        "In order to build on this practical insight it is useful to gain a clearer understanding of their formal properties.",
        "We start by writing out an expression for the likelihood of training data which would give rise to maximum likelihood solutions like those in eq.",
        "1.",
        "Consider a feature vector whose components are indicator functions for rules in the grammar, and let us define an exponential model for a sentence pair (Xm, Ym) of the form",
        "interpolated using MERT.",
        "where fr(Xm, Ym) is a restriction of the feature vector such that all of its entries except for the one corresponding to the rule r are zero and the summation is over all rules in the grammar with the same source side.",
        "As can be veriied by writing out the likelihood for the training set and setting its gradient to zero, maximum likelihood estimation based on eq.",
        "4 yields estimates equal to relative frequency solutions.",
        "In fact, because its normalization factors have non-zero parameters in common only for rules which share the same source phrase, parameter estimation decomposes into independent optimization subproblems, one for each source phrase in the grammar.",
        "However, recovering relative frequencies of the needed form requires further attention to the relationship between the deinition of feature functions and phrase extraction.",
        "Computation of phrase models in machine translation crucially relies on a form of feature selection not widely known in other contexts.",
        "A rule is considered to be observed in a sentence pair only if it is consistent with predictions of a word alignment model according to heuristics for alignment combination and phrase extraction.",
        "The standard recipes in translation modeling can thus be seen to include a feature selection procedure that applies individually to each training example.",
        "We can now generalize these relative frequency estimates by relaxing the restrictions they implicitly place on the form of permissible feature functions.",
        "The simplest elaboration involves allowing indicator functions for rules to be conjoined with indicator functions for arbitrary attributes of the source sentence or its annotation.",
        "This preserves a decomposition of parameter estimation of optimization subproblems associated with individual source phrase, but effectively replaces probabilities p(ry\\rx) in eqs.",
        "2 and 3 with probabilities conditioned on the source phrase together with some of its source-side context.",
        "We may, for example, conjoin an indicator function for the rule {A, A ) – { dd A\\ idées A2 , A\\ A2 ideas ) with a function telling us whether a part-of-speech tagger has identiied the word at the left edge of the source-side gap A2 as an adjective, which would provide additional evidence for the target side of this rule.",
        "Combining a grammar-based formalism with contextual features raises a subtle question of whether rules which have gaps at the edges and can match at multiple positions of a training example should be counted as having occurred together with their respective contextual features once for each possible match.",
        "To avoid favoring monotone rules, which tend to match at many positions, over reordering rules, which tend to match at a single span, we randomly sample only one of such multiple matches for training.",
        "Unlike conventional phrase models, contextually-conditioned probabilities cannot be stored in a precomputed phrase table.",
        "Instead, we store information about features and their weights and compute the normalization factors at runtime at the point when they are first needed by the decoder.",
        "At the expense of more complicated decoding procedures we could also apply the same line of reasoning to generalize the \"noisy channel\" phrase model p(rx\\ry) to be conditioned on local targetside context in a translation hypothesis, possibly combining target-side annotation of the training set with surface form of rules.",
        "We do not pursue this elaboration in part because we are skeptical about its potential for success.",
        "The current state of machine translation rarely permits constructing well-formed translations, so that most of the contextual features on the target side would be rarely if at all observed in the training data, resulting in sparse and noisy estimates.",
        "Furthermore, we have yet to find a case where relative frequency estimates p(rx\\ry) make a useful contribution to the system when contextually-conditioned \"reverse\" probabilities are used, suggesting that viewing translation modeling as approximating sentence-level probabilities p(Y\\X) may be a more fruitful avenue in the long term.",
        "For translation with phrases without gaps classifier solutions of eq.",
        "4 are equivalent to a maximum entropy variant of the phrase sense disambiguation approach studied by Carpuat & Wu (2007b).",
        "These solutions are also closely related to the approximation known as piecewise training in graphical model literature (Sutton and McCallum, 2005; Sutton and Minka, 2006) and independently stated in a more general form by Perez-Cruz et al. (2007).",
        "Aside from formal differences between feature templates defined by graphical models and grammars, which are beyond the scope of our discussion, there are several further contrasts between these studies and standard practice in machine translation in how the learned parameters are used to make predictions.",
        "Unlike inference in piecewise-trained graphical models, where all parameters for a given output are added together without normalization, features that enter into the score for a translation hypothesis are restricted to be consistent with a single synchronous parse and the local probabilities are normalized in decoding as in training.",
        "The use of conditional probabilities in standard lexical models also gives us a straightforward way to generalize them in the same way as phrase models.",
        "Consider the lexical model pw(ry\\rx), defined following Koehn et al. (2003), with a denoting the most frequent word alignment observed for the rule in the training set.",
        "We replace p(wy\\wx) with context-conditioned probabilities, computed similarly to eq.",
        "4, but at the level of individual words.",
        "Our experience suggests that, unlike the analogous phrase model, the standard lexical model pw (rx \\ ry) is not made redundant by this elaboration, and we use its baseline variant in all our experiments.",
        "While this approach seeks to make the most of practical insights underlying state-of-the-art baselines, it is of course not the only way to combine rule-based and word-based features.",
        "See for example Sutton & Minka (2006) for a discussion of alternatives that are closer in spirit to the idea of approximating global probabilities.",
        "An immediate practical benefit of interpreting relative frequency and classifier estimates of translation models as special cases is the possibility of generalizing them further by introducing additional features based on less specific representations of rules and words.",
        "Among the least specific and most potentially useful representations of hierarchical phrases are those limited to the patterns formed by gaps and words, allowing the model to generalize reordering information beyond individual tokens.",
        "We study two types of ordering patterns.",
        "For rules with two gaps we form features by conjoining contextual indicator functions with functions indicating whether the gap pattern is monotone or inverting.",
        "We also use another type of ordering features, representing the pattern formed by gaps and contiguous subsequences of words.",
        "For example, the rule with the right-hand side ( dd Ai idées A2 , A\\ A2 ideas ) might be associated with the pattern ( a A\\ aA2 , Ai A2 a ).",
        "Because some source-side patterns of this type apply to many different rules it is no longer possible to decompose parameter estimation into small independent optimization subproblems.",
        "For practical convenience we enforce decomposition in the experiments reported below in the following way.",
        "We define indicator functions for sequences of closed-class words and the most frequent part-of-speech tag for open-class words on the source side.",
        "For the rule above and a simple tag-set the pattern tracked by such an indicator function would be dd Ai N A2 .",
        "We require all reordering features to be conjoined with an indicator function of this type, ensuring that each corresponds to a separate optimization subproblem.",
        "We further split larger optimization subproblems, so that parameters for identical reordering features are in some cases estimated separately for different subsets of rules.",
        "Morphological inflection provides motivation for another class of features not bound to surface representations.",
        "In this paper we explore a particularly simple example of this approach, adding features conjoined with indicator functions for Arabic lemmas to the lexical models in Arabic-English translation.",
        "This preserves decomposition of parameter estimation, with subproblems now associated with individual lemmas rather than words.",
        "Lemma-based features suggest another extension of the modeling framework.",
        "Instead of computing the sums in normalization factors over all English words aligned to a given Arabic token in the training data, we let the sum range over all English words aligned to Arabic words sharing its lemma.",
        "This also defines probabilities for Arabic words whose surface forms have not been observed in training, although we do not take advantage of estimates for out-of-vocabulary words in the experiments below.",
        "3.5 Regularization",
        "We apply l\\ regularization (Ng, 2004; Gao et al., 2007) to make learning more robust to noise and control the effective dimensionality of the feature space by subtracting a weighted sum of absolute values of parameter weights from the log-likelihood of the training data",
        "We optimize the objective using a variant of the orthant-wise limited-memory quasi-Newton algorithm proposed by Andrew & Gao (2007).",
        "All values Ci are set to 1 in most of the experiments below, although we apply stronger regularization (Ci = 3) to reordering features.",
        "Tuning regularization tradeoffs individually for different feature types is an attractive option, but our experiments suggest that using cross-entropy on a held-out portion of training data for that purpose does not help performance.",

        "Statistical tests for experimental conditions were performed in comparison to the baseline which achieved higher score on the test-dev MT02 set: the fractional count baseline for Arabic-English and the simple relative count baseline for Chinese-English.",
        "We test models with classifier solutions for phrase models alone and for phrase models together with lexical models in both language pairs.",
        "For Arabic-English translation we also experiment with adding features based on lemmas to lexical models, while for Chinese-English we add \"reordering\" features features based on the ordering pattern of gaps for rules with two gaps and features based on ordering of gaps and words for rules with a single gap.",
        "For both language pairs the results show consistent distinctions in behavior of different models between the test sets giving rise to generally higher scores (MT03 and MT05) and generally lower scores (MT04 and MT06).",
        "The fractional counts seem to be consistently more helpful for test sets with poorer coverage, although the reason for this is not immediately clear.",
        "For exponential models the two type of sets present two possible sources of difference.",
        "The lower-performing sets have poorer coverage in the training data, and they also may suffer from lower-quality annotation, since the training sets for both the translation models and the annotation tools are dominated by text in the same, newswire domain.",
        "Overall, the use of features based on surface forms is more beneficial for MT03 and MT05.",
        "Indeed, using lexical models with contextual features in addition to phrase models hurts performance on MT06 for Arabic-English and on both MT04 and MT06 for Chinese-English.",
        "In contrast, using features based on less specific representations is more beneficial on test sets with poorer coverage, while hurting performance on MT03 and MT05.",
        "This agrees with our intuitions and also suggests that the differences in coverage of training data for the translation models may be playing a more important role in these trends than coverage for annotation tools."

        "We have outlined a framework for translation modeling that synthesizes several recent advances in phrase-based machine translation and suggests many other ways to leverage sub-token representations of words as well as syntactic and morphological annotation tools, of which the experiments reported here explore only a small fraction.",
        "Indeed, the range and practicality of the available options is perhaps its most attractive feature.",
        "The inital results are promising and we are optimistic that continued exploration of this class of models will uncover even more effective uses."
