        "The former is largely controlled by language models and translation models and the latter by language models and distortion models.",

        "This separation is essential if one were to design a decoder that incorporates phrase-based, syntax-based, and other types of decoding in a unified and disciplined way.",
        "In the decoder, each hypothesis carries with it a sequence of source segments to be decoded at the current time step.",
        "After the production module translates these segments and after beam pruning is applied to all the hypotheses produced at this time step, the hypotheses go back to the reordering module which determines the next source segments to be translated.",

        "One can think of the reordering module as a black box whose sole responsibility is to determine the next sequence of source segments to be translated.",
        "Given this separation, the reordering module can be implemented in whichever way and the changes in it do not require changes to any other modules in the decoder.",
        "There can be a suite of such modules, each exploring different features and implementing different search schemes.",

        "The framework is not limited to these four methods.",
        "We present these four to demonstrate the ability of the framework to incorporate a wide variety of reordering methods.",
        "This is the type of reordering first presented by (Brown et.al.",
        "1993) and was briefly alluded to in the above Introduction section.",
        "This method is controlled by 2 parameters:",

        "Initially, all 10 entries of B are 0.",

        "It is clear that the search space easily blows up with large skip and window-width values.",
        "Therefore, a beam pruning step is performed after partial hypotheses are produced at every time step.",
        "In this section we show an example of how the Hiero decoding method (Chiang 2005) can be implemented as a reordering module in this framework.",
        "This is not meant to show that our MT decoder is a synchronous CFG parser.",
        "This is a conceptual demonstration of how the Hiero rules can be used in a reordering module to decide the source translation order and thus used in a traditional phrase-based decoder.",
        "This module uses the Hiero rules to determine the next source segment to be translated.",
        "The example is Chinese-English translation.",
        "Consider the following Chinese sentence (word position and English gloss are shown in parentheses):",
        "Suppose we have two following Hiero rules: #titt X โ Australia X (1) Jยง X L โ โ is one of X (2)",
        "The left-hand-side of Hiero rules are source phrases and the right-hand-side is their English translation and the Xs are the non-terminals whose extent is determined by the source input against which the rules are tested for matching.",
        "A rule fires if its left-hand-side matches certain segments of the input.",
        "Given the above Chinese input and the two Hiero rules, the Hiero decoder as described in (Chiang 2005) will produce a partial hypothesis \"Australia is one of\" by firing the two rules during parsing (see Chiang 2005 for decoding details).",
        "We will show how to decode in the Hiero paradigm using the framework.",
        "The reordering module first decides a source segment based on rule (1).",
        "Rule (1) generates a sequence of source segments in term of source ranges: <[1,1],[2,10]>.",
        "This means the source segment spanning range [1,1] (word 1, M^kWJ^E /Australia) is to be translated first, and then the remaining segment spanning range [2,10] is to be translated next.",
        "This is exactly what rule (1) dictates where M^fflM corresponds to source [1,1] in the reordering module's output and the X is [2,10].",
        "The range [1,1], after being given to the production module, results in the production of a partial hypothesis where the target \"Australia'\" is produced.",
        "The task now is to translate the next source range [2,10].",
        "At this point, the reordering module generates another source segment according to rule (2) where the left-hand-side \"M X โ \" is matched against the input and three corresponding source ranges are found which are [2,2] (M/is), [4,9] (X), and [10,10] (^ โ /one of).",
        "According to rule (2), this source sequence is to be translated in the order of [2,2] (is), [10,10] (one of), and then [4,9] (X).",
        "Therefore the output of the reordering module at this stage is <[2,2],[10,10],[4,9]>.",
        "This would then go on to be translated and results in a partial hypothesis to \"Australia is one of'.",
        "Thus \"Australia is one of' is a partial production which covers source segments [1,1] [2,2] and [10,10] in that order.",
        "Note that the source segments decoded so far are not contiguous and this is the effect of long-range reordering imposed by rule (2).",
        "The next stage is <[4,9]> which is what the X in rule (2) corresponds to.",
        "From here onwards, other rules will fire and the decoding sequence these rules dictate will be realized by the reordering module in the form of source ranges.",
        "This process can also be viewed hierarchically in Figure 2.",
        "In Figure 2 the ranges (the bracketed numbers) are source segments and the leaves are English productions.",
        "Initially we have the whole input sentence as one range [1,10].",
        "According to rule (1), this initial range is refined to be [2,10] is further refined by rule (2) to generate the 3rd level ranges <[2,2],[10,10],[4,9]> and the process goes on.",
        "Ranges that cannot be further refined go into the production module which",
        "Australia | | /s.",
        "generates partial hypotheses which are the leaves in the figure.",
        "In other words, the partial hypotheses are generated by traversing the tree in Figure 2 in a left-to-right depth-first fashion.",
        "The aim of a generalized part-of-speech-based reordering method is to tackle the problem of long-range word movement.",

        "We have presented a decoding framework that greatly facilitates the incorporation of various reordering strategies that are necessary to put the words in the right order during translation.",
        "This modularized framework abstracts away the reordering phase from the rest of the decoder components.",
        "This not only makes the decoder easier to maintain but also allows rapid experimentation of a variety of reordering methods.",
        "Instead of using one reordering module, multiple reordering modules are used to come up with a list of next possible source segment choices.",
        "So far we have not seen any significant improvement using combination of reordering modules.",
        "This warrants further research since intuitively the knowledge-rich modules and the distance-based methods ought to complement each other.",
        "The POS and parse-based methods are very targeted and work quite well when the source structure is correctly understood, but cannot correct itself when errors occur in the tagging or the parsing process.",
        "The distance-based methods pay no attention to structure and is thus immune from source processing errors.",
        "Although we present the POS-based and parse-based reordering modules in the context of Chinese to English translation, they can be used for other languages as well.",
        "For example, in Arabic to English translation, we extract patterns that capture the VSO word order of Arabic (English is SVO) and also the adjectival post-modification of noun.",
        "The framework greatly reduces the amount of work needed to experiment with drastically different ways of reordering.",
        "All these can now be done in one single decoder."
