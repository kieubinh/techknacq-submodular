        "Our objective of the first stage of our approach is to detect sub-sentential constituent correspondences in parallel sentences, based on phrase-structure parses for the two corresponding sentences.",
        "Given a pair of parallel sentences and their corresponding parse trees, our goal is to find pairings of nodes in the source and target trees whose yields are translation equivalents of each other.",
        "Our current approach only considers complete constituents and their contigious yields, and will therefore not align discontiguous phrases or partial constituents.",
        "Similar to phrase extraction methods in PB-SMT, we rely on word-level alignments (derived manually or automatically) as indicators for translation equivalence.",
        "The assumption applied is that if two words are aligned with each other, they carry the same meaning and can be treated as translation equivalents.",
        "Constituents are treated as compositional units of meaning and translation equivalence.",
        "Aligning nodes in parallel trees has been investigated by a number of previous researchers.",
        "(Samuelsson and Volk, 2007) describe a process for manual alignment of nodes in parallel trees.",

        "(Tinsley et al., 2007) use statistical lexicons derived from automatic statistical word alignment for aligning nodes in parallel trees.",
        "In our approach, we use the word alignment information directly, which we believe may be more reliable than the statistical lexicon.",
        "(Groves et al., 2004) propose a method of aligning nodes between parallel trees automatically, based on word alignments.",
        "In addition to the word alignment information, their approach uses the constituent labels of nodes in the trees, and the general structure of the tree.",
        "Our approach is more general in the sense that we only consider the word alignments, thereby making the approach applicable to any parser or phrase-structure representation, even ones that are quite different for the two languages involved.",
        "Word-level alignment of phrase-level translation equivalents often leaves some words unaligned.",
        "For example, some languages have articles, while others do not.",
        "It is thus reasonable to expect that constituent pairs in parallel trees that are good translation equivalents of each other may contain some unaligned words.",
        "Our PFA node-alignment algorithm allows for such constituents to be matched.",
        "Different languages have different word orders.",
        "In English, an adjective always comes before a noun, while in French, in most cases, the adjective follows its noun.",
        "Our node alignment algorithm allows aligning of constituents regardless of the word order expressed by the linear precedence relation of their sub-constituents.",
        "As long as one piece of contiguous text dominated by a node covers the same word-level alignments as the yield of a node in the parallel tree, the two nodes can be aligned.",
        "Given a pair of word-aligned sentences and their corresponding parse trees S and T, represented as sets of constituent nodes, our PFA node alignment algorithm produces a collection of aligned node-pairs (Si, Tj).",
        "The underlying assumptions of com-positionality in meaning and word-level alignments being indicative of translation equivalence lead directly to the following node alignment wellformed-ness criteria:",
        "1.",
        "If a node Si is linked to a node Tj, then any node within the subtree of node Si can only be linked to nodes within the subtree of node Tj.",
        "2.",
        "If a node Si is linked to a node Tj, then any node that dominates the node Si can only be linked to nodes that dominate the node Tj.",
        "3.",
        "If a node Si is linked to a node Tj, then the word alignments of the yields of the two constituents must satisfy the following:",
        "(a) Every word in the yield of the node Si must be aligned to one or more words in the yield of the node Tj, or it should be unaligned.",
        "(b) Every word in the yield of the node Tj must be aligned to one or more words in the yield of the node Si, or it should be unaligned.",
        "(c) There should be at least one alignment between the yields of nodes Si and Tj.",
        "Thus, the words in the yields can not all be unaligned.",
        "Our PFA algorithm uses a arithmetic mapping that elegently carries over the constraints characterized by the wellformedness constraints elaborated above.",
        "This mapping is designed to ensure that each aligned word, which carries a distinct \"piece of meaning\" can be uniquely identified, and also inherently reflects the compositional properties of constituent translation equivalence.",
        "This is accomplished by assigning numerical values to the nodes of the two parse trees being aligned, in a bottom-up fashion, starting from the leaf nodes of the trees.",
        "Leaf nodes that correspond to words that are aligned are each assigned a unique prime number.",
        "Unaligned leaf nodes are assigned a value of \"1\".",
        "Constituent nodes in the parse trees are then assigned a value that is the product of all its sub-constituent nodes.",
        "Because of the arithmetic property that any composite number can be uniquely factored into primes, it should be evident that the value of every constituent node uniquely identifies the aligned words that are covered by its yield.",
        "Consequently, by assigning the same prime values to the aligned words of both trees, retrieving aligned constituent nodes is as simple as finding the set of nodes in the two trees that carry the same numerical value.",
        "Note that by assigning values of \"1\" to unaligned words, these unaligned words do not influence the numerical values assigned to constituent nodes, thus reflecting their treatment as \"don't cares\" with respect to the translation equivalence of constituent nodes.",
        "The PFA algorithm uses the concept of 'composite meaning as prime factorization', and hence the name (Prime Factorization and Alignments).",
        "The algorithm assigns values to the leaf nodes, propogates the values up the tree, and then compares the node values across the trees to align the nodes.",
        "As described above, leaf nodes which have word alignments are assigned unique prime numbers, and the same prime is assigned to the corresponding aligned words in the parallel sentences.",
        "Leaf nodes corresponding to unaligned words are assigned the value \"1\".",
        "The treatment of \"one-to-many\" word alignments is a special case.",
        "Such alignments are considered to carry the same meaning, and should thus be assigned the same value.",
        "To accomplish this, if a single word is aligned to multiple words in the other language, we assign the same prime number to all words on the \"multiple\" side, and assign the product of these to the single word equivalent.",
        "Another special case is when the parse trees contain unary productions.",
        "In this case, the values of both nodes involved in this production are the same.",
        "Our node alignment algorithm breaks this \"tie\" by selecting the node that is \"lower\" in the tree (the daughter node of the unary production).",
        "A similar situation with two nodes being assigned identical values can arise when one or more unaligned words are attached directly to the parent node.",
        "Here too, our algorithm aligns the \"lower\" node and leaves the \"higher\" node unaligned.",
        "These decisions reflect our desire to be conservative with respect to such ambiguous cases, and their implications on the notion of translational equivalence.",
        "This also provides some robustness against noisy alignments.",
        "It is straightfoward to verify that the PFA algorithm satisfies the wellformedness constraints described above.",
        "Also, since multiplication is commutative, the algorithm is not effected by differing word orders within parallel constituent structures.",

        "Our system currently does not use the internal tree structure information that is contained in the synchronous tree fragments.",
        "Therefore, only the syntactic category labels of the roots of the tree fragments, and the nodes on the fragment frontier are relevant to decoding.",
        "This in essense corresponds to a \"flattening\" of the synchronous tree fragment into a synchronous context free style rule.",
        "The flattening of the tree fragments is accomplished by an \"in-order\" traversal on each of the tree fragments to produce a string representation.",
        "Frontier nodes in the fragment are either labeled constituent nodes or leaf nodes of the original parse tree.",
        "These form the right-hand sides of the flattened rule.",
        "The positions of the constituent nodes in the output string are numbered to keep track of alignment of the nodes, which is often non-monotonic due to reordering between the source and target languages.",
        "Finally the root constituent label of the source tree fragment becomes the source-side parent category of the rule, while the root label of the target tree fragment becomes the target side parent category.",
        "Accurate automatic transfer rule learning requires accurate word alignments and parse structures.",
        "Thus, to favor high precision (at the expense of some loss of recall), in our work to date on Chinese and other languages, while we extract syntactic phrases from all available parallel data, we extract rules only from manually word-aligned parsed parallel data.",
        "To compensate for the limited amount of data, we generalize the rules as much as possible.",
        "Elements in the rules that originate from leaf nodes in the parse trees are generalized to their part-of-speech categories, if the corresponding words were one-to-one aligned in the parallel sentences.",
        "Unaligned words and words that are part of one-to-many alignments are not generalized to the POS level and remain lexicalized in the final rule.",
        "The phrase table extracted from the corpus and the rules are scored together to ensure that they are consistent when used in our translation system.",
        "For all Stat-XFER experiments to date, we have used just the source side conditionig with a constant smoothing factor for robustness to noise."
