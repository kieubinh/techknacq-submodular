        "Running experiments in natural language processing and machine learning typically involves a complicated network of programs.",
        "One program might extract data from a raw corpus, others might pre-process it with various linguistic tools, before finally the main program being tested is run.",
        "Further programs must evaluate the output, and produce graphs and tables for inclusion in papers and presentations.",
        "All of these steps can be run by hand, but a more typical approach is to automate them using tools such as UNIX shell scripts.",
        "We argue that any approach should satisfy a number of basic criteria.",
        "Reproducibility At some future time, the original researcher or other researchers ought to be able to rerun the set of experiments and produce identical results.",
        "Such reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific research, and ought in principle to be easier in our discipline than in a field requiring physical measurements such as physics or chemistry.",
        "Simplicity We want to create a system that we and other researchers will find easy to use.",
        "A system which requires significant overhead before any experiment can be run can limit a researcher's ability to quickly and easily try out new ideas.",
        "A realistic life-cycle of experiments A typical experiment evolves in structure as it goes along - the researcher may choose partway through to add new datasets, new ranges of parameters, or new sets of models to test.",
        "Moreover, a computational experiment rarely works correctly the first time.",
        "Components break for various reasons, a tool may not perform as expected, and so forth.",
        "A usable tool must be simple to use in the face of such repeated re-execution.",
        "Software engineering Whether writing shell scripts, makefiles, or Java, one is writing code, and software engineering concerns apply.",
        "One key principle is modularity, that different parts of a program should be cleanly separated.",
        "Another is generality, creating solutions that are reusable in different specific cases.",
        "A usable tool must encourage good software engineering.",
        "Inherent support for the combinatorial nature of our experiments Experiments in natural language processing and machine learning typically compare different datasets, different models, different feature sets, different training regimes, and train and test on a number of cross-validation folds.",
        "This produces a very large number of files which any system must handle in a clean way.",

        "As a running example, we present the following set of experiments (abstracted from (Breck et al., 2007)).",
        "The task is one of entity identification we have a large dataset in which two different types of opinion entities are tagged, type A, and type B.",
        "We will use a sequence-based learning algorithm to model the entities, but we want to investigate the relationship between the two types.",
        "In particular, will it be preferable to learn a single model which predicts both entity type A and entity type B, or two separate models, one predicting A, and one predicting B.",
        "The former case makes a three-way distinction between entities of type A, of type B, and of type O, all other words.",
        "The latter two models make a distinction between type A and both other types or between type B and both other types.",
        "Furthermore, prior work to which we wish to compare does not distinguish at all between type A and type B, so we also need a model which just predicts entities to be of either type A or B, versus the background O.",
        "These four training regimes are summarized in Table 1.",
        "Given one of these training regimes, the model is trained and tested using 10-fold cross-validation, and the result is evaluated using precision and recall.",
        "The evaluation is conducted separately for class A, for class B, and for predicting the union of both classes.",
        "Many researchers use UNIX shell scripts to coordinate experiments.",
        "Figure 1 presents a potential shell script for the experiments discussed in Section 2.",
        "Shell scripting is familiar and widely used for coordinating the execution of programs.",
        "However, there are three difficulties with this approach it is difficult to partially re-run, the specification of the filenames is error-prone, and the script is badly modularized.",
        "Re-running the experiment The largest difficulty with this script is how it handles errors - namely, it does not.",
        "If some early processes succeed, but later ones fail, the researcher can only rerun the entire script, wasting the time spent on the previous run.",
        "There are two common solutions to this problem.",
        "The simplest is to comment out the parts of the script which have succeeded, and rerun the script.",
        "This is highly brittle and error-prone.",
        "More reliable but much more complicated is to write a wrapper around each command which checks whether the outputs from the command already exist before running it.",
        "Neither of these is desirable.",
        "It is also worth noting that this problem can arise not just through error, but when an input file changes, an experiment is extended with further processing, additional graphs are added, further statistics are calculated, or if another model is added to the comparison.",

        "Problematic filenames In this example, a filename is a concatenation of several variable names -e.g. $(fold).$(class).train.",
        "This is also error-prone - the writer of the script has to keep track, for each filename, of which attributes need to be specified for a given file, and the order in which they must be specified.",
        "Either of these can change as an experiment's design evolves, and subtle design changes can require changes throughout the script of the references to many filenames.",
        "Bad modularization In this example, the eval program is called twice, even though the input and output files in each case are of the same format.",
        "The problem is that the filenames are such that the line in the script which calls eval needs to be include information about precisely which files (in one case $fold.3way.$class, and in the other $fold.$class)are being evaluated.",
        "This is irrelevant - a more modular specification for the eval program would simply say that it operates on a .eval-in file and produces an .eval file.",
        "We will see ways below of achieving exactly this.",
        "One solution to the problems detailed above is to use a makefile instead of a shell script.",
        "The make program (Feldman, 1979) bills itself as a \"utility to maintain groups of programs\", but from our perspective, make is a declarative language for specifying dependencies.",
        "This seems to be exactly what we want, and indeed it does solve some of the problems detailed above.",
        "make has several new problems, though, which result in its being not an ideal solution to our problem.",
        "Figure 2 presents a portion of a makefile for this task.",
        "For this part, the makefile ideally matches what we want.",
        "It will pick up where it left off, avoiding the rerunning problem above.",
        "The question of filenames is sidestepped, as we only need to deal with the extensions here.",
        "And each command is neatly partitioned into its own section, which specifies its dependencies, the files created by each command, and the shell command to run to create them.",
        "However, there are three serious problems with this approach.",
        "Files are represented by strings The first problem can be seen by trying to write a similar line for the eval command.",
        "It would look something like this:",
        "However, it is hard to write the code represented here as get-class.",
        "This code needs to examine the filename string of $\" or $@, and extract the class from that.",
        "This is certainly possible using standard UNIX shell tools or make extensions, but it is ugly, and has to be written once for every time such a field needs to be accessed.",
        "For example, one way of writing get-class using GNU make extensions would be:",
        "The basic problem here is that to make, a file is represented by a string, its filename.",
        "For machine learning and natural language processing experiments, it is much more natural to represent a file as a set of key-value pairs.",
        "For example, the file O.B.model might be represented as { fold = 0, class = B, filetype = model } .",
        "Combinatorial dependencies The second problem with make is that it is very difficult to specify combinatorial dependencies.",
        "If one continued to write the makefile above, one would eventually need to write a final all target to specify all the files which would need to be built.",
        "There are 60 such files: one for each fold of the following set",
        "$fold.3way.A.eval $fold.3way.B.eval $fold.3way.A+B.eval $fold.A.eval $fold.B.eval $fold.A+B.eval",
        "There is no easy way in make of listing these 60 files in a natural manner.",
        "One can escape to a shell script, or use GNU make's foreach function, but both ways are messy.",
        "Non-representable dependency structures The final problem with make also relates to dependencies.",
        "It is more subtle, but it turns out that there are some sorts of dependency structures which cannot be represented in make.",
        "Suppose I want to compare the effect of using one of three parsers, one of three part-of-speech-taggers and one of three chun-kers for a summarization experiment.",
        "This involves three separate three-way distinctions in the makefile, where for each, there are three different commands that might be run.",
        "A non-working example is in Figure 3.",
        "The problem is that make pattern rules (rules using the % character) can only match the suffix or prefix of a filename.",
        "This makefile does not work because it requires the parser, chunker, and tagger to all be the last part of the filename before the type suffix.",
        "zymake is designed to address the problems outlined above.",
        "The key principles of its design are as follows:",
        "• Like make, zymakefiles can be rerun multiple times, each time picking up where the last",
        "left off.",
        "• Files are specified by key-value sets, not by strings",
        "• zymake includes a straightforward way of handling combinatorial sets of files.",
        "• zymake syntax is minimally different from shell syntax.",
        "Figure 4 presents a zymakefile which runs the running example experiment.",
        "Rather than explaining the entire file at once, we will present a series of increasingly complex parts of it.",
        "Figure 5 presents the simplest possible zymake-file, consisting of one rule, which describes how to create a $().test file, and one goal, which lists what files should be created by this file.",
        "A rule is simply a shell command, with some number of interpolations.",
        "An interpolation is anything between the characters $( and the matching ) .",
        "This is the only form of interpolation done by zymake, so as to minimally conflict with other interpolations done by the shell, scripting languages such as Perl, etc.",

        "extract-3way-training $(fold) raw-data > $(train=\"3way\").train",

        "The exact commands run by this makefile are presented in Appendix A.",
        "extract-test-data $(fold) raw-data $(>).test",
        "The two interpolations in this example are file interpolations, which are replaced by zymake with a generated filename.",
        "Files in zymake are identified not by a filename string but by a set of key-value pairs, along with a suffix.",
        "In this case, the two interpolations have no key-value pairs, and so are only represented by a suffix.",
        "Finally, there are two kinds of file interpolations - inputs, which are files that are required to exist before a command can be run, and outputs, which are files created by a command.",
        "In this case, the interpolation $(>).test is marked as an output by the > character, while $().test is an input, since it is unmarked.",
        "The goal of this program is to create a file matching the interpolation $().test.",
        "The single rule does create a file matching that interpolation, and so this program will result in the execution of the following single command:",
        "extract-test-data raw-data .test",
        "Figure 6 presents a slightly more complex zy-makefile.",
        "In this case, there are two goals - to create a .test file with the key fold having the value 0, and another .test file with fold equal to 1.",
        "We also see that the rule has become slightly more complex - there is now another interpolation.",
        "This, however, is not a file interpolation, but a variable interpolation.",
        "$(fold) will be replaced by the value of fold.",
        "Executing this zymakefile results in the execution of two commands:",
        "extract-test-data 0 raw-data 0.test extract-test-data 1 raw-data l.test",
        "Note that the output files are now not just .test but include the fold number in their name.",
        "This is because zymake infers that the fold key, mentioned in the extract rule, is needed to distinguish the two test files.",
        "In general the user should specify as few keys as possible for each file interpolation, and allow zymake to infer the exact set of keys necessary to distinguish each file from the rest.",
        "Figure 7 presents a small refinement to the zymakefile in Figure 6.",
        "The commands that will be run are the same, but instead of separately listing the two test files to be created, we create a variable folds which is a list of all the folds we want, and use a splat to create multiple goals.",
        "A splat is indicated by the asterisk character, and creates one copy of the file interpolation for each value in the variable's list.",
        "Figure 4 is now a straightforward extension of the example we have seen so far.",
        "It uses a few more features of zymake that we will not discuss, such as string-valued keys, and the range function, but further documentation is available on the zymake website.",
        "zymake wants to create the goals at the end, so it examines all the rules and constructs a directed acyclic graph, or DAG, representing the dependencies among the files.",
        "It then executes the commands in some order based on this DAG - see Section 3 for discussion of execution order.",
        "zymake satisfies the criteria set out above, and handles the problems discussed with other systems.",
        "• Reproducibility.",
        "By providing a single file which can be re-executed many times, zymake encourages a development style that encodes all information about a workflow in a single file.",
        "This also serves as documentation of the complete workflow.",
        "• Simplicity.",
        "zymake only requires writing a set of shell commands, annotated with interpolations.",
        "This allows researchers to quickly and easily construct new and more complex experiments, or to modify existing ones.",
        "• Experimental life-cycle.",
        "zymake can re-execute the same file many times when components fail, inputs change, or the workflow is extended.",
        "• Software engineering.",
        "Each command in a zymakefile only needs to describe the inputs and outputs relevant for that command, making the separate parts of the file quite modular.",
        "• Combinatorial experiments.",
        "zymake includes a built-in method for specifying that a particular variable needs to range over several possibilities, such as a set of models, parameter values, or datasets.",
        "Beginning to use zymake is as simple as downloading a single binary from the website.",
        "Just as with a shell script or makefile, the user then writes a single textual zymakefile, and passes it to zymake for execution.",
