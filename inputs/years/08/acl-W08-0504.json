        "Software systems that perform practical tasks with natural language input often include, in addition to task-specific components, a pipeline of basic natural language processing modules, such as part-of-speech taggers, named-entity recognizers, syntactic parsers and semantic-role labelers.",
        "Although such building blocks of larger language technology solutions are usually carefully evaluated in isolation using standard test sets, the impact of improvements in each individual module on the overall performance of end-to-end systems is less well understood.",
        "While the effects of the amount of training data, search beam widths and various machine learning frameworks have been explored in detail with respect to speed and accuracy in basic natural language processing tasks, how these tradeoffs in individual modules affect the performance of the larger systems they compose is an issue that has received relatively little attention.",
        "This issue, however, is of great practical importance in the effective design and engineering of complex software systems that deal with natural language.",
        "In this paper we explore some of these issues empirically in an information extraction task in the biomedical domain, the identification of proteinprotein interactions (PPI) mentioned in papers abstracts from MEDLINE, a large database of biomedical papers.",
        "Due in large part to the creation of biomedical treebanks (Kulick et al., 2004; Tateisi et al., 2005) and rapid progress of data-driven parsers (Lease and Charniak, 2005; Nivre et al., 2007), there are now fast, robust and accurate syntactic parsers for text in the biomedical domain.",
        "Recent research shows that parsing accuracy of biomedical corpora is now between 80% and 90% (Clegg and Shepherd, 2007; Pyysalo et al., 2007; Sagae et al., 2008).",
        "Intuitively, syntactic relationships between words should be valuable in determining possible interactions between entities present in text.",
        "Recent PPI extraction systems have confirmed this intuition (Erkan et al., 2007; Sœtre et al., 2007; Katrenko and Adriaans, 2006).",
        "While it is now relatively clear that syntactic parsing is useful in practical tasks that use natural language corpora in bioinformatics, several questions remain as to research issues that affect the design and testing of end-user applications, including how syntactic analyses should be used in a practical setting, whether further improvements in parsing technologies will result in further improvements in practical systems, whether it is important to continue the development of treebanks and parser adaptation techniques for the biomedical domain, and how much effort should be spent on comparing and benchmarking parsers for biomedical data.",
        "We attempt to shed some light on these matters by presenting experiments that show the relationship of the accuracy of a dependency parser and the accuracy of the larger PPI system that includes the parser.",
        "We investigate the effects of domain-specific treebank size (the amount of available manually annotated training data for syntactic parsers) and final system performance, and obtain results that should be informative to researchers in bioinformatics who rely on existing NLP resources to design information extraction systems, as well as to members of the parsing community who are interested in the practical impact of parsing research.",
        "In section 2 we discuss our motivation and related efforts.",
        "Section 3 describes the system for identification of protein-protein interactions used in our experiments, and in section 4 describes the syntactic parser that provides the analyses for the PPI system, and the data used to train the parser.",

        "While recent work has addressed questions relating to the use of different parsers or different types of syntactic representations in the PPI extraction task (Ssetre et al., 2007, Miyao et al., 2008), little concrete evidence has been provided for potential benefits of improved parsers or additional resources for training syntactic parsers.",
        "In fact, although there is increasing interest in parser evaluation in the biomedical domain in terms of precision/recall of brackets and dependency accuracy (Clegg and Shepherd, 2007; Pyysalo et al., 2007; Sagae et al., 2008), the relationship between these evaluation metrics and the performance of practical information extraction systems remains unclear.",
        "In the parsing community, relatively small accuracy gains are often reported as success stories, but again, the precise impact of such improvements on practical tasks in bioinformatics has not been established.",
        "One aspect of this issue is the question of domain portability and domain adaptation for parsers and other NLP modules.",
        "Clegg and Shepherd (2007) mention that available statistical parsers appear to overfit to the newswire domain, because of their extensive use of the Wall Street Journal portion of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1994) during development and training.",
        "While this claim is supported by convincing evaluations that show that parsers trained on the WSJ Penn Treebank alone perform poorly on biomedical text in terms of accuracy of dependencies or bracketing of phrase structure, the benefits of using domain-specific data in terms of practical system performance have not been quantified.",
        "These expected benefits drive the development of domain-specific resources, such as the GENIA treebank (Tateisi et al., 2005), and parser domain adaption (Hara et al., 2007), which are of clear importance in parsing research, but of largely unconfirmed impact on practical systems.",
        "Quirk and Corston-Oliver (2006) examine a similar issue, the relationship between parser accuracy and overall system accuracy in syntax-informed machine translation.",
        "Their research is similar to the work presented here, but they focused on the use of varying amounts of out-of-domain training data for the parser, measuring how a translation system for technical text performed when its syntactic parser was trained with varying amounts of Wall Street Journal text.",
        "Our work, in contrast, investigates the use of domain-specific training material in parsers for biomedical text, a domain where significant amounts of effort are allocated for development of domain-specific NLP resources in hope that such resources will result in better overall performance in practical systems."

        "This parsing approach is very similar to the one used successfully by Nivre et al.",

        "In addition, our parsing approach performs a search over the space of possible parser actions, while Nivre et al.",
        "'s approach is deterministic.",

        "As described in Section 3, bag-of-words and syntactic dependency paths are fed as features to the PPI classifier.",
        "The accuracy of PPI extraction is measured by the abstract-wise 10-fold cross validation (Ssetre et al., 2007).",
        "When we use the part-of-speech tagger and the dependency parser trained with WSJ, the accuracy (F-score) of PPI extraction on this data set is 55.2.",
        "The accuracy increases to 56.9 when we train the part-of-speech tagger with GENIA and Penn BioIE, while using the WSJ-trained parser.",
        "This confirms the claims by Lease and Charniak (2005) that sub-sentential lexical analysis alone is helpful in adapting WSJ parsers to the biomedical domain.",
        "While Lease and Charniak looked only at parse accuracy, our result shows that the increase in parse accuracy is, as expected, beneficial in practice.",
        "Figure 6 shows the relationship between the amount of parser training data and the F-score for the PPI extraction.",
        "The result shows that the accuracy of PPI extraction increases with the use of more sentences to train the parser.",
        "The best accuracy was obtained when using 4,000 sentences, where parsing accuracy is around 84.3.",
        "Although it may appear that further increasing the training data for the parser may not improve the PPI extraction accuracy (since only small and inconsistent variations in F-score are observed in Figure 6), when we plot the curves shown in Figures 5 and 6 in a single graph (Figure 7), we see that the two curves match each other to a large extent.",
        "This is supported by the strong correlation between parse accuracy and PPI accuracy observed in Figure 8.",
        "While this suggests that training the parser with a larger treebank may result in improved accuracy in PPI extraction, we observe that a 1% absolute improvement in parser accuracy corresponds roughly to a 0.25 improvement in PPI extraction F-score.",
        "Figure 5 indicates that to obtain even a 1% improvement in parser accuracy by using more training data, the size of the treebank would have to increase significantly.",
        "Although the results presented so far seem to suggest the need for a large data annotation effort to achieve a meaningful improvement in PPI extraction accuracy, there are other ways to improve the overall accuracy of the system without an improvement in parser accuracy.",
        "One obvious alternative is to increase the size of the PPI-annotated corpus (which is distinct from the treebank used to train the parser).",
        "As mentioned in section 3, our system is trained using the Aimed corpus, which contains 225 abstracts from biomedical papers with manual annotations indicating interactions between proteins.",
        "Pairs of proteins with no interaction described in the text are used as negative examples, and pairs of proteins described as interacting are used as positive examples.",
        "The corpus contains a total of roughly 9,000 examples.",
        "Figure 9 shows how the overall system accuracy varies when different amounts of training data (varying amounts of training examples) are used to train the PPI system (keeping the parse accuracy constant, using all of the available training data in the GENIA treebank to train the parser).",
        "While Figure 5 indicates that a significant improvement in parse accuracy requires a large increase in the treebank used to train the parser, and Figure 7 shows that improvements in PPI extraction accuracy may require a sizable improvement in parse accuracy, Figure 9 suggests that even a relatively small increase in the PPI corpus may lead to a significant improvement in PPI extraction accuracy.",
        "While some of the conclusions that can be drawn from these results may be somewhat surprising, most are entirely expected.",
        "However, even in these straightforward cases, our experiments provide some empirical evidence and concrete quantitative analysis to complement intuition.",
        "We see that using domain-specific training data for the parsing component for the PPI extraction system produces superior results, compared to using training data from the WSJ Penn Treebank.",
        "When the parser trained on WSJ sentences is used, PPI extraction accuracy is about 55, compared to over 57 when sentences from biomedical papers are used.",
        "This corresponds fairly closely to the differences in parser accuracy: the accuracy of the parser trained on 500 sentences from GENIA is about the same as the accuracy of the parser trained on the entire WSJ Penn Treebank, and when these parsers are used in the PPI extraction system, they result in similar overall task accuracy.",
        "However, the results obtained when a domain-specific POS tagger is combined with a parser trained with out-of-domain data, overall PPI results are nearly at the same level as those obtained with domain-specific training data (just below 57 with a domain-specific POS tagger and out-of-domain parser, and just above 57 for domain-specific POS tagger and parser).",
        "At the same time, the argument against annotating domain-specific data for parsers in new domains is not a strong one, since higher accuracy levels (for both the parser and the overall system) can be obtained with a relatively small amount of domain-specific data.",
        "Figures 5, 6 and 7 also suggest that additional efforts in improving parser accuracy (through the use of feature engineering, other machine learning techniques, or an increase in the size of its training set) could improve PPI extraction accuracy, but a large improvement in parser accuracy may be required.",
        "When we combine these results with the findings obtained by Miyao et al.",
        "(2008), they suggest that a better way to improve the overall system is to spend more effort in designing a specific syntactic representation that addresses the needs of the system, instead of using a generic representation designed for measuring parser accuracy.",
        "Another potentially fruitful course of action is to design more sophisticated and effective ways for information extraction systems to use NLP tools, rather than simply extracting features that correspond to small fragments of syntactic trees.",
