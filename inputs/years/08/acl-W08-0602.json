        "The application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) is widespread in biomedicine.",
        "Typically, it is applied to improve access to the ever-burgeoning research literature.",
        "Increasingly, biomedical researchers need to relate this literature to pheno-typic data: both to populations, and to individual clinical subjects.",
        "The computer applications used in biomedical research, including NLP applications, therefore need to support genotype-meets-phenotype informatics and the move towards translational biology.",
        "Such support will undoubtedly include linkage to the information held in individual medical records: both the structured portion, and the unstructured textual portion.",
        "The Clinical E-Science Framework (CLEF) project (Rector et al., 2003) is building a framework for the capture, integration and presentation of this clinical information, for research and evidence-based health care.",
        "The project's data resource is a repository of the full clinical records for over 20000 cancer patients from the Royal Marsden Hospital, Europe's largest oncology centre.",
        "These records combine structured information, clinical narratives, and free text investigation reports.",
        "CLEF uses information extraction (IE) technology to make information from the textual portion of the medical record available for integration with the structured record, and thus available for clinical care and research.",
        "The CLEF IE system analyses the textual records to extract entities, events and the relationships between them.",
        "These relationships give information that is often not available in the structured record.",

        "This paper examines relationship extraction.",
        "Extraction of relationships from clinical text is usually carried out as part of a full clinical IE system.",
        "Several such systems have been described.",
        "They generally use a syntactic parse with domain-specific grammar rules.",
        "The Linguistic String project (Sager et al., 1994) used a full syntactic and clinical sublanguage parse to fill template data structures corresponding to medical statements.",
        "These were mapped to a database model incorporating medical facts and the relationships between them.",
        "MedLEE (Friedman et al., 1994), and more recently BioMedLEE (Lussier et al., 2006) used a semantic lexicon and grammar of domain-specific semantic patterns.",
        "The patterns encode the possible relationships between entities, allowing both entities and the relationships between them to be directly matched in the text.",
        "Other systems have incorporated large-scale domain-specific knowledge bases.",
        "medsyn-Dikate (Hahn et al., 2002) employed a rich discourse model of entities and their relationships, built using a dependency parse of texts and a description logic knowledge base re-engineered from existing terminologies.",
        "Menelas (Zweigenbaum et al., 1995) also used a full parse, a conceptual representation of the text, and a large scale knowledge base.",
        "In other applications of biomedical NLP, a second paradigm has become widespread: the application of statistical machine learning techniques to feature-based models of the text.",
        "Such approaches have typically been applied to journal texts.",
        "They have been used both for entity recognition and extraction of various relations, such as protein-protein interactions (see, for example, Grover et al. (2007)).",
        "This follows on from the success of these methods in general NLP (see for example Zhou et al. (2005)).",
        "Statistical machine learning has also been applied to clinical text, but its use has generally been limited to entity recognition.",
        "The Mayo Clinic text analysis system (Pakhomov et al., 2005), for example, uses a combination of dictionary lookup and a Naive Bayes classiier to identify entities for information retrieval applications.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, statistical methods have not been previously applied to extraction of clinical relationships from text.",
        "This paper describes experiments in the statistical machine learning of relationships from a novel text type: oncology narratives.",
        "The set of relationships extracted are considered to be of interest for clinical and research applications down line of IE, such as querying to support clinical research.",
        "We apply Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers to learn these relationships.",
        "The classiiers are trained and evaluated using novel data: a gold standard corpus of clinical text, hand-annotated with semantic entities and relationships.",
        "In order to test the applicability of this method to the clinical domain, we train clas-siiers using a number of comparatively simple text features, and look at the contribution of these features to system performance.",
        "Clinically interesting relationships may span several sentences, and so we compare classiiers trained for both intra-and inter-sentential relationships (spanning one or more sentence boundaries).",
