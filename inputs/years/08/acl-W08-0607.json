        "Science involves making hypotheses, experimenting, and reasoning to reach conclusions, which are often tentative and provisional.",
        "Scientific writing, particularly in biomedical research articles, reflects this, as it is rich in speculative statements, also known as hedges.",
        "Most text processing systems ignore hedging and focus on factual language (assertions).",
        "Although assertions, sometimes mere cooccurrence of terms, are the focus of most information extraction and text mining applications, identifying hedged text is crucial, because hedging alters, in some cases even reverses, factual statements.",
        "For instance, the italicized fragment in example (1) below implies a factual statement while example (2) contains two hedging cues (indicate and might), which render the factual proposition speculative:",
        "(1) Each empty cell indicates that the corresponding TPase query was not used at the particular stage of PSI-BLAST analysis.",
        "(2) These experiments indicated that the roX genes might function as nuclear entry sites for the assembly of the MSL proteins on the X chromosome.",
        "These examples not only illustrate the phenomenon of hedging in the biomedical literature, they also highlight some of the difficulties in recognizing hedges.",
        "The word indicate plays a different role in each example, acting as a hedging cue only in the second.",
        "In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the speculative aspect of biomedical language (Light et al., 2004, Wilbur et al., 2006, Medlock and Briscoe, 2007).",
        "In general, these studies focus on issues regarding annotating speculation and approach the problem of recognizing speculation as a text classification problem, using the well-known \"bag of words\" method simple substring matching (Light et al., 2004).",
        "While both approaches perform reasonably well, they do not take into account the more complex and strategic ways hedging can occur in biomedical research articles.",
        "In example (3), hedging is achieved with a combination of referring to experimental results (We ... show that ... indicating) and the prepositional phrase to our knowledge:",
        "(3) We further show that D-mib is specifically required for Ser endocytosis and signaling during wing development indicating for the first time to our knowledge that endocytosis regulates Ser signaling.",
        "In this paper, we extend previous work through linguistically motivated techniques.",
        "In particular, we pay special attention to syntactic structures.",
        "We address lexical hedges by drawing on a set of lexical hedging cues and expanding and refining it in a semi-automatic manner to acquire a hedging dictionary.",
        "To capture more complex strategic hedges, we determine syntactic patterns that commonly act as hedging indicators by analyzing a publicly available hedge classification dataset.",
        "Furthermore, recognizing that \"not all hedges are created equal\", we use a weighting scheme, which also takes into consideration the strengthening or weakening effect of certain syntactic structures on lexical hedging cues.",
        "Our results demonstrate that linguistic knowledge can be used effectively to enhance the understanding of speculative language."

        "Our results confirm that writers of scientific articles employ basic, predictable hedging strategies to soften their claims or to indicate uncertainty and demonstrate that these strategies can be captured using a combination of lexical and syntactic means.",
        "Furthermore, the results indicate that hedging cues can be gainfully weighted to provide a rough measure of tentativeness or uncertainty.",
        "For instance, a sentence with the highest overall hedging score is given below:",
        "(7) In one study, Liquid facets was proposed to target Dl to an endocytic recycling compartment suggesting that recycling of Dl may be required for signaling.",
        "On the other hand, hedging is not strong in the following sentence, which is assigned an overall hedging score of 2:",
        "(8) There is no apparent need for cytochrome c release in C.elegans since CED-4 does not require it to activate CED-3.",
        "Below, we discuss some of the common error types we encountered.",
        "Our discussion is based on evaluation at hedging score threshold of 0, where existence of a hedging cue is sufficient to label a sentence speculative.",
        "Most of the false negatives produced by the system are due to syntactic patterns not addressed by our method.",
        "For instance, negation of \"unhedg-ers\" was used as a syntactic pattern; the pattern was able to recognize know as an \"unhedger\" in the following sentence, but not the negative quantifier (little), labeling the sentence as non-speculative.",
        "(9) Little was known however about the specific role of the roX RNAs during the formation of the DCC.",
        "In fact, Hyland (1998) notes \"negation in scientific research articles shows a preference for negative quantifiers (few, little) and lexical negation (rarely, overlook).\"",
        "However, we have not encountered this pattern while analyzing the training set and have not addressed it.",
        "Nevertheless, our approach lends itself to incremental development and adding such a pattern to our rulebase is relatively simple.",
        "Another type of false negative is caused by certain derivational forms of epistemic words.",
        "In the following example, the adjective suggestive is not recognized as a hedging trigger, even though its base form suggest is an epistemic verb.",
        "(10) Phenotypic differences are suggestive of distinct functions for some of these genes in regulating dendrite arborization.",
        "It seems that more sophisticated lexicon expansion rules can be employed to handle such cases.",
        "For example, WordNet's \"derivationally related form\" feature may be used as the basis of these expansion rules.",
        "Regarding false positives, most of them are due to word sense ambiguity concerning hedging cues.",
        "For instance, the modal auxiliary could is frequently used as a past tense form of can in scientific articles to express the role of enabling conditions and external constraints on the occurrence of the proposition rather than uncertainty or tentativeness regarding the proposition.",
        "Currently, our system is unable to recognize such cases.",
        "An example is given below:",
        "(10) Also we could not find any RAG-like sequences in the recently sequenced sea urchin lancelet hydra and sea anemone genomes, which encode RAG-like sequences.",
        "The context around the hedging cue seems to play a role in these cases.",
        "First person plural pronoun (we) and/or reference to objective enabling conditions seem to be a common characteristic among false positive cases of could.",
        "In other cases, such as appear, in the absence of strengthening syntactic cues (to, that), we lower the hedging score; however, depending on the threshold, this may not be sufficient to render the sentence non-speculative.",
        "Rather than lowering the score equally for all epistemic verbs, a more appropriate approach would be to consider verb senses separately (e.g., appear should be effectively unhedged without a strengthening cue, while suggest should only be weakened).",
        "Another type of false positives concern \"weak\" hedging cues, such as epistemic deductive verbs (conclude, estimate) as well as adverbs (essentially, usually) and nominalizations (implication, assumption).",
        "We have also seen a few instances, which seem speculative on the surface, but were labeled non-speculative.",
        "An example is given below:",
        "(11) Caspases can also be activated with the aid of Apaf-1, which in turn appears to be regulated by cytochrome c and dATP."

        "In this paper, we present preliminary experiments we conducted in recognizing speculative sentences.",

        "We also aim to refine the weighting scheme in a more principled way.",
        "While recognizing that a sentence is speculative is useful in and of itself, it seems more interesting and clearly much more challenging to identify speculative sentence fragments and the propositions that are being hedged.",
        "In the future, we will move in this direction with the goal of characterizing the semantics of speculative language."
