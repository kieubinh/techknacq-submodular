        "Expandability is supported through allowing a user of the NER tool to improve NER coverage by adding entries to the dictionary.",
        "In our approach, retraining is not required after dictionary enrichment.",
        "Recently, Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) have been successfully applied to sequence labelling problems, such as POS tagging and NER, and have outperformed other machine learning techniques.",
        "The main idea of CRFs is to estimate a conditional probability distribution over label sequences, rather than over local directed label sequences as with Hidden Markov Models (Baum and Petrie, 1966) and Maximum Entropy Markov Models (McCallum et al., 2000).",
        "Parameters of CRFs can be efficiently estimated through the log-likelihood parameter estimation using the forward-backward algorithm, a dynamic programming method.",
        "Experiments were conducted using the training and test sets of the JNLPBA-2004 data set(Kim et al., 2004).",
        "Training data The training data set used in JNLPBA-2004 is a set of tokenized sentences with manually annotated term class labels.",
        "The sentences are taken from the Genia corpus (version 3.02) (Kim et al., 2003), in which 2,000 abstracts were manually annotated by a biologist, drawing on a set of POS tags and 36 biomedical term classes.",
        "In the JNLPBA-2004 shared task, performance in extracting five term classes, i.e., protein, DNA, RNA, cell line, and cell type classes, were evaluated.",
        "Test Data The test data set used in JNLPBA-2004 is a set of tokenized sentences extracted from 404 separately collected MEDLINE abstracts, where the term class labels were manually assigned, following the annotation specification of the Genia corpus.",

        "Raw text is analyzed by a POS/PROTEIN tagger based on a CRF tagging model and dictionary, and then converted into token sequences.",
        "Strings in the text that match with protein names in the dictionary will be tagged as NN-PROTEIN depending on the context around the protein names.",
        "Since it is not realistic to enumerate all protein names in the dictionary, due to their high variability of form, instead previously unseen forms are predicted to be protein names by statistical sequential labelling.",
        "Finally, protein names are identified from the POS/PROTEIN tagged token sequences via a CRF labelling model.",
        "Figure 2 shows the block diagram of the training procedure for both POS/PROTEIN tagging and sequential labelling.",
        "The tagging model is created using the Genia corpus (version 3.02) and a dictionary.",
        "Using the tagging model, MEDLINE abstracts used for the JNLPBA-2004 training data set are then POS/PROTEIN-tagged.",
        "The output token sequences over these abstracts are then integrated with the correct protein labels of the JNLPBA-2004 training data.",
        "This process results in the preparation of token sequences with features and correct protein labels.",

        "This paper has demonstrated how to utilize known named entities to achieve better performance in statistical named entity recognition.",
        "We took a two-step approach where sentences are first tokenized and tagged based on a biomedical dictionary that consists of general English words and about 1.3 million protein names.",
        "Then, a statistical sequence labelling step predicted protein names that are not listed in the dictionary and, at the same time, reduced false negatives in the POS/PROTEIN tagging results.",
        "The significant benefit of this approach is that a user, not a system developer, can easily enhance the performance by augmenting the dictionary.",
        "This paper demonstrated that the state-of-the-art F-score 73.78 on the standard JNLPBA-2004 data set was achieved by our approach.",
        "Furthermore, thanks to the dictionary-based NER approach, the upper bound performance using ideal dictionary enrichment, without any retraining of the models, yielded F-score 78.72."
