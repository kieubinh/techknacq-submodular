        "Species Disambiguation for Biomedical Term Identiication",
        "Xinglong Wang and Michael Matthews",
        "An important task in information extraction (ie) from biomedical articles is term identification (ti), which concerns linking entity mentions (e.g., terms denoting proteins) in text to unambiguous identifiers in standard databases (e.g., RefSeq).",
        "Previous work on ti has focused on species-specific documents.",
        "However, biomedical documents, especially full-length articles, often talk about entities across a number of species, in which case resolving species ambiguity becomes an indispensable part of ti.",
        "This paper describes our rule-based and machine-learning based approaches to species disambiguation and demonstrates that performance of ti can be improved by over 20% if the correct species are known.",
        "We also show that using the species predicted by the automatic species taggers can improve ti by a large margin."

        "The exponential growth of the amount of scientific literature in the fields of biomedicine and genomics has made it increasingly difficult for scientists to keep up with the state of the art.",
        "The txm project (Alex et al., 2008a), a three-year project which aims to produce software tools to aid curation of biomedical papers, targets this problem and exploits natural language processing (NLP) technology in an attempt to automatically extract enriched protein-protein interactions (EPPI) and tissue expressions (TE) from biomedical text.",
        "A critical task in TXM is term identification (TI), the task of grounding mentions of biomedical named entities to identifiers in referent databases.",
        "Ti can be seen as an intermediate task that builds on the previous component in an information extraction (IE) pipeline, i.e., named entity recognition (NER), and provides crucial information as input to the more complex module of relation extraction (RE).",
        "The structure of the iE pipeline resembles a typical cu-ration process by human biologists.",
        "For example, when curating protein-protein interactions (PPIs), a curator would first mark up the protein mentions in text, and then identify the mentions by inding their unique identifiers from standard protein databases such as RefSeq, and finally curate pairs of IDs as PPIs.",
        "TI is a matching and disambiguation process (Wang and Matthews, 2008), and a primary source of ambiguity lies in the model organisms of the terms.",
        "In curation tasks, one often needs to deal with collections of articles that involve entities of a large variety of species.",
        "For example, our collection of articles from PubMed and PubMed Central involve over 100 model organisms.",
        "Also, it is often the case that more than one species appear in the same document, especially when the document is a full-length article.",
        "In our dataset, 74% of the articles concern more than one organism.",
        "In many standard databases, such as RefSeq and SwissProt, homolog proteins in different species, which often contain nearly identical synonym lists, are assigned distinct identiiers.",
        "This makes biomedical terms even more polysemous and hence species disambiguation becomes crucial to TI.",
        "For example, querying Ref-Seq with the protein mention plkl resulted in 98",
        "hits.",
        "By adding a species to the query, e.g. mouse, one can significantly reduce the number of results to two.",
        "This paper describes our work on the task of species disambiguation.",
        "We also report the performance gain of a ti system from integration of various automatic species taggers.",
        "The paper is organised as follows.",
        "Section 2 gives a brief overview of related work.",
        "Section 3 presents our methodologies for species disambiguation.",
        "Section 4 describes a rule-based ti system that we developed in the txm project, and the evaluation metrics.",
        "This section also reports the evaluation results of the ti system with and without help from the species predicted by the taggers.",
        "We finally conclude in Section 5."

        "The most relevant work to ours are the Gene Normalisation (gn) tasks (Morgan and Hirschman, 2007; Hirschman et al., 2004) in the BioCreAtlvE I & II workshops (Hirschman et al., 2007; Hirschman et al., 2005), which provided forums for exchanging thoughts and methodologies on tackling the task of ti.",
        "The data provided in the gn tasks, however, were species-specific, which means that the lexicons and datasets were concerned with single model organisms and thus species disambiguation was not required.",
        "A few participating systems, however, integrated a filter to rule out entities with erroneous species (Hanisch et al., 2005; Fluck et al., 2007), which were reported to be helpful.",
        "Another difference between our task and the BioCreAtIvE gn ones is that we carry out ti on entity level while gn on document level.",
        "It is worth mentioning that the protein-protein interaction task (ips) in BioCreAtIvE II has taken into account species ambiguity.",
        "The ips task resembles the work-flow of manual curation of ppis in articles involving multiple species, and to accomplish the task, one would require a full pipeline of ie systems, including named entity recognition, term identification and relation extraction.",
        "The best result for ips (Krallinger et al., 2007) was fairly low at 28.85% F1, which reflects the difficulty of the task.",
        "Some participants of ips have reported (e.g., Grover et al., 2007) that resolving species ambiguity was one of the biggest challenges.",
        "Our analysis of the ips training data revealed that the interacting proteins in this corpus belong to over 60 species, and only 56.27% of them are human.",
        "As noted in previous work (Krauthammer and Ne-nadic, 2004; Chen et al., 2005; Krallinger et al., 2007; Wang, 2007), determining the correct species for the protein mentions is a very important step towards ti.",
        "However, as far as we know, there has been little work in species disambiguation and in to what extent resolving species ambiguity can help ti."

        "We created two corpora in slightly different domains, eppi and te.",
        "The eppi corpus consists of 217 full-text papers selected from PubMed and PubMed Central and domain experts annotated all documents for both protein entities and ppis, as well as extra (enriched) information associated with the ppis and normalisations of the proteins to publicly available ontologies.",
        "The te corpus consists of 230 full-text papers, in which entities such as proteins, tissues, genes and mrnacdnas were identiied, and a new tissue expression relation was marked up.",
        "We used these corpora to develop a species tagging system.",
        "As the biomedical entities in the data were manually assigned with standard database identiiers, it was straightforward to obtain their species IDs through the mappings provided by En-trezGene and RefSeq.",
        "In more detail, proteins, protein complexes, genes and mrnacdnas in both eppi and te datasets were assigned with NCBI Taxonomy IDs (TaxIDs) denoting their species.",

        "The averaged F1 scores of species annotation on the doubly annotated EPPI and TE datasets are 86.45% and 95.11%, respectively, indicating that human annotators have high agreement when assigning species to biomedical entities.",

        "We have developed a rule-based program that detects species words, which were used to help the species identification systems described in the following sections.",
        "The species word tagger is a lexical lookup component which applies to tokenised text and marks content words such as human, murine and D. melanogaster with their corresponding species TaxIDs.",
        "In addition, rules written in an Ixtransduce grammar are used to identify species prefixes (e.g., 'h' for human, 'm' for mouse).",
        "For example, the term mSos-1 would be assigned with a TaxlD for mouse.",
        "Note that a species \"word\" may contain several words, for example, \"E. coli\".",
        "Please see (Wang and Grover, 2008) for more details on the species word tagger.",
        "It is intuitive that a species word that occurs near an entity (e.g., \"mousep53\") is a strong indicator of its species.",
        "To assess this intuition, we developed a set of five rules using heuristics and species words detected by the species word tagger.",
        "• PreWd: If the word preceding an entity is a species word, assign the species indicated by that word to the entity.",
        "• PreWd Sent: If a species word that occurs to the left of an entity and in the same sentence, assign the species indicated by that word to the entity.",
        "• Prefix: If an entity has a species-indicating prefix, e.g., mSos-1, then tag the species to that entity.",
        "• Spread: Spread the species of an entity e to all entities in the same document that have the same surface form with e. This rule must be used in conjunction with the other rules.",
        "• Majority Vote: Count the species words in a document and assign as a weight to each species the proportion of all species words in the document that refer to the species.",
        "Tag all entities in the document the species with the highest weight, defaulting to human in the case of a tie.",
        "Table 1 shows the results of species tagging when the above rules were applied.",
        "As we can see, the precision of the systems that rely solely on the previous species words or prefixes is very good but the recall is low.",
        "The system that looks at the previous species word in the same sentence does better as measured by F1 .",
        "In addition, spreading the species improves both systems but the overall results are still not satisfactory.",
        "It is slightly counter-intuitive that using a rule such as 'PreWd' did not achieve perfect precision.",

        "As shown in Table 6, except on human, the txm model yielded very disappointing results, whereas the BC model did well overall.",
        "This was because the txm model was trained on a dataset where fly and yeast entities occur rarely with only 2% and 5% of the training instances belonging to these species, respectively, which again revealed the influence of the bias introduced in the training material to the ml models.",

        "One possible reason that the 'Majority Vote' tagger yielded reasonably good result on the BioCre-AtIvE dataset, but unsatisfactory result on the txm datasets was due to the difference in document length in the two corpora: the BioCreAtIvE corpus is comprised of abstracts and the txm corpora consist of only full-length articles.",
        "In abstracts, authors are inclined to only talk about the main biomedical entities described in the paper, whereas in full articles, they tend to describe a larger number of entities, possibly in multiple species, for the purposes of describing related work or comparison.",
