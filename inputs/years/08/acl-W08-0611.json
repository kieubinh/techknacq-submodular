        "At this point there is no specific collection for the biomedical domain in SemEval, but a test collection for WSD in biomedicine was developed by Wee-beret al.",
        "(2001), and has been used as a benchmark by many independent groups.",

        "50 ambiguous terms which occur frequently in MEDLINE were chosen for inclusion in the test set.",

        "The terms which form these various subsets are shown in Figure 1.",
        "The 50 terms which form the NLM-WSD data set represent a range of challenges for WSD systems.",
        "The Most Frequent Sense (MFS) heuristic has become a standard baseline in WSD (McCarthy et al., 2004) and is simply the accuracy which would be obtained by assigning the most common meaning of a term to all of its instances in a corpus.",
        "Despite its simplicity, the MFS heuristic is a hard baseline to beat, particularly for unsupervised systems, because it uses hand-tagged data to determine which sense is the most frequent.",
        "Analysis of the NLM-WSD data set showed that the MFS over all 50 ambiguous terms is 78%.",
        "The different subsets have lower MFS, indicating that the terms they contain are more difficult to disambiguate.",

        "This feature set has been adapted for the disambiguation of biomedical text by adding further linguistic features and two different types of domain-specific features: CUIs (as used by (McInnes et al., 2007)) and Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms.",
        "Our feature set contains a number of parameters which were set empirically (e.g. threshold for unigram frequency in the linguistic features).",

        "Linguistic features: The system uses a wide range of domain-independent features which are commonly used for WSD.",
        "• Local collocations: A total of 41 features which extensively describe the context of the ambiguous word and fall into two main types: (1) bigrams and trigrams containing the ambiguous word constructed from lemmas, word forms or PoS tags and (2) preceding/following lemma/word-form of the content words (adjective, adverb, noun and verb) in the same sentence with the target word.",
        "For example, consider the sentence below with the target word adjustment.",
