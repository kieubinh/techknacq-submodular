        "The need for automatic tools to assist human indexers in this task is growing with the increasing number of publications in MEDLINE.",
        "The Medical Text Indexer (mti) (Aronson et al., 2004) has been available at the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM) since 2002 to provide indexers with MeSH main heading recommendations (e.g. Aphasia, Patient Care...) when they create MEDLINE citations.",
        "This paper describes a method to enhance MTI with the capacity to attach appropriate MeSH subheadings (e.g. metabolism, pharmacology) to these main headings in order to provide MeSH pair recommendations (e.g. aphasia/metabolism), which are more specific and therefore a significant asset to NLM indexers.",
        "Subheading attachment can be accomplished using indexing rules such as:",
        "If a main heading from the \"Anatomy\" tree and a \"Carboxylic Acids\" term are recommended for indexing, then the pair \"[Carboxylic Acids]/pharmacology\" should also be recommended.",
        "Sets of manual rules developed for a few subheadings show good precision but low recall.",
        "The development of new rules is a complex, time-consuming task.",
        "We investigate a novel approach adapting Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) to the context of MEDLINE, which requires efficient processing of large amounts of data."

        "ILP is a supervised machine learning technique used to infer rules that are expressed with logical clauses (Prolog clauses) based on a set of examples also represented using Prolog.",
        "A comprehensive description of ILP can be found in (Muggleton and Raedt, 1994).",
        "We selected this method because it is able to provide simple representations for relational problems and produces rules that can be easily interpreted.",
        "One caveat to the use of ILP is the complexity of rule inference from large sets of positive and negative examples.",
        "Considering each of the 24,000 MeSH main headings independently would not be computationally feasible.",
        "For this reason, based on work by Buntine (1988) we introduce a new definition of subsumption that allows us to go through the set of examples efficiently by exploiting hierarchical relationships between main headings.",
        "This type of subsumption is in fact suitable for any rule inference problem involving structured knowledge encoded by ontologies."

        "In spite of this, the performance obtained by ILP rules is superior to the baseline and shows the best F-measure.",
        "The precision obtained by the manual rules, when they exist, is higher, but they produce a recall inferior to ILP and even to the baseline method.",
        "ILP vs. manual rules.",
        "A detailed analysis of the rules obtained shows that not all ILP rules are easily understood by indexers.",
        "This is due to some unexpected regularities which do not seem to be relevant but nonetheless achieved good results on the training data used to infer rules.",
        "Furthermore, we noticed that while most rules typically contain a \"trigger term\" (e.g. Anatomy in our previous example) and a \"target term\" (e.g. Carboxylic Acids above), in some ILP rules the target term can also serve as the trigger term.",
        "Some changes in the ILP inferring process are foreseen in order to prevent the production of such rules.",
        "Rule filtering vs. manual review.",
        "Preliminary experiments with producing ILP rules suggested that improvement could be achieved by 1/ filtering out rules that showed a comparatively low precision on the training corpus when applied to main headings retrieved by mti; and 2/ by having an indexing expert review the rules to improve their readability.",
        "On most subheadings, filtering had little impact but generally tended to improve precision while F-measure stayed the same, which was our goal.",
        "The manual review of the rules seemed to degrade the performance obtained with the original ILP."
