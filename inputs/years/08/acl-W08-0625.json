        "Pinar Oezden Wennerberg, Sonja Zillner",
        "Through advanced technologies in clinical care and research, especially the rapid progress in imaging technologies, more and more medical imaging data and patient text data is generated by hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, and medical research.",
        "For enabling advanced access to clinical imaging and text data, it is relevant to know what kind of knowledge the clinician wants to know or the queries that clinicians are interested in.",
        "Through intensive interviews and discussions with radiologists and clinicians, we have learned that medical imaging data is analyzed - and hence queried - from three different perspectives, i.e. the anatomic perspective addressing the involved body parts, the radiology-specific spatial perspective describing the relationships of located anatomical regions to other anatomical parts, and the disease perspective distinguishing between normal and abnormal imaging features.",
        "Our aim is to establish query patterns reflecting those three perspectives that would typically be used by clinicians and radiologists to find patient-specific sets of relevant images.",
        "The context of our work is in the Theseus-MEDICO project on cross-modal image and information retrieval in the medical domain.",
        "The focus of the work reported here is on setting up Wikipedia-based corpora of human anatomy and radiology and on obtaining a statistical profile of concepts from three semantic knowledge resources with these corpora: the Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA), the radiology lexicon RadLex, and a subset of the international classification of disease codes ICD-9 CM.",
        "Using this information, we intend to extract relations that are likely to occur between statistically relevant terms and the concepts they express.",
        "The final goal of our work is to derive potential query patterns from the extracted set of relations that can be used in the MEDICO semantic-based image retrieval application.",
        "For example when re-staging head and neck lymphoma, clinicians and radiologists look for information and images that report on essential radiological patterns as \"an enlargement in the dimension of the lymph node in the neck\".",
        "Therefore, within our approach, we aim at establishing hypotheses about possible user queries, i.e. the query patterns that reflect the three perspectives discussed above.",
        "Accordingly, an example query pattern might look like this: [ANATOMICAL STRUCTURE] [[RADIOLOGY] IMAGE]Modality] [[RADIOLOGY IMAGE]Modality] located_in [ANATOMICAL STRUCTURE] AND is_about shows_ symptom [DISEASE SYMPTOM] http://theseus-programm.de/scenarios/en/medico Once an initial set of similar patterns has been established in this way, they will be evaluated by clinicians for their validity and relevance."

        "A central aspect of the query pattern mining task is the statistical analysis of the FMA and RadLex terms in relevant text collections.",
        "In this way relevance scores can be assigned to terms that allow to investigate the most likely expressed (and hence queried) relations between them.",
        "For this purpose we need access to a representative corpus of texts that at the same time reflects the joint view of anatomy, spatial aspects of radiology and disease that we are targeting.",
        "Patient records would be our first choice, but due to strict anonymization requirements these are difficult to obtain.",
        "We therefore constructed a corpus based on the Wikipedia Categories Anatomy and Radiology.",
        "We then ran all text sections of each corpus through a part-of-speech tagger (Brants, 2000) to extract all nouns in the corpus and to compute a relevance score (chi-square) for each by comparing anatomy and radiology frequencies with those in the British National Corpus.",
        "A next step will be to parse and annotate sentences with predicate-structure information, which may then be used for relation extraction along the lines of (Schutz and Buitelaar, 2005)."

      "heading": "3. FMA Terms",
      "text": [
        "The statistically most relevant FMA terms were identified on the basis of chi-square scores computed for nouns in each corpus.",
        "Single word terms in the FMA and occurring in the corpus correspond directly to the noun that the term is build up of (e.g. the noun 'ear' corresponds to the FMA term ear).",
        "In this case, the statistical relevance of the term is the chi-square score of the corresponding noun.",
        "In the case of multi-word terms occurring in the corpus, the statistical relevance is computed on the basis of the chi-square score for each constituting noun and/or adjective in the term, summed and normalized over the length of the term.",
        "Thus, the relevance value for lymph node is the summation of chi-square scores for 'lymph' and 'node' divided by 2.",
        "In order to take frequency in account, we further multiplied the summed relevance value by the frequency of the term.",
        "This assures that only frequently occurring terms are judged as relevant."
