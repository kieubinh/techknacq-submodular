        "We tried to annotate field values for the biomedical data, but we found few intuitive clues that rich surface text patterns could be learned with this corpus.",
        "This insight, Feedback F1, caused us to give up the idea of learning surface text patterns as usual, and switch to the Conditional Random Fields (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001) for labeling sentences instead.",
