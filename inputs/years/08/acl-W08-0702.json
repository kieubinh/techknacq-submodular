        "The basic tenet of Evolutionary Phonology is that the observed universal commonalities in phonological systems of the world arise from the universal commonality of the way listeners and speakers produce and perceive sound structures (Blevins, 2004).",
        "Diachronic processes operating via the transmission of the speech signal act without regard for the subsequent system they create.",
        "Alternate theories in the tradition of Chomsky argue for universal prohibitions which would serve to ban or repair certain changes just in case they would result in a 'disallowed' system (Kiparsky 2004, 2006).",
        "In Optimality Theoretic terms, this would be a grammar that violates the canonical set of universal markedness constraints.",
        "I will call this claim the Universal-Grammar-Delimited Hypothesis Space (UG-Delimited HH) Principle.",
        "Without this check, Kiparsky argues, common and natural sound changes ('blind' Evolutionary Phonology) would frequently produce unnatural and in fact unobserved 'anti-markedness' languages (such as a system in which lower sonority vowels were stressed in preference to higher sonority vowels).",
        "An analysis of the properties of possible grammars is an analysis that involves explicitly characterizing the properties of the learner, as well as of the data to which the learner is exposed.",
        "The work in this paper is, to my knowledge, the first attempt to do exactly this kind of analysis, for exactly the type of scenario in which a dispreferred, but hypothetically learnable, grammar might arise.",
        "Diachronic changes that are caused by factors outside of the grammar have the capability of disrupting a categorical rule system, introducing irregularities into a previously regular pattern.",
        "These irregularities may have an 'unnatural' or anti-markedness character, but typically, they will coexist alongside remnants of the prior natural pattern.",
        "That is the first observation.",
        "The second is that if learners are allowed to adopt mixed-grammar hypotheses ('co-phonologies' (Inkelas 1997), 'stratal faithfulness' (Ito and Mester 2001), 'lexical indexation' (Pater 2000)), then under a posterior-maximizing learning model, these hybrid systems are the most likely outcome (rather than a categorical 'anti-markedness' grammar).",
        "I will work through a case study of sonority sensitive stress, paying special attention to the lexicon that would be produced after a hypothetical sound change of the type Kiparsky proposes.",
        "By examining the output of Bayesian hypothesis testing in this domain I will conclude that for the pure anti-markedness grammar to arise, not only is a certain type of diachronic change necessary, but also a certain type of non-uniform lexical distribution.",
        "To first approximation, this confluence of circumstances appears rather rare, leading me to tentatively reject the hypothesis that categorical bans on allowed grammars are necessary to explain the distribution of the world's languages."

        "Each grammar in this view is equally complex, but certain weight combinations may be more likely than others (such as the 'simple' 0/100% distribution over weights).",
        "Conceptually this seems at least as reasonable as the current approach.",
        "We are still left, however, with the problem of determining the prior probability distribution over the weights, in a manner which, ideally, would be independent of the problem at hand.",
        "to be in a state in which higher sonority vowels attract stress (due to assumed perceptual factors), the hypothetical sound change that disrupts the natural order must act over forms that are originally markedness-abiding.",
        "Thus, there will be a residue of those forms in the language even after the change has occurred (those in which /a/'s not derived from /a/'s fail to attract stress in the presence of mid-sonority vowels).",
        "If this residue is small enough then the anti-markedness hypothesis might emerge as the winner.",
        "In turn, for this residue to be small, the lexicon before the change must exhibit a certain make-up, such that some word types either fail to appear or occur with much lower frequency than others.",
        "In order to approximate these conditions I created 1000 (x5) simulated lexicons by sampling (without replacement) from the uniform word inventory (Lmu) at five different rates; for 3-syllable words: 1% (=5 types), 3% (=15 types), 5% (=26 types), 7% (=36 types), and 10% (=51 types).",
        "Higher sampling rates meant a greater likelihood of reproducing the underlying uniform type distribution over the 1000 trials, while lower sampling rates (under-sampling) allowed for a higher likelihood of departure from uniformity, and a greater chance for skewed, or outlier, lexicons to emerge.",
        "These simulations were done for the full set of both 3-syllable and 2-syllable words (a more realistic distribution of input to the learner).",
        "To combine the two word lengths, with differing numbers of types, I scaled selection from the two classes.",
        "A cursory examination of the online English database CELEX (1993) gives a count of 45,652 for 3-syllable words, and 61,738 for 2-syllable words, a 1:1.4 relationship.",
        "Using this as a rough guide, and since the ratio of total types between 3-syllable and 2-syllable words is 512:64, a 1:10 scale was used (giving a proportion of 512:640=1:1.25).",
        "Each of the five sampling rates maintained this 1:10 scaling factor, such that the lexicon containing 3-syllable word types sampled at 7%, also contained 2-syllable word types sampled at 70%; this is the lexicon of 36 3-syllable word types (out of a possible total of 512) and 45 2-syllable word types (out of a possible total of 64) (Row 5: [36,45] in Table2).",
        "Each lexicon, L, at a particular sampling rate, was transformed to its L counterpart (via the change a>a), and the coverage ratio between hypotheses Gujarati* and Gujarati over L was computed.",
        "As given at the end of Section 3.4 for the description-length prior, a value greater than G*/G = 8 is needed for a Gujarati* outcome.",
        "Here, due to concerns about the sensitivity of the Bayesian learner, and the degree of uncertainty in the calculation of the prior, I relax this criterion.",
        "The last four columns of Table 2 correspond to four (largely arbitrary) values for the G*/G ratio which were stipulated as thresholds (or possible prior probability ratios) that would allow Gu-jarati* to beat Max(G*/G)°.",
        "Each cell contains the percentage of anti-markedness outcomes (calculated from 1000 runs) for a given threshold, at a given sampling rate.",
        "Table 2: Estimated probabilities of learned anti-markedness grammar: under 5 different sampling rates (given as [number of 3-syllable,2-syllable word types]), for four different threshold coverage ratios.",
        "The very low occurrence rates of Table 2 show that changing our assumptions about the make-up of the lexicon (departing from uniformity) do not qualitatively alter the results of the previous sections.",
        "A pure anti-markedness grammar (Gu-jarati*) seems to be a relatively rare outcome as compared to a mixed-grammar competitor (Max(G*/G)°), even under relaxed acceptance criteria.",
        "The above work relies heavily on the existence of a residue of natural patterns in a post-sound change language.",
        "Under circumstances in which sound change is non-neutralizing (that is, a is absent from the inventory of Gujarati before the sound change), there will be no contradictory evidence to the learner of Gujarati': all data is consistent with the Gujarati* hypothesis.",
        "Furthermore, there is a long-standing intuition in the literature that the most likely sound changes might actually be of this type (Martinet 1955).",

        "Under these circumstances we might expect Gujarati* to emerge as the clear winner.",
        "This will depend critically on whether or not we consider the lack of conflicting data to be an overwhelming factor in hypothesis selection.",
        "If, instead, we maintain our space of non-deterministic hypotheses, then there is still competition from the mixed-grammar alternatives.",
        "Under the non-neutralizing scenario, Gujarati has 7 vowels (rather than 8); for 3-syllable words, all 343 types support the Gujarati*\" hypothesis, while 265 are also consistent with Penult\".",
        "And G*/P = 1.3.",
        "2-syllable words will provide somewhat less of an advantage to the anti-markedness grammar (49:46~1.13), and with a larger weight (10 times greater frequency to approximate the CELEX ratios), giving an adjusted ratio of roughly 1.15.",
        "Whether this is enough of an advantage to cause Gujarati* to be selected will depend on the parameters of our learner, as well as the prior probability ratio between the two hypotheses: the difference in complexity between the Gujarati* rule, which computes stress location based on both position and sonority, and the Penult rule, which only computes over position.",
        "What the above discussion illustrates is that the actual form of common or likely sound changes can significantly alter the outcome of analysis.",
        "If non-neutralizing sound changes are the norm, then the dispreferred grammar might have a higher predicted likelihood than that calculated here.",
        "Alternatively, if chain shifts predominate, whereby all the vowels in the system undergo related incremental changes in quality, the outcome might be different again.",
        "And if realistic sound changes operate on a word by word basis, as predicted by Evolutionary Phonology, such that results are even less consistent in terms of sonority class, an even lower likelihood for a true anti-markedness grammar might be the result.",
        "This work has been a preliminary attempt to accurately lay out the methodological requirements for addressing questions of how grammars arise.",
        "Further research ought to be concerned with exactly the complications to the question just raised.",
        "For present purposes, however, there are two general points to be made.",
        "The first is that, in order to determine what any theory predicts in this domain, one has to make assumptions about what constitutes a realistic language learner, as well as establish estimates of the normal state of lexical statistics.",
        "The second point is that determining those predictions tells us what the relevant typological facts are.",
        "The work here suggests that it is the occurrence, not so much of pure anti-markedness systems, but of partial anti-markedness (mixed-grammar) systems that is the critical issue.",
        "It may turn out to be the case that these systems are also very rare, and the over-prediction claim holds in its revised form.",
        "However, the true distribution of these types of languages seems far from clear at the present time, and work will have to be done to establish the fact of the matter."
