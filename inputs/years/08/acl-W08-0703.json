        "Sound changes in natural language, such as stem variation in inflected forms, can be described as phonological processes.",
        "These are governed by a constraint hierarchy as in Optimality Theory (OT), or by a set of ordered rules.",
        "Both rely on a single lexical representation of each morpheme (i.e., its underlying form), and context-sensitive transformations to surface forms.",
        "Phonological changes often affect segments near morpheme boundaries, but can also apply over an entire prosodic word, as in vowel harmony.",
        "It does not seem straightforward to incorporate context into a Bayesian model of phonology, although a clever solution may yet be found.",
        "A standard way of incorporating conditioning environments is to treat them as factors in a Gibbs model (Liang and Klein, 2007), but such models require an explicit calculation of the partition function.",
        "Unless the rule contexts possess some kind of locality, we don't know how to compute this partition function efficiently.",
        "Some context could be captured by generating underlying phonemes from an n-gram model, or by annotating surface forms with neighborhood features.",
        "However, the effects of autosegmental phonology and other long-range dependencies (like vowel harmony) cannot be easily Bayesianized.",
        "In the last decade, finite-state approaches to phonology (Gildea and Jurafsky, 1996; Beesley and Kart-tunen, 2000) have effectively brought theoretical linguistic work on rewrite rules into the computational realm.",
        "A finite-state approximation of optimality theory (Karttunen, 1998) was later refined into a compact treatment of gradient constraints (Gerdemann and van Noord, 2000).",
        "Recent work on Bayesian models of morphological segmentation (Johnson et al., 2007) could be combined with phonological rule induction (Gold-water and Johnson, 2004) in a variety of ways, some of which will be explored in our discussion of future work.",
        "Also, the Hierarchical Bayes Compiler (Daumé III, 2007) could be used to generate a model similar to the one presented here, but less constrained which makes correspondingly more random, less accurate predictions.",
        "As we describe the model and its implementation in this and subsequent sections, we will refer to a sam-",
        "'Recent updates to HBC, inspired by discussions with the author, have addressed some of these limitations.",
        "ple dataset (in Figure 1), consisting of a paradigmof verb stems and person/number suffixes.",
        "The head of each row or column is an /underlying/ form, which in 3rd person singular is a phonologically null segment (represented as /0/).",
        "In [surface] forms, the realization of each morpheme is affected by phonological processes.",
        "For example, in the combination of /tieta/ + /vat/, the result is [tieta+vat], where the 3rd person plural /a/ becomes [a] due to vowel harmony.",
        "As a baseline model, we select the most frequently occurring allophone as the underlying form.",
        "Our goal is to outperform this baseline using a Bayesian model.",
        "In other words, what patterns in phonological processes can be inferred with such a statistical model?",
        "This simple framework begins learning with the assumption that the underlying forms are faithful to the surface (i.e., without considering markedness or phonotactics).",
        "We model the generation of surface forms from underlying ones on the segmental (character) level.",
        "Input is an inflectional paradigm, with tokens of the form stem+suffix.",
        "Morphology is limited to a single suffix (no agglutination), and is already identified.",
        "Each character of an underlying stem or suffix (ui) generates surface characters (sij) in an entire row or column of the input.",
        "To capture the phonology of a variety of languages with a single model, we need constraints from linguistically plausible priors (universal grammar).",
        "We prefer that underlying characters be preserved in surface forms, especially when there is no alternation.",
        "It is also reasonable that there be fewer underlying forms (phonemes) than surface forms (phones, phonetic inventory), to account for allophones.",
        "We expect to be able to capture a significant subset of phonological processes using a simple model (only faithfulness constraints).",
        "Our model has an advantage over the baseline in its preference for \"purity\" in underlying forms.",
        "Each underlying segment should generate as few distinct surface segments as possible: if it generates non-alternating (identical) segments, it will be less likely to generate an alternation in addition.",
        "This means that when two segments alternate, the underlying form should be the one that appears less frequently in other contexts, irrespective of the majority within the alternation.",
        "In the first stem of our Finnish verb conjugation (Figure 1), we see a [t,d] alternation (a case of consonant gradation), as well as unalternating [t].",
        "If we isolate three of the surface forms where /tieta/ is inflected (1st person singular, and 3rd person singular and plural), and consider only the dental segments in the stem of each, we have two underlying segments.",
        "Here, we use question marks to indicate unknown underlying segments.",
        "In this subset of the data, the reasonable candidate underlying forms are /t/ and /d/.",
        "These two compete to explain the observed data (surface forms).",
        "The nature of the prior probability distribution determines whether the majority is hypothesized for each underlying form, so /t/ produces both alternating and unal-ternating surface segments, or /d/ is hypothesized as the source of the alternation (and /t/ remains \"pure\").",
        "In a Bayesian setting, we impose a sparse prior over underlying forms conditioned on the surface forms they generate.",
        "If u2 is hypothesized to be /t/, the posterior probability of ui being /t/ goes down:",
        "The probability of ui being the competitor, /d/, correspondingly increases:",
        "Even though the majority in this case would be /t/, the favored candidate for the alternating form was /d/.",
        "This happened because of how we defined the model's prior, in combination with the evidence that /t/ (assigned to u2) generated the sequence of [t].",
        "So selection bias prefers /d/ as the source of an ambiguous segment, leaving /t/ to always generate itself.",
        "A similar effect can occur if there are both unal-ternating [t]'s and [d]'s on the surface, in addition to the [t,d] alternation.",
        "The candidate (/t/ or /d/) that is",
        "Figure 1: Sample dataset (constructed by hand): Finnish verbs, with inflection for person and number.",
        "generating fewer unalternating segments is preferred to explain the alternation.",
        "For example, if there were 1000 cases of [t], 500 [d] and 500 [t,d], we would expect the following hypotheses: /t/ – [t], /d/ – [d] and /d/ – [t,d].",
        "This is because one of the two candidates must be responsible for both unalternating and alternating segments, but we prefer to have as much \"'purity\" as possible, to minimize ambiguity.",
        "With this solution, we still have 1000 pure /t/ – [t], and only the 500 /d/ – [d] are now indistinct from /d/ – [t,d].",
        "If we had selected /t/ as the source of the alternation, there would be only 500 remaining \"pure\" (/d/) segments, and 1500 ambiguous /t/.",
        "Our Bayesian model should prefer the less ambiguous (\"purer\") solution, given an appropriate prior."

        "As discussed above, the present model should be applicable to analysis of language-learners' speech errors, and this connection should be explored in greater depth.",
        "It might be interesting to predispose the sampler to select underlying forms from open syllables.",
        "That is, set a to increase the probability of matching one of the surface segments if its context (feature annotations) includes a vocalic segment or a word boundary immediately following.",
        "The probability of phonological processes like assimilation could be similarly modeled, with the prior higher for choosing a segment that appears on the surface in a contrastive context (where it shares few features with neighboring segments).",
        "If we define a MaxEnt distribution over Optimality Theoretic constraints, we might use that to inform our selection of underlying forms.",
