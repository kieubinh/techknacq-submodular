        "The Maori passive is perhaps the most famous problem in Polynesian linguistics.",
        "It has received attention from Williams (1971, first published in 1844), Biggs (1961), Hohepa (1967), Hale (1968; 1973; 1991), Kiparsky (1971), Kaye (1975), Kenstowicz and Kisseberth (1979), McCarthy (1981), Moorfield (1988), Sanders (1990; 1991), Harlow (1991; 2001; 2007), Bauer (1993), Blevins (1994), Kibre (1998), de Lacy (2004), and Boyce (2006).",
        "Some representative examples of active and passive verbs are given in Table 1 (Ryan, 1989).",
        "Two types of analysis have been proposed for these data (Hale, 1968).",
        "These are known as the 'morphological' and 'phonological' analyses.",
        "For the subset of passives with thematic consonants, the analyses parse the data differently into stems and suffixes.",
        "To illustrate this, the examples from Table 1 have been parsed in Table 2 with hyphens inserted between the stems and suffixes.",
        "The thematic consonants have also been flagged.",
        "In both types of analysis, the qualities of the thematic consonants are assumed to be unpredictable and are therefore lexicalized.",
        "To cite just one example, Blevins writes that \"a consonant of unpredictable quality appears in the passive and gerundial forms, but this consonant is absent when the verb occurs unsuffixed\" (Blevins, 1994, p. 29, my emphasis).",
        "In the phonological analysis, the thematic consonants are lexicalized with the rest of the stem.",
        "The active forms are derived by a rule that deletes stem-final consonants.",
        "Although less obvious, the morphological analysis also lexicalizes the thematic consonants by allowing stems to be stored with 'diacritic features'.",

        "is to constrain the free combination of stems and suffixes, which, if unconstrained, would over-generate unattested passive forms.",
        "As an illustration, if we assume the exhaustive association of /inu/ with the diacritic feature [+m], then the stem would be allowed to combine with /-mia/, but not with any other suffixes.",
        "(In short, to store the diacritic feature is to lexicalize the quality of the thematic consonant.)",
        "Although lack of a diacritic feature is allowed for stems that take 'default' suffixes (/-tia/, /-ia/, or /-a/, depending on stem's size and composition), this would only be one thematic consonant (out of six) that would not be lexicalized; the phonological analysis could still be seen as lexicalizing the majority of the thematic consonants.",
        "Furthermore, a case could be made that the contrastive absence of a [+t] diacritic feature effectively lexicalizes /-tia/, too.",
        "Finally, it is worth noting that the purpose ofthe default suffixes is to provide analyses for previously unseen stems, such as nonce words or borrowings; in other words, the purpose of defaults is not to make /-tia/ non-lexical.",
        "In this paper, I want to question the assumption that thematic consonants are unpredictable in Maori passives.",
        "To do so, I will focus on the phonotac-tic probabilities of active verbs as predictive of their passive and gerundial forms.",
        "I implemented the analysis as an artificial neural network, which I describe below.",
        "This follows from a rich tradition of using neural networks in phonology and morphology, as exemplified by the English past tense models of Rumelhart and McClelland (1987) and Plunkett and Marchman (1991).",
        "Incidentally, I chose neural networks to implement my analysis because of their computational properties, not because of an argument for the biological plausibility of my analysis.",
        "I suspect that similar results could have been obtained from another statistical formalism, like the k-nearest neighbor approach of TiMBL (Daelemans and van den Bosch, 2005).",

        "None of the active verbs in the passive dataset required more than 6 syllables in any of the coding schemes.",
        "Since there were 10 passive categories in my dataset (corresponding to the passive suffixes in the morphological analysis, illustrated in Figure 2), 10 output units were employed in the network.",
        "It was considered appropriate to model membership to each category independently, as many verbs show multiple passive forms (as /motu/ 'to separate, wound' does in its passive forms /motu-hia/ and /motu-kia/).",
        "The key to reading the model's passive output can be given as the vector [/-hia/, /-kia/, /-mia/, /-gia/, /-ria/, /-tia/, /-ia/, /-ina/, /-na/, /-a/].",

        "Although there are fewer gerund suffixes than passive suffixes, there is a well-known parallel between the existing gerund suffixes and the subset of passive suffixes with thematic consonants.",
        "Consider the vector [/-haga/, /-kaga/, /-maga/, /-ga/, /-raga/, /-taga/, /-aga/, N/A, N/A, N/A], which can be used as the key for interpreting gerund outputs in the network.",

        "Since these stimuli had already been randomly split into 80%-10%-10% subsets to estimate the number of hidden units in the network, I started by reusing this split.",
        "The 10% used as a test set for the hidden units task were then lumped back into the training set, resulting in arandom 90%-10% split (i.e., 418 training patterns and 46 test patterns).",

        "The results are summarized numerically in Table 10 and graphically in Figure 3.",

        "So, of the 15 relevant test cases, the null hypothesis would have guessed 23.44% correct (i.e., x 100); I adjusted the calculation of the null hypothesis here to reflect the focus on just 6 of the 10 output patterns (i.e., the ones with thematic consonants).",

        "So, the network correctly predicted 23.23% more of the thematic consonant patterns than chance.",
        "This suggests that lexicalization is not the only way to address thematic consonants in Maori.",
        "Since the problem can be specified in terms of active and passive verbs (rather than in terms of stems and suffixes), this also suggests that the Maori passive need not be framed in terms of the 'morphological' and 'phonological' analyses of Hale (1968).",
