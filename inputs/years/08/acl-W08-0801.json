        "People have access to large libraries of digital content both in their living rooms and on their mobile devices.",
        "Digital video recorders (DVRs) allow people to record TV programs from hundreds of channels for subsequent viewing at home – or, increasingly, on their mobile devices.",
        "Similarly, having accumulated vast libraries of digital music, people yearn for an easy way to sift through them from the comfort of their couches, in their cars, and on the go.",
        "Mobile devices are already central to accessing digital media libraries while users are away from home: people listen to music or watch video recordings.",
        "Mobile devices also play an increasingly important role in managing digital media libraries.",
        "For instance, a web-enabled mobile phone can be used to remotely schedule TV recordings through a web site or via a custom application.",
        "Such management tasks often prove cumbersome, however, as it is challenging to browse through listings for hundreds of TV channels on a small display.",
        "Indeed, even on a large screen in the living room, browsing alphabetically, or by time and channel, for a particular show using the remote control quickly becomes unwieldy.",
        "Speech and multimodal interfaces provide a natural means of addressing many of these challenges.",
        "It is effortless for people to say the name of a program, for instance, in order to search for existing recordings.",
        "Moreover, such a speech browsing capability is useful both in the living room and away from home.",
        "Thus, a natural way to provide speech-based control of a media library is through the user's mobile device itself.",
        "In this paper we describe just such a prototype system.",
        "A mobile phone plays a central role in providing a multimodal, natural language interface to both a digital video recorder and a music library.",
        "Users can interact with the system – presented as a dynamic web page on the mobile browser – using the navigation keys, the stylus, or spoken natural language.",
        "In front of the TV, a much richer GUI is also available, along with support for playing video recordings and music.",
        "In the prototype described herein, the mobile device serves as the locus of natural language interaction, whether a user is in the living room or walking down the street.",
        "Since these environments may be very different in terms of computational resources and network bandwidth, it is important that the architecture allows for multiple configurations in terms of the location of the natural language processing components.",
        "For instance, when a device is connected to a Wi-Fi network at home, recognition latency may be reduced by performing speech and natural language processing on the home media server.",
        "Moreover, a powerful server may enable more sophisticated processing techniques, such as multipass speech recognition (Hetherington, 2005; Chung et al., 2004), for improved accuracy.",
        "In situations with reduced network connectivity, latency may be improved by performing speech recognition and natural language processing tasks on the mobile device itself.",
        "Given resource constraints, however, less detailed acoustic and language models may be required.",
        "We have developed just such a flexible architecture, with many of the natural language processing components able to run on either a server or the mobile device itself.",
        "Regardless of the configuration, a consistent user experience is maintained."

        "Various academic researchers and commercial businesses have demonstrated speech-enabled interfaces to entertainment centers.",

        "Much commercial work, for example (Fujita et al., 2003), tends to focus on constrained grammar systems, where speech input is limited to a small set of templates corresponding to menu choices.",
        "(Berglund and Johansson, 2004) present a remote-control based speech interface for navigating an existing interactive television on-screen menu, though experimenters manually transcribed user utterances as they spoke instead of using a speech recognizer.",
        "(Oh et al., 2007) present a dialogue system for TV control that makes use of concept spotting and statistical dialogue management to understand queries.",
        "A version of their system can run independently on low-resource devices such as PDAs; however, it has a smaller vocabulary and supports a limited set of user utterance templates.",
        "Finally, (Wittenburg et al., 2006) look mainly at the problem of searching for television programs using speech, an on-screen display, and a remote control.",
        "They explore a Speech-In List-Out interface to searching for episodes of television programs.",
        "(Portele et al., 2003) depart from the model of adding a speech interface component to an existing on-screen menu.",
        "Instead, they a create a tablet PC interface to an electronic program guide, though they do not use the television display as well.",
        "Users may search an electronic program guide using constraints such as date, time, and genre; however, they can't search by title.",
        "Users can also perform typical remote-control tasks like turning the television on and off, and changing the channel.",
        "(Johnston et al., 2007) also use a tablet PC to provide an interface to television content – in this case a database of movies.",
        "The search can be constrained by attributes such as title, director, or starring actors.",
        "The tablet PC pen can be used to handwrite queries and to point at items (such as actor names) while the user speaks.",
        "We were also inspired by previous prototypes in which mobile devices have been used in conjunction with larger, shared displays.",
        "For instance, (Paek et al., 2004) demonstrate a framework for building such applications.",
        "The prototype we demonstrate here fits into their \"Jukebox\" model of interaction.",
        "Interactive workspaces, such as the one described in (Johanson et al., 2002), also demonstrate the utility of integrating mobile and large screen displays.",
        "Our prototype is a departure from these systems, however, in that it provides for spoken interactions.",
        "Finally, there is related work in the use of mobile devices for various kinds of search.",
        "For instance, offerings from Microsoft (Acero et al., 2008), Vlingo,and Promptu allow users to search for items like businesses and songs using their mobile phones.",
        "These applications differ from ours in that speech is used only for search, without any accompanying command and control capabilities.",
        "Also, these services do not allow interaction with your own devices at home.",
        "Efforts have been made to use mobile devices for control of devices in the home, such as in (Nichols and Myers, 2006), however these efforts have not involved the use of speech as an input modality.",

        "While the navigation pad and stylus are great for basic navigation and control, searching for media with specific attributes, such as title, remains cumbersome.",
        "To facilitate such interactions, the current system supports spoken natural language interactions.",
        "For example, the user can press the hold-to-talk button located on the side of the mobile device and ask \"What's on the National Geographic Channel this afternoon?\"",
        "to retrieve a list of shows with the specified channel and time.",

        "Depressing the hold-to-talk button not only terminates any current spoken response, but also mutes the TV to minimize interference with speech recognition.",
        "As the previous example demonstrates, contextual information is used to resolve list position references and disambiguate commands.",
        "The speech interface to the user's music library works in a similar fashion.",
        "Users can search by artist, album, and song name, and then play the songs found.",

        "Thus, both the page layout and information detail were adjusted for the mobile browser.",
        "Although AJAX is more responsive than traditional web technology, rendering large formatted pages – such as the program guide grid – is often still unacceptably slow.",
        "In the current implementation, we addressed this problem by displaying only the first section of the content and providing a \"Show More\" button that downloads and renders the full content.",
        "While browser-based GUIs expedite rapid prototyping, deployed systems may want to take advantage of native interfaces specific to the device for more responsive user interactions.",
        "Instead of limiting the mobile interface to reflect the TV GUI, improved usability may be obtained by designing the interface for the mobile device first and then expanding the visual content to the TV display.",
        "In the current prototype, communication between the mobile device and the media server consists of AJAX HTTP and XML-RPC requests.",
        "To enable server-side \"push\" updates, the client periodically pings the server for messages.",
        "While such an implementation provides a responsive user interface, it quickly drains the battery and is not robust to network outages resulting from the device being moved or switching to power-saving mode.",
        "Reestablishing connection with the server further introduces latency.",
        "In future implementations, we would like to examine the use of Bluetooth for lower power consumption, and infrared for immediate response to common controls and basic navigation."

        "We have presented a prototype system that demonstrates the feasibility of deploying a multimodal, natural language interface on a mobile device for browsing and managing one's home media library.",
        "In developing the prototype, we have experimented with a novel role for a mobile device – that of a speech-enabled remote control.",
        "We have demonstrated a flexible natural language understanding architecture, in which various processing stages may be performed on either the server or mobile device, as networking and processing power considerations require.",
        "While the mobile platform presents many challenges, it also provides unique opportunities.",
        "Whereas desktop computers and TV remote controls tend to be shared by multiple users, a mobile device is typically used by a single individual.",
        "By collecting and adapting to the usage data, the system can personalize the recognition and understanding models to improve the system accuracy.",
        "In future systems, we hope to not only explore such adaptation possibilities, but also study how real users interact with the system to further improve the user interface."
