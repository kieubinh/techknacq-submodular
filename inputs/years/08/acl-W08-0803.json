        "Information extraction is one of useful applications in NLP that helps users to easily access core information in a large amount of free texts.",
        "Unfortunately, it is not easy to implement an information extraction system in mobile devices because target texts include many morphological variations (e.g. blank omission, typos, word abbreviation) and mobile devices have many hardware limitations (e.g. a small volume of a main memory and the absence of an arithmetic logic unit for floating-point calculation)",
        "There are some researches on information extraction from short messages in a mobile device, and Cooper's research (Cooper, 2005) is representative.",
        "Cooper predefined various syntactic patterns with placeholders and matched an input message against the syntactic patterns.",
        "Then, he extracted texts in the placeholders and assigned them the attribute name of the placeholders.",
        "This method has some advantages like easy implementation and fast response time.",
        "However, it is inadequate to apply Cooper's method to languages with partially-free word-order like Korean and Japanese because a huge amount of syntactic patterns should be predefined according as the degree of freedom on word order increases.",
        "Kang (2004) proposed a NLIDB (natural language interface to database) system using lightweight shallow NLP techniques.",
        "Kang raised problems of deep NLP techniques such as low portability and error-proneness.",
        "Kang proposed a lightweight approach to natural language interfaces, where translation knowledge is semi-automatically acquired and user questions are only syntactically analyzed.",
        "Although Kang's method showed good performances in spite of using shallow NLP techniques, it is difficult to apply his method to mobile devices because his method still needs a morphological analyzer with a large size of dictionary.",

        "As shown in Figure 1, the proposed system consists of an extraction part and a normalization part.",
        "In the extraction part, the proposed system first extracts temporal instance candidates (i.e. dates and times) using FSA (finite-state automata).",
        "Then, the proposed system extracts named instance candidates (i.e. locations and topics) using syllable n-grams.",
        "Finally, the proposed system ranks the extracted instances and selects the highest one per target category.",
        "In the normalization part, the proposed system converts the temporal instances into suitable forms.",
        "Although short messages in an appointment domain often include many incorrect words, temporal instances like dates and times are expressed as correct as possible because they are very important to appointment management.",
        "In addition, temporal instances are expressed in tractable numbers of surface forms in order to make message receivers easily be understood.",
        "In MUC-7, these kinds of temporal instances are called TIMEX (Chinchor, 1998), and it has known that TIMEX can be easily extracted by using FSA (Srihari, 2001).",
        "Based on these previous works, the proposed system extracts temporal instances from short messages by using FSA, as shown in Figure 2.",
        "Unlike dates and times, locations and topics not only have various surface forms, but also their constituent words are not included in a closed set.",
        "In MUC-7, these kinds of named entities are called NAMEX (Chinchor, 1998), and many researches on NAMEX have been performed by using rules and statistics.",
        "Generally, rule-based methods show high precisions but they have a weak point that it is hard to maintain a system when new words are continuously added to the system (Goh, 2003).",
        "Statistical methods guarantee reasonable performances but they need large-scale language resource and complex floating point operations.",
        "Therefore, it is not suitable to apply previous traditional approaches to mobile devices with many hardware limitations.",
        "To resolve this problem, we propose a statistical model based on syllable n-grams, as shown in Figure 3.",
        "The extraction of named instances has two kinds of problems; a instance boundary detection problem and a category assigning problem.",
        "If we can use a conventional morphological analyzer, the instance boundary detection problem is not big.",
        "However, it is not easy to use a morphological analyzer in a mobile device because of hardware limitations and users' writing habitations.",
        "Users often ignore word spacing and this habitation lowers the performance of the morphological analyzer.",
        "To resolve this problem, we adopt a syllable n-gram model that performs well in word boundary detection for languages like Chinese with no spacing between words (Goh, 2003; Ha, 2004).",
        "We first define 9 labels that represent boundaries of named instance candidates by adopting BIO (begin, inner, and outer) annotation scheme, as shown in Table 1 (Hong, 2005; Uchimoto, 2000).",
        "size pieces about which we can collect statistics, as shown in Equation (2).",
        "We simplify Equation (2) by making the following two assumptions: one is that the current boundary label is only dependent on the previous boundary label, and the other is that current boundary label is affected by its contextual features.",
        "In Equation (3), p*(si i \\i) is a modified observation probability that is adopted from a class probability in naive Bayesian classification (Zheng, i998) as shown in Equation (4).",
        "The reason why we modify an original observation probability p(si i \\i) in",
        "HMM is its sparseness that is caused by a size limitation of training corpus in a mobile environment.",
        "Then, based on a modified HMM (hidden Markov model), the proposed system assigns boundary labels to each syllable in an input message, as follows.",
        "Let sln denote a message which consists of a sequence of n syllable, Si,s2,...,sn, and let Lin denote the boundary label sequence, ii;i2,...,in, of sln.",
        "Then, the label annotation problem can be formally defined as finding li n which is the result of Equation (i).",
        "L(Si n ) = argmax P(Li,n Si,n )",
        "= argmax P(Lin , Sin )",
        "In Equation (i), we dropped P(sin) as it is constant for all Lin.",
        "Next, we break Equation (i) into bite-",
        "In Equation (4), f is the number of contextual features, and Sij is the jth feature of the ith syllable.",

        "Table 2 shows the contextual features that the proposed system uses.",
        "In Equation (i), the max scores are calculated by using the well-known Viterbi algorithm (Forney, i973).",
        "After performing instance boundary labeling, the proposed system extracts syllable sequences labeled with the same named categories.",
        "For example, if a syllable sequence is labeled with 'TS OT LB LI LI', the proposed system extracts the subsequence of syllables labeled with 'LB LI LI', as a location candidate.",

        "It is inadequate for the proposed system to use the extracted temporal instances as database instances without any processing because the temporal instances consist of various forms of human-readable strings like 'January 24, 2008'.",
        "Therefore, the proposed system should normalize the temporal instances into machine-manageable forms like '20080i24'.",
        "However, the normalization is not easy because temporal instances often include the relative information like 'this Sunday' and 'after two days'.",
        "To resolve this problem, the proposed system converts relative temporal instances into absolute temporal instances by using a message arrival time.",
        "For example, if a message includes the temporal instance 'after two days', the proposed system checks arrival time information of the message.",

        "The manual annotation was done by 2 graduate students majoring in natural language processing and post-processed by a student in a doctoral course for consistency.",
        "In order to experiment the proposed system, we divided the annotated messages into the training corpus and the testing corpus by a ratio of four (4,952 messages) to one (i,238 messages).",
        "Then, we performed 5-fold cross validation and used a precision, a recall rate, and a Fi-measure as performance measures.",
        "In this paper, we did not evaluate the performances on the temporal instance extraction because performances of the proposed method are fully dependent on the coverage of pre-constructed",

        "However, as shown in the Table 3, although the number of syllable trigrams was three times larger than the number of syllable bigrams, the difference of performances between the system using syllable bigrams and the system using syllable trigrams was not big (about Based on this experimental result, we conclude that the combination of syllable unigrams and syllable bigrams, as shown in Table 2, is the most suitable language model for mobile devices with low hardware resources.",
        "To evaluate the proposed system, we calculated two types of performances.",
        "One is boundary labeling performances that measure whether the proposed system can correctly annotate a test corpus with boundary labels in Table i.",
