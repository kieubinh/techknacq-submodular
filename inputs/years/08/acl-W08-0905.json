        "Then we provide a short description of the PDT itself in Section 3.",
        "Section 4 is the core of our paper.",
        "Section 4.1 is devoted to the filtering of the PDT sentences in such a way that the complexity of sentences included in the exercise book exactly corresponds to the complexity of sentences exercised in traditional Czech textbooks and exercise books.",

      "text": [
        "From the very beginning, we had an idea of using an annotated corpus outside its original context.",
        "We recalled our experience from secondary school, namely from language lessons when we learned morphology and syntax.",
        "We did it \"with pen and paper\" and more or less hated it.",
        "Thus we decided to build an electronic exercise book to learn and practice the morphology and the syntax \"by moving the mouse around the screen.\"",
        "In principle, there are two ways to build an exercise book - manually or automatically.",
        "A manual procedure requires collecting sentences the authors usually make up and then process with regard to the chosen aspects.",
        "This is a very demanding, time-consuming task and therefore the authors manage to collect only tens (possibly hundreds) of sentences that simply cannot fully reflect the real usage of a language.",
        "An automatic procedure is possible when an annotated corpus of the language is available.",
        "Then the disadvantages of the manual procedure disappear.",
        "It is expected that the texts in a corpus are already selected to provide a well-balanced corpus reflecting the real usage of the language, the hard annotation work is also done and the size of such corpus is thousands or tens of thousands of annotated sentences.",
        "The task that remains is to transform the annotation scheme used in the corpus into the sentence analysis scheme that is taught in schools.",
        "In fact, a procedure based on an annotated corpus that we apply is semi-automatic, since the annotation scheme transformation presents a knowledge-based process designed manually - no machine-learning technique is used.",
        "We browsed the Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) approaches, namely those concentrated under the teaching and language corpora interest group (e.g. (Wichmann and Fligel-stone (eds.",
        "), 1997), (Tribble, 2001), (Murkherjee, 2004), (Schultze, 2003), (Scott, Tribble, 2006)).",
        "We realized that none of them actually employs manually annotated corpora - they use corpora as huge banks of texts without additional linguistic information (i.e. without annotation).",
        "Only one project (Keogh et al., 2004) works with an automatically annotated corpus to teach Irish and German morphology.",
        "Reviewing the Czech electronic exercise books available (e.g. (Terasoft, Ltd., 2003)), none of them provides the users with any possibility of analyzing the sentence both morphologically and syntactically.",
        "All of them were built manually.",
        "Considering all the facts mentioned above, we find our approach to be novel one.",
        "One of the most exciting aspects of corpora is that they may be used to a good advantage both in research and teaching.",
        "That is why we wanted to present this system that makes schoolchildren familiar with an academic product.",
        "At the same time, this system represents a challenge and an opportunity for academics to popularize a field with a promising future that is devoted to natural language processing."

        "The annotations go from the morphological layer through to the intermediate syntactic-analytical layer to the tectogrammati-cal layer (the layer of an underlying syntactic structure).",
        "The texts have been annotated in the same direction, i. e. from the simplest layer to the most complex.",
        "This fact corresponds with the amount of data annotated on each level - 2 million words have been annotated on the lowest morphological layer, 1.5 million words on both the morphological and the syntactic layer, and 0.8 million words on all three layers.",
        "Within the PDT conceptual framework, a sentence is represented as a rooted ordered tree with labeled nodes and edges on both syntactic (Hajicova, Kirschner and Sgall, 1999) and tectogrammatical (Mikulovaa et al., 2006) layers.",

        "and the dependency relation between two nodes is captured by an edge between them, i. e. between the dependent and its governor.",
