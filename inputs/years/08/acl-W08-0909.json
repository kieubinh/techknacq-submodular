        "A reading difficulty, or readability, measure can be described as a function or model that maps a text to a numerical value corresponding to a difficulty or grade level.",
        "Inputs to this function are usually statistics for various lexical and grammatical features of the text.",
        "The output is one of a set of ordered difficulty levels, usually corresponding to grade levels for elementary school through high school.",
        "As such, reading difficulty prediction can be viewed as a regression of grade level on a set of textual features.",
        "Early work on readability measures employed simple proxies for grammatical and lexical complexity, including sentence length and the number of syllables in a word.",
        "Fairly simple features were often employed because of a lack of computational power.",
        "Such features exhibit high bias because they rely on strong assumptions about what makes a text difficult to read.",
        "For example, the use of sentence length as a measure of grammatical complexity assumes that a longer sentence is more grammatically complex than a shorter one, which is often but not always the case.",
        "In one early model, the Dale-Chall model (Dale and Chall, 1948; Chall and Dale, 1995), reading difficulty is a linear function of the mean sentence length and the percentage of rare words, as defined by a list of 3,000 words commonly known by 4th grade.",
        "In this paper, sentence length is defined as the mean number of words in the sentences of a text.",
        "Many early measures did not employ direct estimates of word frequency due to computational limitations (e.g., (Gunning, 1952; McLaughlin, 1969; Kincaid et al., 1975)).",
        "Instead, these measures relied on the strong relationship between the frequency of and the number of syllables in a word.",
        "More frequent words are more likely to have fewer syllables (e.g., \"the\") than less frequent words (e.g., \"vocabulary\"), an association that is related to Zipf's Law (Zipf, 1935).",
        "The Flesch-Kincaid measure (Kincaid et al., 1975) is probably the most common reading difficulty measure in use.",
        "It is implemented in common word processing programs.",
        "This measure is a linear function of the mean number of syllables per word and the mean number of words per sentence.",
        "Klare (1974) provides a summary of other early work on readability.",
        "More recent approaches to reading difficulty employ more sophisticated models that make use of the growth in computational power.",
        "The Lexile Framework (e.g., (Stenner, 1996)) uses individual word frequency estimates as a measure of lexical difficulty.",
        "The word frequency estimates are derived from a large, varied corpus of text.",
        "Lexile uses a Rasch model (Rasch, 1980) with the mean log word frequency as a lexical feature and the log of the mean sentence length as a grammatical feature.",
        "The Rasch model, related to logistic regression, is used to estimate the level of a student that would comprehend 75% of a given text.",
        "The converted log odds ratio called a \"Lexile\" that is used as part of this measure can be easily mapped to grade school levels.",
        "A reading difficulty measure developed by Collins-Thompson and Callan (2005) uses smoothed unigram language modeling to capture the predictive ability of individual words based on their frequency at each reading difficulty level.",
        "Collins-Thompson and Callan found that certain words were very predictive of certain levels.",
        "For example, \"grownup\" was very predictive of grade 1, and \"essay\" was very predictive of grade 12.",
        "For a given text, this measure estimates the likelihood that the text was generated by each level's language model.",
        "The prediction is the level of the model with the highest likelihood of generating the text.",
        "There are no grammatical features.",
        "Natural language processing techniques enable more sophisticated grammatical analysis for reading difficulty measures.",
        "Rather than using sentence length as a proxy, measures can employ tools for automatic analysis of the syntactic structure of texts (e.g., (Charniak, 2000)).",
        "A measure by Schwarm and Ostendorf (2005) incorporates syntactic analyses, among a variety of other types of features.",
        "It includes four grammatical features derived from syntactic parses of text: the mean parse tree height, the mean number of noun phrases, mean number of verb phrases, and mean number of \"SBARs.\"",
        "\"SBARs\" are non-terminal nodes that are associated with subordinate clauses.",
        "Their system led to better predictions than the Flesch-Kincaid and Lexile measures, but the predictive value of the grammatical features is not entirely clear.",
        "In initial experiments using such course-grain grammatical features alone, rather than in conjunction with language modeling and other features as in Schwarm and Ostendorf's system, we found relatively poor prediction performance.",
        "Our final approach using subtrees of syntactic parses allows for a finer level of discrimination that may support the detection of differences in grade levels between texts that exhibit the same high level features.",
        "A reading difficulty measure developed by Heilman, Collins-Thompson, Callan, and Eskenazi (2007) uses the frequency of grammatical constructions as a measure of grammatical difficulty.",
        "A set of approximately twenty constructions were selected from English as a Second Language grammar textbooks.",
        "This set includes grammatical constructions such as the passive voice, relative clauses, and various verb tenses.",
        "The frequencies are used as features for a nearest neighbor classification algorithm.",
        "The unigram language modeling approach of Collins-Thompson and Callan (2005) is used to estimate lexical difficulty in this measure.",
        "The final prediction is a linear function of the lexical and grammatical components.",
        "That model assumes that grammatical difficulty is adequately captured by a small number of constructions chosen according to detailed knowledge of English grammar.",
        "In that work, the constructions were selected from an English as a Second Language grammar textbook, a labor- and knowledge-intensive task that may be less practical for other languages.",
        "We aim to identify the appropriate scale of measurement for reading difficulty-nominal, ordinal, or interval-by comparing the effectiveness of statistical models for each type of data.",
        "We also extend previous work combining lexical and grammatical features (Heilman et al., 2007) by making it possible to include a large number of grammatical features derived from syntactic structures without requiring significant linguistic or pedagogical content knowledge, such as a reference guide for the grammar of the language of interest."

        "Higher order n-grams such as bigrams and trigrams were not used as features because they did not improve predictions in preliminary tests.",
        "The specific set of lexical features was chosen based on the frequencies of words in the training corpus.",
        "The system performs morphological stemming and stopword removal.",
        "The remaining 5000 most common words comprised the lexical feature set.",
        "Grammatical features are extracted from automatic context-free grammar parses of sentences.",
        "The system computes relative frequencies of partial syntactic derivations, which will be called 'subtrees' hereafter.",
        "The approach extends (Heilman et al., 2007), where frequencies of manually defined syntactic patterns were extracted from syntactic structures.",
        "In that approach, the features are defined manually using linguistic knowledge of the target language to implement tree search patterns, a labor- and knowledge-intensive process.",
        "The approach advocated in this paper, however, extracts frequencies for an automatically defined set of subtree patterns.",
        "The system considers all subtrees up to a given depth that occur in the training corpus.",
        "Examples of grammatical features at levels 0 through 2 are shown in Figure 1.",
        "The sentence for the parse tree shown was taken from a third grade text.",
        "For depth 0, the system includes all subtrees consisting of just nonterminal nodes.",
        "This includes all parts of speech, as well as non-terminal nodes for noun phrases, adjective phrases, clauses, etc.",
        "For depth 1, the system includes subtrees corresponding to the application of a single context free grammar rule in the derivation of the tree.",
        "An example of a feature at this level would be a sentence node that dominates nodes for noun phrases and verb phrases.",
        "For deeper levels, the system includes subtrees corresponding to the successive application of rules on non-terminals symbols until either a terminal symbol is reached or the given depth is reached.",
        "An example feature for level 2 is a subtree in which a prepositional phrase node dominates a preposition node and noun phrase node, and the preposition node in turn dominates a preposition, and the noun phrase dominates determiner, adjective, and noun nodes.",
        "We used a maximum depth of 3 in our experiments.",
        "Features of deeper levels occur less frequently in general, and deeper levels were avoided due to data sparseness.",
        "A depth first search algorithm extracts candidate grammatical features from the training corpus.",
        "First, a context-free grammar parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) derives parse trees for all texts in the training corpus.",
        "The algorithm traverses these parses, at each node counting all subtree features up to the given depth that are rooted at that node.",
        "The subtree features are sorted by their overall counts in the corpus.",
        "In our experiments, frequencies of the most common 1000 subtrees were chosen as the final features.",
        "These included 64 level 0 features corresponding to nonterminal symbols, 334 level 1 features, 461 level 2 features, and 141 level 3 features.",
        "Deeper levels have more possible features, but sparsity at level 3 resulted in fewer level 3 features being selected.",
        "In our experiments, the subtrees included terminal symbols for stopwords.",
        "However, the system effectively removed content word terminals from parses before extracting features.",
        "The system could be modified to include terminal symbols for content words, or even to ignore all nodes for terminal symbols.",
        "Subtree features including terminal symbols for content words would, of course, occur with low frequency and not likely be included in the final feature set.",
        "Terminal symbols for content words were omitted so that lexical information was not included in the set of grammatical features.",
        "Similar to leaving higher order n-grams out of the lexical feature set, omitting terminal symbols for content words avoids confounding grammatical and lexical information in the grammatical feature set.",
        "Subtree counts are normalized by the number of words in a text to compute the relative frequencies.",
        "Normalization by the number of sentences in a text is also possible, but did not perform as well in preliminary tests.",

        "Several statistical models were tested for effectiveness at predicting reading difficulty.",
        "The appropriateness of these models depends on the nature of reading difficulty data, particularly the scale of measurement.",
        "The standard unit for reading difficulty is the grade level.",
        "First through twelfth grade levels in American schools have been used in previous work (e.g., (Heilman et al., 2007; Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2005)).",
        "English as a Second Language levels have also been used (Heilman et al., 2007), as well as grade levels for other languages such as French (Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2005).",
        "While these grades are assigned evenly spaced integers, the ranges of reading difficulty corresponding to these grades are not necessarily evenly spaced.",
        "It is possible, of course, that assuming even spacing between levels might produce more parsimonious and accurate statistical models.",
        "A more reasonable assumption is that the grade numbers assigned to each difficulty level denote an ordering: for example, that grade 1 is in some sense less than grade 2, which is less than grade 3, etc.",
        "Different statistical models handle this assumption more or less well.",
        "which the transitions between consecutive classes all have the same direction but not the same magnitude.",
        "Making predictions about such data is generally called ordinal regression (McCullagh, 1980).",
        "Interval data, however, are both ordered and evenly spaced.",
        "An example would be temperature as measured in Fahrenheit degrees.",
        "Such data have an arbitrary zero point, and negative values may occur.",
        "Ratio data, of which annual income is an example, do have a meaningful zero point.",
        "We will not discuss ratio data further since its distinction from interval data is not relevant to this paper.",
        "It is not clear to which scale reading difficulty corresponds.",
        "The assumption of an interval scale allows for simpler models with fewer parameters.",
        "However, models for ordinal or even nominal data might be more appropriate if the strong assumption of an interval scale does not hold.",
        "Statistics generally distinguish four scales of measurement, which are, ordered by increasing assumptions about the relationships between values: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio (Stevens, 1946; Cohen et al., 2003).",
        "Nominal data involve no relationships between the labels or classes of the data.",
        "An example would be types of fruits, where a model might be used to make decisions between apples and oranges.",
        "This type of prediction is generally called classification in machine learning and related fields.",
        "Ordinal data have a natural ordering, but the values are not necessarily evenly spaced.",
        "For example, data about the severity of illnesses might have labels such as mild, moderate, severe, deceased, in",
        "We experimented with three linear and log-linear models corresponding to interval, ordinal, and nominal data.",
        "Parameters were estimated using L2 regularization, which corresponds to a Gaussian prior distribution with zero mean and a user-specified variance over the parameters.",
        "We chose these models because they are commonly used in the statistics, machine learning, and behavioral science communities, and aimed to set up meaningful comparisons among the scales of measurement.",
        "Other machine learning algorithms might also be employed.",
        "In fact, we briefly tested the maximum margin (Vap-nik, 1995) approach, which led to comparable results and might be worth exploring in future work.",

        "LIN provides continuous estimates of reading difficulty, such that a prediction might fall between grade levels.",
        "The estimates were not rounded to whole numbers in the experiments.",
        "For rare cases of an LIN prediction falling outside the appropriate range of grade levels, the value was set to the maximum or minimum grade level.",

        "The LIN model has relatively few parameters but makes strong assumptions about the scale of measurement.",
        "For details, see (Hastie et al., 2001).",
        "The Proportional Odds (PO) model, also called the parallel regression model and the cumulative logit model, is a form of log-linear, or exponential, model for ordinal data (McCullagh, 1980).",
        "Given a new unlabeled instance as input, the model provides estimates of the probability that the instance belongs to a class at or above a particular level.",
        "In Equation (1), P(y > j) is this estimated probability, aj is an intercept parameter for the given level j, 0 is vector of regression coefficients, Xi is the vector of feature values for instance i, and yi is the predicted reading difficulty level.",
        "The PO model has a parameter aj for the threshold, or intercept, at each level j, but only a single set / of parameters for the features.",
        "These two types of parameters correspond to an implicit assumption of ordinality.",
        "Having a single setofparameters forfeatures across the levels means that changes in feature values proportionally affect the odds oftransitioning from any one class to another.",
        "The estimated probability of an instance belonging to a particular class is the difference between estimates for that class and the next highest class.",
        "For example, the estimated probability of a text being at the eighth grade level would be the estimate for being at or above eighth grade minus the estimate for being at or above ninth grade.",
        "As in binary logistic regression, the PO model estimates log odds ratios based on the values of features or predictor variables.",
        "The numerator of the odds ratio is the probability of being at or above a level, and the denominator is the probability of being below a level.",
        "Equation (2) shows the form of the model that is linear in the parameters.",

        "Approximately half of these texts were authored by students at the particular grade level, and half were authored by teachers or writers and aimed at readers at a particular grade level.",
        "Texts were found for grade levels 1 through 12.",
        "The twelfth grade level also included some post-secondary level texts.",

        "reading difficulty appears to increase steadily but not linearly with grade level.",
        "As such, the LIN approach that produces linear models was less effective, particularly in terms of adjacent accuracy.",
        "The LOG model, for nominal data, also led to inferior performance compared to the PO model, which can be attributed to the difficulty of accurately estimating a more complex model with many parameters for each level.",
        "Our tests found that grammatical features alone can be effective predictors of readability.",
        "This finding disagrees with a previous result that found that a model using a combination of lexical and manually defined grammatical features (Heilman et al., 2007) outperformed a model using grammatical features alone.",
        "The superior predictive ability of the models we describe that use grammatical features can be attributed to the automatic derivation of a grammatical feature set that is more than an order of magnitude larger than in the previous approach.",
        "Our approach enables the use of much larger grammatical feature sets because it does not require the extensive linguistic knowledge and effort to manually define the grammatical features.",
        "The automatic approach also enables an easier transition to other languages, assuming a parser is available.",
        "Using the combined feature set did not hurt performance, however, and since regularized statistical models can avoid over-fitting large numbers of parameters, a combined feature set still seems appropriate."
