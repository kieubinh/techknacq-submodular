        "Reading practice is an important component of first and second language learning, especially with regards to vocabulary learning (Hafiz and Tudor, 1989).",
        "Appropriating suitable reading material for the needs of a particular curriculum or particular student, however, is a challenging process.",
        "Manually authoring or editing readings is time-consuming and raises issues of authenticity, which are particularly significant in second language learning (Peacock, 1997).",
        "On the other hand, the Web is a vast resource of authentic reading material, but commercial search engines which are designed for a wide variety of information needs may not effectively facilitate the retrieval of appropriate readings for language learners.",
        "In order to demonstrate the problem of finding appropriate reading materials, here is a typical example of an information need from a teacher of an English as a Second Language (ESL) course focused on reading skills.",
        "This example was encountered during the development of the system.",
        "It should be noted that while we describe the system in the context of ESL, we claim that the approach is general enough to be applied to first language reading practice and to languages other than English.",
        "To fit within his existing curriculum, the ESL teacher wanted to find texts on the specific topic of \"international travel.\"",
        "He sought texts that contained at least a few words from the list of target vocabulary that his student were learning that week.",
        "In addition, he needed the texts to be within a particular range of reading difficulty, fifth to eighth grade in an American school, and shorter than a thousand words.",
        "Sending the query \"international travel\" to a popular search engine did not produce a useful list of results.",
        "The first result was a travel warning from the Department of State, which was at a high reading level (grade 10 according to the approach described by (Heilman et al., 2008)) and not likely to be of interest to ESL students because of legal and technical details.",
        "Most of the subsequent results were for commercial web sites and travel agencies.",
        "A query for a subset of the target vocabulary words for the course also produced poor results.",
        "Since the search engine used strict boolean retrieval methods, the top results for the query \"deduce deviate hierarchy implicit undertake\" were all long lists of ESL vocabulary words.",
        "We describe a search system, called REAP Search, that is tailored to the needs of language teachers and learners.",
        "The system facilitates the retrieval of texts satisfying particular pedagogical constraints such as reading level and text length, and allows the user to constrain results so that they contain at least some, but not necessarily all, of the words from a user-specified target vocabulary list.",
        "It also filters out inappropriate material as well as pages that do not contain significant amounts of text in well-formed sentences.",

      "text": [
        "The foundation of the system is a digital library of potential reading material.",
        "The customized search component does not search the Web directly, but rather accesses this filtered and annotated database of Web pages.",
        "The current library consists of approximately five million documents.",
        "Construction of the digital library begins with a set of target vocabulary words that might be covered by a course or set of courses (typically 100-1,500 words), and a set of constraints on text characteristics.",
        "The constraints can be divided into three sets: those that can be expressed in a search engine query (e.g., target words, number of target words per text, date, Web domain), those that can be applied using just information in the Web search result list (e.g., document size), and those that require local annotation and filtering (e.g., reading level, text quality, profanity).",
        "The system obtains candidate documents by query-based crawling, as opposed to following chains of links.",
        "The query-based document crawling approach is designed to download documents for particular target words.",
        "Queries are submitted to a commercial Web search engine, result links are downloaded, and then the corresponding documents are downloaded.",
        "A commercial web search engine is used to avoid the cost of maintaining a massive, overly general web corpus.",
        "Queries consist of combinations of multiple target words.",
        "The system generates 30 queries for each target word (30 is a manageable and sufficient number in practice).",
        "These are spread across 2-, 3-, and 4-word combinations with other target words.",
        "Queries to search engines can often specify a date range.",
        "We employ ranges to find more recent material, which students prefer.",
        "The tasks of submitting queries, downloading the result pages, and extracting document links are distributed among a dozen or so clients running on desktop machines, to run as background tasks.",
        "The clients periodically upload their results to a server, and request a new batch of queries.",
        "Once the server has a list of candidate pages, it downloads them and applies various filters.",
        "The final yield of texts is typically approximately one percent of the originally downloaded results.",
        "Many web pages are too long, contain too little well-formed text, or are far above the appropriate reading level for language learners.",
        "After downloading documents, the system annotates them as described in the next section.",
        "It then stores the pages in a fulltext search engine called Indri, which is part of the Lemur Toolkit.",

        "Annotations include reading difficulty, general topic area, text quality, and text length.",
        "Text length is simply the number of word tokens appearing in the document.",
        "The system employs a language modeling approach developed by Collins-Thompson and Callan (Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2005) that creates a model of the lexicon for each grade level and predicts reading level, or readability, of given documents according to those models.",
        "The readability predictor is a specialized Naive Bayes classifier with lexical unigram features.",
        "For web documents in particular, Collins-Thompson and Callan report that this language modeling-based prediction has a stronger correlation with human-assigned levels than other commonly used readability measures.",
        "This automatic readability measure allows the system to satisfy user-specified constraints on reading difficulty.",
        "We are also experimenting with using syntactic features to predict reading difficulty.",
        "Heilman, Collins-Thompson, and Eskenazi (Heilman et al., 2008) describe an approach that combines predictions based on lexical and grammatical features.",
        "The grammatical features are frequencies of occurrence of grammatical constructions, which are computed from automatic parses of input texts.",
        "Using multiple measures of reading difficulty that focus on different aspects of language may allow users more freedom to find texts that match their needs.",
        "For example, a teacher may want to find grammatically simpler texts for use in a lesson focused on introducing difficult vocabulary.",
        "A set of binary topic classifiers automatically classifies each potential reading by its general topic, as described by Heilman, Juffs, and Eskenazi (2007).",
        "This component allows users to search for readings on their general interests without specifying a particular query (e.g., \"international travel\") that might unnecessarily constrain the results to a very narrow topic.",
        "A Linear Support Vector Machine text classifier (Joachims, 1999) was trained on Web pages from the Open Directory Project (ODP).",
        "These pages effectively have human-assigned topic labels because they are organized into a multilevel hierarchy of topics.",
        "The following general topics were manually selected from categories in the ODP: Movies and Theater; Music; Visual Arts; Computers and Technology; Business; Math, Physics and Chemistry; Biology andEnvironment; Social Sciences; Healthand Medicine; Fitness and Nutrition; Religion; Politics; Law and Crime; History; American Sports; and Outdoor Recreation.",
        "Web pages from the ODP were used as goldstandard labels in the training data for the classifiers.",
        "SVM-Light (Joachims, 1999) was used as an implementation of the Support Vector Machines.",
        "In preliminary tests, the linear kernel produced slightly better performance than a radial basis function kernel.",
        "The values of the decision functions of the classifiers for each topic are used to annotate readings with their likely topics.",
        "The binary classifiers for each topic category were evaluated according to the F1 measure, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, using leave-one-out cross-validation.",
        "Values for the F1 statistic range from .68 to .86, with a mean value of .76 across topics.",
        "For comparison, random guessing would be expected to correctly choose the gold-standard label only ten percent of the time.",
        "During an error analysis, we observed that many of the erroneous classifications were, in fact, plausible for a human to make as well.",
        "Many readings span multiple topics.",
        "For example, a document on a hospital merger might be classified as \"Health and Medicine\" when the correct label is \"Business.\"",
        "In the evaluation, the gold standard included only the single topic specified by the ODP.",
        "The final system, however, assigns multiple topic labels when appropriate.",
        "A major challenge of using Web documents for educational applications is that many web pages contain little or no text in well-formed sentences and paragraphs.",
        "We refer to this problem as \"Text Quality.\"",
        "Many pages consist of lists of links, navigation menus, multimedia, tables of numerical data, etc.",
        "A special annotation tool filters out such pages so that they do not clutter up search results and make it difficult for users to find suitable reading materials.",
        "The text quality filter estimates the proportion of the word tokens in a page that are contained in well-formed sentences.",
        "To do this it parses the Document Object Model structure of the web page, and organizes it into text units delineated by the markup tags in the document.",
        "Each new paragraph, table element, span, or divider markup tag corresponds to the beginning of a new text unit.",
        "The system then runs a POS tagger over each text unit.",
        "We have found that a simple check for whether the text unit contains both a noun and a verb can effectively distinguish between content text units and those text units that are just part of links, menus, etc.",
        "The proportion of the total tokens that are part of content text units serves as a useful measure of text quality.",
        "We have found that a threshold of about 85% content text is appropriate, since most web pages contain at least some non-content text in links, menus, etc.",
        "This approach to content extraction is related to previous work on increasing the accessibility of web pages (Gupta etal., 2003)."

        "This issue is relevant because a teacher might want to search for texts that contain some, but not necessarily all, of a list of target vocabulary words.",
        "For example, a teacher might have a list of ten words, and any text with five of those words would be useful to give as vocabulary and reading practice.",
        "In such cases, ranked retrieval models are more appropriate because they do not require that all of the query terms appear.",
        "Instead, these models prefer multiple occurrences of different word types as opposed to multiple occurrences of the same word tokens, allowing them to rank documents with more distinct query terms higher than those with distinct query terms.",
        "Documents that contain only some of the query terms are thus assigned nonzero weights, allowing the user to find useful texts that contain only some of the target vocabulary.",
        "The REAP search system uses the Indri Query Language's \"combine\" and \"weight\" operators to implement a ranked retrieval model for target vocabulary.",

        "The weight operator at the start of line 5 balances between the ad hoc query terms in line 5 and the user-specific target vocabulary terms in lines 6-8.",
        "The uw10 operator on line 5 tells the system to prefer texts where the query terms appear together in an unordered window of size 10.",
        "Such proximity operators cause search engines to prefer documents in which query terms appear near each other.",
        "The implicit assumption is that the terms in queries such as \"coal miners safety\" are more likely to appear in the same sentence or paragraph in relevant documents than irrelevant ones, even if they do not appear consecutively.",
        "Importantly, query terms are separated from target words because there are usually a much greater number of target words, and thus combining the two sets would often result in the query terms being ignored.",

        "Such an approach should be suitable for use in first language classrooms, especially by teachers who need to find supplemental materials for struggling readers.",
        "Are there enough high-quality, low-reading level texts for very young readers?",
        "From observations made while developing REAP, the proportion of Web pages below fourth grade reading level is small.",
        "Finding appropriate materials for beginning readers is a challenge that the REAP developers are actively addressing.",
        "Issues of speed and scale are also important to consider.",
        "Complex queries such as the one shown in Figure 3 are not as efficient as boolean queries.",
        "The current system takes a few seconds to return results from its database of several million readings.",
        "Scaling up to a much larger digital library may require sophisticated distributed processing of queries across multiple disks or multiple servers.",
        "However, we maintain that this is an effective approach for providing texts within a particular grade level range or known target word list."
