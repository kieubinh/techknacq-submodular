      "text": [
        "As demand for spoken language testing and cost of human scoring have increased in recent years, there is a growing interest in building both research and industrial systems for automatically scoring non-native speech (Bernstein, 1999, Zechner and Bejar, 2006, Zechner et al., 2007).",
        "However, past approaches have focused typically only on one type of spoken language, or on a range of types similar in linguistic entropy.",
        "Entropy in this context can be seen as a measure for how predictable the language in the expected spoken response is: Some tests, such as SET-10 (Bernstein 1999), are focused mostly on the lower entropy aspects of language, using tasks such as \"reading\" or \"repetition\", where the expected sequence of words is highly predictable.",
        "Other assessments, such as the TOEFL® Practice Online Speaking test, on the other hand, focus on more spontaneous, high-entropy responses (Zechner et al., 2007).",
        "In this paper, we describe a spoken language test with heterogeneous task types, ranging from read speech to tasks that require candidates to give their opinions on an issue, whose goal is to assess communicative competence (Bachman, 1990; Bach-man & Palmer, 1996); we call this test THT (Test with Heterogeneous Tasks).",
        "Communicative competence, in this context, refers to a speaker's ability to use the language for communicative purposes.",
        "The effectiveness of the communication typically consists of a few aspects including comprehensibility, accuracy, clarity, coherence and appropriateness, and is evident in a speaker's pronunciation, fluency, use of grammar and vocabulary, development of ideas, and sensitivity to the context of the communication.",
        "This test has the advantage of being able to assess a wide range of non-native speakers' proficiencies by using tasks of varying difficulty levels to allow even low proficiency speakers some degree of success on easier task types.",
        "We select two tasks from this test, one of higher and one of medium to high entropy, and first adapt a non-native English speech recognizer (trained on TOEFL® Practice Online data) to transcribed THT task responses, then compute a set of relevant speech features based on the recognition output, and finally build a scoring model using a subset of these features to predict trained human rater scores.",
        "In this paper, we will demonstrate that the machine-human score agreements on these two task types come close to or even exceed the level of inter-human agreement.",
        "This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses related work, Section 3 describes the test and the challenges for automatic scoring involved, Section 4 discusses the speech recognizer and the acoustic and language model adaptations performed, and Section 5 describes the speech features selected for use in the scoring model.",
        "In Section 6, we report the construction of the scoring model and its results, Section 7 contains a general discussion and Section 8 concludes the paper with a brief discussion of future research."

        "In this paper, we use CART to build the scoring model for one task type.",
        "We also adopt multiple regression for another task type which has the advantage of being more easily interpreted than, for example, SVMs.",

        "Task type 4: Constrained short-answer questions (Planning time: none; Response time: 1530 seconds; low/low-medium entropy)",
        "The test-taker responds, without preparation, to three questions about familiar and accessible topics that draw on immediate personal experience.",

        "This task is rated holistically on the combined impact of delivery, use of structures, vocabulary, task appropriateness and content accuracy on a 3-point scale.",
        "Task type 5: Respond to a voice mail (Planning time: 30 seconds; Response time: 60 seconds; high entropy)",
        "In this task, the test-taker listens to a voicemail that describes a problem, question or situation and then assumes a particular role (bank teller, office assistant, etc.)",

        "Respond to a voicemail and Opinion task).",
        "The predictability of the expected response will dictate what type of language modeling technique is preferable to optimize speech recognition results.",
        "Therefore, unlike in other systems focusing either on high or low entropy speech (e.g., Zechner and Bejar, 2006; Bernstein, 1999), in which a single speech recognizer is employed, it is anticipated that different types of speech recognizers are needed to suit different THT task types.",

        "2.",
        "Furthermore, the scoring criteria of these six different task types are somewhat different.",

        "Training different types of scoring models will certainly increase the complexity and the amount of scoring model development and evaluation work.",

      "heading": "4. Adaptation of the speech recognizer",
      "text": [
        "For this work, we are using a state-of-the-art gender-independent Hidden Markov Model speech recognizer whose acoustic model was trained on about 30 hours of non-native speech and whose language model was built on several hundred hours of both native and non-native speech.",
        "The non-native data came from the TOEFL® Practice Online system, a web-based practice program for prospective takers of the Test Of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) (Zechner et al., 2007).",
        "This data is somewhat different from the THT, as there are only high-entropy tasks in TOEFL Speaking and as the speakers are generally more proficient.",
        "Due to this difference, the baseline word accuracy was fairly low (see Table 1).",
        "Therefore, as a first step, we needed to adapt the automatic speech recognition engine to the THT speech data.",
        "We had approximately 1,000 responses each from the Picture and Opinion tasks transcribed.",
        "As mentioned above, while the Opinion task responses are generally more spontaneous, the Picture task requires the candidate to accurately describe a picture and thus restricts the possible answer space considerably.",
        "Still, there is more room for individual choice and variation in the vocabulary, grammar and content produced than there is in the more restricted low-medium and low entropy task types in the THT Speaking test.",
        "When using our baseline automatic speech recognition (ASR) engine without any adaptation to the THT speech data, we only obtained word accuracies between 25% and 33%, which was clearly inadequate, and far below a word accuracy where, at least for some speakers, meaningful information can be drawn from the ASR hypothesis.",
        "Therefore, we undertook a series of adaptation and optimization steps with the goal of maximizing the word accuracy on the two task types for the THT Speaking test.",
        "We first adapted the acoustic model in batch mode with supervised maximum a-posteriori (MAP) adaptation using the combined data from both tasks, then the language model, optimized the filler cost parameter and finally conducted unsupervised maximum likelihood linear regression (MLLR) acoustic model adaptation based on individual speakers.",
        "We randomly selected about 90% of Picture and Opinion task response data for acoustic model (AM) adaptation, which contained 1,800 response files (over 25 hours of speech, adult speakers with typically low to intermediate English proficiency).",
        "Results are always reported on the held-out evaluation data containing 100 files for the Picture task and 80 files for the Opinion task.",
        "We performed supervised maximum a posteriori (MAP) adaptation which is the method of choice for larger amounts of data and is typically performed in batch mode (Tomokiyo and Waibel, 2001; Wang et al., 2003).",
        "After one cycle of adaptation, word accuracy improved by about 8%, as is shown in Table 1.",
        "We also performed unsupervised maximum likelihood linear regression (MLLR) adaptation, which is discussed in Section 4.4 below.",
        "Table 1.",
        "Word accuracies after each incremental step of adaptation or optimization and performance improvement within each step for Picture and Opinion task types.",
        "The second step was language model (LM) adaptation.",
        "The Picture and Opinion tasks were adapted separately using the same training sets as above.",
        "We built interpolated models between the task-specific LM and the baseline LM (from the original recognizer).",
        "We obtained the best results using only the task-specific LM trained on the THT data set (given in Table 1).",
        "This indicates that the domain of each of the tasks is narrow enough that it can be sufficiently described with a set of about 900 transcribed examples each and it does not benefit from a larger LM such as our baseline LM.",
        "\"Filler cost\" is a recognizer-internal parameter that determines the likelihood of filler and noise words to be inserted into the hypothesis before or after \"real\" words.",
        "The higher the parameter's value, the less likely fillers will be inserted.",
        "The experiments with the filler cost parameter grew out of an observation that the baseline recognizer has a tendency to hypothesize too many words when faced with different kinds of \"uncertain\" audio, such as mumbled words, noises or fillers.",
        "Therefore we conjectured that having the recognizer hypothesize more filler and noise words in these cases and be more restrictive with actual word hypotheses might increase the word accuracy overall.",
        "We varied the filler cost parameter from its default, 3, down to its lowest meaningful value, 0.",
        "Our experiments show that for fillercost=0, a maximum word accuracy was achieved (given in Table 1), albeit at the cost of more than doubling the length of the recognizer's hypothesis by introducing a large amount of fillers (such as \"um\" or \"uh\", noises, mumbles etc.).",
        "We observe that using such a low filler cost parameter setting can negatively affect some speech features which are candidates for being used in a scoring model, such as \"language model score\".",
        "Therefore we have to carefully assess whether achieving a higher word accuracy is more beneficial to the overall performance of the feature set or whether it has too many negative effects on some important speech features.",
        "In future work we will attempt to tune the recognizer in such a way that it is not only optimized for a high word accuracy, but also for high accuracy in filler (and noise) prediction.",
        "Word accuracy was computed with the fillers included or excluded.",
        "Since fillers are not real words, and in this round of scoring model development we did not use any features based on fillers, it was reasonable to compute the overall word accuracy with the fillers removed from the human and recognizer transcriptions, resulting in a moderate performance gain (see Table 1).",
        "We used unsupervised maximum likelihood linear regression (MLLR) AM adaptation on top of the previous adaptation and optimization steps (To-mokiyo and Waibel, 2001; Wang et al., 2003).",
        "In this step, all words whose confidence score was higher than a pre-set threshold were collected and their acoustic information was used to adapt the acoustic model.",
        "All adaptations were done based on the utterances of a single speaker and pertained to that speaker only, i.e., it was not incremental or cumulative.",
        "Since a second decoding run is needed after the actual MLLR adaptations, the recognizer's response time more than doubles when this method is employed.",
        "The unsupervised speaker adaptation led to an additional increase of approximately 2% for the Picture and Opinion tasks (see Table 1).",
        "There were large differences between different speakers in terms of the performance gain of MLLR adaptation on our data set, however.",
        "There was also a large variation of word accuracies between speakers (13-100%).",
        "The variation in accuracy across speakers can be due to many different factors, including the degree of accent, the grammaticality of the response, the voice quality and the recording quality.",

        "The following features Were used: hmmscore, typespersecond, silences-persecond, repetitions and relevancecos5 (the latter only in the task-specific model).",
        "Table 3 shows the results on the sm-eval set.",
        "The Expert Weights model and the Optimal Weights models yielded very similar results (weighted kappa and correlation = 0.61-0.63) if we look at predicted scores that were rounded to the nearest integer.",
        "The agreements between regression model predicted scores and scores of human rater 1 were just a little below the agreements between two human raters (weighted kappa and correlation = 0.72).",
        "However, the results for the Equal Weights model were inferior.",
        "The results for the task-specific models showed no improvement over the generic models, suggesting that the task-specific vocabulary feature did not contribute more predictive power beyond the four features already in the generic models.",
        "tasks (generic model)",
        "As mentioned earlier, the Picture tasks are on a 0-3 point scale and we removed a small number of 0-scores from the analyses, making it a 3-point scale.",
        "Given this particular score scale, multiple regression may not be appropriate for this data as it requires a continuous or a quasi-continuous dependent variable (i.e. a variable that has at least 5 or more data points).",
        "Some classification techniques such as CART (Brieman et al., 1984) or logistic regression, which can take ordered score categories as the outcome variable, are better suited for this data.",
        "In this study, we analyzed the data with CART models.",
        "CART 5.0 (Steinberg and Colla, 1997) was used to build the classification trees.",
        "We built two sets of CART models, one set with the task-specific vocabulary feature (relevancecos3) and one set without it.",
        "We explored different model configurations, i.e., different combinations of priors and splitting rules.",
        "For each combination, a 10-fold cross-validation was conducted.",
        "Subsequently, the optimal sub tree that was a relatively small tree with the highest or near-highest agreement with the human scores (weighted kappa) on the cross-validation sample was identified.",
        "Then the cases in the sm-eval data set were dropped down the optimal tree to obtain the evaluation results on the held-out data.",
        "The results for the generic model vs. task-specific models are compared in Table 4.",
        "For both models, CART trees built using the Twoing splitting rule combined with mixed priors (average of equal priors for different score classes and sm-train sample priors) yielded the best kappa values on the cross-validation data and were selected as the optimal trees.",
        "The agreements between the CART model predicted scores and first rater scores slightly exceeded that between two human raters on the sm-eval data set.",
        "Another observation from Table 4 was that for this task type, the task-specific CART model did not demonstrate an advantage over the generic model; actually, its performance was slightly worse than that of the generic model, a finding in line with the Opinion task.",

        "This paper investigates the feasibility of developing an automatic scoring system for the THT Speaking test, focusing on the particular challenges posed by the design of the test.",
        "The main challenge posed by the test design is the high variability in task types -- ranging from low-entropy Reading-aloud tasks to high-entropy Opinion tasks.",
        "While previous tests of spoken language have focused mainly on either high or low entropy tasks (Bernstein, 1999; Zechner and Bejar, 2006), we have made an attempt at starting to address the whole scale of entropy within a single test.",
        "In this paper, we selected one high entropy task (Opinion) and one medium-high entropy task (Picture) to start our explorations.",
        "While we found that we could, for the most part, use a similar set of features for both tasks, we had to address the difference in score scales between these two task types.",
        "While we could use multiple regression for scoring the 5-point-scale Opinion task, we had to employ CART trees for the 3-point-scale Picture task, demonstrating that one can not necessarily use one type of scoring model for all tasks.",
        "When moving to low and low-medium entropy tasks, we expect further adaptations, both in terms of the feature set (e.g., the higher importance of pronunciation features in Reading-aloud tasks), and in speech recognition, where more restrictive language models will be needed.",
        "We have reported findings associated with the performance of the scoring models for the Opinion and Picture task types.",
        "Overall, the preliminary findings are quite promising: with a few key speech features, we were able to achieve prediction accuracies that could almost emulate or slightly exceed the agreements between two human raters at task level.",
        "Once we have developed scoring models for all task types, it is conceivable to aggregate the task level scores to produce a total summary score at the test level and it is very likely we would see a much stronger association between human scores and automated scores for the whole test.",
        "The findings also suggest that task-specific modeling efforts did not seem to be necessary for the two task types investigated.",
        "This does not preclude the possibility, though, that task-specific scoring models are superior for other task types in which the expected content is much more restricted (such as the Constrained short-answer questions)."

        "We have demonstrated that by using a three-stage architecture of automatic speech recognition, feature computation, and scoring models, we are able to achieve some degree of success in generating automated scores for two task types of a spoken language test with a wide variation in entropy in its tasks.",
        "The agreement between machine scores and human scores comes close to or reaches the interhuman agreement levels for these two tasks.",
        "In future work, we will switch our focus to task types that elicit more constrained speech (such as the Reading-aloud tasks and Constrained short-answer questions).",
        "In the meantime, we will continue to refine and evaluate the preliminary scoring models developed in this paper.",
        "In particular, we will explore cumulative logit models for tasks that are on a 0-3 point scale and compare the results to those of CART models.",
