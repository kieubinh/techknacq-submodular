        "Language practice that includes meaningful interaction is a critical component of many current language teaching theories.",
        "At the same time, existing research on intelligent computer-aided language learning (ICALL) systems has focused primarily on providing practice with grammatical forms.",
        "For most ICALL systems, although form assessment often involves the use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the need for sophisticated content assessment of a learner response is limited by restricting the kinds of activities offered in order to tightly control the variation allowed in learner responses, i.e., only one or very few forms can be used by the learner to express the correct content.",
        "Yet many of the activities that language instructors typically use in real language-learning settings support a significant degree of variation in correct answers and in turn require both form and content assessment for answer evaluation.",
        "Thus, there is a real need for ICALL systems that provide accurate content assessment.",
        "While some meaningful activities are too unrestricted for ICALL systems to provide effective content assessment, where the line should be drawn on a spectrum of language exercises is an open question.",
        "Different language-learning exercises carry different expectations with respect to the level and type of linguistic variation possible across learner responses.",
        "In turn, these expectations may be linked to the learning goals underlying the activity design, the cognitive skills required to respond to the activity, or other properties of the activity.",
        "To develop adequate processing strategies for content assessment, it is important to understand the connection between exercises and expected variation, as conceptualized by the exercise spectrum shown in Figure 1, because the level of variation imposes requirements and limitations on different processing strategies.",
        "At one extreme of the spectrum, there are tightly restricted exercises requiring minimal analysis in order to assess content.",
        "At the other extreme are unrestricted exercises requiring extensive form and content analysis to assess content.",
        "In this work, we focus on determining whether shallow content-analysis techniques can be used to perform content assessment for activities in the space between the extremes.",
        "A good test case in this middle ground are loosely restricted reading comprehension (RC) questions.",
        "From a teaching perspective, they are a task that is common in real-life learning situations, they combine elements of comprehension and production, and they are a meaningful activity suited to an ICALL setting.",
        "From a processing perspective, responses exhibit linguistic variation on lexical, morphological, syntactic and semantic levels - yet the intended contents of the answer is predictable so that an instructor can define target responses.",
        "Since variation is possible across learner responses in activities in the middle ground of the spectrum, we propose a shallow content assessment approach which supports the comparison of target and learner responses on several levels including token, chunk and relation.",
        "We present an architecture for a content assessment module (CAM) which provides this flexibility using multiple surface-based matching strategies and existing language processing tools.",
        "For an empirical evaluation, we collected a corpus of language learner data consisting exclusively of responses to short-answer reading comprehension questions by intermediate English language learners."

        "The system takes as input the learner response and one or more target responses, along with the question and the source reading passage.",

        "The question text is used for pronoun resolution and to eliminate concepts that are \"given\" (cf. Halliday, 1967, p. 204 and many others since).",

        "The few ICALL systems that have been successfully integrated into real-life language teaching, such as German Tutor (Heift, 2001) and BANZAI (Nagata, 2002), also tightly control expected response variation through deliberate exercise type choices that limit acceptable responses.",
        "Content assessment in the German Tutor is performed by string matching against the stored targets.",
        "Because of the tightly controlled exercise types and lack of variation in the expected input, the assumption that any variation in a learner response is due to form error, rather than legitimate variation, is a reasonable one.",
        "The recently developed TAGARELA system for learners of Portuguese (Amaral and Meurers, 2006; Amaral, 2007) lifts some of the restrictions on exercise types, while relying on shallow semantic processing.",
        "using strategies inspired by our work, TAGARELA incorporates simple content assessment for evaluating learner responses in short-answer questions.",
        "ICALL system designs that do incorporate more sophisticated content assessment include FreeText (L'Haire and Faltin, 2003), the Military Language Tutor (MILT) Program (Kaplan et al., 1998), and Herr Kommissar (DeSmedt, 1995).",
        "These systems restrict both the exercise types and domains to make content assessment feasible using deeper semantic processing strategies.",
        "Beyond the ICALL domain, work in automatic grading of short answers and essays has addressed whether the students answers convey the correct meaning, but these systems focus on largely scoring rather than diagnosis (e.g., E-rater, Burstein and Chodorow, 1999), do not specifically address language learning contexts and/or are designed to work specifically with longer texts (e.g., AutoTu-tor, Wiemer-Hastings et al., 1999).",
        "Thus, the extent to which ICALL systems can diagnose meaning errors in language learner responses has been far from clear.",
        "As far as we are aware, no directly comparable systems performing content-assessment on related language learner data exist.",
        "The closest related system that does a similar kind of detection is the Crater system (Leacock, 2004).",
        "That system obtains 85% accuracy.",
        "However, the test set and scoring system were different, and the system was applied to responses from native English speakers.",
        "In addition, their work focused on detection of errors rather than diagnosis.",
        "So, the results are not directly comparable.",
        "Nevertheless, the CAM detection results clearly are competitive."

        "After motivating the need for content assessment in ICALL, in this paper we have discussed an approach for content assessment of English language learner responses to short answer reading comprehension questions, which is worked out in detail in Bailey (2008).",
        "We discussed an architecture which relies on shallow processing strategies and achieves an accuracy approaching 90% for content error detection on a learner corpus we collected from learners completing the exercises assigned in a real-life ESL class.",
        "Even for the small data sets available in the area of language learning, it turns out that machine learning can be effective for combining the evidence from various shallow matching features.",
        "The good performance confirms the viability of using shallow NLP techniques for meaning error detection.",
        "By developing and testing this model, we hope to contribute to bridging the gap between what is practical and feasible from a processing perspective and what is desirable from the perspective of current theories of language instruction."
