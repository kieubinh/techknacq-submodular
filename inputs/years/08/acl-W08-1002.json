        "The literature on HPSG parsing of German has almost exclusively been concerned with issues of theoretical adequacy and parsing efficiency.",
        "In contrast to LFG parsing of German, or even to HPSG work on English or Japanese, very little effort has been spent on the question of how the intended, or, for that matter a likely parse, can be extracted from the HPSG parse forest of some German sentence.",
        "This issue becomes all the more pressing, as the grammars gain in coverage, inevitably increasing their ambiguity.",
        "In this paper, I shall present preliminary results on probabilistic parse selection for a large-scale HPSG of German, building on technology developed in the Lingo Redwoods project (Oepen et al., 2002).",
        "*The research reported here has been carried out at the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI GmbH) as part of the projects COLLATE, QALL-ME, and Checkpoint, funded by the German Federal Ministery for education and Science (BMBF), the European Union, and the State of Berlin, respectively.",
        "I am also greatly indepted to my colleagues Bernd Kiefer and Giinter Neumann, as well as to Stephan Oepen and Dan Flickinger for support and comments relating to the work presented here.",
        "The paper is organised as follows: in section 2, I shall give a brief overview of the grammar.",
        "Section 3 discusses the treebanking effort we have undertaken (3.1), followed by a presentation of the parse selection results we achieve using probabilistic models trained on different feature sets (3.2)."

      "heading": "2. The grammar",
      "text": [
        "The grammar used in the experiments reported here has originally been developed, at DFKI, in the context of the Verbmobil project (Muller and Kasper, 2000).",
        "Developed initially for the PAGE development and processing platform (Uszkoreit et al., 1994), the grammar has subsequently been ported to by Stefan Muller.",
        "Since 2002, the grammar has been extended and modified by Berthold Crysmann (Crysmann, 2003; Crysmann, 2005; Crysmann, 2007).",
        "The grammar, codename GG, is a large scale HPSG grammar for German, freely available under an open-source license: it consists of roughly 4000 types, out of which 290 are parametrised lexical types, used in the definition of about 35,000 lexical entries.",
        "The lexicon is further extended by 44 lexical rules and about 300 inflectional rules.",
        "On the syntactic side, the grammar has about 80 phrase structure rules.",
        "The grammar covers all major aspects of German clausal and phrasal syntax, including free word order in the clausal domain, long-distance dependencies, complex predicates, passives, and extraposition (Crysmann, 2005).",
        "Furthermore, the grammar covers different coordination constructions, including the so-called SGF coordination.",
        "Furthermore, the grammar is fully reversible, i.e. it can be used for parsing, as well as generation.",
        "The phrase structure rules of the grammar are either unary or binary branching phrase structure schemata, permitting free interspersal of modifiers between complements in the clausal domain.",
        "The relatively free order of complements is captured by means of lexical rules which permute the elements on the COMPS valence list.",
        "As a result, the verb's complements can be saturated in any order.",
        "The treatment of verb placement is somewhat special: in sentences without a right sentence bracket, a left branching structure is assumed, permitting efficient processing.",
        "Whenever the right bracket is occupied by a non-finite verb cluster, the finite verb in the left bracket is related to the clause finla cluster by means of simulated head movement, following the proposal by (Kiss and Wesche, 1991), inter alia.",
        "As a consequence, the grammar provides both head-initial and head-final versions of the Head-Adjunct, Head-Complement and Head-Subject schemata.",
        "As output, the grammar delivers detailed semantic representations in the form of Minimal Recursion Semantics (Copestake et al., 2005).",
        "These representations have been successfully used in the context of automated email response or question answering (Frank et al., 2006).",
        "Most recently, the grammar has been used for automatic correction of grammar and style errors, combining robust parsing with generation."

        "The treebank used in the experiments reported here has been derived from the German subset of the Verbmobil (Wahlster, 2000) corpus.",
        "In essence, we removed any duplicates on the string level from the corpus, in order to reduce the amount of subsequent manual annotation.",
        "Many of the duplicates thus removed were short interjection, such as ja \"yes\", nein \"no\", or hm \"euhm\", which do not give rise to any interesting structural ambiguities.",
        "As a side effect, removal of these duplicates also enhanced the quality of the resulting treebank.",
        "The construction of the disambiguated treebank for German followed the procedure suggested for",
        "English by (Oepen et al., 2002): the corpus was first analysed with the German HPSG GG, storing the derivation trees of all successful parses.",
        "In a subsequent annotation step, we manually selected the best parse, if any, from the parse forest, using the Redwoods annotation tool cited above.",
        "After removal of duplicates, syntactic coverage of the corpus figured at 69.3 percent, giving a total of 11894 out of 16905 sentences.",
        "The vast majority of sentences in the corpus are between 1 and 15 words in length (14757): as a result, average sentence length of parsed utterances figures at 7.64, compared to 8.72 for the entire corpus.",
        "Although average sentence length is comparatively low, the treebank still contains items up to sentence length 47.",
        "The 11894 successfully parsed sentences have subsequently been disambiguated with the Redwoods treebanking tool, which is built on top of LKB (Copestake, 2001) and [incr tsdb()] (Oepen, 2002).",
        "Figure 2 shows the annotation of an example sentence from the treebank.",
        "During annotation, 10356 sentences were successfully disambiguated to a single reading (87.1%).",
        "Another 276 sentences were also disambiguated, yet contain some unresolved ambiguity (2.3%), while 95 sentences were left unannotated (0.8%).",
        "The remaining 1167 items (=9.8%) were rejected, since the parse forest did not contain the desired reading.",
        "Since not all test items in the tree bank were ambiguous, we were left, after manual disambiguation, with 8230 suitable test items, i.e. test items where the number of readings assigned by the parser exceeds the number of readings judged as acceptable.",
        "Average ambiguity of fully disambiguated sentences in the tree bank is around 12.7 trees per sentence.",
        "This corresponds to a baseline of 21.4% for random parse selection, owing to the unequal distribution of low and high ambiguity sentences.",
        "The parse selection experiments reported on here have been performed using the LOGON branch of the LKB and [incr tsdb()] systems.",
        "In particular, we used Rob Malouf's tadm maximum entropy toolkit for training and evaluation of our log-linear parse selection models.",

        "All experiments were carried out as a tenfold cross-evaluation with 10 iterations, using 10 different sets of 7407 annotated sentences for training and 10 disjoint sets of 823 test items for testing.",
        "The discriminative models we evaluate here were trained on different subsets of features, all of which were extracted from the rule backbone of the derivations stored in the treebank.",
        "As node labels, we used the names of the HPSG rules licensing a phrasal node, as well as the types of lexical entries (preter-minals).",
        "On the basis of these derivation trees, we selected several features for training our disambiguation models: local trees of depth 1, several levels of grandparenting, i.e. inclusion of grandparent node (GP 2), great-grandparent node (GP 3) and great-great-grandparent node (GP 4), partial trees of depth 1 (+AE).",
        "Grandparenting features involve local trees of depth 1 plus a sequence of grandparent nodes, i.e. the local tree is contextualised in relation to the dominating tree.",
        "Information about a grandparent's other daughters, however, is not taken into consideration.",
        "Partial trees, by contrast, are included as a kind of back-off model.",
        "In addition to tree-configurational features, we experimented with n-gram models, using n-gram sizes between 2 and 4.",
        "These models were further varied, according to whether or not a back-off model was included.",
        "Apart from these linguistic features, we also varied two parameters of the maximum entropy learner, viz. variance and relative tolerance.",
        "The relative tolerance parameter restricts convergence of the model, whereas variance defines a prior in order to reduce over-fitting.",
        "In the results reported here, we used optimal setting for each individual set of linguistic parameters, although, in most cases, these optimal values figured at 10-4 for variance and 10-6 for relative tolerance.",
        "The results of our parse selection experiments for German are summarised in tables 1 and 2, as well as figures 3 and 4.",
        "As our major result, we can report an exact match accuracy for parse selection of 81.72%, using great-grandparenting (GP 3) and 4-grams.",
        "This result corresponds to an error reduction by a factor of 3.8, as compared to the 21.4% random baseline.",
        "Apart from the overall result in terms of achievable parse selection accuracy, a comparison of the individual results is also highly informative.",
        "As illustrated by figure 3, models including any level of grandparenting clearly outperform the basic model without grandparenting (GP0).",
        "Furthermore, relative gains with increasing levels of grandparenting are quite low, compared to the more than 3% increase in accuracy between the GP0 and GP2 models.",
        "Another interesting observation regarding the data in table 1 and figure 3 is that the inclusion of partial constituents into the model (+AE) only benefits the most basic model.",
        "Once the more sophisticated grandparenting models are used, partial constituent worsen rather than improve the overall performance.",
        "Another observation we made regarding the relative usefulness of the features we have employed relates to n-gram models: again, we find that n-gram models clearly improve on the basic model without grandparenting (by about 1 percentage point), albeit to a lesser degree than grandparenting itself(see above).",
        "With grandparenting added, however, the relative gains of the n-gram models greatly diminishes.",
        "A possible explanation for this finding is that reference to grandparenting indirectly makes available information about the preceding and linear context, obviating the need for direct encoding in terms of n-grams.",
        "Again, the best combined model (hierarchy + n-grams) outperforms the best purely hierarchical model by a mere O.23 percentage points.",
        "The results obtained here for German thus replicate the results established earlier for English, namely that the inclusion of n-gram information only improves overall parse selection to a less significant extent.",
        "A probably slightly unsurprising result relates to the use of back-off models: we found that n-gram models with backing-off yielded better results throughout our test field than the correspoding n-gram models that did not use this feature.",
        "Differences, however, were not dramatic, ranging roughly between O.O7 and O.3 percentage points.",
        "The results obtained here for German compare quite well to the results previously achieved for the ERG, a broad coverage HPSG for English: using a similar treebank (Toutanova et al., 2OO2) report 81.8O exact match accuracy for a log-linear model with local trees plus ancestor information, the model which is closest to the models we have evaluated here.",
        "The baseline in their experiments is 25.81.",
        "The best model they obtain includes semantic dependencies, as well, yielding 82.65 exact match accuracy.",
        "Probably the most advanced approach to parse selection for German is (Forst, 2OO7): using a broad coverage LFG grammar, he reports an f-score of 83% of correctly assigned dependency triples for a reference corpus of manually annotated newspaper text.",
        "However, it is unclear how these figures relate to the exact match accuracy used here.",
        "Relevant, in principle, to our discussion here, are also the results obtained with treebank grammars for German: (Dubey and Keller, 2OO3) have trained a PCFG on the Negra corpus (Skut et al., 1998), reporting labelled precision and recall between 7O and 75%.",
        "(Kubler et al., 2OO6) essentially confirm these results for the Negra treebank, but argue instead that probabilistic parsing for German can reach far better results (around 89%), once a different treebank is chosen, e.g. Tuba-D/Z.",
        "However, it is quite difficult to interpret the significance of these two treebank parsers for our purposes here: not only is the evaluation metric an entirely different one, but so are the parsing task and the corpus.",
        "In an less recent paper, however, (Ruland, 2OOO) reports on probabilistic parsing of Verbmobil data using a probabilistic LR-parser.",
        "The parser has been trained on a set of 19,75O manually annotated sentences.",
        "Evaluation of the parser was then performed on a holdout set of 1OOO sentences.",
        "In addition to labelled precision and recall, (Ruland, 2OOO) also report exact match, which figures at 46.3%.",
        "Using symbolic postprocessing, exact match improves to as much as 53.8%.",
        "Table 3.2.2 summarizes Ru-land's results, permitting a comparison between exact match and PARSEVAL measures.",
        "Although the test sets are certainly not fully comparable, these figures at least gives us an indication about how to judge the the performance of the HPSG parse selection models presented here: multiplying our 69.3% coverage with 81.72% exact match accuracy still gives us an overall exact match accuracy of 56.6% for the entire corpus.",
