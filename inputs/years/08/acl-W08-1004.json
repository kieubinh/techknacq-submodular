        "Between the two extremes of constituency treebanks for English and dependency treebanks for free word order languages such as Czech lie languages such as German, for which two different treebanks have explored different options for encoding topology and dependency, Negra (Brants et al., 1999) and TiiBa-D/Z (Telljo-hann et al., 2005).",
        "Recent research has started addressing the question of how parsers trained on these different syntactic resources differ in their performance.",
        "Such work must also address the question of how to conduct a meaningful evaluation of the parsing results across such a range of syntactic representations.",
        "In this paper, we show that previous work comparing PCFG parsing for the two German treebanks used representations which cannot adequately be compared using the given PARSEVAL measures and that a grammatical dependency evaluation is more meaningful than the grammatical function evaluation provided.",
        "We present the first comparison of Negra and TuBa-D/Z using a labeled dependency evaluation based on the grammatical function labels provided in the corpora.",
        "We show that, in contrast to previous literature, a labeled dependency evaluation establishes that PCFG parsers trained on the two corpora give similar parsing performance.",
        "The focus on labeled dependencies also provides a direct link to recent work on dependency-based evaluation (e.g., Clark and Curran, 2007) and dependency parsing (e.g., CoNLL shared tasks 2006, 2007).",
        "The question of how to evaluate parser output has naturally already arisen in earlier work on parsing English.",
        "As discussed by Lin (1995) and others, the PARSEVAL evaluation typically used to analyze the performance of statistical parsing models has many drawbacks.",
        "Bracketing evaluation may count a single error multiple times and does not differentiate between errors that significantly affect the interpretation of the sentence and those that are less crucial.",
        "It also does not allow for evaluation of particular syntactic structures or provide meaningful information about where the parser is failing.",
        "In addition, and most directly relevant for this paper, PARSE-VAL scores are difficult to compare across syntactic annotation schemes (Carroll et al., 2003).",
        "At the same time, previous research on PCFG parsing using treebank training data present PAR-SEVAL measures in comparing the parsing performance for different languages and annotation schemes, reporting a number of striking differences.",

        "In related work, parser enhancements that provide a significant performance boost for English, such as head lexicalization, are reported not to provide the same kind of improvement, if any, for German (Dubey and Keller, 2003; Dubey, 2004; Kubler et al., 2006).",

        "A dependency-based evaluation on triples of the form word-POS-head shows better results for the parser trained on Tiger even though the much lower PARSEVAL scores, if meaningful, would predict that the output for Tiger is of lower quality.",
        "However, their dependency-based evaluation does not make use of the grammatical function labels, which are provided in the corpora and closely correspond to the representations used in recent work on formalism-independent evaluation of parsers (e.g., Clark and",
        "Addressing these issues, we resolve the apparent discrepancy between Kubler et al.",

        "We also extend the evaluation to a labeled dependency evaluation based on grammatical relations for both corpora.",
        "Such an evaluation, which abstracts away from the specifics of the annotation schemes, shows that, in contrast to the claims made in Kubler et al.",

        "As motivated in the introduction, the work discussed in this paper is based on two German corpora, Ne-gra and TuBa-D/Z, which differ significantly in the syntactic representations used - thereby offering an interesting test bed for investigating the influence of an annotation scheme on the parsers trained.",
        "The Negra corpus (Brants et al., 1999) consists of newspaper text from the Frankfurter Rundschau, a German newspaper.",
        "Version 2 of the corpus contains 20,602 sentences.",
        "It uses the STTS tag set (Schiller etal., 1995) for part-of-speech annotation.",
        "There are 25 non-terminal node labels and 46 edge labels.",
        "The syntactic annotation of Negra combines features from phrase structure grammar and dependency grammar using a treelike syntactic structure with grammatical functions labeled on the edges of the tree.",
        "Flat sentence structures are used in many places to avoid attachment ambiguities and non-branching phrases are not used.",
        "The annotation scheme emphasizes the use of the tree structure to encode grammatical dependencies, representing a head and all its dependents within a local tree regardless of whether a dependent is realized near its head or not, e.g., because it has been extraposed or fronted.",
        "Since traditional syntax trees do not permit the crossing branches needed to license discontinuous constituents, Negra uses a \"syntax graph\" data structure to represent the annotation.",
        "An example of a syntax graph with a discontinuous constituent (VP) due to a fronted dative object (NP) is shown in Figure 1.",
        "Dieser Meinung kann ich nur voll zustimmen .",
        "PDAT NN VMFIN PPER ADV ADJD VVINF $.",
        "Negra uses flat NP and PP annotation with no marked heads.",
        "For example, both Dieser and Meinung in Figure 1 have the grammatical function label \"NK\".",
        "Since unary branching is not used in Negra, a bare noun or pronoun argument is not dominated by an NP node, as shown by the pronoun ich above.",
        "A verbal head in Negra is always marked with the edge label \"HD\" and its arguments are its sisters in the local tree.",
        "The subject is always the sister of the finite verb, which is a daughter of S. If the finite verb is the main verb in the clause, the objects are also its sisters, i.e., the finite verb, subject and objects are all daughters of S. If the main verb is an auxiliary governing a non-finite main verb, the non-finite verb and its objects and modifiers form a VP where the objects are sisters of the non-finite verb as in Figure 1.",
        "The VP is then a sister of the finite verb.",
        "The finite verb in a German declarative clause appears in the so-called verb-second position, immediately following the fronted constituent.",
        "As a result, the VP in Negra is discontinuous whenever one of its children has been fronted, as in the common word orders exemplified in (1a) and (1b).",

        "Syntactically it uses 27 non-terminal node labels and 47 edge labels.",
        "The syntactic annotation incorporates a topological field analysis of the German clause (Reis, 1980; Hohle, 1986), which segments a sentence into topological units depending on the position of the finite verb (verb-first, verb-second, verb-last).",
        "In a verb-first and verb-second sentence, the finite verb is the left bracket (LK), whereas in a verb-last subordinate clause, the subordinating conjunction occupies that field.",
        "In all clauses, the non-finite verb cluster forms the right bracket (VC), and arguments and modifiers can appear in the middle field (MF) between the two brackets.",
        "Extraposed material is found to the right of the right bracket, and in a verb-second sentence one constituent appears in the fronted field (VF) preceding the finite verb.",
        "By specifying constraints on the elements that can occur in the different fields, the word order in any type of German clause can be concisely characterized.",
        "Each clause in the TuBa-D/Z corpus is divided into topological fields at the top level, and each topological field contains phrase-level annotation.",

        "For example, in Figure 2 the subject noun chunk (NX) has the edge label ON (object - nominative) and the object noun chunk has the edge label OA (object - accusative); both are realized within the middle field (MF), while the finite verb (VXFIN) marked as HD (head) is in the left sentence bracket (LK).",
        "This issue becomes relevant in section 3.4.2, discussing an evaluation based on labeled dependency triples.",
        "Where Negra uses discontinuous constituents, TuBa-D/Z uses special edge labels to annotate grammatical relations which are not locally realized.",
        "For example, the fronted prepositional phrase (PX) in Figure 2 has the edge label OA-MOD which needs to be matched with the noun phrase (NX) with label OA that is found in the MF field.",
        "To give an impression of how the different annotation schemes affect the appearance of a typical tree in the two corpora, Table 1 provides statistics on average sentence length and the number of nonterminals per sentence.",
        "While the sentences in Negra and TuBa-D/Z on average have the same number of words, the average TuBa-D/Z sentence has nearly three times as many non-terminal nodes as the average Negra sentence.",
        "This difference is mainly due to the extra level of topological fields annotation and the use of more contoured structures in many places where Negra uses flatter structures."

        "As we saw in section 2, Negra and TuBa-D/Z use very different syntactic annotation schemes, resulting in over 2.5 times as many non-terminals per sentence in TuBa-D/Z as in Negra with the additional unary nodes.",
        "As mentioned previously, Rehbein and van Genabith (2007a) showed that PARSEVAL is affected by the ratio of terminal to non-terminal nodes, so these results are not expected to indicate the quality of the parses.",

        "Comparing PARSEVAL scores for a parser trained on the Negra and the TuBa-D/Z corpus with a grammatical function and a labeled dependency evaluation, we confirm that the PARSEVAL scores do not correlate with the scores in the other two evaluations, which given their closeness to the semantic functor argument structure make meaningful targets for evaluating parsers.",
        "Shifting the focus to the grammatical function evaluation, we showed that a grammatical function evaluation based on phrasal arguments as provided by Kubler et al.",
        "(2006) is inadequate for comparing parsers trained on the Negra and TuBa-D/Z corpora.",
        "By introducing non-branching phrase nodes above single-word arguments in Negra, it is possible to provide a balanced comparison for the grammatical function label evaluation between Negra and TuBa-D/Z on both phrasal and single-word arguments.",
        "The models trained on both corpora perform very similarly in the grammatical function evaluation, in contrast to the claims in Kubler et al.",
        "(2006).",
        "When the grammatical function label evaluation is extended into a labeled dependency evaluation by finding the verbal head to complete the labeled dependency triple, the parser trained on Negra outperforms that trained on TuBa-D/Z.",
        "The more significant drop in results for TuBa-D/Z compared to the grammatical function label evaluation may be due to the fact that a verbal lexical head in TuBa-D/Z is not in the same local tree as its dependents, whereas it is in Negra.",
        "The presence of intervening topological field nodes in TuBa-D/Z may make it difficult for the parser to consistently identify the elements of the dependency triple across several subtrees.",
        "The Negra corpus annotation scheme makes it simple to identify the heads of verb arguments, but the flat NP and PP structures make it difficult to extend a labeled dependency analysis beyond verb arguments.",
        "On the other hand, TuBa-D/Z has marked heads in NPs and PPs, but it is not as easy to pair verb arguments with their heads because the verbs are in separate topological fields from their arguments.",
        "For a constituent-based corpus annotation scheme to lend itself to a thorough labeled dependency evaluation, heads should be marked clearly for all phrase categories and all non-head elements need to have marked grammatical functions.",

        "The presence of topological field nodes in TuBa-D/Z deserves more discussion in relation to a grammatical dependency evaluation.",
        "The corpus contains two very different types of nodes in its syntactic trees: nodes such as NP and PP that correspond to constituents and nodes such as VF (Vorfeld) and MF (Mittelfeld) that correspond to word order domains.",
        "Constituents such as NP have grammatical relations to other elements in the sentence and have identifiable heads within them, whereas nodes encoding word order domains have neither.",
        "While constituents and word order domains sometimes coincide, such as the Vorfeld normally consisting of a single constituent, this is not the general case.",
        "For example, the Mittelfeld often contains multiple constituents which each stand in different grammatical relations to the verb(s) in the left and right sentence brackets (LK and VC).",
        "Returning to the issue of finding dependencies between constituents, the intervening word order domain nodes can make it non-trivial to determine these relations in TuBa-D/Z.",
        "For example, word order domain nodes will always intervene between a verb and its arguments.",
        "In order to have all grammatical dependencies directly encoded in the treebank, it would be preferable for corpus annotation schemes to ensure that a homogeneous constituency representation can be easily obtained."

        "An evaluation on arguments of verbs is just a first step in working towards a more complete labeled dependency evaluation.",
        "Because Negra and TuBa-D/Z do not have parallel uses of many grammatical function labels beyond arguments of verbs, a more detailed evaluation on more types of dependency relations will require a complex dependency conversion method to provide comparable results.",
        "Since previous work on head-lexicalized parsing models for German has focused on PARSEVAL evaluations, it would also be useful to perform a labeled dependency evaluation to determine what effect head lexicalization has on particular constructions for the parsers.",
        "Because of the concerns discussed in the previous section and the difference in which types of clauses have marked heads in Negra and TuBa-D/Z, the effect of head lexicalization on the parsing results may differ for the two corpora."

        "Addressing the general question of how to compare parsing results for different annotation schemes, we revisited the comparison ofPCFG parsing results for the Negra and TuBa-D/Z corpora.",
        "We show that these different annotation schemes lead to very significant differences in PARSEVAL scores for un-lexicalized PCFG parsing models, but grammatical function label and labeled dependency evaluations for arguments of verbs show that this difference does not carry over to measures which are relevant to the semantic functor-argument structure.",
        "In contrast to Kubler et al.",
        "(2006) a grammatical function evaluation on subjects, accusative objects, and dative objects establishes that Negra and TuBa-D/Z perform similarly when all types of words and phrases appearing as arguments are taken into consideration.",
        "A labeled dependency evaluation based on grammatical relations, which links this work to current work on formalism-independent parser evaluation (e.g., Clark and Curran, 2007), shows that the parsing performance for Negra and TuBa-D/Z is comparable."
