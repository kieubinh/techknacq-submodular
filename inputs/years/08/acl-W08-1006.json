        "We additionally explore parsing with the inclusion of grammatical function information.",

      "text": [
        "Recent papers provide mixed evidence as to whether techniques that increase statistical parsing performance for English also improve German parsing performance (Dubey and Keller, 2003; Kubler et al., 2006).",
        "We provide a systematic exploration of this topic to shed light on what techniques might benefit German parsing and show general trends in the relative performance increases for each technique.",
        "While these results vary across treebanks, due to differences in annotation schemes as discussed by Kubler (2005), we also find similarities and provide explanations for the trend differences based on the annotation schemes.",
        "We address three parsing techniques: (i) Markovization, (ii) lexicalization, and (iii) state splitting (i.e., subcategorization).",
        "These techniques are not independent, and we thus examine how lexicalization and Markovization interact, since lexicalization for German has been the most contentious area in the literature.",
        "Many of these techniques have been investigated in other work (Schiehlen, 2004; Dubey, 2004; Dubey, 2005), but, we hope that by consolidating, replicating, improving, and clarifying previous results we can contribute to the re-evaluation of German probabilistic parsing after a somewhat confusing start to initial literature in this area.",
        "One feature of German that differs markedly from English is substantial free word order.",
        "This requires the marking of grammatical functions on phrases to indicate their syntactic function in sentences (subject, object, etc.",
        "), whereas for English these functions can be derived from configurations (Chomsky, 1965; de Marneffe et al., 2006).",
        "While some similar functions are present in English treebanks, they are used more frequently in German treebanks and many more unique functions and category-function pairings exist.",
        "Because of the relatively free word ordering in German, the usefulness of parses is substantially increased by generating them with this information.",
        "We demonstrate the difficulties introduced by naively concatenating these functions to categories and how this treatment interacts with the other parsing techniques.",
        "There are several avenues for improving this situation in future work.",
        "The versions of the treebanks we use here do not include case information in part-of-speech tags and we do",
        "Table 1: Size in sentences of treebanks used in this paper.",
        "\"Tiger\" and \"TuBa-D/Z\" refer to the corpora prepared for the ACL-08 workshop shared task; the full Tiger corpus is much larger.",
        "Our Negra results are on the test set.",
        "not use any morphological analyzer; this should be rectified in future work.",
        "A new parsing model could be written to treat separate grammatical functions for nodes as first class objects, rather than just concatenating phrasal categories and functions.",
        "Finally, assignment of grammatical functions could be left to a separate post-processing phase, which could exploit not only case information inside noun phrases but joint information across the subcategorization frames of predicates."

      "heading": "2. Methodology",
      "text": [
        "We use the Stanford Parser (Klein and Manning, 2003b) for all experiments.",
        "An advantage of this parser for baseline experiments is that it provides clean, simple implementations of component models, with many configuration options.",
        "We show results in most instances for evaluations both with and without grammatical functions and with and without gold tags.",
        "When training and parsing with the inclusion of grammatical functions, we treat each pairing of basic category and grammatical function as one new category.",
        "Rules are learned for each such category with a separate orthographic form, with no attempt to learn general rules for nodes with the same basic category but different functions.",
        "Clearly, more sophisticated methods of handling grammatical functions exist, but our focus is on providing baseline results that are easily replicable by others.",
        "We focus primarily on the TuiBa-D/Z and Tiger corpora, training on the training sets for the ACL 2008 Workshop on Parsing German shared task and providing ablation results based on development set performance.",
        "Additionally, we show a limited number of results on the Negra corpus, using the standard training/development/test splits, defined in (Dubey and Keller, 2003).",
        "The sizes of these data sets are shown in table 1."

      "heading": "3. Markovization",
      "text": [
        "Previous work has shown that adding vertical Markovization ((grand-)parent annotation) and using horizontal Markovization can greatly improve English parsing performance (Klein and Manning, 2003a).",
        "Several papers have already reported partially corresponding results on German: Schiehlen (2004) and Dubey (2004) reported gains of several percent for unlexicalized parsing on Negra; Kubler et al.",
        "(2006) agreed with these results for Negra, but suggests that they do not hold for TuBa-D/Z.",
        "We extend these results by examining a variety of combinations of Markovization parameters for all three corpora (TuBa-D/Z, Tiger, and Negra) in table 2.",
        "No results presented here do include grammatical functions; we present results on the interaction between these functions and Markovization in section 4.",
        "For TuBa-D/Z, we see that adding vertical Markovization provides a substantial performance gain of about 2% (vertical Markovization = 2) for all levels of horizontal Markovization; increasing vertical Markovization improves performance only slightly further.",
        "Decreasing horizontal Markovization from the default of infinity for a standard PCFG also provides marginal gains, and decreases the number of rules learned by the parser, creating a more compact grammar.",
        "The results of Markovization on the Tiger and Negra corpora illustrate the problems of a large grammar.",
        "While a modest improvement is found by using parent annotation (vertical Markovization = 2) when horizontal Markovization is small, increasing either horizontal or vertical Markovization past this point decreases performance due to sparsity.",
        "Thus, while the general results concerning Markovization from English hold, the size of performance increase is affected appreciably by the annotation strategy.",
        "In table 3, we show a subset of the results of various Markovization parameters when gold part-of-speech tags are used, focusing on models that performed well without gold tags and that produce relatively compact grammars.",
        "Gold tags provide 2-3% absolute improvement in F1 over tagging while parsing; slightly greater improvements are seen when the PCFG model is used individually (3-4% absolute improvement), and absolute improvement does not vary greatly between treebanks.",
        "These results are",
        "Table 2: Factored parsing results for TuiBa-D/Z, Tiger, and Negra when tagging is done by the parser.",
        "Numbers in italics show difference between factored parser and PCFG, where improvements over the PCFG are positive.",
        "comparable to Maier (2006), which found 3-6% improvement using an unlexicalized PCFG; these absolute improvements hold despite the fact that the Maier (2006) parser has results with 2-4% absolute lower F1 than those in this paper."

      "heading": "4. Inclusion of Grammatical Functions",
      "text": [
        "In this section we examine how the addition of grammatical functions for training and evaluation affects performance.",
        "As noted previously, we add grammatical functions simply by concatenating them to the dependent phrasal categories and calling each unique symbol a PCFG nonterminal; this is an obvious way to adapt an existing PCFG parser, but not a sophisticated model of grammatical functions.",
        "We also present our shared task results (table 6).",
        "As shown in table 4, the inclusion of grammatical functions decreases performance by 10-15% for both treebanks.",
        "This is partially due to the increase in grammar size, creating less supporting evidence for each rule, and the fact that the parser must now discriminate amongst more categories.",
        "The larger grammar is particularly problematic for Tiger due to its flat annotation style.",
        "Adding gold tags (table 5) increases performace by 2-3%, a similar gain to that for the parsers without grammatical functions.",
        "We also see that lexicalization provides smaller gains when grammatical functions are included; we discuss this further in section 5.",

        "Lexicalization shows fairly consistent 2-3% gains on the Negra and Tiger treebanks.",
        "As the number of tags increases, however, such as when grammatical functions are included, gains from lex-icalization are limited due to sparseness.",
        "While useful category splits lessen the need for lexicaliza-tion, we think the diminishing gain is primarily due to problems resulting from the unsmoothed PCFG model.",
        "As the grammar becomes sparser, there are limited opportunities for the lexical dependencies to correct the output of the PCFG grammar under the factored parsing model of Klein and Manning (2003b).",
        "Indeed, as shown in table 8, the grammar becomes sufficiently sparse that for many sentences there is no tree on which the PCFG and dependency grammar can agree, and the parser falls back to simply returning the best PCFG parse.",
        "This falloff, in addition to overall issues of sparsity, helps explain the drop in performance with the addition of grammatical functions: our possible gain from lexicalized parsing is decreased by the increasing rate of failure for the factored parser.",
        "Thus, for future German work to gain from lexicalization, it may be necessary to explore smoothing the grammar or working with a diminished tagset without grammatical functions.",

        "We evaluate performance on identifying unlabeled dependencies between heads and modifiers, extracting dependencies automatically from the parse trees.",
        "Most heads in the TuiBa-D/Z and Tiger treebanks are marked, and we use marked heads when possible for training and evaluation.",
        "When heads were not marked, we used heuristic rules to identify the likely head.",
        "Broadly consistent with the results of Rehbein and van Genabith (2007), Table 9 shows that the disparity in performance between TuiBa-D/Z and Tiger is much smaller when measuring dependency accuracy rather than labeled bracketing F1, especially when using gold tags.",
        "These results also reverse the trend in our other results that adding grammatical functions greatly reduces F1.",
        "While F1 decreases or remains constant when grammatical functions are used with automatic tags, probably reflecting a decrease in accuracy on tags when using grammatical functions, they increase F1 given gold tags.",

        "We found that the three categories had distinctively different patterns of errors, although we unfortunately still do not achieve particularly high F1 for any of the individual pairings of node label and grammatical function.",
        "Note that this analysis differs from that of Kuibler et al.",
        "(2006) due to our analysis of the accuracy of node labels and grammatical functions, rather than only performance on identifying these three grammatical functions (without regards to the correctness of the original node label).",
        "Overall, dative objects occur much less frequently than either of the other two types, and accusative objects occur less frequently than subjects.",
        "Consistent with sparsity causing degradations in performance, for both Tiger and TuiBa-D/Z, we show the best performance on subjects, followed by accusative objects and then dative objects.",
        "For all categories, we find that these functions occur most frequently with noun phrases, and we achieve higher performance when pairing tthem with a noun phrase than with any other basic category.",
        "While Kuibler et al.",
        "(2006) suggests these functions are particularly important for parsing, our low performance on dative objects (F1 between 0.00 and 0.06) may not matter a great deal given that dative objects consist of only 0.42% of development set nodes in TuiBa-D/Z and 0.76% of such nodes in Tiger.",
        "One limiting factor for overall parsing accuracy is roughly defined by the number of local (one-level) trees in the test set that are present in the training set.",
        "While changes such as Markovization may allow rules to be learned that do not correspond directly to such local trees, it is unlikely that many such rules will be created.",
        "Thus, if a local tree in the test set is not represented in the training set, it is unlikely we will be able to correctly parse this sentence.",
        "The number of such local trees and the amount of test set coverage they provide varies widely between TuiBa-D/Z and Tiger.",
        "Without grammatical functions, the training set for TuiBa-D/Z contains 4,532 unique local trees, whereas the training set for Tiger contains 20,957; both have 20,894 complete trees.",
        "Local trees from the training set represent 79.6% of the unique local trees in the development set for TuBa-D/Z, whereas they represent 61.8% of unique local trees in Tiger's development set.",
        "This translates to 99.3% of total local trees in the development set represented in the training set for TuiBa-D/Z versus 92.3% for Tiger.",
        "With grammatical functions, the number of unique local trees increases for both TuBa-D/Z and Tiger (10,464 and 32,614 trees in training, respectively), and total coverage in the development sets drop to 98.6% (TuiBa-D/Z) and 87.7% (Tiger).",
        "Part of the reason for this decrease in coverage with the addition of grammatical functions, and the disparity between corpora, is a large increase in the number of possible categories for each node: from 26 to 139 categories for TuiBa-D/Z and from 24 to 192 categories for Tiger."
