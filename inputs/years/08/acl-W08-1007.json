        "Kubler et al.",

        "Earlier studies by Dubey and Keller (2003) and Dubey (2005) using the Negra treebank (Skut et al., 1997) reports that lexicalization of PCFGs decrease the parsing accuracy when parsing Negra's flat constituent structures.",

        "(2006) present a comparative study that suggests that it is not harder to parse German than for example English.",
        "By contrast, Rehbein and van Genabith (2007) study different parser evaluation metrics by simulating parser errors on two German treebanks (with different treebank annotation schemes) and they claim that the question whether German is harder to parse than English is still undecided.",
        "This paper does not try to answer the question above, but presents a new way of parsing constituent structures that can output the whole structure with all grammatical functions.",
        "The shared task on parsing German was to parse both the constituency version and the dependency version of the two German treebanks: TIGER (Brants et al., 2002) and TuBa-D/Z (Telljohann et al., 2005).",

        "The basic idea of MaltParser is to derive dependency graphs using a greedy parsing algorithm that approximates a globally optimal solution by making a sequence of locally optimal choices.",
        "The system is equipped with several parsing algorithms, but we have chosen to only optimize Nivre's parsing algorithm for both the dependency track and the constituency track.",
        "Nivre's algorithm is a deterministic algorithm for building labeled projective dependency structures in linear time (Nivre, 2006).",
        "There are two essential parameters that can be varied for this algorithm.",
        "The first is the arc order and we selected the arc-eager order that attaches the right dependents to their head as soon as possible.",
        "The second is the stack initialization and we chose to use an empty stack initialization that attaches root dependents with a default root label after completing the left-to-right pass over the input.",
        "The algorithm uses two data structures: a stack to store partially processed tokens and a queue of remaining input tokens.",
        "The arc-eager transitionsystem has four parser actions:",
        "1.",
        "Left-Arc(r): Adds an arc labeled r from the next input token to the top token of the stack, the top token is popped from the stack because it must be complete with respect to left and right dependents at this point.",

        "Right-Arc(r): Adds an arc labeled r from the top token of the stack to the next input token and pushes the next input token onto the stack (because it may have dependents further to the right).",
        "3.",
        "Reduce: Pops the top token of the stack.",
        "This transition can be performed only if the top token has been assigned a head and is needed for popping a node that was pushed in a Rig ht-Arc(r) transition and which has since found all its right dependents.",

        "Shift: Pushes the next input token onto the stack.",
        "This is correct when the next input token has its head to the right or should be attached to the root.",
        "MaltParser uses history-based feature models for predicting the next parser action at nondeterminis-tic choice points.",
        "Previously, MaltParser combined the prediction of the transition with the prediction of the arc label r into one complex prediction with one feature model.",
        "The experiments presented in this paper use another prediction strategy, which divide the prediction of the parser action into several predictions.",
        "First the transition is predicted; if the transition is Shift or Reduce the nondeterminism is resolved, but if the predicted transition is Right-Arc or Left-Arc the parser continues to predict the arc label r. This prediction strategy enables the system to have three different feature models: one for predicting the transition and two for predicting the arc label r (Right-Arc and Left-Arc).",
        "We will see in section 4 that this change makes it more feasible to encode the inverse mapping into complex arc labels for an arbitrary constituent structure without losing any information.",
        "All symbolic features were converted to numerical features and we use the quadratic kernel K(xi,Xj) = (yxJXj + r) of the LIBSVM package (Chang and Lin, 2001) for mapping histories to parser actions and arc labels.",

        "One way of doing this is to traverse the constituent structure from the root node and identify the head-child and the lexical head of all constituent nodes in a recursive depth-first search.",
        "Usually this process is governed by predefined head-finding rules that define the direction of the search for each distinct constituent label.",
        "Moreover, it is quite common that the head-finding rules define some kind of priority lists over which part of speech or grammatical function is the more preferable headchild.",
        "For our experiment on German we have kept this search of the head-child and lexical head very simple.",
        "For the TIGER treebank we perform a left-to-right search to find the leftmost lexical child.",
        "If no lexical child can be found, the head-child of the constituent will be the leftmost constituent child and the lexical head will be the lexical child of the head child recursively.",
        "For the TiiBa-D/Z treebank we got higher accuracy if we varied the direction of search according to the label of the target constituent.",
        "We also tried more complex and linguistically motivated head rules, but unfortunately no improvement in accuracy could be found.",
        "We want to stress that the use of more complex head rules was done late in the parser optimization process and it would not be a surprise if more careful experiments resulted in the opposite conclusion.",
        "Given that all constituents have been assigned a lexical head it is a straightforward process to identify the head and the dependents of all input tokens.",
        "The algorithm investigates, for each input token, the containing constituent's lexical head, and if the token is not the lexical head of the constituent it takes the lexical head as its head in the dependency graph; otherwise the head will be assigned the lexical head of a higher constituent in the structure.",

        "• The constituent labels encode the path of constituent labels from the dependent to the highest constituent of which is the lexical head (with path elements separated by | ).",

        "The constituent structure is shown above the sentence and below we can see the resulting dependency graph after the transformation.",
        "We want to stress that the resulting dependency graph is not linguistically sound, and the main purpose is to demonstrate how a constituent structure can be encoded in a dependency graph that have all information need for the inverse transformation.",

        "For the same reason the lexical head of the constituent SIMPX is the token FUr and this token will be the head of the token Beckmeyer, because SIMPX dominates MF.",
        "In the dependency graph this is illustrated with an arc from the head FUr to its dependent Beckmeyer.",
        "The arc FUr to Beckmeyer is labeled with a complex label (?",
        "?, HD|ON, NX|MF, 2), which consists of four sublabels.",
        "The first sublabel is the grammatical function above MF and because this is missing a dummy label ??",
        "is used instead.",
        "The sublabel HD| ON encodes a sequence of head relations from the lexical head Beckmeyer to MF.",
        "The constituent labels are encoded in the same way in the third sublabel NX| MF.",
        "Finally, the fourth sublabel indicates the attachment level of the constituent MF.",
        "In this case, MF should be attached to the constituent two levels up in the structure with respect to the head FUr.",
        "The two arcs diese to Behauptung and keinen to Nachweis both have the complex arc label (HD, *, *, 0), because the tokens Behauptung and Nachweis are attached to a constituent without being a lexical head of any dominating constituent.",

        "If we compare the dependency graphs in Figure l and Figure 2, we can see large differences.",
        "The more linguistically motivated dependency graph (LDG) in Figure l has a completely difference structure and different arc labels compared to the automatically generated dependency graph (ADG) in Figure 2.",
        "There are several reasons, some of which are listed here:",
        "• Different conversions strategies: LDG is based on a conversion that sometimes leads to non-projective structures for non-local dependencies.",
        "For example, in Figure 2, the extracted PP Für diese Behauptung has the grammatical function OAMOD, which indicates that it is a modifier (MOD) of a direct object (OA) elsewhere in the structure (in this case keinen Nachweis).",
        "In LDG, this is converted to a non-projective dependency from Nachweis to Für (with the label PP).",
        "No such transformtion is",
        "attempted in ADC, which simply attaches Fur to the lexical head ofthe containing constituent.",
        "• Different head-finding rules: ADG are derived without almost no rules at all.",
        "Most likely, the conversion of LDG makes use of several linguistically sound head-finding rules.",
        "A striking difference is the root of the dependency graph, where LDG has its root at the linguistically motivated token hat.",
        "Whereas ADG has its root at the end of the sentence, because the leftmost lexical child of the virtual root VROOT is the punctuation.",
        "• Different arc labels: ADG encodes the constituent structure in the complex arc labels to be able to recover the constituent structure, whereas LDG have linguistically motivated dependency relations that are not present in the constituent structure.",
        "We believe that our simplistic approach can be further improved by using ideas from the conversion process of LDG.",
        "The last step of our presented strategy is to make the inverse transformation from a dependency graph to a constituent structure.",
        "This is done by a bottom-up and top-down process of the dependency graph.",
        "First we iterate over all tokens in the dependency graph and restore the sequence of constituent nodes with constituent labels and grammatical functions for each individual token using the information of the sublabels head relations and constituent labels.",
        "After this bottom-up process we have the lineage of constituents for each token where the token is the lexical head.",
        "The top-down process then traverse the dependency graph recursively from the root with pre-order depth-first search.",
        "For each token, the highest constituent of the lineage of the token is attached to its head lineage at an attachment level according to the sublabel attachment.",
        "Finally, the edge between the dominating constituent and the highest constituent of the lineage is labeled with a grammatical function according to the sublabel dependency relation.",
        "For the constituency versions of both TIGER and TuBa-D/Z we can recover the constituent structure without any loss of information, if we transform from constituency to dependency and back again to constituency.",
        "During parsing we predict the sublabels separately with separate feature models for Right-Arc and Left-Arc.",
        "Moreover, the parsed constituent structure can contain discontinuous constituency because of wrong attachment levels of constituents.",
        "To overcome this problem, the structure is post-processed and the discontinuous constituents are forced down in the structure so that the parser output can be represented in a nested bracketing format."

        "It was beneficial to use the divided predication strategy for all four data sets.",
        "In the next step we performed a feature optimization with both forward and backward selection, starting from a model extrapolated from many previous experiments on different languages.",
