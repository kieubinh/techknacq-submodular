        "Information graphics, such as bar charts and line graphs, are an important component of a multimodal document.",
        "However, summarization has focused primarily on the text of a document.",
        "But as shown in (Carberry et al., 2006), information graphics in magazine and newspaper articles often convey a message that is not repeated in the article's text.",
        "Thus information graphics cannot be ignored.",
        "Individuals with sight impairments can access the text of an electronic document via text to speech systems.",
        "But such individuals are stymied when they encounter information graphics.",
        "The SIGHT system (Elzer et al., 2007) has the goal of providing the user with the message and knowledge that one would gain from viewing the graphic, rather than providing alternative access to what the graphic looks like.",
        "In the current Bayesian network implementation, the system uses the communicative signals present in the graphic to recognize one of the twelve message categories that can be conveyed by a bar chart and produces a logical representation of what we will refer to as the core message conveyed by the graphic; this representation is translated into natural language via templates.",
        "For example, the system determines that the core message of the graphic in Figure 1 is that the bar for the United States has the maximum value of the entities listed, and the system produces Maximum(First_Bar) as the logical representation of that message.",
        "However, this is insufficient as a summary of the graphic since it doesn't convey the particularly significant features of the graphic such as the fact that the number of hacker attacks in the United States is far greater than in the other countries listed.",
        "In this paper, we explore the generation of an effective initial summary of a bar chart within the SIGHT system.",
        "Input to our system is a logical representation of the graphic's core message (as produced by SIGHT) and the XML representation of the graphic which specifies the components of the graphic such as the number of bars and the heights of each bar.",
        "Our goal is to generate a succinct coherent summary of a graphic that captures its core message and the most important and significant features.",
        "At the same time, the summary need not include all information that could be extracted from the graphic since future work on SIGHT includes a mechanism for responding to follow-up questions from the user.",
        "Our work is unique in that it generates a summary of the content of a bar chart with no domain restriction and constructs a high-quality but brief summary by incorporating the graphic's core mes-",

        "Our system produces a coherent organization of the content of the summary that we hypothesize lends itself to follow-up questions, applies the notion of syntactic complexity in choosing how to aggregate information into sentence-sized pieces, utilizes a sentence realizer to convey the output in natural language, and applies heuristics for constructing referents for graphical elements.",

        "In (McCoy et al., 2001), we reported an informal experiment in which human subjects were asked to write a brief summary of a series of line graphs with the same high-level intention.",
        "This experiment led to three observations:",
        "• the intended message of the graphic was contained in all summaries.",
        "• summaries of the same graphic by different subjects were similar.",
        "• summaries of different graphics in the same message category (such as Rising_Trend) varied in the information provided.",
        "Subjects included more than the core message of the graphic in their summaries.",
        "The extra information could be explained as capturing features of the graphic that were visually salient.",
        "It was hypothesized that what is taken as visually salient in a graphic relates to the overall message of the graphic.",
        "For example, in the line graphs analyzed, if the overall message of the graphic is an increasing trend and the variance in that trend is large, then the variance is salient.",
        "The fact that the summaries only included the core message and the visually salient features, correlates with Grice's Maxim of Quantity (Grice, 1975) which states that one's discourse contribution should be as informative as necessary for the purposes of the current exchange but not more so.",
        "To extend these observations to other kinds of information graphics, particulary to simple bar charts, we needed to identify the kinds of features that were salient with respect to the graphic's overall message.",
        "For this purpose, we conducted a set of formal experiments with human subjects.",
        "Our goal was a set of rules that took into account the message category (such as Rising_Trend or Rank.of Jintity) and the visual features of the graphic to specify what propositions should be included in the initial summary.",
        "Based on our experience with summarizing graphics, we first identified the set of all propositions (PROP_ALL) that reflect information that we envisioned someone might ask about a simple bar chart.",
        "Twenty graduate students from a variety of departments participated in the experiments.",
        "Each subject was given an information graphic along with a sentence conveying the intended message of the graphic (as identified by the SIGHT system) and a subset of PROP_ALL, and was asked to classify these additional propositions into one of three classes according to how important they felt it was to include that proposition in the initial summary: essential, possible, and not important.",
        "Subjects were told to assume that the graphic was part of an article that the user is reading and that he would be able to ask follow-up questions after receiving the summary.",
        "Twenty-one graphics were used in the experiments and each participant was given six graphics to view.",
        "The graphics were either selected from articles in popular media or constructed from scratch to present a number of different salient features within the same graphic.",
        "Eight different message categories were tested in the experiments and the graphics from the same message category reflected different salient features that had been observed in a corpus of collected graphics.",
        "To analyze the experiment's results, we assigned a numeric score to each category (essential=3, possible^, not important=0) indicating the level of importance assigned by the subjects.",
        "We computed an importance level (IL) for each proposition that might be included in a summary of a graphic, estimating how important it is to be included in the initial summary.",
        "The IL of a proposition is computed based on the average of the importance assigned by each subject.",
        "We classify a proposition as a highlyrated proposition in a graphic (and therefore worthy of being included in the initial summary) if its importance level is equal to or above the importance level that would be obtained if at least half of the subjects had classified the proposition as essential.",
        "The particular assignments of values to categories shown above was used in order to emphasize instances in which subjects placed a proposition in the essential category.",
        "For each message category, we analyzed the sets of highly-rated propositions identified for the graphics associated with that message category and hand constructed a set of content identification rules specifying whether a proposition should be included in the initial summary.",
        "If a proposition was classified as highly-rated for all graphics in a particular message category, the content identification rule stated that the proposition should be included in the initial summary for every graphic whose core message fell into that message category.",
        "For the other highlyrated propositions for a message category, we identified a feature that was visually salient only in the graphics where the proposition was marked as essential, and our content identification rule used the presence of this feature in the graphic as a condition for the proposition to be included in the initial summary.",
        "Thirty content identification rules were defined in the system.",
        "Besides the propositions capturing salient features of the graphic, we observed that the subjects selected propositions whose absence might lead the user to draw false conclusions by default (for example, the propositions indicating that the trend starting from 1997 does not cover the full range of bar labels in the graphic in Figure 2).",
        "We constructed rules to add such content.",
        "This correlates with the maxim in (Joshi et al., 1984) which states that a system should not only produce correct information but should also prevent the user from drawing false inferences.",

        "• If (message_category equals 'increas-ing_trend') and (coverage(graphic) not equal coverage(trend)) then include(propositions indicating that the trend does not cover the full range of bar labels)",

        "• S.O-A-E-: A summary consisting of single sentences that are randomly ordered.",
        "The results of the experiment are presented in Table 3.",
        "It is particularly noteworthy that the summary generated by our system was most often (65.6% of the time) rated as the best summary and overwhelmingly (92.2% of the time) rated as one of the top two summaries.",
        "The table shows that omitting the evaluation metric (S-O+A+E-) or omitting ordering of propositions (S_O-A+E+) results in summaries that are substantially less preferred by the subjects.",
        "We gained insights into improving the system's performance by looking at the comments made by the subjects when our summary was not selected as the best.",
        "For example, it appears that the subjects did not like summaries where exceptions were fronted on the core message with an \"although\" clause rather than following the core message (S-O+A+E-).",
        "We hypothesize that fronting the exception detracted from the core message.",
        "This is easily remedied in our evaluation metric.",
        "Overall, the results shown in Table 3 support our methodology for generating summaries.",
        "In the future, we will test the summaries with blind individuals to determine their effectiveness in providing alternative access to graphics."
