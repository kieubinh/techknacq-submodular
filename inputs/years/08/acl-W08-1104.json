        "Summarising georeferenced (can be identified according to it's location) data in natural language is challenging because it requires linking events describing its non-geographic attributes to their underlying geography.",
        "This mapping is not straightforward as often the only explicit geographic information such data contains is latitude and longitude.",
        "In this paper we present an approach to generating textual summaries of georeferenced data based on spatial reference frames.",
        "This approach has been implemented in a data-to-text system we have deployed in the weather forecasting domain."

        "Data-to-text systems are NLG systems that generate texts from raw input data.",
        "Many examples of such systems have been reported in the literature, which have been applied in a number of domains and to different types of input.",
        "For example, BabyTalk (Portet et al., 2007) generates medical reports from sensors monitoring a baby in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, while (Hallett and Scott, 2005) describe a system for generating reports from events in medical records.",
        "SumTime (Reiter et al., 2005), (Coch, 1998) and Fog (Goldberg et al., 1994) generate weather forecasts from the output of weather computer simulation models, while (Iordanskaja et al., 1992) and (Rosner, 1987) both generate summaries from employment statistics.",
        "As the above examples show most work in data-to-text up to now has concentrated almost exclusively on time series data.",
        "Work on generating text from spatial data has been reported in Coral (Dale et al., 2005), which generates route descriptions of a path constructed from Geographical Information Systems (GIS) datasets.",
        "Unlike the input to Coral however, most georeferenced data contains only limited spatial information(in many cases, only latitude and longitude).",
        "As (Roy and Reiter, 2005) point out, connecting language to the non-linguistic world is an important issue in Cognitive Science and Aritificial Intelligence; moreover, geographic data is becoming increasingly ubiquitous as the availability of low cost locational devices such as GPS increases, and GIS become more user friendly.",
        "Therefore, we believe exploring the issue of generating textual reports grounded in real world geographical data is an important challenge.",
        "On a more practical level, it is also a natural next step in the application of data-to-text technology to apply it to geographically referenced data.",
        "In the RoadSafe project described in the following section, we have been investigating this issue in a data-to-text system that generates road ice weather forecasts.",
        "The subsequent focus of this paper is the adaption of NLG techniques to the task of summarising georeferenced data.",
        "In particular, the incorporation of spatial reference frames to generate grounded (from external GIS data sources) spatial references."

        "More precisely, they are sets of related geographical features (such as elevated areas ) which partition the domain into meaningful sub areas for descriptive purposes.",

        "Understanding the weathers interaction with the terrain enables them to make reliable meteorological inferences.",
        "For example a spatial description such as 'rain turning to snow in rural areas' may be geographically accurate, but does not make sense meteorologically as it is purely by chance that this event is occurring at that location.",
        "From a NLG system perspective it is important to take into account the communicative purpose of spatial descriptions in this context, which are expressing causality (the effect of geographical features on weather conditions) rather than being purely locative.",
        "For example, changes in precipitation type are more commonly seen in higher elevation areas where the air temperature is generally lower, so a spatial description describing such an event should make use of a reference frame that reflects this interaction.",
        "Similarly, road surface temperatures are generally higher in urban areas where there is a general population effect.",
        "For a referring expression generation (REG) strategy this means that this requires not only adequate spatial representation and reasoning capabilities about an objects location, but also additional information about an objects function in space.",
        "This is a problem which has been acknowledged in the psycholinguistic literature e.g. (Coventry and Garrod, 2004).",
        "Geographic Characterisation is responsible for grounding the location of the data by making the relationship between it's underlying geography explicit.",
        "As the first stage of data analysis it assigns additional spatial properties to each data point by intersecting the point with external GIS data sources representing the frames of reference we have identified.",
        "For example after characterisation, the first point in the spatial attribute table shown in Figure 1 is assigned values [0m,SSW,Urban,Coastal] to represent elevation, absolute compass direction, population density of its immediate area and its proximity to the coast respectively.",
        "This process is more commonly known as a form of data enrichment in the Spatial Data Mining community (Miller and Han, 2001).",
        "In the scope of our work it is important for two reasons: most importantly, it provides a set of properties that are used by the REG module to generate spatial descriptions; secondly, these properties can be taken into account by our analysis method during the initial segmentation of the data.",
        "The spatial database provides a repository of geographic information.",
        "Frames of reference are stored as thematic layers from various GIS data sources consisting of sets of boundary objects.",
        "For example, altitude is represented as sets of polygons representing altitude contours at a given resolution and population is a set of town boundary polygons.",
        "The spatial reasoning module provides a high level interface between the spatial database and the rest of the system.",
        "It is responsible for performing geographic characterisation and providing spatial query functionality to the rest of the system.",
        "Text Generation",
        "In Section 2 we outlined 3 main challenges that our system must address.",
        "Our approach to the first, analysis of the input data, is described in (Turner et al., 2007).",
        "In the following Sections 4.1 and 4.2, we describe the approach taken by our text generator to the former two: content selection and generating spatial references.",
        "The input to the document planning module of our system is a series of meteorological events (such as rises in temperature) describing each parameter over specific periods of time and locations.",
        "The basic events are generated by data analysis which are then abstracted into higher level concepts by data interpretation.",
        "As it is impossible to include all these events in such a short summary our system also generates a table as well as text shown in Figure 5.",
        "In our KA studies we have found experts use a qualitative overview of weather conditions when writing forecasts to perform this task, confirming similar observations reported in (Sripada et al., 2001).",
        "We take the same approach as experts in our system by including the internal information of the table (generated by the data analysis module) as input to document planning.",
        "This serves as the overview for content selection and allows construction of an initial document plan consisting of overview event leaf nodes.",
        "An example of this structure for the system output shown in Figure 5 is given in Figure 6.",

        "This is done in a top down fashion by further annotating the tree with events from the input list.",
        "Additional events are selected by using the information from the overview events to retrieve them from the list.",
        "This has the benefit of keeping the content of both text and table consistent.",
        "The final tree comprises the input to the microplanner where messages are realised as sentences in the final text and typically contain two events per message (as observed in our corpus).",
        "For example the overview event describing Precip in Figure 6 is realised as two sentences in Figure 5: Wintry precipitation will affect most routes throughout the forecast period at first [overview event], falling as snow flurries in some places above 300M at first [event].",
        "Snow spreading throughout the forecast period to all areas [event] and persisting in some places above 300M until end of period [event].",
        "Approaches to REG to date have concentrated on distinguishing descriptions (e.g. (Gatt and van Deemter, 2007),(van Deemter, 2006),(Horacek, 1995); more specifically that is given a domain, they look to generate a description of a target object that uniquely distinguishes it from all other objects within that domain.",
        "In a large geographic environment such as a road network consisting of 1000's of points, where the task is to refer to an event occurring at a small subset of those points, it is impractical (generated descriptions may be long and complex) and prohibitively expensive (large numbers of spatial relations between objects may have to be computed) to take this approach.",
        "A more practical approach is to generate spatial descriptions in terms of regions that are not strictly distinguishing (i.e. urban areas, high ground) rather than in terms of the points contained within that region.",
        "Indeed, this is the strategy employed by human authors in our corpus.",
        "Therefore, in a description such as 'road surface temperatures will fall below zero in some places in the south west', distractors can be defined as the set of points within the south western boundary that do not satisfy this premise.",
        "The relaxation of the requirement to generate a distinguishing description simplifies the REG task in this context as a single referring expression may be deemed acceptable to refer to a wide range of situations.",
        "For example, 'in some places in the south west' could be used to refer to a large number of possible subsets of points that fall within the south western boundary of the network.",
