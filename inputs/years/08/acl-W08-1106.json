        "There are two main approaches to the task of summarization â€“ extraction and abstraction (Hahn and Mani, 2000).",
        "Extraction involves concatenating extracts taken from the corpus into a summary, whereas abstraction involves generating novel sentences from information extracted from the corpus.",
        "It has been observed that in the context of multi-document summarization of news articles, extraction may be inappropriate because it may produce summaries which are overly verbose or biased towards some sources (Barzilay et al., 1999).",
        "However, there has been little work identifying specific factors which might affect the performance of each strategy in summarizing evaluative documents containing opinions and preferences, such as customer reviews or blogs.",
        "This work aims to address this gap by exploring one dimension along which the effectiveness of the two paradigms could vary; namely, the controversiality of the opinions contained in the corpus.",
        "In this paper, we make the following contributions.",
        "Firstly, we define a measure of controver-siality of opinions in the corpus based on information entropy.",
        "Secondly, we run a user study to test the hypothesis that a controversial corpus has greater need of abstractive methods and consequently of NLG techniques.",
        "Intuitively, extracting sentences from multiple users whose opinions are diverse and wide-ranging may not reflect the overall opinion, whereas it may be adequate content-wise if opinions are roughly the same across users.",
        "As a secondary contribution, we propose a method for structuring text when summarizing controversial corpora.",
        "This method is used in our study for generating abstractive summaries.",
        "The results of the user study support our hypothesis that a NLG summarizer outperforms an extractive summarizer by more when the contro-versiality is high."

        "There has been little work comparing extractive and abstractive multi-document summarization.",
        "A previous study on summarizing evaluative text (Carenini et.",
        "al, 2006) showed that extraction and abstraction performed about equally well, though for different reasons.",
        "The study, however, did not look at the effect of the controversiality of the corpus on the relative performance of the two strategies.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, the task of measuring the controversiality of opinions in a corpus has not been studied before.",
        "Some well known measures are related to this task, including variance, information entropy, and measures of interrater reliability.",
        "(e.g. Fleiss' Kappa (Fleiss, 1971), Krippendorffs Alpha (Krippendorff, 1980)).",
        "However, these existing measures do not satisfy certain properties that a sound measure of controversiality should possess, prompting us to develop our own based on information entropy.",
        "Summary evaluation is a challenging open research area.",
        "Existing methods include soliciting human judgements, task-based approaches, and automatic approaches.",
        "Task-based evaluation measures the effectiveness of a summarizer for its intended purpose.",
        "(e.g. (McKeown et al., 2005)) This approach, however, is less applicable in this work because we are interested in evaluating specific properties of the summary such as the grammaticality and the content, which may be difficult to evaluate with an overall task-based approach.",
        "Furthermore, the design of the task may intrinsically favour abstractive or extractive summarization.",
        "As an extreme example, asking for a list of specific comments from users would clearly favour extractive summarization.",
        "Another method for summary evaluation is the Pyramid method (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004), which takes into account the fact that human summaries with different content can be equally informative.",
        "Multiple human summaries are taken to be models, and chunks of meaning known as Summary Content Units (SCU) are manually identified.",
        "Peer summaries are evaluated based on how many SCUs they share with the model summaries, and the number of model summaries in which these SCUs are found.",
        "Although this method has been tested in DUC 2006 and DUC 2005 (Passonneau et al., 2006), (Passonneau et al., 2005) in the domain of news articles, it has not been tested for evaluative text.",
        "A pilot study that we conducted on a set of customer reviews on a product using the Pyramid method revealed several problems specific to the evaluative domain.",
        "For example, summaries which misrepresented the polarity of the evaluations for a certain feature were not penalized, and human summaries sometimes produced contradictory statements about the distribution of the opinions.",
        "In one case, one model summary claimed that a feature is positively rated, while another claimed the opposite, whereas the machine summary indicated that this feature drew mixed reviews.",
        "Clearly, only one of these positions should be regarded as correct.",
        "Further work is needed to resolve these problems.",
        "There are also automatic methods for summary evaluation, such as ROUGE (Lin, 2004), which gives a score based on the similarity in the sequences of words between a human-written model summary and the machine summary.",
        "While ROUGE scores have been shown to often correlate quite well with human judgements (Nenkova et al., 2007), they do not provide insights into the specific strengths and weaknesses of the summary.",
        "The method of summarization evaluation used in this work is to ask users to complete a questionnaire about summaries that they are presented with.",
        "The questionnaire consists of questions asking for Likert ratings and is adapted from the questionnaire in (Carenini et al., 2006)."

        "In our user study, we compare an abstractive and an extractive multi-document summarizer that are both developed specifically for the evaluative domain.",
        "These summarizers have been found to produce quantitatively similar results, and both significantly outperform a baseline summarizer, which is the MEAD summarization framework with all options set to the default (Radev et al., 2000).",
        "Both summarizers rely on information extraction from the corpus.",
        "First, sentences with opinions need to be identified, along with the features of the entity that are evaluated, the strength, and polarity (positive or negative) of the evaluation.",
        "For instance, in a corpus of customer reviews, the sentence \"Excellent picture quality - on par with my Pioneer, Panasonic, and JVC players.\"",
        "contains an opinion on the feature picture quality of a DVD player, and is a very positive evaluation (+3 on a scale from 3 to +3).",
        "We rely on methods from previous work for these tasks (Hu and Liu, 2004).",
        "Once these features, called Crude Features (CFs), are extracted, they are mapped onto a taxonomy of User Defined Features (UDFs), so named because they can be defined by the user.",
        "This mapping provides a better conceptual organization of the CFs by grouping together semantically similar CFs, such as jpeg picture and jpeg slide show under the UDF JPEG.",
        "For the purposes of our study, feature extraction, polarity/strength identification and the mapping from CFs to UDFs are not done automatically as in (Hu and Liu, 2004) and (Carenini et al., 2005).",
        "Instead, \"gold standard\" annotations by humans are used in order to focus on the effect of the summarization strategy.",
        "The abstractive summarizer is the Summarizer of Evaluative Arguments (SEA), adapted from GEA, a system for generating evaluative text tailored to the user's preferences (Carenini and Moore, 2006).",
        "In SEA, units of content are organized by UDFs.",
        "The importance of each UDF is based on the number and strength of evaluations of CFs mapped to this UDF, as well as the importance of its children UDFs.",
        "Content selection consists of repeating the following two steps until the desired number of UDFs have been selected: (i) greedily selecting the most important UDF (ii) recalculating the measure of importance scores for the remaining",

        "The content structuring, microplanning, and realization stages of SEA are adapted from GEA.",
        "Each selected UDF is realized in the final summary by one clause, generated from a template pattern based on the number and distribution of polarity/strength evaluations of the UDF.",

        "We found that controversially rated UDF features (roughly balanced positive and negative evaluations) were treated as contrasts to those which were uncontroversially rated (either mostly positive, or mostly negative evaluations).",
        "In SEA, contrast relations between features are realized by cue phrases signalling contrast such as \"however\" and \"although\".",
        "These cue phrases appear to signal a contrast that is too strong for the relation between controversial and uncontroversial features.",
        "An example of a SEA summary suffering from this problem can be found in Figure 1.",
        "To solve this problem, we devised an alternative content structure for controversial corpora, in which all controversial features appear first, followed by all positively and negatively evaluated features.",
        "The extractive approach is represented by MEAD*, which is adapted from the open source summarization framework MEAD (Radev et al., 2000).",
        "After information extraction, MEAD* orders CFs by the number of sentences evaluating that CF, and selects a sentence from each CF until the word limit has been reached.",
        "The sentence that is selected for each CF is the one with the highest sum of polarity/strength evaluations for any feature, so sentences that mention more CFs tend to be selected.",
        "The selected sentences are then ordered according to the UDF hierarchy by a depth-first traversal through the UDF tree so that more abstract features tend to precede more specific ones.",
        "MEAD* does not have a special mechanism to deal with controversial features.",
        "It is not clear how overall controversiality of a feature can be effectively expressed with extraction, as each sentence conveys a specific and unique opinion.",
        "One could include two sentences of opposite polarity for each controversial feature.",

        "These footnotes serve to provide details for the abstractive SEA summarizer, and context for the sentences chosen by the extractive MEAD* summarizer.",

        "It is natural then, to base a measure of controversiality on these annotations.",
        "To measure the controversiality of a corpus, we first measure the controversiality of each of the features in the corpus.",
        "We list two properties that a measure of feature controversiality should satisfy.",
        "Strength-sensitivity: The measure should be sensitive to the strength of the evaluations.",
        "e.g. Polarity/strength (P/S) evaluations of 2 and +2 should be less controversial than 3 and +3",
        "Polarity-sensitivity: The measure should be sensitive the polarity of the evaluations.",
        "e.g. P/S evaluations of 1 and +1 should be more controversial than +1 and +3.",
        "The rationale for this property is that positive and negative evaluations are fundamentally different, and this distinction is more important than the difference in intensity.",
        "Thus, though a numerical scale would suggest that 1 and +1 are as distant as +1 and +3, a suitable controversiality measure should not treat them so.",
        "In addition, the overall measure of corpus con-troversiality should also satisfy the following two features.",
        "CF-weighting: CFs should be weighted by the number of evaluations they contain when calculating the overall value of controversiality for the corpus.",
        "CF-independence: The controversiality of individual CFs should not affect each other.",
        "An alternative is to calculate controversiality by UDFs instead of CFs.",
        "However, not all CFs mapped to the same UDF represent the same concept.",
        "For example, the CFs picture clarity and color signal are both mapped to the UDF video output.",
        "Since the problem of measuring the variability of a distribution has been well studied, we first examined existing metrics including variance, entropy, kappa, weighted kappa, Krippendorff s alpha, and information entropy.",
        "Each of these, however, is problematic in their canonical form, leading us to devise a new metric based on information entropy which satisfies the above properties.",
        "Existing metrics will now be examined in turn.",
        "Variance: Variance does not satisfy polarity-sensitivity, as the statistic only takes into account the difference of each data point to the mean, and the sign of the data point plays no role.",
        "Information Entropy: The canonical form of information entropy does not satisfy strength or polarity sensitivity, because the measure considers the discrete values of the distribution to be an unordered set.",
        "Measures of Inter-rater Reliability: Many measures exist to assess inter-rater agreement or disagreement, which is the task of measuring how similarly two or more judges rate one or more subjects beyond chance (dis)agreement.",
        "Various versions of Kappa and Krippendorff's Alpha (Krippendorff, 1980), which have shown to be equivalent in their most generalized forms (Passonneau, 1997), can be modified to satisfy all the properties listed above.",
        "However, there are important differences between the tasks of measuring controver-siality and measuring inter-rater reliability.",
        "Kappa and Krippendorff's Alpha correct for chance agreement between raters, which is appropriate in the context of inter-rater reliability calculations, because judges are asked to give their opinions on items that are given to them.",
        "In contrast, expressions of opinion are volunteered by users, and users self-select the features they comment on.",
        "Thus, it is reasonable to assume that they never randomly select an evaluation for a feature, and chance agreement does not exist.",
        "We define here our novel measure of controversiality, which is based on information entropy because it can be more easily adapted to measure controversiality.",
        "As has been stated, entropy in its original form over the evaluations of a CF is not sensitive to strength or polarity.",
        "To correct this, we first aggregate the positive and negative evaluations for each CF separately, and then calculate the entropy based on the resultant Bernoulli distribution.",

        "A unimodal normal-like distribution of evaluations centred on zero, for example, should intuitively be somewhat controversial, because there are equal numbers of positive and negative evaluations.",
        "Our entropy-based feature controver-siality measure is able to take this into account.",
        "To calculate the controversiality of the corpus, a weighted average is taken over the CF controver-siality scores, with the weight being equal to one less than the number of evaluations for that CF. We subtract one to eliminate any CF where only one evaluation is made, as that CF has an entropy score of one by default before scaling by importance.",

        "We have explored the controversiality of opinions in a corpus of evaluative text as an aspect which may determine how well abstractive and extractive summarization strategies perform.",

        "We have also presented a document structuring strategy for summarization of controversial corpora.",
        "Our work has implications in practical decisions on summarization strategy choice; an extractive approach, which may be easier to implement because of its lack of requirement for natural language generation, may suffice if the controversiali-ty of opinions in a corpus is sufficiently low.",
        "A future approach to summarization of evaluative text might combine extraction and abstraction in order to combine the different strengths that each bring to the summary.",
        "The controversiality of the corpus might be one factor determining the mix of abstraction and extraction in the summary.",
        "The footnotes linking to sample sentences in the corpus in SEA are already one form of this combined approach.",
        "Further work is needed to integrate this text into the summary itself, possibly in a modified form.",
        "As a final note to our user study, further studies should be done with different corpora and summarization systems to increase the external validity of our results."
