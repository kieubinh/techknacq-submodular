        "The Generation of Referring Expressions (gre) is one of the most intensively studied subtasks of Natural Language Generation (nlg).",
        "Much research has focused on content determination in gre, which is typically framed as an attribute selection task in which properties are selected in order to describe an intended referent.",
        "Since such properties are typically defined as attribute-value pairs, in what follows, we will refer to this as the as-gre (Attribute Selection for Generating Referring Expressions) task.",
        "Since early work on asgre, which focused on pragmatic motivations behind different types of reference (Appelt, 1985; Appelt and Kronfeld, 1987), the focus has increasingly been on definite descriptions and identification, where the set of attributes selected should uniquely distinguish the intended referent from other entities (its 'distractors').",
        "Unique Reference in this sense is a dominant criterion for selecting attribute sets in classic asgre algorithms.",
        "Following Dale (1989), and especially Dale and Reiter (1995), several contributions have extended the remit of asgre algorithms to handle relations (Dale and Haddock, 1991; Kelleher and Kruijff, 2006) and gradable attributes (van Deemter, 2006); and also to guarantee logical completeness of algorithms (van and van Deemter, 2007).",
        "Much of this work has incorporated the principle of brevity.",
        "Based on the Gricean Quantity maxim (Grice, 1975), and originally discussed by Appelt (1985), and further by Dale (1989), Reiter descriptions should contain no more information than is necessary to distinguish an intended referent.",
        "In asgre, this has been translated into a criterion which determines the adequacy of an attribute set, implemented in its most straightforward form in Full Brevity algorithms which select the smallest attribute set that uniquely refers to the intended referent (Dale, 1989).",
        "Another frequent property of asgre algorithms is Incrementality which involves selection of attributes one at a time (rather than exhaustive search for a distinguishing set), and was initially motivated by algorithmic complexity considerations.",
        "The Incremental Algorithm of Dale and Reiter (1995) was also justified with reference to psycholinguistic findings that (a) humans overspecify their references (i.e. they are not brief when they produce a reference); and (b) this tends to occur with properties which seem to be very salient or in some sense preferred (Pechmann, 1989; Belke and Meyer, 2002; Arts, 2004).",
        "In the Incremental Algorithm (Dale and Reiter, 1995), incrementality took the form of hillclimbing along an attribute order which reflects the preference that humans manifest for certain attributes (such as colour).",
        "This Modelling of Human Preferences in the Incremental Algorithm has proven influential.",
        "Another feature proposed by Dale and Reiter is to hardwire the inclusion of the type of an entity in a description, reflecting the human tendency to always include the category of an object (e.g. chair or man), even if it has no discriminatory value.",
        "A compromise may be reached between incrementality and brevity; for example, Dale's (1989) Greedy Algorithm selects attributes one at a time, and computes the Discriminatory Power of attributes, that is, it bases selection on the extent to which an attribute helps distinguish an entity from its distractors.",
        "In the remainder of this paper, we uniformly use the term 'algorithmic property' for the selection criteria and other properties of ASGRE algorithms described above, and refer to them by the following short forms: Full Brevity, Uniqueness, Discriminatory Power, Hardwired Type Selection, Human Preference Modelling and Incrementality.",
        "Though ASGRE evaluations have been carried out (Gupta and Stent, 2005; Viethen and Dale, 2006; Gatt et al., 2007), these have focused on 'classic' algorithms, and have been corpus-based.",
        "The absence of task-performance evaluations is surprising, considering the well-defined nature of the asgre task, and the predominance of task-performance studies elsewhere in the NLG evaluation literature (Reiter et al., 2003; Karasimos and Isard, 2004).",
        "Given the widespread agreement on task definition and input/output specifications, asgre was an ideal candidate for the first nlg shared task evaluation challenge.",
        "The challenge was first discussed during a workshop held at Arlington, Va. (Dale and White, 2007), and eventually organised as part of the UCNLG+MT Workshop in September 2007 (Belz and Gatt, 2007).",
        "The ASGRE Shared Task provided an opportunity to (a) assess the extent to which the field has diversified since its inception; (b) carry out a comparative evaluation involving both automatic methods and human task-performance methods.",
        "In the ASGRE Challenge report (Belz and Gatt, 2007) we presented the results of the ASGRE Challenge evaluations objectively and with little interpretation.",
        "In this paper, we present the results of a new task-performance evaluation and a new intrinsic measure involving the same 15 systems and compare the new results with the earlier ones.",
        "We also examine all results in the light of the algorithmic properties of the participating systems.",
        "We thus focus on two issues in ASGRE and its evaluation.",
        "We examine the similarities and differences among the systems submitted to the ASGRE Challenge and compare them to classic approaches (Section 2.1).",
        "We look at the results of intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations (Section 4) and examine how these relate to algorithmic properties (Section 4.1 and 4.2).",
        "Finally we look at how intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations correlate with each other (Section 4.3)."

        "The ASGRE Challenge used the TUNA Corpus (Gatt et al., 2007), a set of human-produced referring expressions (REs) for entities in visual domains of pictures of furniture or people.",
        "The corpus was collected during an online elicitation experiment in which subjects typed descriptions of a target referent in a DOMAIN in which there were also 6 other entities ('distractors').",
        "Each RE in the corpus is paired with a domain representation consisting of the target referent and the set of distractors, each with their possible attributes and values; Figure 1(a) shows an example of an entity representation.",
        "In each human-produced RE, substrings are annotated with the attribute(s) they express ('realise').",
        "For the Challenge, the attributes in each RE were extracted to produce a description, i.e. a set of",

        "Participants were given both input (DOMAIN) and output (DESCRIPTION) parts in the training and development data, but just inputs in the test data.",
        "They were asked to submit the corresponding outputs for test data inputs.",

        "Properties are indicated in the first column (abbreviations are explained in the table caption).",

      "heading": "3. Evaluation methods",
      "text": [
        "Evaluation methods can be characterised as either intrinsic or extrinsic.",
        "While intrinsic methods evaluate the outputs of algorithms in their own right, either relative to a corpus or based on absolute evaluation metrics, extrinsic methods assess the effect of an algorithm on something external to it, such as its effect on human performance on some external task.",
        "In the evaluation results reported below, we use two of the intrinsic methods used in the ASGRE Challenge.",
        "The first of these is Minimality, defined as the proportion of descriptions produced by a system that are maximally brief, as per the original definition in Dale (1989).",
        "The second is the Dice coefficient, used to compare the description produced by a system (DS) to the human-produced description (DH) on the same input domain.",
        "Dice is estimated as follows:",
        "For this paper, we also computed MAS I, a version of the Jaccard similarity coefficient proposed by Passonneau (2006) which multiplies the similarity value by a monotonicity coefficient, biasing the measure towards those cases where DS and DH have an empty set difference.",
        "Intuitively, this means that those system-produced descriptions are preferred which do not include attributes that are omitted by a human.",
        "Thus, two of our intrinsic measures assess Humanlikeness (Dice and MASI), while Minimality reflects the extent to which an algorithm conforms to brevity, one of the principles that has emerged from the asgre literature.",
        "In the ASGRE Challenge, the extrinsic evaluation was performed via an experiment in which partici-",

        "All systems produce outputs with unique reference.",
        "The meaning of the abbreviations is as follows (for definitions see Section 1): Incr = Incrementality; DP = Discriminatory Power; Train = Trainability; Type = Hardwired Type Selection; Hum = Human Preference Modelling; FB = Full Brevity",
        "pants were shown visual representations of the domains that were used as inputs in the test data, coupled with a system-generated description on the same screen.",
        "Their task was to identify the intended referent in the domain by means of a mouse click.",
        "The rationale behind the experiment was to assess the degree to which an algorithm achieved its stated purpose of generating a description that facilitates identification of the intended referent.",
        "Since system outputs were sets of attributes (see Figure 1(b)), they were first mapped to nl strings using a deterministic, template-based method which always maps each attribute to word(s) in the same way and in the same position regardless of context.",
        "The present analysis is based on results from a new evaluation experiment which replicated the original methodology with a slight difference.",
        "While participants in the asgre experiment were shown visual domains and descriptions at the same time, this experiment sought to distinguish reading and identification time.",
        "Thus, for each system output, participants first saw the description, using the mouse to call up the visual domain once they had read it.",
        "This yields three dependent measures: (a) reading time (rt); (b) identification time (it); (c) error rate (er), defined as the proportion of trials per system for which participants identified the wrong referent.",
        "One of the possible complications with the rt measure is that, while it depends on the semantics of a description (the attributes that an algorithm selects), the syntactic complexity of the description will also impact the time it takes to read it.",
        "In our setup, the adoption of a deterministic, one-to-one mapping between an attribute and its linguistic representation controls for this to some extent.",
        "Since every attribute in any semantic representation will invariably map to the same surface form, there is no variation between systems in terms of how a particular attribute is realised.",
        "Design: As in the original experiment, we used a Repeated Latin Squares design in which each combination of peer system and test set item is allocated one trial.",
        "Because there were 148 items in the test set, but 15 peer systems, 2 test set items were randomly selected and duplicated to give a test set size of 150, and 10 Latin Squares.",
        "The 150 test set items were divided into two sets of 75; 15 of the 30 participants did the first 75 items (the first 5 Latin Squares), while the other 15 did the rest.",
        "This resulted in 2250 trials (each corresponding to a combination of test set item and system) in all.",
        "For the purposes of this paper, the duplicate items were treated as fillers, that is, every item was included only once in the analysis.",
        "Participants and procedure: The experiment was carried out by 30 participants recruited from among the faculty and administrative staff of the University of Brighton.",
        "Participants carried out the experiment under supervision in a quiet room on a laptop.",
        "Stimulus presentation was carried out using dmdx, a Win-32 software package for psycholinguistic experiments involving time measurements (Forster and Forster, 2003).",
        "Participants initiated each trial, which consisted of an initial warning bell and a fixation point flashed on the screen for 1000ms.",
        "They then read the description and called up the visual domain to identify the referent.",
        "Identification was carried out by clicking on the image that a participant thought was the target referent of the description they had read.",
        "rt was measured from the point at which the description was presented, to the point at which a participant called up the next screen via mouse click.",
        "it was measured from the point at which pictures (the visual domain) were presented on the screen to the point where a participant identified a referent by clicking on it.",
        "In addition to the time taken to identify a referent, the program recorded the location of a participant's mouse click, in order to assess whether the object identified was in fact the correct one.",

        "more tentative, conclusion that could be made by looking at these figures is that trainable systems perform better if they are non-incremental; however, the difference (Dice of .710 vs .696) seems rather marginal and would require further testing.",
        "What is also striking in this table is the absence of any significant impact of these properties on the task-performance measures of reading and identification time, despite initial impressions based on means (Table 3).",
        "In summary, at least one of the principles that has been widely adopted in asgre - incrementality seems to be validated by the evaluation results for these new algorithms.",
        "However, results show that improvement on an automatically computed human-likeness metric such as mas i or Dice does not necessarily imply an improvement on a task-performance measure.",
        "This is a theme to which we return in Section 4.3.",
        "Apart from incrementality, the other dominant principle that has emerged from nearly three decades of asgre research is brevity.",
        "While psycholinguistic research has shown (Pechmann, 1989; Belke and Meyer, 2002; Arts, 2004) that the strict interpretation of the Gricean Quantity Maxim, adopted for example by Dale (1989), is not observed by speakers, brevity has remained a central concern in recent approaches (Gardent, 2002).",
        "Only one algorithm adopted a full-brevity approach in the asgre Challenge; however, several algorithms emphasised discriminatory power, and some of these, as a comparison between Tables 1 and 2 shows, tended to have higher Minimality scores overall.",
        "Since Minimality was part of the overall design of the evaluation, it is possible to see the extent to which it covaries significantly with other performance measures.",
        "The relevant correlations are displayed in Table 5.",
        "There are highly significant negative correlations between Minimality and the two intrinsic humanlikeness measures (Dice and masi).",
        "The significant positive correlation with it implies that participants in our evaluation experiment tended to take longer to identify referents in the case of systems which produce more minimal descriptions.",
        "The negative correlation with the humanlikeness measures corroborates previous findings that people do not observe a strict interpretation of the Gricean Quantity Maxim (Pechmann, 1989; Belke and Meyer, 2002; Arts, 2004).",
        "On the other hand, the direction of the correlation with it is somewhat more surprising.",
        "One possible explanation is that minimal descriptions often do not include a type attribute, since this seldom has any discriminatory power in the tuna Corpus domains.",
        "The role of Minimality remains a topic of some debate in the psycholinguistic literature.",
        "A recent study (Engelhardt et al., 2006) showed that identification of objects in a visual domain could be delayed if a description of the target referent was overspeci-fied, suggesting a beneficial effect from Minimality.",
        "However, Engelhardt et al.",
        "also found, in a separate study, that overspecified descriptions tended to be rated as no worse than brief, or minimal ones.",
        "Indeed, one of the points that emerges from this study is that intrinsic and extrinsic assessments can yield contrasting results.",
        "It is to this issue that we now turn.",
        "Since humanlikeness (intrinsic) and task performance (extrinsic) are different perspectives on the outputs of an asgre algorithm, it is worth asking to what extent they agree.",
        "This is an important question for comparative hlt evaluation more generally, which has become dominated by corpus-based humanlikeness metrics.",
        "To obtain an indication of agreement, we computed correlations between the two humanlikeness measures and the task-performance measures; these are displayed in Table 6.",
        "The two time measures (rt and it) are strongly correlated, implying that when subjects took longer to read descriptions, they also took longer to identify a referent.",
        "This may seem surprising in view of the positive correlation between Minimality and it (shorter descriptions imply longer it) which was reported in Section 4.2, where Minimality was also",

        "What this result indicates is that rather than the number of attributes in a description, as measured by Minimality, it is the content that influences identification latency.",
        "Part of the effect may be due to the lack of type in minimal descriptions noted earlier.",
        "Table 6 also shows that error rate is significantly correlated with it (but not with rt), i.e. where subjects took longer to identify referents, the identification was more likely to be wrong.",
        "This points to a common underlying cause for slower reading and identification, possibly arising from the use of attributes (such as size) which impose a greater cognitive load on the reader.",
        "The very strong correlation (0.97) between Dice and masi is to be expected, given the similarity in the way they are defined.",
        "Another unambiguous result emerges: none of the similarity-based metrics covary significantly with any of the task-performance measures.",
        "An extended analysis involving a larger range of intrinsic metrics confirmed this lack of significant covariation for string-based similarity metrics as well as set-similarity metrics across two task-performance experiments (Belz and Gatt, 2008).",
        "This indicates that at least for some areas of hlt, task-performance evaluation is vital: without the external reality check provided by extrinsic evaluations, intrinsic evaluations may end up being too self-contained and disconnected from notions of usefulness to provide a meaningful assessment of systems' quality."

        "Comparative evaluation can be of great benefit, especially in an area as mature and diverse as gre.",
        "A shared-task evaluation like the asgre Challenge can help identify the strengths and weaknesses of alternative approaches and techniques, as measured by different evaluation criteria.",
        "Perhaps even more importantly, such a challenge helps evaluate the evaluation methods themselves and reveals which (combinations of) evaluation methods are appropriate for a given evaluation purpose.",
        "As far as the first issue is concerned, this paper has shown that trainability, incrementality and not aiming for minimality are the algorithmic properties most helpful in achieving high humanlikeness scores.",
        "This result is in line with psycholinguistic research on attribute selection in reference by humans.",
        "Less clear-cut is the relationship between these properties and task-performance measures that assess how efficiently a referent can be identified based on a description.",
        "The second part of the analysis presented here showed that intrinsic and extrinsic perspectives on the quality of system outputs quality can yield uncorrelated sets of results, making it difficult to predict quality as measured by one based on quality as measured by the other.",
        "Furthermore, while intuitively it might be expected that higher human-likeness entailed better task performance, our results suggest that this is not necessarily the case.",
        "Our main conclusions for asgre evaluation are that (a) while humanlikeness evaluation may provide a measure of one aspect of systems but we need to be cautious in relying on humanlikeness as a criterion of overall quality (standard in evaluation of mt and summarisation); and (b) that we must not leave the nlg tradition of task-performance evaluations behind as we move towards more comparative forms of evaluation."
