        "Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) are software systems that provide individualized instruction, like human tutors do in one-on-one tutoring sessions.",
        "Whereas ITSs have been shown to be effective in engendering learning gains, they still are not equivalent to human tutors.",
        "Hence, many researchers are exploring Natural Language (NL) as the key to bridging the gap between human tutors and current ITSs.",
        "A few results are now available, that show that ITS with relatively sophisticated language interfaces are more effective than some other competitive condition (Graesser et al., 2004; Litman et al., 2006; Evens and Michael, 2006; Kumar et al., 2006; Van-Lehn et al., 2007; Di Eugenio et al., 2008).",
        "Ascertaining which specific features of the NL interaction are responsible for learning still remains an open research question.",
        "In our experiments, we contrasted the richness with which human tutors respond to student actions with poorer forms of providing feedback, e.g.",
        "only graphical.",
        "Our study starts exploring the role that positive feedback plays in tutoring and in ITSs.",
        "While it has long been observed that most tutors tend to avoid direct negative feedback, e.g. (Fox, 1993; Moore et al., 2004), ITSs mostly provide negative feedback, as they react to student errors.",
        "In this paper, we will first briefly describe our tutorial dialog collection.",
        "We will then present the planning architecture that underlies our feedback generator.",
        "Even if our ITS does not currently allow for student input, our generation architecture is inspired by state-of-the art tutorial dialog management (Freedman, 2000; Jordan et al., 2001; Zinn et al., 2002).",
        "One limitation of these approaches is that plan operators are difficult to maintain and extend, partly because they are manually defined and tuned.",
        "Crucially, our plan operators are automatically derived via the association rules mined from our corpus.",
        "Finally, we will devote a substantial amount of space to evaluation.",
        "Our work is among the first to show not only that a more sophisticated language interface results in more learning, but that it favorably compares with human tutors.",

        "Our results add to the growing body of evidence that language feedback engenders more learning not only than simple practice, but also, than less sophisticated language feedback.",
        "Importantly, our 'model' ITS appears intriguingly close to our expert tutor in effectiveness: on post-test problem 1, it is as effective as the expert tutor himself, and significantly better than the other two tutors, as the expert tutor is.",
        "It appears our 'model' ITS does capture at least some features of successful tutoring.",
        "As concerns the specific language the ITS generates, we compared different ways of providing verbal feedback.",
        "A subject receives both positive and negative verbal feedback when interacting with the \"model\" version, while a subject receives only one type of verbal feedback when interacting with the \"positive\" and \"negative\" versions (recall that in all these versions including the \"model\" ITS the red/green graphical feedback is provided on every input).",
        "While we cannot draw definite conclusions regarding the functions of positive and negative feedback, since the 'model' version provides other tutorial moves beyond positive / negative feedback, we have suggestive evidence that negative feedback by itself is not as effective.",
        "Additionally, positive feedback appears to play an important role.",
        "First, the 'model' and the 'positive' versions are statistically equivalent when we analyze performance on individual problems.",
        "Further, in the \"model\" version, the ratio of positive to negative messages turns out to be 9 to 1.",
        "In our tutoring dialogs, positive feedback still outnumbers negative feedback, but by a lower margin, 4 to 1.",
        "We hypothesize that conveying a positive attitude in an ITS is perhaps even more important than in human tutoring since a human has many more ways of conveying subtle shades of approval and disapproval.",
        "From the NLG point of view, we have presented a simple generation architecture that turns out to be rather effective.",
        "Among its clear limitations are the lack of hierarchical planning, and the fact that different components of a plan are generated independently one from the other.",
        "Among its strengths are that the plan operators are derived automatically via the rules we mined, both for content planning and, partly, for realization.",
        "It clearly remains to be seen whether our NLG framework can easily be ported to other domains - the issue is not domain dependence, but whether a more complex domain will require some form of hierarchical planning.",
        "We are now working in the domain of Computer Science data structures and algorithms, where we continue exploring the role of positive feedback.",
        "We collected data with two tutors in that domain, and there again, we found that in the human data positive feedback occurs about 8 times more often than negative feedback.",
        "We are now annotating the data to mine it as we did here, and developing the core ITS."
