        "The immediate motivating application context for the grec Task is the improvement of referential clarity and coherence in extractive summarisation by regenerating referring expressions in summaries.",

        "The grec Corpus (version 2.0) consists of about 2,000 texts in total, all collected from introductory sections in Wikipedia articles, in five different domains (cities, countries, rivers, people and mountains).",
        "In each text, three broad categories of Main Subject Reference (msr) have been annotated, resulting in a total of about 13,000 annotated res.",
        "The corpus was randomly divided into 90% training data (of which 10% were randomly selected as development data) and 10% test data.",
        "Participants used the training data in developing their systems, and (as a minimum requirement) reported results on the development data.",
        "Participants had 48 hours to submit outputs for the (previously unseen) test data.",
        "Three broad categories of main subject referring expression (msres) are annotated in the grec corpus – subject nps, object nps, and genitive nps and pronouns which function as subject-determiners within their matrix np.",
        "These categories of referring expression (re) are relatively straightforward to identify and achieve high inter-annotator agreement on (complete agreement among four annotators in 86% of msrs), and account for most cases of overt main subject reference (msr) in the grec texts.",

        "The motivation for annotating the approximate place where the subject n p would be if it were realised (the gap-like underscores above) is that from a generation perspective there is a choice to be made about whether to realise the subject np in the second and third coordinates or not.",

        "REFs have three attributes: ID, a unique reference identifier; SEMCAT, the semantic category of the referent, ranging over city, country, river, person, mountain; and SYNCAT, the syntactic category required of referential expressions for the referent in this discourse context (np-obj, np-subj, subj -det).",
        "A REF is composed of one REFEX element (the 'selected' referential expression for the given reference; in the corpus texts it is simply the referential expression found in the corpus) and one ALT-REFEX element which in turn is a list of refexs which are alternative referential expressions obtained by other means (see following section).",

        "When computed against the triple-re test set (C-2), first the number of correct REG0 8-Types is computed at the text level for each of the three versions of a corpus text and the maximum of these is determined; then the maximum text-level numbers are summed and divided by the total number of REFs in all the texts, which gives the global reg08-Type Accuracy score.",
        "The rationale behind computing the reg08-Type Accuracy scores in this way for multiple-re test sets (maximising scores on re chains rather than individual res) is that an re is not good or bad in its own right, but depends on the other msrs in the same text.",

        "In all cases, we assessed just the msres selected by peer systems (leaving out the surrounding text), and computed scores globally (rather than averaging over re-level scores), as this is standard for these metrics.",

        "We designed a reading/comprehension experiment in which the task for subjects was to read texts one sentence at a time and then to answer three brief multiple-choice comprehension questions after reading each text.",

        "The questions were designed to be of varying degrees of difficulty and predictability.",
        "There was one set of three questions (each with five possible answers) associated with each text, and questions followed the same pattern across the texts: the first question was always about the subdomain of a text; the second about the location of the main subject; the third question was designed not to be predictable.",
        "The order of the answers was randomised for each question and each subject.",
        "The order of texts (with associated questions) was randomised for each subject.",
        "We used the dmdx package for presentation of sentences and measuring reading times and question answering accuracy (Forster and Forster, 2003).",
        "Subjects did the experiment in a quiet room, under supervision.",
        "As a new and highly experimental method, we tried out an automatic approach to extrinsic evaluation.",
        "The basic idea was similar to that in the human-based experiments described above: badly chosen reference chains seem likely to affect the reader's ability to resolve res.",
        "In the automatic version, the role of the reader is played by an automatic coref-erence resolution tool and the expectation is that the tool performs worse (are less able to identify coref-erence chains correctly) with worse msr reference chains.",
        "To counteract the potential problem of results being a function of a specific coreference resolution algorithm or tool, we decided to use three different resolvers – those included in LingPipe, JavaRap (Qiu et al., 2004) and OpenNLP (Morton, 2005) – and to average results.",
        "There does not appear to be a single standard evaluation metric in the coreference resolution community, so we opted to use three: muc-6 (Vilain et al., 1995), ceaf (Luo, 2005), and b-cubed (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998), which seem to be the most widely accepted metrics.",
        "All three metrics compute Recall, Precision and F-Scores on aligned gold-standard and resolver-tool coreference chains.",
        "They differ in how the alignment is obtained and what components of corefer-ence chains are counted for calculating scores.",

        "Ranks for peer systems are very similar to the results reported in the last section.",

        "There were no significant differences under any of these analyses.",
        "Much of the variance in SRTimes was due to subjects' very different average reading speeds: means of SRTime normalised for sentence length ranged from 188.45ms to 426.10ms for individual subjects.",

        "The grec Task is a new task not only for an nlg shared-task challenge, but also as a research task in general (improving referential clarity in extractive summaries seems to be just taking off as a research subfield).",
        "It was therefore not unexpected that only three teams were able to participate in this task.",
        "We continued the traditions of the asgre'07 challenge in that we used a wide range of evaluation metrics to obtain a well-rounded view of the quality of the participating systems.",
        "It had been our intention to use evaluation methods in all four possible extrinsic/intrinsic and automatic/human combinations.",
        "However, the combination intrinsic/human is missing from this report and will have to be left to future research.",
        "There was no indication in the human task performance experiment that the different reference chains selected by different systems had any impact on subjects' reading speeds, and the evidence that there is an effect on comprehension was scant.",
        "This means that we will need to investigate alternative task-performance measures.",
        "Because of the lack of significant results from the human extrinsic experiment, we were also unable to validate the automatic extrinsic experiment against it, and so at this point we do not really know how useful it is (despite some correlation with intrinsic measures), something we will seek to establish in future research."
