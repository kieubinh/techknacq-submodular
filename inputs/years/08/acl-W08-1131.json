        "The tuna Challenge 2008 built on the foundations laid in the asgre 2007 Challenge (Belz and Gatt, 2007), which consisted of a single shared task, based on a subset of the tuna Corpus (Gatt et al., 2007).",
        "The tuna Corpus is a collection of human-authored descriptions of a referent, paired with a representation of the domain in which that description was elicited.",
        "The 2008 Challenge expanded the scope of the previous edition in a variety of ways.",
        "This year, there were three shared tasks.",
        "tuna-as is the Attribute Selection task piloted in the 2007 asgre Challenge, which involves the selection of a set of attributes which are true of a target referent, and help to distinguish it from its distractors in a domain.",
        "tuna-r is a realisation task, involving the mapping from attribute sets to linguistic descriptions.",
        "tuna-reg is an 'end to end' referring expression generation task, involving a mapping from an input domain to a linguistic description of a target referent.",
        "In addition, there was an Open Submission Track, where participants were invited to submit a report on any interesting research that involved the shared task data, and an Evaluation Track, for which submissions were invited on proposals for evaluation methods.",
        "This year's tuna Challenge also expanded considerably on the evaluation methods used in the various tasks.",
        "The measures can be divided into intrinsic, automatically computed methods, and extrinsic measures obtained through a task-oriented experiment involving human participants.",
        "The training and development data for the Challenge included the full dataset used in the asgre Challenge, that is, all of the 2007 training, development and test data.",
        "For the 2008 edition, two new test sets were constructed.",
        "Test Set 1 was used for tuna-r, Test Set 2 was used for both tuna-as and",
        "tuna-reg.",
        "Overall, 8 research groups submitted 33 systems by the deadline.",
        "Table 1 provides a summary of the submissions.",

        "No submissions were made to the Evaluation Track.",

        "Participants in tuna-as and tuna-r were also given the opportunity to submit peer outputs for tuna-reg, and having them included in the extrinsic evaluation, by making the use of off-the-shelf modules.",
        "For systems in tuna-as, we made available a template-based realiser, written by Irene Langkilde-Geary at the University of Brighton.",

        "All of these were automatically computed, and are subdivided into (a) those measures that assess humanlikeness, i.e. the degree of similarity between a peer output and a reference output; and (b) measures that assess intrinsic properties of peer outputs.",
        "Peer outputs from the tuna-reg task were also included in a human, task-oriented evaluation, which is extrinsic insofar as it measures the adequacy of a peer output in terms of its utility in an externally defined task.",
        "In the remainder of this section, we summarise the properties of the intrinsic methods.",
        "Section 3.1 describes the experiment conducted for the extrinsic evaluation.",
        "Dice coefficient (tuna-as): This is a set-comparison metric, ranging between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a perfect match between sets.",

        "2 x jA n Bj masi (tuna-as): The masi score (Passonneau, 2006) is an adaptation of the Jaccard coefficient which biases it in favour of similarity where one set is a subset of the other.",
        "Like Dice, it ranges between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a perfect match.",

        "Accuracy (all tasks): This is computed as the proportion of the peer outputs of a system which have an exact match to a reference output.",
        "In tuna-as, Accuracy was computed as the proportion of times a system returned an attribute-set identical to the reference attribute-set produced by a human author for the same domain.",
        "In tuna-r and tuna-reg, Accuracy was computed as the proportion of times a peer word-string was identical to the reference word-string produced by an author for the same domain.",
        "String-edit distance (tuna-r, tuna-reg): This is the classic Levenshtein distance measure, used to compare the difference between a peer output and a reference output in the corpus, as the minimal number of insertions, deletions and/or substitutions of words required to transform one string into another.",
        "The cost for insertions and deletions was set to 1, that for substitutions to 2.",
        "Edit distance is an integer bounded by the length of the longest description in the pair being compared.",

        "Unlike Dice, masi and String-edit, bleu is by definition an aggregate measure (i.e. a single bleu score is obtained for a system based on the entire set of items to be compared, and this is generally not equal to the average of bleu scores for individual items).",

        "Note that this definition includes Uniqueness as a prerequisite, since the description must identify the target entity uniquely in order to qualify for Minimality.",
        "All intrinsic evaluation methods except for bleu and nist were computed (a) overall, using the entire test data set (i.e. Test Set 1 or 2 as appropriate); and (b) by object type, that is, computing separate values for outputs referring to targets of type furniture and people.",
        "The experiment for the extrinsic evaluation of tuna-reg peer outputs combined a self-paced reading and identification paradigm, comparing the peer outputs from 10 of the tuna-reg systems shown in Table 1, as well as the two sets of human-authored reference outputs for Test Set 2.",
        "We refer to the latter as human 1 and human-2 in what fol-lows.",
        "In the task given to experimental subjects, a trial consisted of a description paired with a visual domain representation corresponding to an item in Test Set 2.",
        "Each trial was split into two phases: (a) in an initial reading phase, subjects were presented with the description only.",
        "This phase was terminated by subjects once they had read the description.",
        "(b) In the second, identification phase, subjects saw the visual domain in which the description had been produced, consisting of images of the domain entities in the same spatial configuration as that in the test set domain.",
        "They clicked on the object that they thought was the intended referent of the description they had read.",
        "The experiment yielded three dependent measures: (a) reading time (rt), measured from the point at which the description was presented, to the point at which a participant called up the next screen via mouse click; (b) identification time (it), measured from the point at which pictures (the visual domain) were presented on the screen to the point where a participant identified a referent by clicking on it; (c) error rate (er), the proportion of times the wrong referent was identified.",
        "This design differs from that used in the 2007 asgre Challenge, in which descriptions and visual domains were presented in a single phase (on the same screen), so that rt and it were conflated.",
        "The new experiment replicates the methodology reported in Gatt and Belz (2008), in a follow-up study on the asgre 2007 data.",
        "Another difference between the two experiments is that the current one is based on peer outputs which are themselves realisations, whereas the asgre experiment involved attribute sets which had to be realised before they could be used.",
        "Design: We used a Repeated Latin Squares design, in which each combination of system and test set item is allocated one trial.",
        "Since there were 12 levels of system, but 112 test set items, 8 randomly selected items (4 furniture and 4 people) were duplicated, yielding 120 items and 10 12 x 12 latin squares.",
        "The items were divided into two sets of 60.",
        "Half of the participants did the first 60 items (the first 5 latin squares), and the other half the second 60.",
        "Participants and procedure: The experiment was carried out by 24 participants recruited from among the faculty and administrative staff of the University of Brighton, as well as from among the authors' acquaintances.",
        "Participants carried out the experiment under supervision in a quiet room on a laptop.",
        "Stimulus presentation was carried out using dmdx, a Win-32 software package for psycholinguistic experiments involving time measurements (Forster and Forster, 2003).",
        "Participants initiated each trial, which consisted of an initial warning bell and a fixation point flashed on the screen for 1000ms.",
        "They then read the description and called up the visual domain to identify the referent.",
        "Trials timed out after 15000ms.",
        "Treatment of outliers and timeouts: Trials which timed out with no response were discounted from the analysis.",
        "Out of a total of (24 x 60 =) 1440 trials, there were 4 reading timeouts (0.3%) and 7 identification timeouts (0.5%).",
        "Outliers for rt and it were defined as those exceeding a threshold of mean ±2SD.",
        "There were 64 outliers on rt (4.4%) and 191 on it (13.3%).",

        "Referring Expression Generation was an ideal starting point, because of its relatively long history within the nlg community, and the widespread agreement on inputs, outputs and task definitions.",
        "The tasks described and evaluated in this report constitute a broadening of scope over the 2007 Challenge.",
        "Like the previous Challenge, the 2008 edition emphasised diversity in terms of the measures of quality used.",
        "This year, there was also an increased emphasis on broadening the range of tasks, with the inclusion of realisation and end-to-end referring expressions generation.",
        "This extends the scope of the REG problem, which has traditionally been focussed on content determination (attribute selection) for the most part.",
        "As for evaluation, the diversity of measures can shed light on different aspects of quality in these tasks.",
        "The fact that the correlation among measures based on different quality criteria is not straightforward is in itself an argument for maintaining this diversity, particularly as comparative evaluation exercises such as this one provide the opportunity for further investigation of the nature of these relationships.",
        "Another indicator of the growing diversity in this year's Challenge is the range of algorithmic solutions in the three tasks, ranging from new models based on classical algorithms, to data-driven methods, evolutionary algorithms, and graph-and tree-based frameworks.",
        "The body of work represented by submissions to the TuNA-R and TuNA-REG tasks is also interesting for its exploration of how to apply",
