        "A review of the referring expressions shows that humans prefer frequently distinct attributes and attribute combination such as in the following examples.",
        "the one in the top left corner (31t1), the one to the left in the middle row (31t2), the bottom right most one (31t3), the blue chair at the bottom center (31t5), etc.",
        "The first individual (#30) seems to prefer colour and size while the second one (#31) seems to prefer the relative position (to the left) and places (the top left corner).",
        "Because of the review, we checked, if the Incremental Algorithm (Dale and Reiter, 1995) using the order for the attributes due to the frequency calculated for each individual can outperform the algorithm using the order for the attributes due to the frequency of the complete training set.",
        "This was the case.",
        "Table 1 shows the results.",
        "Using the individual attribute order, the IA performed as good as the FBN algorithm, cf. Table 1.",
        "However, the FBN algorithm generates all possible referring expressions and selects based on the dice metric the most similar expressions ofthe same human.",
        "Since there is usually a set ofequal good referring expressions, it is possible to select a referring expression among these results due to another metric.",
        "That this would improve the results shows the experiment to selected among these results the referring expression that is closest to the correct result.",
        "The outcome was that the FBN algorithm has still about 9% room for improvements.",
        "The following sections investigates possibilities to use this chance.",
        "An important metric is the identification time that is the time which is used by a human to identify an entity due to a given referring expression.",
        "The identification time is very loosely related with the number of minimal referring expressions and therefore likely with the length of a referring expression.",
        "The best identification times had a system with 74% minimal referring expressions and the second and third best systems had about 41%.",
        "Good identification times had nearly all systems with only a maximum difference of 0.38 seconds except FBN and FBS which are about 1.05 and 1.49 seconds behind the best one.",
        "This is a huge difference compared to all other systems.",
        "What could be the reason for that?",
        "We know of two differences of FBN to all other systems: (1) the lowest portion of minimal referring expressions of all systems and (2) the nearest neighbour learning technique.",
        "The number of minimal referring expressions is also different to the number of expressions found in the training set.",
        "Table 2 shows in the columns human the average length and portion of minimal human referring expressions.",
        "Because of the different length of the human and the generated expressions, we conducted the experiment to chose always the shortest.",
        "Table 2 shows the change between the random selection (FBN) and the selection of the shortest (FP).",
        "The experiment leads to a result that have a length and percentage of minimal referring expressions in average similar to the humans ones, cf. columns of human and shortest.",
