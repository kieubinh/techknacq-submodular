        "TAP (Text Arranging Pipeline) is a set of interfaces that define generic functionality for a pipeline of tasks oriented toward natural language generation, from an initial conceptual input to surface realization as a string, with intervening stages of content planning and sentence planning.",
        "The TAP architecture considers three basic stages: content planning, sentence planning and surface realization.",
        "Of these, the first stage is not relevant to the challenge tasks.",
        "The configuration choices applied to the other two stages to adapt them to the challenge tasks are described below."

        "The NIL-UCM-MFVF for Task 1 applies a Most-Frequent-Value-First method for Attribute Selection.",
        "Of the five evaluation dimensions considered in this challenge (Dice, MASI, accuracy, minimality and uniqueness), this method has been designed to address explicitly only three: Dice, MASI and uniqueness.",
        "Minimality was abandoned in view of results in previous challenges (Hervas and Gervas, 2007) that showed good minimality results tended to produce low Dice scores.",
        "We have also opted for not using accuracy evaluation to fit the performance of our system, since the corpus contains a wide range of style of reference and we are interested in providing our system with only a subset of these that ensure correct identification.",
        "The selection algorithm employed is an adaptation of the algorithm described in (Reiter and Dale, 1992).",
        "The original algorithm has been modified to allow for a dynamically changing list of preferred attributes, which determine the particular order in which attributes are considered to generate the distinguishing expression.",
        "This list is constructed dynamically for each reference by computing the probability of occurrence in the corpus of the particular attribute-value pairs associated with the referent, and using those probabilities to rank them into a specific list of preferred attributes.",
        "The idea is that attributes should be considered in a particular order depending highly on their values.",
        "For example, in the people domain we have observed that almost the 100% of the target entities that have beard (attribute has value 1) are referred using the attribute hasBeard, but when this attribute has value 0 it is never used.",
        "For the hasHair attribute, the opposite seems to be the case (mentioned only when lacking).",
        "The training data was studied to obtain the probability of occurrence of an attribute given a certain value for it.",
        "This probability was calculated using Formula 1:",
        "b J2 appsValuelnAttSet \"a J2 appsValuelnTarget",
        "For each possible value of each of the attributes of the domains, the sum of the appearances of this value in the ATTRIBUTE-SET elements (appsVal-ueInAttSet) and the sum of the appearances of this value in the attributes ofall targets (appsValueInTar-get) are calculated.",
        "The division ofthese two values is the probability of mentioning an attribute when it has a specific value.",
        "Table 1:Task 1 results for training and development data",
        "Some examples of the results obtained are that the attribute hasGlasses is mentioned in the 60% of the situations when its value is 1, and in the 0% of the situations when its value is 0 .",
        "On the contrary, the attribute hasShirt is almost never mentioned (0.8% when its value is 1 and 0% with value 0).",
        "The only exception in the algorithm is the type attribute for the people domain.",
        "As every entity in this domain is of type person, the attribute selector does not choose this attribute because no distractor is discarded by it.",
        "However, the experiments have shown us that in the corpus a lot of descriptions include the type person even when it is redundant.",
        "Following this idea, our algorithm always includes the type in the list of chosen attributes for the people domain.",
        "Results obtained over the training and development data are shown in Table 1.",
        "As can be seen comparing both tables there are no surprises in the final results: the system gets similar results with both domains and with both the training and development data.",
        "These results confirm that the probability of appearance of an attribute depending on its value is more or less the same in the whole corpus."

        "The realization tasks of the 2008 GRE challenge required specific instantiations of the Referring Expression Generation, Syntactic Choice, and Lexical-ization stages of the Sentence Planning module of TAP, and it draws on the SurReal (Gervas, 2006) surface realization module.",
        "SurReal provides a Java implementation of the surface realization mechanisms of FUF described in Elhadad (Elhadad, 1993), operating over a grammar which follows the notational conventions of the SURGE grammar in Elhadad (El-hadad and Robin, 1996), but it is not systemic in nature.",
        "It currently has much smaller coverage than the original, but quite sufficient to deal with the kind of realizations required for the challenge tasks.",
        "An analysis of the domain was carried out to ascertain what the various alternatives required for realization were for the given corpus, both in terms of how to realize syntactically the different concepts and what alternative lexicalizations should be considered.",
        "With respect to linguistic variation in the form of expression we have distinguished between choices that give rise to different syntactic structures (which we consider as syntactic choices) and choices which give rise to the same syntactic structures but with different lexical items (which we consider as lexical choices).",
        "With respect to the Referring Expression Generation stage, the following issues required specific decisions.",
        "The use of determiners is erratic.",
        "Some examples in the corpus use indefinite article, some use definite articles, and some omit the determiners altogether.",

        "The use of particular features of the object in its description, as in \"the desk with the drawers facing the viewer\" or \"the chair with the seat facing away\".",
        "Comparison with all or some of the distractors are also used, either as adjuncts describing their position relative to other distractors, as in \"the blue fan next to the green fan\", or as comparative adjectives used for particular attributes, as in \"the largest red couch\" (and even combinations of the two as in \"the smaller of the two blue fans\").",
        "Finally, there are samples in the corpus of use of ellipsis and ungrammatical expressions.",
        "The mention of particular features and the use of comparison would involve operating on more data than are generated in task 1, and the current submission is aimed to interconnection with task 2 for addressing task 3.",
        "The issue of ungrammaticality is important since it implies that there is an upper limit to the possible scores that the system may achieve over the corpus under the circumstances, totally unrelated with the correctness of the generated expressions.",

        "Nevertheless, some of the variations in the corpus, such as the free use of determiners or the flexibility that subjects exhibit in the way they refer to the images do introduce a certain \"noise\".",
