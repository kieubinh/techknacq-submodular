        "Classification tasks fall into two broad categories.",
        "Those in the first category proceed by requiring that every item is explicitly assigned a tag out of a given set of tags; part-of-speech tagging is an example (Santorini, 1990).",
        "In the second group of tasks, the annotator is asked to identify a phenomenon of interest, thus implicitly classifying items as belonging to the phenomenon (marked) and not belonging to it (left unmarked).",
        "When the studied phenomenon is expected to have low incidence, this is a time-saving strategy, as annotators do not need to bother with explicitly marking (almost) everything as a non-phenomenon.",
        "A recent example of such a task is Beigman Klebanov and Shamir (2006), where annotators were asked to provide anchors for words",

        "Some rights reserved.",
        "deemed anchored in the text (i.e. associatively connected to a previous item in the text), thus leaving words that did not receive an anchor implicitly marked as un-anchored.",
        "Psychological experiments where people are asked to respond to the occurrence of a given phenomenon can also be viewed as implicit classifications; for example, see Spiro's (2007) work on identification of boundaries of musical phrases by listeners.",
        "The task of metaphor detection discussed in this paper also falls under the implicit classification category.",
        "While such a strategy uses annotators' time efficiently, some of the observed disagreements could be due to an annotator missing an occurrence of the relevant phenomenon, rather than genuinely disagreeing on the matter of occurrence.",
        "We show in section 2 that our metaphor identification task features less-than-perfect inter-annotator agreement.",
        "Section 3 uses Beigman Klebanov and Shamir's (2006) methodology to find annotations that can be reliably attributed to a deliberate decision by at least some of the annotators.",
        "We then discuss the use of validation experiment to distinguish between slips of attention and genuine disagreements (sections 4,5)."
