        "Finally, the mutual comparison of competitors' results, at the end of the evaluation campaign, confirms the choices we made at its starting point, and provides means to redefine the task when we shall launch a future campaign based on the same topic."

        "Each corpus had the interesting feature of combining a mark or opinion with a descriptive text, as the mark was used to sum up the judment in the argumentative part of this text.",

        "• 20 values for video game reviews (a global mark calculated from a set of advices about various aspects of the game: graphics, payability, life span, sound track and scenario).",
        "In order to, first, assess the feasibility of the task, and to, secondly, define the scale of values to be used in the evaluation campaign, we submitted human judges to several tests (Paek, 2001): they were instructed to assign a mark on two kinds of scale, a wide one with the original values, and a restricted one with 2 or 3 values, depending on the corpus it was applying to.",
        "The results from various judges were evaluated in terms of precision and recall, and matched to each other by way of the Kappa coefficient (C arietta, 1996) (Cohen, 1960).",
        "We present hereunder the values of the n coefficient between pairs of human judges, and with the reference, on the video game corpus.",
        "The wide scale (Table 1) uses the original values (marks between 0 and 20), while the restricted scale (Table 2) relies upon 3 values with following definitions: class 0 for original marks between 0 and 10, class 1 for marks between 11 and 14, and class 2 for marks between 15 and 20.",
        "Table 1 and 2 show that agreement between judges varies widely when marking scales are modified.",
        "Table 1 shows that there is an insufficient agreement among judges on the wide scale, with k coefficients lower than 0.20, while the agreement between these same judges can be considered as good on the restricted scale, with n coefficients between 0.54 and 0.79 (Table 2), the median being at 0.74.",
        "In order to confirm the validity of the change in scales, we used the n to test how each judge agreed with himself, between his two sets of results (Table 3).",
        "Therefore, we compared judgments made by each judge using the initial value scale and converted towards the restricted scale, with judgments made by the same judge directly using the restricted value scale.",
        "This measurement shows the degree of correspondence between both scales for each judge.",
        "Among the three judges who took part in the test, the first and third one agree well with themselves, while for the second one, the agreement is only moderate.",
        "We did the same for a second corpus, of film reviews.",
        "The test involved five judges, and the scale change was smaller, since it was from five values to three, and not from twenty to three.",
        "For this scale change, we merged the two lowest values (0 and 1) into one (0), and the two highest ones (3 and 4) into one (2), and the middle value in the wide scale (2) remained the intermediate one in the restricted scale (1).",
        "This scale change was the most relevant one, since, with 29.7% of the documents, the class of the middle mark (2) accounted for almost one third of the corpus.",
        "However, the two other groups of documents are less well balanced.",
        "Indeed, the lowest mark concerns less documents than the highest one: 4.6% and 10.3% respectively for the initial marks 0 and 1, while one finds 39.8% and 15.6% of documents for the marks 3 and 4.",
        "Grouping the documents in only two classes, by joining the middle class with the two lowest ones, would have yielded a better balance between classes, with 44.6% of documents for the lower mark and 55.4% for the higher one, but that would have been less meaningful.",

        "The 2007 edition of DEFT highlighted two main phenomena concerning the corpora involved in the task.",
        "First, each corpus yielded a different level of difficulty, and this gradation of difficulty among corpora appeared both for human evaluators and competitors in the challenge (Paroubek et al., 2007).",
        "Table 10: Minimal and maximal strict F-scores between human evaluators and competitors in the challenge, 2007 edition.",
        "During human tests, judges mentioned the great facility of finding about opinions expressed in the corpus of parliamentary debate.",
        "Next came corpora of video game reviews, and then of film and book reviews, whose difficulty was considered average, and last, the corpus of scientific paper reviews, which the judges perceived as particularly difficult.",
        "This gradation of difficulty among corpora was also found among competitors, following the same ordering of three levels of difficulty.",
        "Secondly, the difficulties met by human evaluators are also found in the case of competitors.",
        "Upon finishing human tests, judges felt difficulties in evaluating the corpus of scientific paper reviews, yielding poor results.",
        "Now, the results of competitors on the same corpus are quite as poor, occupying exactly the same value interval as for human judges.",
        "Most competitors, by the way, obtained their worst results on this corpus.",
        "The alikeness of results between judges and competitors reflects the complexity of the corpus: when preparing the campaign, we observed that reviews were quite short.",
        "Therefore, assigning a value had to rely upon a small amount of data.",
        "From that, we can derive a minimal size for documents to be used in this kind of evaluation.",
        "Moreover, a paper review can be seen as an aid for the author, to be expressed as positively as possible, even if it is also addressed to the Program Committee which has to accept or reject the paper.",
        "Therefore, the mark could prove more negative than the text of the review.",
        "The case of comments about videogames is a different one.",
        "Indeed, giving a global mark on a scale of 20 is a difficult task.",
        "Therefore, this mark comes most often from a sum of smaller marks which rate either the whole document according to various criteria, or parts of this document.",
        "In our corpus, each reviewer rates the game according to several criteria, namely, graphics, playability, life span, sound track and scenario, from which a rather long text is produced, making the judgment an easier task to perform.",
        "However, the global mark differs from the sum of the smaller ones from various criteria, hence the difficulty for human judges to reckon this global mark on a scale of20.",
        "Contrary to the 2007 edition, in which competitors obtained results that confirmed those of human judges, the 2008 edition gave them the opportunity to reach a higher level than human evaluators.",
        "While genre identification yielded no special problem, either for human evaluators or for competitors, and the results obtained by both groups are similar, competitors reached better results than human judges in topical categorization.",
        "Concerning genre identification, strict F-scores are situated between 0.94 and 1.00 for human judges, and between 0.95 and 0.98 for the best runs of competitors (each competitor was allowed to submit up to three collections of results, only the best one being used for the final ranking).",
        "As for topical categorization, strict F-scores go from 0.66 to 0.82 for human evaluators, and from 0.84 to 0.89 for best runs from competitors.",
        "The equivalence of results on genre identification between judges and competitors can be explained by the fact that it was a simple, binary choice (the newspaper Le Monde vs. Wikipedia).",
        "Contrariwise, competitors obtained better results in topical categorization, since machines have a stronger abstraction capacity than humans in presence of the 9 topical categories we defined (Art, Economy, France, International, Literature, Science Society Sport and Television).",
        "However, conditions were not quite similar, since human judges had to pick a category among eight, and not, like the automatic systems, a category within two subsets of four and five categories.",
        "Indeed, we dispatched the categories into two sets, by balancing categories that are easy or difficult for human evaluators.",
        "For the second set of categories, we carefully put together three semantically close ones, (France, International and Society, all three of them being about political and societal contents), to make the task more difficult.",
        "Although the second set of categories seems more complicated for human judges, half of the competitors obtained better results in topical categorization of the second set than of the first one.",

        "The relevance of human judgment in an evaluation campaign is present from the beginning to the end of a campaign.",
        "In a first step, testing a topic for a campaign among a limited number of human evaluators allows us to check the feasibility of a task.",
        "This checking relies both on the results obtained by judges (recall, precision, F-scores) and on their personal impressions after passing the test.",
        "In a second step, the study of both the results obtained by the judges, and their pairwise matching involving such a comparator as the n coefficient allows us to adjust the task (choice of a marking scale for DEFT'07 and selection of topical categories for DEFT'08).",
        "Finally, the mutual comparison of competitors' results, at the end of the evaluation campaign, allows us to validate the choices we made at its starting point, and even to reposition the task when we shall launch a future campaign based on the same topic.",
