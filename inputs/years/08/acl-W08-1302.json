        "Modern statistical parsers are trained on large annotated corpora (treebanks) and their parameters are estimated to reflect properties of the training data.",
        "Therefore, a disambiguation component will be successful as long as the treebank it was trained on is representative for the input the model gets.",
        "However, as soon as the model is applied to another domain, or text genre (Lease et al., 2006), accuracy degrades considerably.",
        "For example, the performance of a parser trained on the Wall Street Journal (newspaper text) significantly drops when evaluated on the more varied Brown (fiction/non-fiction) corpus (Gildea, 2001).",
        "A simple solution to improve performance on a new domain is to construct a parser specifically",
        "©2008.",
        "Some rights reserved.",
        "for that domain.",
        "However, this amounts to hand-labeling a considerable amount of training data which is clearly very expensive and leads to an unsatisfactory solution.",
        "In alternative, techniques for domain adaptation, also known as parser adaptation (McClosky et al., 2006) or genre portability (Lease et al., 2006), try to leverage either a small amount of already existing annotated data (Hara et al., 2005) or unlabeled data (McClosky et al., 2006) of one domain to parse data from a different domain.",
        "In this study we examine an approach that assumes a limited amount of already annotated in-domain data.",
        "We explore auxiliary distributions (Johnson and Riezler, 2000) for domain adaptation, originally suggested for the incorporation of lexical selectional preferences into a parsing system.",
        "We gauge the effect of exploiting a more general, out-of-domain model for parser adaptation to overcome the limited amount of in-domain training data.",
        "The approach is examined on two application domains, question answering and spoken data.",
        "For the empirical trials, we use Alpino (van Noord and Malouf, 2005; van Noord, 2006), a robust computational analyzer for Dutch.",
        "Alpino employs a discriminative approach to parse selection that bases its decision on a Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) model.",
        "Section 2 introduces the MaxEnt framework.",
        "Section 3 describes our approach of exploring auxiliary distributions for domain adaptation.",

      "heading": "2. Background: MaxEnt Models",
      "text": [
        "Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) models are widely used in Natural Language Processing (Berger et al., 1996; Ratnaparkhi, 1997; Abney, 1997).",
        "In this framework, a disambiguation model is specified by a set of feature functions describing properties of the data, together with their associated weights.",
        "The weights are learned during the training procedure so that their estimated value determines the contribution of each feature.",
        "In the task of parsing, features appearing in correct parses are given increasing weight, while features in incorrect parses are given decreasing weight.",
        "Once a model is trained, it can be applied to parse selection that chooses the parse with the highest sum of feature weights.",
        "During the training procedure, the weights vector is estimated to best fit the training data.",
        "In more detail, given m features with their corresponding empirical expectation Ep[fj] and a default model qo, we seek a model p that has minimum Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence from the default model qo, subject to the expected-value constraints: Ep[fj] = Ep[fj], where j G l,...,m.",
        "In MaxEnt estimation, the default model qo is often only implicit (Velldal and Oepen, 2005) and not stated in the model equation, since the model is assumed to be uniform (e.g. the constant function for sentence s, where Q(s) is the set of parse trees associated with s).",
        "Thus, we seek the model with minimum KL divergence from the uniform distribution, which means we search model p with maximum entropy (uncertainty) subject to given constraints (Abney, 1997).",
        "In alternative, if qo is not uniform then p is called a minimum divergence model (according to (Berger and Printz, 1998)).",
        "In the statistical parsing literature, the default model qo that can be used to incorporate prior knowledge is also referred to as base model (Berger and Printz, 1998), default or reference distribution (Hara et al., 2005; Johnson et al., 1999; Velldal and Oepen, 2005).",
        "The solution to the estimation problem of finding distribution p, that satisfies the expected-value constraints and minimally diverges from qo, has been shown to take a specific parametric form (Berger and Printz, 1998):",
        "with m feature functions, s being the input sentence, uj a corresponding parse tree, and Zo the normalization equation:",
        "Since the sum in equation 2 ranges over all possible parse trees uo e f2 admitted by the grammar, calculating the normalization constant renders the estimation process expensive or even intractable (Johnson et al., 1999).",
        "To tackle this problem, Johnson et al.",
        "(1999) redefine the estimation procedure by considering the conditional rather than the joint probability.",
        "with Zq as in equation 2, but instead, summing over {J G 0,(s), where Q(s) is the set of parse trees associated with sentence s. Thus, the probability of a parse tree is estimated by summing only over the possible parses of a specific sentence.",
        "Still, calculating Q(s) is computationally very expensive (Osborne, 2000), because the number of parses is in the worst case exponential with respect to sentence length.",
        "Therefore, Osborne (2000) proposes a solution based on informative samples.",
        "He shows that is suffices to train on an informative subset of available training data to accurately estimate the model parameters.",
        "Alpino implements the Osborne-style approach to Maximum Entropy parsing.",

        "Auxiliary distributions (Johnson and Riezler, 2000) offer the possibility to incorporate information from additional sources into a MaxEnt Model.",
        "In more detail, auxiliary distributions are integrated by considering the logarithm of the probability given by an auxiliary distribution as an additional, real-valued feature.",
        "More formally, given k auxiliary distributions Qi(ui), then k new auxiliary features fm+i, fm+k are added such that where Qi(ui) do not need to be proper probability distributions, however they must strictly be positive Vw G O (Johnson and Riezler, 2000).",
        "The auxiliary distributions resemble a reference distribution, but instead of considering a single reference distribution they have the advantage that several auxiliary distributions can be integrated and weighted against each other.",
        "Johnson establishes the following equivalence between the two (Johnson and Riezler, 2000; Velldal and Oepen, 2005):",
        "where Q{uS) is the reference distribution and Qi{uS) is an auxiliary distribution.",
        "Hence, the contribution of each auxiliary distribution is regulated through the estimated feature weight.",
        "In general, a model that includes k auxiliary features as given in equation (4) takes the following form (Johnson and Riezler, 2000):",
        "Due to the equivalence relation in equation (5) we can restate the equation to explicitly show that auxiliary distributions are additional features.",
        "While (Johnson and Riezler, 2000; van Noord, 2007) focus on incorporating several auxiliary distributions for lexical selectional preferences, in this study we explore auxiliary distributions for domain adaptation.",
        "We exploit the information of the more general model, estimated from a larger, out-of-domain treebank, for parsing data from a particular target domain, where only a small amount of training data is available.",
        "A related study is Hara et al.",
        "(2005).",
        "While they also assume a limited amount of in-domain training data, their approach",
        "'Note that the step from equation (6) to (7) holds by restating equation (4) as Qi(uj) = expJ'm+i^",
        "differs from ours in that they incorporate an original model as a reference distribution, and their estimation procedure is based on parse forests (Hara et al., 2005; van Noord, 2006), rather than informative samples.",
        "In this study, we want to gauge the effect of auxiliary distributions, which have the advantage that the contribution of the additional source is regulated.",
        "More specifically, we extend the target model to include (besides the original integer-valued features) one additional real-valued feature (k=l).",
        "Its value is defined to be the negative logarithm of the conditional probability given by OUT, the original, out-of-domain, Alpino model.",
        "Hence, the general model is 'merged' into a single auxiliary feature:",
        "The parameter of the new feature is estimated using the same estimation procedure as for the remaining model parameters.",
        "Intuitively, our auxiliary feature models dispreferences of the general model for certain parse trees.",
        "When the Alpino model assigns a high probability to a parse candidate, the auxiliary feature value will be small, close to zero.",
        "In contrast, a low probability parse tree in the general model gets a higher feature value.",
        "Together with the estimated feature weight expected to be negative, this has the effect that a low probability parse in the Alpino model will reduce the probability of a parse in the target domain.",
        "In this section we sketch an alternative approach where we keep only two features under the Max-Ent framework: one is the log probability assigned by the out-domain model, the other the log probability assigned by the in-domain model:",
        "The contribution of each feature is again scaled through the estimated feature weights 61,62.",
        "We can see this as a simple instantiation of model combination.",
        "In alternative, data combination is a domain adaptation method where IN and OUT-domain data is simply concatenated and a new model trained on the union of data.",
        "A potential and well known disadvantage of data combination is that the usually larger amount of out-domain data",
        "Or alternatively, k > 1 (see section 4.3.1).",
        "'overwhelms' the small amount of in-domain data.",
        "Instead, Model combination interpolates the two models in a linear fashion by scaling their contribution.",
        "Note that if we skip the parameter estimation step and simply assign the two parameters equal values (equal weights), the method reduces to Pout{u\\s) x Pjn(uj\\s), i.e. just multiplying the respective model probabilities."

        "The general model is trained on the Alpino Treebank (van Noord, 2006) (newspaper text; approximately 7,000 sentences).",
        "For the domain-specific corpora, in the first set of experiments (section 4.3) we consider the Alpino CLEF Treebank (questions; approximately 1,800 sentences).",
        "In the second part (section 4.4) we evaluate the approach on the Spoken Dutch corpus (Oostdijk, 2000) (CGN, 'Corpus Gesproken Nederlands'; spoken data; size varies, ranging from 17 to 1,193 sentences).",
        "The CGN corpus contains a variety of components/subdomains to account for the various dimensions of language use (Oostdijk, 2000).",
        "The output of the parser is evaluated by comparing the generated dependency structure for a corpus sentence to the gold standard dependency structure in a treebank.",
        "For this comparison, we represent the dependency structure (a directed acyclic graph) as a set of named dependency relations.",
        "To compare such sets of dependency relations, we count the number of dependencies that are identical in the generated parse and the stored structure, which is expressed traditionally using precision, recall and f-score (Briscoe et al., 2002).",
        "Let Dp be the number of dependencies produced by the parser for sentence i, D%g is the number of dependencies in the treebank parse, and DlQ is the number of correct dependencies produced by the parser.",
        "If no superscript is used, we aggregate over all sentences of the test set, i.e.,:",
        "Precision is the total number of correct dependencies returned by the parser, divided by the overall number of dependencies returned by the parser (precision = D0/Dp); recall is the number of correct system dependencies divided by the total number of dependencies in the treebank (recall = D0/Dg).",
        "As usual, precision and recall can be combined in a single f-score metric.",
        "An alternative similarity score for dependency structures is based on the observation that for a given sentence of n words, a parser would be expected to return n dependencies.",
        "In such cases, we can simply use the percentage of correct dependencies as a measure of accuracy.",
        "Such a labeled dependency accuracy is used, for instance, in the CoNLL shared task on dependency parsing (\"labeled attachment score\").",
        "Our evaluation metric is a variant of labeled dependency accuracy, in which we do allow for some discrepancy between the number of returned dependencies.",
        "Such a discrepancy can occur, for instance, because in the syntactic annotations of Alpino (inherited from the CGN) words can sometimes be dependent on more than a single head (called 'secondary edges' in CGN).",
        "A further cause is parsing failure, in which case a parser might not produce any dependencies.",
        "We argue elsewhere (van Noord, In preparation) that a metric based on f-score can be misleading in such cases.",
        "The resulting metric is called concept accuracy, in, for instance, Boros et al.",
        "(1996).",
        "The concept accuracy metric can be characterized as the mean of a per-sentence minimum of recall and precision.",
        "The resulting CA score therefore is typically slightly lower than the corresponding f-score, and, for the purposes of this paper, equivalent to labeled dependency accuracy.",
        "In the first set of experiments we focus on the Question Answering (QA) domain (CLEF corpus).",
        "Besides evaluating our auxiliary based approach (section 3), we conduct separate baseline experiments:",

        "On two datasets (CLEF 2004 and 2005) this simple technique reaches a substantial improvement over all other models.",
        "On only one dataset (CLEF 2006) it falls slightly off the in-domain baseline, but still considerably outperforms data combination.",
        "This is true for both model combination methods, with estimated and equal weights.",
        "In general, the results show that model combination usually outperforms data combination (with the exception of one dataset, CLEF 2007), where, interestingly, the simplest model combination (equal weights) often performs best.",
        "Contrary to expectations, the auxiliary based approach performs poorly and could often not even come close to the results obtained by simple model combination.",
        "In the following we will explore possible reasons for this result.",
        "Examining possible causes One possible point of failure could be that the auxiliary feature was simply ignored.",
        "If the estimated weight would be close to zero the feature would indeed not contribute to the disambiguation task.",
        "Therefore, we examined the estimated weights for that feature.",
        "From that analysis we saw that, compared to the other features, the auxiliary feature got a weight relatively far from zero.",
        "It got on average a weight of – 0.0905 in our datasets and as such is among the most influential weights, suggesting it to be important for disambiguation.",
        "Another question that needs to be asked, however, is whether the feature is modeling properly the original Alpino model.",
        "For this sanity check, we create a model that contains only the single auxiliary feature and no other features.",
        "The feature's weight is set to a constant negative value.",
        "The resulting model's performance is assessed on the complete CLEF data.",
        "The results (0% column in table 3) show that the auxiliary feature is indeed properly modeling the general Alpino model, as the two result in identical performance.",
        "In the experiments so far the general model was 'packed' into a single feature value.",
        "To check whether the feature alone is too weak, we examine the inclusion of several auxiliary distributions (k > 1).",
        "Each auxiliary feature we add represents a 'submodel' corresponding to an actual feature template class used in the original model.",
        "The feature's value is the negative log-probability as defined in equation 11, where OUT corresponds to the respective Alpino submodel.",
        "The current Disambiguation Model of Alpino uses the 21 feature templates (van Noord and Mal-ouf, 2005).",

        "One might argue that the question domain is rather 'easy', given the already high baseline performance and the fact that few hand-annotated questions are enough to obtain a reasonable model.",
        "Therefore, we examine our approach on CGN (Oostdijk, 2000).",
        "The empirical results of testing using cross-validation within a subset of CGN subdomains are given in table 4.",
        "The baseline accuracies are much lower on this more heterogeneous, spoken, data, leaving more room for potential improvements over the in-domain model.",
        "However, the results show that the auxiliary based approach does not work on the CGN subdomains either.",
        "The approach is not able to improve even on datasets where very little training data is available (e.g. comp-1), thus confirming our previous finding.",
        "Moreover, in some cases the auxiliary feature rather, although only slightly, degrades performance (indicated in italic in table 4) and performs worse than the counterpart model without the additional feature.",
        "Depending on the different characteristics of data/domain and its size, the best model adaptation method varies on CGN.",
        "On some subdomains simple model combination performs best, while on others it is more beneficial to just apply the original, out-of-domain Alpino model.",
        "To conclude, model combination achieves in most cases a modest improvement, while we have shown empirically that our domain adaptation method based on auxiliary distributions performs just similar to a model trained on in-domain data."

        "We examined auxiliary distributions (Johnson and Riezler, 2000) for domain adaptation.",
        "While the auxiliary approach has been successfully applied to lexical selectional preferences (Johnson and Riezler, 2000; van Noord, 2007), our empirical results show that integrating a more general into a domain-specific model through the auxiliary feature approach does not help.",
        "The auxiliary approach needs training data to estimate the weight(s) of the auxiliary feature(s).",
        "When little training data is available, the weight cannot be estimated appropriately and hence is not contributing enough compared to the other features.",
        "This result was confirmed on both examined domains.",
        "We conclude that the auxiliary feature approach is not appropriate for integrating information of a more general model to leverage limited in-domain data.",
        "Better results were achieved either without adaptation or by simple model combination.",
        "Future work will consist in investigating other possibilities for parser adaptation, especially semi-supervised domain adaptation, where no labeled in-domain data is available.",
