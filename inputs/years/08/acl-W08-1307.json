      "text": [
        "In this paper we examine the various decisions made by designers of parser evaluation schemes based on grammatical relations (Lin, 1995; Carroll et al., 1998).",
        "Following Carroll et al.",
        "(1998), we use the term grammatical relations to refer to syntactic dependencies between heads and dependents.",
        "We assume that grammatical relation schemes are currently the best method available for parser evaluation due to their relative independence of any particular parser or linguistic theory.",
        "There are several grammatical relation schemes currently available, for example Carroll et al.",
        "(1998), King et al.",
        "(2003), and de Marneffe et al.",
        "(2006).",
        "However, there has been little analysis of the decisions made by the designers in creating",
        "© 2008.",
        "Some rights reserved.",
        "what turns out to be a complex set of dependencies for naturally occurring sentences.",
        "In particular, in this paper we consider how the process can be made more modular to help the parsing community converge on a single scheme.",
        "The first decision to be made by the scheme designer is what types of linguistic constructions should be covered by the scheme.",
        "By construction we mean syntactic phenomena such as subject of verb, direct object of verb, passive voice, coordination, relative clause, apposition, and so on.",
        "In this paper we assume that the constructions of interest have already been identified (and there does appear to be broad agreement on this point across the existing schemes).",
        "A construction can be thought of as a unitary linguistic object, although it is often represented by several grammatical relations.",
        "The second decision to be made is which words are involved in a particular construction.",
        "This is important because a subset of these words will be arguments of the grammatical relations representing the construction.",
        "Again, we assume that there is already broad agreement among the existing schemes regarding this question.",
        "One possible point of disagreement is whether to include empty elements in the representation, for example when a passive verb has no overt subject, but we will not address that issue here.",
        "The next question, somewhat orthogonal to the previous one, and a source of disagreement between schemes, is how informative the representation should be.",
        "By informative we mean the amount of linguistic information represented in the scheme.",
        "As well as relations between heads, some schemes include one or more features, each of which expresses information about an individual head.",
        "These features can be the locus of richer linguistic information than is represented in the dependencies.",
        "A useful example here is tense and mood information for verbs.",
        "This is included in the parc scheme, for example, but not in the Briscoe and Carroll or Stanford schemes; parc is in general more informative and detailed than competing schemes.",
        "Although features are technically different from relations, they form part of an overall evaluation scheme and must be considered by the scheme designer.",
        "We will not consider here the question of how informative schemes should be; we only note the importance of this question for the resulting scoring mechanism.",
        "The penultimate question, also a source of disagreement among existing schemes, is which words among all those involved in the construction should be used to represent it in the scheme.",
        "This decision may arise when identifying syntactic heads; for example, in the sentence Brown said house prices will continue to fall, we assume there is no disagreement about which words are involved in the clausal complement construction {{said, house, prices, will, continue, to, fall}), but there may be disagreement about which subset to use to represent the construction in the grammatical relations.",
        "Here, either will or continue could be used to represent the complement of said.",
        "This decision may also be theory-dependent to some degree, for example whether to use the determiner or the noun as the head of a noun phrase.",
        "The final decision to make is the choice of relations and their arguments.",
        "This can also be thought of as the choice of how the set of representative words should be grouped into relations.",
        "For example, in a relative clause construction, the scheme designer must decide whether the relation between the relative pronoun and the head noun is important, or the relation between the relative pronoun and the verb, between the head noun and the verb, or some subset of these.",
        "The choice of label for each relation will be a natural part of this decision.",
        "An important property of the representation, closely related to the choices made about representative words and how they are grouped into relations, is the number of relations used for a particular construction.",
        "We refer to this as the compactness property.",
        "Compactness essentially boils down to the valency of each relation and the information encoded in the label(s) used for the relation.",
        "We show that this property is closely related to the assigning of partial credit – awarding points even when a construction is not recovered completely correctly – and that it can have a significant effect on the resulting scoring mechanism.",
        "The dividing lines between the various questions we have described are subtle, and in particular the last two questions (which words should represent the construction and which relations to use, and consequently how compactly the relations are represented) have significant overlap with one another.",
        "For example, if the auxiliary are in the passive construction prices are affected is chosen as one of the representative words, then a relation type which relates are to either prices or affected must also be chosen.",
        "For the relative clause construction woman who likes apples and pears, if the words and relations chosen include a representation along the lines of relative-clause-subject(likes, woman) and subject(likes, who), then it is unlikely that the more compact relation relative-clause(likes, woman, who) would also be chosen.",
        "Despite the overlap, each question can provide a useful perspective for the designer of an evaluation scheme.",
        "Decisions must be made not only about the representations of the individual constructions, but also about the interfaces between constructions.",
        "For example, in the sentence Mary likes apples and pears, the coordination structure apples and pears serves as direct object of likes, and it must be determined which word(s) are used to represent the coordination in the direct object relation.",
        "We will illustrate some of the consequences of the decisions described here with detailed examples of three construction types.",
        "We focus on passive, coordination, and relative clause constructions, as analysed in the parc (King et al., 2003), gr (Briscoe and Carroll, 2006), and Stanford (de Marneffe et al., 2006) evaluation schemes, using sentences from the shared task of the coling 2008 parser evaluation workshop.",
        "These three constructions were chosen because we believe they provide particularly good illustrations of the various decisions and their consequences for scoring.",
        "Furthermore, they are constructions whose representation differs across at least two of the three grammatical relation schemes under dicsussion, which makes them more interesting as examples.",
        "We believe that the principles involved, however, apply to any linguistic construction.",
        "We also wish to point out that at this stage we are not recommending any particular scheme or any answers to the questions we raise, but only suggesting ways to clarify the decision points.",
        "Nor do we intend to imply that the ideal representation of any linguistic construction, for any particular purpose, is one of the representations in an existing scheme; we merely use the existing schemes as concrete and familiar illustrations of the issues involved."

        "Stanford, for example, uses the label auxpass for the relation between made and are, indicating that it is part of the passive construction.",

        "We consider it uncontroversial to include a relation between things and made, which will be some kind of subject relation.",

        "Observe also that partial credit is assigned differently in the three schemes.",
        "If the parser recognises the subject of made but misses the fact that the construction is a passive, for example, it will earn one out of two possible points in parc, one out of three in gr (if it recognizes the auxiliary), but zero out of two in Stanford.",
        "This type of error may seem unlikely, yet examples are readily available.",

        "Acanthamoeba profilin was cross-linked to actin via a zero-length isopeptide bond using carbodiimide.",
        "The parser correctly identifies profilin as the subject of cross-linked, yet because it misidentifies cross-linked as an adjectival rather than verbal predicate, it misses the passive construction.",
        "Finally, note an asymmetry in the partial credit scoring: a parser that misidentifies the subject (e.g. by selecting the wrong head), but basically gets the construction correct, will receive partial credit in all three schemes; misidentifying the verb, however (again, this would likely occur by selecting the wrong head within the verb phrase) will cause the parser to lose all points for the construction."
