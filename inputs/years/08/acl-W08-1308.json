        "The aim of the work reported in this paper is to evaluate the extent to which proposed systems of grammatical relations (GRs) reflect the kinds of deep linguistic knowledge required for semantic interpretation, in particular for deriving semantic representations suitable for domain reasoning in dialogue systems.",
        "Grammatical relations either produced by or extracted from the output of wide-coverage syntactic parsers are currently used as input to shallow semantic parsers, which identify semantic relations that exist between predicators (typically verbs) and their dependents (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Erk and Pado, 2006).",
        "Predicate-argument structure identified in this way can then be used in tasks like information extraction (Surdeanu et al., 2003) and question answering (Kaisser and Webber, 2007).",
        "© 2008.",
        "Some rights reserved.",
        "However, wide-coverage stochastic parsers are only rarely used in dialogue systems.",
        "Traditionally, interpretation modules of dialogue systems utilise specialised parsers and semantic interpreters handcrafted to a small domain (Seneff, 1992; Chang et al., 2002), or wide coverage deep parsers (Allen et al., 2007; Jordan et al., 2006; Wolska and Kruijff-Korbayova, 2003; Callaway et al., 2007; Kay et al., 1994).",
        "Unlike in information retrieval and question answering tasks, the system often needs to be connected to a knowledge base which represents the state of the world, and must be able to convert user utterances into knowledge base queries.",
        "In addition to identifying predicate-argument relationships, such systems need to support a variety of tasks, for example resolution of pronouns and anaphors, and interpreting negation, quantification, tense and modality.",
        "While deep parsers produce precise semantic representations appropriate for such reasoning, they suffer from robustness problems.",
        "Wide-coverage dependency parsers could potentially provide a more robust alternative, provided that their output is easy to convert into semantic representations for reasoning.",
        "Section 2 introduces the kind of deep linguistic processing application which motivates our approach to grammatical relations.",
        "Section 3 defines some underlying principles behind the kind of 'deep' GR system we have in mind.",
        "The remainder of the paper discusses a number of linguistic phenomena in detail, and evaluates how well various systems of GR representation from the dependency parsing literature capture the kind of linguistic insights required for interface with reasoning – passive (section 4), raising and control (section 5), noun modification (section 6) and syntactic versus semantic prepositions (section 7)."

      "heading": "2. Motivation",
      "text": [
        "As an example application that requires deep parsing consider a tutorial dialogue system that interprets students' answers to factual questions (e.g.",
        "Which bulbs will be lit in this circuit?)",
        "as well as explanation questions (e.g.",
        "Explain your reasoning!).",
        "It has been argued previously (Wolska and Kruijff-Korbayovâ, 2004; Rosé et al., 2003) that tutorial dialogue systems require deep understanding of student explanations, which can have significantly more complex structure than database queries in the information-seeking domain.",
        "In our application, if a student is asked for an explanation, his or her input has to be passed through the domain knowledge base to verify its factual correctness, and a separate process verifies that all relations mentioned in the explanation are correct and relevant.",
        "For example, imagine that the student says the following:",
        "(1) The bulbs in circuits 1 and 3 will be lit because they are in closed paths with the batteries.",
        "Here, the system has to verify two things: (a) that the facts are correct (bulbs in circuits 1 and 3 will be lit, and each of those bulbs is in a closed path with a battery); and (b) that the reason is valid – being in a closed path with a battery is a necessary and sufficient condition for a bulb to be lit.",
        "This task is particularly interesting because it combines characteristics of deep and shallow interpretation tasks.",
        "On the one hand, the fact-checking mechanism requires a connection to the database.",
        "Thus, both pronouns and definite noun phrases need to be resolved to the objects they represent in the knowledge base, and first-order logic formulas representing utterance content need to be checked against the system knowledge.",
        "This task is similar to natural language interfaces to databases, or knowledge acquisition interfaces that convert language into knowledge base statements (Yeh et al., 2005).",
        "On the other hand, with respect to reason checking, human tutors have indicated that they would accept an answer simply if a student produces the key concepts and relations between them, even if the answer is not strictly logically equivalent to the ideal answer (Dzikovska et al., 2008).",
        "Human tutors tend to be especially lenient if a student is asked a generic question, like What is the definition of voltage?, which does not refer to specific objects in the knowledge base.",
        "Thus, a simpler matching mechanism is used to check the reasons, making this task more similar to an information retrieval task requiring shallower processing, i.e. that the predicate-argument relations are retrieved correctly (though negation still remains important).",
        "Thus, while a specific task is used to motivate our evaluation, the conclusions would be applicable to a variety of systems, including both deep and shallow semantic interpreters.",
        "For the purposes of this evaluation, we discuss features of grammatical representation relevant to two subtasks critical for the system: (a) identifying predicate-argument structure; and (b) resolving anaphora.",
        "The extraction of predicate-argument relations is a common requirement for both shallow and deep semantic tasks.",
        "For example, for the student input in example (1) we may expect something like:",
        "Resolving anaphora, on the other hand, is particularly important for the kind of deep semantic processing used in dialogue systems.",
        "Implicit in the above representation is the fact that the definite noun phrase the bulbs in circuits 1 and 3 was resolved to domain constants bland b3, and indefinite references to paths were replaced by Skolem constants P 3 and P 4.",
        "The reference resolution process requires detailed knowledge of noun phrase structure, including information about restrictive modification, and this is the second focus of our evaluation.",
        "Ideally, we would like a dependency parser to produce grammatical relations that can be converted into such semantic representations with minimal effort, thus minimising the number of specific rules used to convert individual relations.",
        "We discuss the principles underlying such representations in more detail in the next section."

        "We formulated four principles for deep grammatical relations representation.",
        "Firstly, grammatical relations should, whenever possible, reflect relations between the predicators (i.e. content words as opposed to function words) in a sentence.",
        "In addition, the same relation should correspond to the same role assignment.",
        "For example, the deep GRs in passive constructions should be the same as those in the active equivalents (see section 4), and the analysis of a control verb construction like John persuaded Mary to dance should make it clear that there is a 'subject' GR from dance to Mary similar to that in the implied sentence Mary danced (see section 5).",
        "Secondly, a GR should, whenever possible, appear only if there is a an explicit selectional restriction link between the words.",
        "For example, in a raising verb construction like John expects Mary to dance, there should be no GR from the raising verb expects to its object Mary (see section 5).",
        "Also, where a preposition functions strictly as a syntactic role marker, as in the construction John relies on Mary, it should have no place in the GR analysis; rather there should be a direct link from the verb to the embedded noun phrase (see section 7).",
        "Thirdly, the GRs should preserve evidence of syntactic modification to enable reference resolution.",
        "To understand why this is important, take the following two examples:",
        "(3) The lit bulb is in a closed path.",
        "The bulb in a closed path is lit.",
        "From a pure predicate-argument structure perspective, these two sentences share exactly the same deep GRs:",
        "ext(in-closed-path,bulb)",
        "However, from the perspective of reference resolution, the two sentences are very different.",
        "For the first example, this process involves first finding the lit bulb and then verifying that it is in a closed path, whereas for the second we need to find the bulb in a closed path and verify that it is lit.",
        "This difference can be captured by assigning the following additional deep GRs to the first example:",
        "And the following GRs are added to the analysis of the second example:",
        "ncmod(bulb,in-closed-path)",
        "Now the two analyses are formally distinct: (a) the first is rooted at predicate in a closed path and the second at lit; and (b) the definite external argument the bulb takes scope over the modifier lit in the first but over in a closed path in the second.",
        "Noun modification is discussed in section 6.",
        "Finally, the set of grammatical relations should make it easy to identify and separate out constructions which are largely dependent on semantic/world knowledge, such as N-N modification, so that separate models and evaluations can be conducted as necessary."

        "The administration doesn't seem moved by the arguments; (c) nominal postmodifier e.g. the genes involved in T-cell growth; and (d) nominal premodifier e.g. the proposed rules.",
        "In all these cases, our system for deep grammatical relation annotation requires: (a) that there is a relation from the passive participle to the deep object; and (b) that this relation be the same as in the corresponding active declarative construction, so that predicate-argument structure can be straightforwardly derived.",
        "Thus, for example, the analysis of Tax induction is activated by the RelA subunit will contain the GR dob j (activated, induction), and that of the proposed rules will include dobj (proposed, rules), where dob j is the relation between a transitive verb and its (deep) direct object.",

        "I assume the following notational convenience for those categories which contain specify more than one argument – the emphasised argument is surrounded by square brackets.",
        "Thus, subject and object of a strict transitive verb are denoted S\\ [NP ] /NP and S\\NP/ [NP] respectively.",
        "With respect to Table 1, note that: (a) in the CCGbank dependency representation, although prenominal passive participles are linked to their deep object (i.e. the modified noun), this relation is just one of generic noun premodification (i.e. N/N) and is thus irrelevant to the kind of predicate-argument relation we are interested in; (b) in the PARC and Stanford dependency representations, there is no GR from noun-modifying passive participles to their deep objects, just generic modification relations in the opposite direction; and (c) in PARC, passive participles are themselves marked as being passive, thus allowing a subsequent interpretation module to normalise the deep grammatical relations if desired.",
        "If we are interested in a system of deep grammatical role annotation which allows for the representation of normalised GRs for passive participles in all their uses, then the HPSG Treebank format is more appropriate than the other schemes, since it uniformly uses deep GRs for both active and passive verb constructions.",
        "The RASP representation comes a close second, only requiring a small amount of postprocessing to convert ncsub j : obj relations into dob j ones.",

        "We have proposed a set of principles for developing a grammatical relation annotation system for use with both shallow and deep semantic interpretation systems, in particular a tutorial dialogue system.",
        "We then evaluated five different GR schemes from the dependency parsing literature based on how well they handle a number of 'deep' syntactic phenomena implied by these principles, i.e. passive, control and raising, noun modification, and meaningful vs. non-meaningful prepositions.",
        "We conclude that none of the proposed GR annotation schemes contains everything we require for deep semantic processing, although each of the features/distinctions we included in our list of desiderata is provided by at least one system.",
        "Many of the deep syntactic phenomena discussed here are known issues for shallow semantic tasks like semantic role labelling.",
        "For example, passive constructions are a recognised source of noise in semantic role labelling systems (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), and resolving controlled subjects provides more data for training models of selectional restrictions, which are known to be useful features for role labelling.",
        "More generally, Chen and Rambow (2003) demonstrate that a focus on 'deep' syntactic features results in a more accurate stochastic semantic role labeller than using surface information alone.",
        "Note also that the deep grammatical role representation proposed here is meant to be 'theory-neutral', in the sense that it was not influenced by any one of the competing grammar formalisms to the exclusion of the others.",
        "Indeed, it should be a straightforward task to write a grammar using either the HPSG, LFG, CCG or RASP-style underlying formalism which can produce an output representation consisting of deep relations, constructed in a purely compositional manner.",
        "Indeed, the syntactic phenomena discussed in this paper are those which form the basis of numerous introductory textbooks on English generative syntax (Haegeman, 1994; Sag and Wasow, 1999; Bres-nan, 2000).",
        "In addition, the phenomena which form the basis of the analysis in this paper were among those which had been the focus of a significant amount of attention in the development of the semantic interpretation system underlying our domain-independent tutorial dialogue system.",
        "Other issues which were considered, but for which we lack space to discuss in detail include: (a) expletive pronouns should be ignored, i.e. the subject pronouns in 'impersonal' verb constructions like It is raining or It's great that John loves Mary should not be seen as the target of deep grammatical relations; (b) unbounded dependencies should be resolved, i.e. in the relative clause the woman Bill thinks John loves there should be an object relation between the embedded verb loves and its extracted object woman; (c) restrictive and non-restrictive modification (including apposition) should be distinguished, since the latter is not relevant for reference resolution; and (d) certain subsentential conjunctions need to be compiled out (for examples like electronic, computer and building products).",
        "Finally, we recognise that, in many cases, it is possible to transform parser representations into our desired format.",
        "For example, if the parser output tells us that a given verb form is a passive participle, we can use this information to remap the surface relations, thus retrieving the underlying predicate-argument structure.",
        "However, we prefer a system where this kind of post-processing is not needed.",
        "Reasons for this include the increased potential for error in a system relying on post-processing rules, as well as the need to have both detailed documentation for how each parser output format handles particular constructions, as well as a comprehensive mapping schema between representations.",
        "Having a community standard for GR-based parser output is an essential element of future parsing technology, and to be practically useful in a range of semantic interpretation tasks, this standard should involve 'deep' syntactic distinctions of the kind discussed in this paper."
