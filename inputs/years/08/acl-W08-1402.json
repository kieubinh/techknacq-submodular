        "The problem of matching pairs of names which may have different spellings or segmentation arises in a variety of common settings, including integration or linking database records, mapping from text to structured data (e.g., phonebooks, gazetteers, and biological databases), and text to text comparison (for information retrieval, clustering, summarization, coreference, etc.).",
        "For named entity recognition, a name from a gazetteer or dictionary may be matched against text input; even within monolingual applications, the forms of these names might differ.",
        "In multi-document summarization, a name may have different forms across different sources.",

        "that address this problem must be able to handle variant spellings, as well as abbreviations, missing or additional name parts, and different orderings of name parts.",
        "In multilingual settings, where the names being compared can occur in different scripts in different languages, the problem becomes relevant to additional practical applications, including both multilingual information retrieval and machine translation.",
        "Here special challenges are posed by the fact that there usually aren't one-to-one correspondences between sounds across languages.",
        "Thus the name Stewart, pronounced / s t u w 9 r t / in IPA, can be mapped to Mandarin \" Df H0jjs#\", which is",
        "Pinyin \"si tu er te\", pronounced /s i th u a 4 th e/, and the name Elizabeth / I l I z 9 b e 9/ can map to \"ff\"fra$£fi\", which is Pinyin \"yi li sha bai\", pronounced /I l I § a p aI/.",
        "Further, in a given writing system, there may not be a one-to-one correspondence between orthography and sound, a well-known case in point being English.",
        "In addition, there may be a variety of variant forms, including dialectical variants, (e.g., Bourguiba can map to Abu Ruqayba), orthographic conventions (e.g., Anglophone Wasim can map to Francophone Ouassime), and differences in name segmentation (Abd Al Rahman can map to Abdurrahman).",
        "Given the high degree of variation and noise in the data, approaches based on machine learning are needed.",
        "The considerable differences in possible spellings of a name also call for approaches which can compare names based on pronunciation.",
        "Recent work has developed pronunciation-based models for name comparison, e.g., (Sproat, Tao and Zhai 2006) (Tao et al.",
        "2006).",
        "This paper explores trainable pronunciation-based models further.",
        "Consider the problem of matching Chinese script names against their English (Pinyin) Romanizations.",
        "Chinese script has nearly 50,000 characters in all, with around 5,000 characters in use by the well-educated.",
        "However, there are only about 1,600 Pinyin syllables when tones are counted, and as few as 400 when they aren't.",
        "This results in multiple Chinese script representations for a given Roman form name and many Chinese characters that map to the same Pinyin forms.",
        "In addition, one can find multiple Roman forms for many names in Chinese script, and multiple Pinyin representations for a Chinese script representation.",
        "In developing a multilingual approach that can match names from any pair of languages, we compare an approach that relies strictly on monolingual knowledge for each language, specifically, grapheme-to-phoneme rules for each language, with a method that relies on cross-lingual rules which in effect map between graphemic and/or phonemic representations for the specific pair of languages.",
        "The monolingual approach requires finding data on the phonemic representations of a name in a given language, which (as we describe in Section 4) may be harder than finding more graphemic representations.",
        "But once the phonemic representation is found for names in a given language, then as one adds more languages to a system, no more work needs to be done in that given language.",
        "In contrast, with the cross-lingual approach, whenever a new language is added, one needs to go over all the existing languages already in the system and compare each of them with the new language to develop cross-lingual rules for each such language pair.",
        "The engineering of such rules requires bilingual expertise, and knowledge of differences between language pairs.",
        "The cross-lingual approach is thus more expensive to develop, especially for applications which require coverage of a large number of languages.",
        "Our paper investigates whether we can address the name-matching problem without requiring such a knowledge-rich approach, by carrying out a comparison of the performance of the two approaches.",

        "For example, characters corresponding to low diphthongs in English are normalized as \"w\", the transliteration for the Arabic 'Vcharacter, while high diphthongs are mapped to \"y\", the transliteration for the Arabic \"l?\"",

        "Certain characters or character sequences in Pinyin are pronounced differently than in English.",
        "We therefore apply certain transforms to the Pinyin; for example, the following substitutions are applied at the start of a Pinyin syllable, which makes it easier for an English speaker to see how to pronounce it and renders the Pinyin more similar to English orthography: \"u:\" (umlaut \"u\") => \"u\", \"zh\" => \"j\", \"c\" => \"ts\", and \"q\" => \"ch\" (so the Pinyin \"Qian\" is more or less pronounced as if it were spelled as \"Chian\", etc.).",
        "The MLEV algorithm uses equivalence classes that allow \"o\" and \"u\" to match, which results in a higher score than the generic score using the LEV method.",
        "Instead of relying on rules that require extensive knowledge of differences between a language pair, the monolingual approach first builds phonemic representations for each name, and then aligns them.",
        "Earlier research by (Kondrak 2000) used dynamic programming to align strings of phonemes, representing the phonemes as vectors of phonological features, which are associated with scores to produce similarity values.",

        "Neither of the two basic approaches described so far use machine learning.",
        "Our machine learning framework is based on learning from alignments produced by either approach.",
        "To view the learning problem as one amenable to a statistical classifier, we need to generate labeled feature vectors so that each feature vector includes an additional class feature that can have the value 'true' or 'false.'",
        "Given a set of such labeled feature vectors as training data, the classifier builds a model which is then used to classify unlabeled feature vectors with the right labels.",
        "A given set of attested name pairs constitutes a set of positive examples.",
        "To create negative pairs, we have found that randomly selecting elements that haven't been paired will create negative examples in which the pairs of elements being compared are so different that they can be trivially separated from the positive examples.",
        "The experiments reported here used the MLEV score as a threshold to select negatives, so that examples below the threshold are excluded.",
        "As the threshold is raised, the negative examples should become harder to discriminate from positives (with the harder problems mirroring some of the \"confusable name\" characteristics of the real-world name-matching problems this technology is aimed at).",
        "Positive examples below the threshold are also eliminated.",
        "Other criteria, including a MALINE score, could be used, but the MLEV scores seemed adequate for these preliminary experiments.",
        "Raising the threshold reduces the number of negative examples.",
        "It is highly desirable to balance the number of positive and negative examples in training, to avoid the learning being ifiers which alter the sound defined by the base letter.",
        "By default, the output contains the alignments together with the overall similarity scores.",
        "The aligned subsequences are delimited by '|' signs.",
        "The '<' sign signifies that the previous phonetic segment has been aligned with two segments in the other sequence, a case of compression/expansion.",
        "The '-' sign denotes a \"skip\", a case of insertion/deletion.\"",
        "biased by a skewed distribution.",
        "However, when one starts with a balanced distribution of positive and negatives, and then excludes a number of negative examples below the threshold, a corresponding number of positive examples must also be removed to preserve the balance.",
        "Thus, raising the threshold reduces the size of the training data.",
        "Machine learning algorithms, however, can benefit from more training data.",
        "Therefore, in the experiments below, thresholds which provided woefully inadequate training set sizes were eliminated.",
        "One can think of both the machine learning method and the basic name comparison methods (MLEV and MALINE) as taking each pair of names with a known label and returning a system-assigned class for that pair.",
        "Precision, Recall, and F-Measure can be defined in an identical manner for both machine learning and basic name comparison methods.",
        "In such a scheme, a threshold on the similarity score is used to determine whether the basic comparison match is a positive match or not.",
        "Learning the best threshold for a dataset can be determined by searching over different values for the threshold.",
        "In short, the methodology employed for this study involves two types of thresholds: the MLEV threshold used to identify negative examples and the threshold that is applied to the basic comparison methods, MLEV and MALINE, to identify matches.",
        "To avoid confusion, the term negative threshold refers to the former, while the term positive threshold is used for the latter.",
        "The basic comparison methods were used as baselines in this research.",
        "To be able to provide a fair basic comparison score at each negative threshold, we \"trained\" each basic comparison matcher at twenty different positive thresholds on the same training set used by the learner.",

        "Boolean value of each feature in the composite feature set.",
        "Our data is a (roughly 470,000 pair) subset of the Chinese-English personal name pairs in LDC 2005T34.",
        "About 150,000 of the pairs had more than 1 way to pronounce the English and/or Chinese.",
        "For these, to keep the size of the experiments manageable from the point of view of training the learners, one pronunciation was randomly chosen as the one to use.",
        "(Even with this restriction, a minimum negative threshold results in over half a million examples).",
        "Chinese characters were mapped into Hanyu Pinyin representations, which are used for MLEV alignment and string comparisons.",
        "Since the input to MALINE uses a phonemic representation that encodes phonemic features in one or more letters, both Pinyin and English forms were mapped into the MALINE notation.",
        "There are a number of slightly varying ways to map Pinyin into an international pronunciation system like IPA.",
        "For example, (Wikipedia 2006) and (Salafra 2006) have mappings that differ from each other and also each of these two sources have changed its mapping over time.",
        "We used a version of Salafra from 2006 (but we ignored the ejectives).",
        "For English, the CMU pronouncing dictionary (CMU 2008) provided phonemic representations that were then mapped into the MALINE notation.",
        "The dictionary had entries for 12% of our data set.",
        "For the names not in the CMU dictionary, a simple grapheme to phoneme script provided an approximate phonemic form.",
        "We did not use a monolingual mapping of Chinese characters (Mandarin pronunciation) into IPA because we did not find any.",
        "Note that we could insist that all pairs in our dataset be distinct, requiring that there be exactly one match for each Roman name and exactly one match for each Pinyin name.",
        "This in our view is unrealistic, since large corpora will be skewed towards names which tend to occur frequently (e.g., international figures in news) and occur with multiple translations.",

        "Our approach, by contrast, takes pairs of strings along with an alignment, and using features derived from the alignments, trains a learner to derive the best match given the features.",
        "This offers the advantage of modularity, in that any type of alignment model can be combined with SVMs or other classifiers (we have preferred SVMs since they offer discriminative training).",
        "Our approach allows leveraging of any existing alignments, which can lead to starting the learning from a higher baseline and less training data to get to the same level of performance.",
        "Since the learner itself doesn't compute the alignments, the disadvantage of our approach is the need to engineer features that communicate important aspects of the alignment to the learner.",
