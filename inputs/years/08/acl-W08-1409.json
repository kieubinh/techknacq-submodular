        "Language description, i.e., producing a phonological description, grammatical description, wordlist, dictionary, text collection or the like, of these 7 000 languages has been ongoing on a larger scale since about 200 years.",
        "This process is fully decentralized, and at present there is no database over which languages of the world have been described, which have not, and which have partial descriptions already produced (Hammarstrom, 2007b).",

        "Input: A bibliographical reference to a work with descriptive language data of (at least one of) the language in the database",
        "Desired output: The identification of which language^) is described in the bibliographical reference",
        "We would like to achieve this with as little human labour as possible.",
        "In particular, this means that thresholds that are to be set by humans are to be avoided.",
        "However, we will allow (and do make use of - see below) supervision in the form of databases of language references annotated with target language as long as they are freely available.",
        "As an example, say that we are given a bibliographical reference to a descriptive work as follows:",
        "Dammann, Ernst 1957 Studien zum Kwangali: Grammatik, Texte, Glossar, Hamburg: Cram, de Gruyter & Co. [Abhandlungen aus dem Gebiet der Auslandskunde / Reihe B, Völkerkunde, Kulturgeschichte und Sprachen 35]",

        "Unfortunately, the problem is not simply that of a clean database lookup.",
        "As shall be seen, the distributional characteristics of the world language database and input data give rise to a special case of a more general Information Extraction (IE) problem.",
        "To be more precise, an abstract IE problem may be defined as follows:",
        "• There is a set of natural language objects O",
        "• There is a fixed set of categories C",

        "• Each object in O contains a small amount of text, on the order of 100 words",
        "• The language of objects in O varies across objects, i.e., not all objects are written in the same language",
        "• \\C(o) \\ is small for most objects o G O, i.e., most objects belong to very few categories (typically exactly one category)",
        "• Most objects o G O contain a few tokens that near-uniquely identifies C(o), i.e., there are some words that are very informative as to category, while the majority of tokens are very little informative.",
        "(This characteristic excludes the logical possibility that each token is fairly informative, and that the tokens together, on an equal footing, serve to pinpoint category.)",

        "The exact nature of the data at hand is felt to be quite important for design choices in our proposed algorithm, and is assumed to be unfamiliar to most readers, wherefore we go through it in some detail here.",
        "The Ethnologue (Gordon, 2005) is a database that aims to catalogue all the known living languages of the world.",
        "As far as language inventory goes, the database is near perfect and language/dialect divisions are generally accurate, though this issue is thornier (Hammarstrom, 2005).",
        "Each language is given a unique three-letter identifier, a canonical name and a set of variant and/or dialect names.",
        "The three-letter codes are draft ISO-639-3 standard.",

        "There are 39 419 unique name strings (but 42 768 name tokens in the database!).",
        "Thus the average number of different languages (= unique id:s) a name denotes is 1.08, the median is 1 and the maximum is 14 (for Miao).",

        "In the preparation of the test set (see Section 2.4) an attempt to estimate this was made, yielding the following results.",

        "66 (63.5%) existed in the database allowing for variation in spelling (cf.",
        "Section 1).",
        "A more interesting test, which could not be carried out for practical reasons, would be to look at a language and gather all publications relating to that language, and collect the names occurring in titles of these.",
        "(To collect the full range of names denoting languages used in the bodies of such publications is probably not a well-defined task.)",
        "The Ethnologue itself does not systematically contain bibliographical references, so it is not possible to deduce from where/how the database of alternative names was constructed.",
        "• A rough indication of the ratio between spelling variants versus alternative roots among alternative names is as follows.",
        "For each of the 7299 sets of alternative names, we conflate the names which have an edit distance of < i for i = 0,..., 4.",
        "The mean, median and max number of names after conflating is shown below.",

        "Descriptive data on the languages of the world are found in books, PhD/MA theses, journal articles, conference articles, articles in collections and manuscripts.",
        "If only a small number of languages is covered in one publication, the title usually carries sufficient information for an experienced human to deduce which language(s) is covered.",
        "On the other hand, if a larger number of languages is targeted, the title usually only contains approximate information as to the covered languages, e.g., Talen en dialecten van Nederlands Nieuw-Guinea or West African Language Data Sheets.",

        "Section 2.4).",
