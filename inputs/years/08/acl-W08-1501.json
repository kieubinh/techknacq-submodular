        "Statistical machine translation (SMT) methods are well established in speech-to-speech translation systems as the main translation technique (Narayanan et al., 2003; Hsiao et al., 2006).",
        "Due to their flexibility these methods provide a good coverage of the dialog domain.",
        "The fluency of the translation, however, is not guaranteed.",
        "Dis-fluencies of spoken utterances plus the speech recognizer errors degrade the translation quality even more.",
        "All these ultimately affect the quality of the synthesized speech output in the target language, and the effectiveness of the concept transfer.",
        "It is quite common, though, to use other means of translation in parallel to the SMT methods (Gao et al., 2006; Stallard et al., 2006).",
        "Concept classification, as an alternative translation method, has been successfully integrated in speech-to-speech translators (Narayanan et al., 2003; Ehsani et al., 2006).",
        "A well defined dialog domain, e.g. doctor-patient dialog, can be partly covered by a number of concept classes.",
        "Upon a successful classification of the input utterance, the translation task reduces to",
        "Â© 2008.",
        "Some rights reserved.",
        "synthesizing a previously created translation of the concept, as a mere look up.",
        "Since the main goal in such applications is an accurate exchange of concepts, this method would serve the purpose as long as the input utterance falls within the coverage of the classifier.",
        "This process can be viewed as a quantization of a continuous \"semantic\" sub-space.",
        "The classifier is adequate when the quantization error is small (i.e. the derived concept and input utterance are good matches), and when the utterance falls in the same subspace (domain) as the quantizer attempts to cover.",
        "Since it is not feasible to accurately cover the whole dialog domain (since a large number of quantization levels needed) the classifier should be accompanied by a translation system with a much wider range such as an SMT engine.",
        "A rejection mechanism can help identify the cases that the input utterance falls outside the classifier coverage (Ettelaie et al., 2006).",
        "In spite of this short coming, the classifier-based translator is an attractive option for speech-to-speech applications because of its tolerance to \"noisy\" input and the fluency of its output, when it operates close to its design parameters.",
        "In practice this is attainable for structured dialog interactions with high levels of predictability.",
        "In addition, it can provide the users with both an accurate feedback and different translation options to choose from.",
        "The latter feature, specially, is useful for applications like doctor-patient dialog.",
        "Building a concept classifier starts with identifying the desired concepts and representing them with canonical utterances that express these concepts.",
        "A good set of concepts should consist of the ones that are more frequent in a typical interaction in the domain.",
        "For instance in a doctor-patient dialog, the utterance \"Where does it hurt?\"",
        "is quite common and therefore its concept is a good choice.",
        "Phrase books, websites, and experts' judgment are some of the resources that can be used for concept selection.",
        "Other frequently used concepts include those that correspond to basic communicative and social aspects of the interaction such as greeting, acknowledgment and confirmation.",
        "After forming the concept space, for each class, utterances that convey its concept must be gathered.",
        "Hence, this training corpus would consist of a group of paraphrases for each class.",
        "This form of data are often very difficult to collect as the number of classes grow.",
        "Therefore, the available training data are usually sparse and cannot produce a classification accuracy to the degree possible.",
        "Since the classifier range is limited, high accuracy within that range is quite crucial for its effectiveness.",
        "One of the main issues is dealing with data sparsity.",
        "Other techniques have also been proposed to improve the classification rates.",
        "For example in (Ettelaie et al., 2006) the accuracy has been improved by introducing a dialog model.",
        "Also, a background model has been used to improve the discrimination ability of a given concept class model.",
        "In this work a novel method for handling the sparsity is introduced.",
        "This method utilizes an SMT engine to map a single utterance to a group of them.",
        "Furthermore, the effect of the background model on classification accuracy is investigated.",
        "Section 2 reviews the concept classification process and the background model.",
        "In Section 3 the sparsity handling method using an SMT is introduced.",
