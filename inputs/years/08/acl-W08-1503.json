        "To avoid the problems that result from using humans to evaluate spoken dialog systems, developers have widely used dialog simulation, in which a simulated user interacts with a spoken dialog system.",
        "Many techniques for user intention, utterance and error simulation have been proposed.",
        "However, previously proposed simulation techniques cannot be easily applied to evaluate various dialog systems, because some of these techniques are specially designed to work with their own dialog systems, some require heuristic rules or flowcharts, and others try to build user side dialog management systems using specialized dialog managing methods.",
        "These problems motivated us to develop dialog simulation techniques which allow developers to build dialog simulation systems rapidly for use in evaluating various dialog systems.",
        "To be successful, a simulation approach should not depend on specific domains or rules.",
        "Also it should not be coupled to a specific dialog management method.",
        "Furthermore, successful dialog simulation should fully support both user simulation and environment simulation.",
        "In user simulation, it must be capable of simulating both user intentions and user utterances, because user utterances are essential for testing the language understanding component of the dialog system.",
        "In addition to user simulation, environment simulation such as ASR channel simulation is desirable because it allows developers to test the dialog system in various acoustic environments.",
        "In this paper, we propose novel dialog simulation techniques which satisfy these requirements.",
        "We introduce a new user intention simulation method based on the sequential graphical model, and a user utterance simulator which can generate diverse natural user utterances.",
        "The user intention and utterance simulators are both fully data-driven approaches; therefore they have high domain-and language portability.",
        "We also propose a novel Automatic Speech Recognizer (ASR) channel simulator which allows the developers to set the desired speech recognition performance level.",

        "Dialog simulation techniques can be classified according to the purpose of the simulation.",
        "One of the purposes is to support the refinement of dialog strategies.",
        "Some techniques use large amounts of simulated data for a systematic exploration of the dialog state space in the framework of reinforcement learning (Schatzmann et al., 2005; Schatzmann et al., 2007a).",
        "Other techniques use simulation techniques to investigate and improve the target dialog strategies by examining the results heuristically or automatically (Chung, 2004; Rieser and Lemon, 2006; Torres et al., 2008).",
        "A second purpose of dialog simulation techniques is to evaluate the dialog system itself qualitatively.",
        "Eckert et al., (1997) andLopez-Cozaret., (2003; 2006) used a dialog simulation to evaluate whole dialog systems.",
        "Dialog simulation techniques can also be classified according to the layers of the simulation.",
        "Typically, dialog simulation can be divided into three layers: user intention, user surface (utterance) and error simulation.",
        "Some studies have focused only on the intention level simulation (Rieser and Lemon, 2006; Schatzmann et al., 2007b; Cuayahuitl et al., 2005).",
        "The main purpose of those approaches was to collect and examine intention level dialog behavior for automatically learning dialog strategies.",
        "In this case, surface and error simulations were neglected or simply accessed normally.",
        "Another approach is to simulate both user intention and surface.",
        "In this approach, user utterance generation is designed to express a given intention.",
        "Chung (2004) tried to use the natural language generation module of (Seneff, 2002) to generate this surface.",
        "He used a speech synthesizer to generate user utterances.",
        "Lopez-Cozar et., (2003; 2006) collected real human utterances, and selected and played the voice to provide input for the spoken dialog system.",
        "Both Chung (2004) and Lopez-Cozar et., (2003; 2006) used rule based intention simulation.",
        "They used real ASR to recognize the synthesized or played voice; hence, ASR channel simulation is not needed in their techniques.",
        "Scheffler and Young (2000; 2001) used the lattices which are derived from the grammars used by the recognition engine, but generated user utterances by associating the lattice edges with intentions.",
        "During utterance generation, they simulated errors in recognition and understanding by probabilistic substitution on the selection of the edge.",
        "Schatzmann et al., (2007a; 2007b) proposed a statistical model for user utterance generation and error simulation using agenda based intention simulation.",
        "The existing rule-based techniques for simulating intentions or surfaces are not appropriate in the sense of portability criteria.",
        "In addition, specific dialog managing techniques based user simulators (e.g., (Torres et al., 2008)) are not desirable because it is not easy to implement these techniques for other developers.",
        "Another important criterion for evaluating dialog simulation techniques for use in evaluating spoken dialog systems is the range of simulation layers.",
        "Simulations that are restricted to only the intention level are not sufficient to evaluate the whole dialog system.",
        "Domain and language independent techniques for simulating both intentions and utterances are needed, and ASR channel simulation is desirable for evaluating the spoken dialog systems accurately because human-machine dialog is heavily influenced by speech recognition errors."

        "However, both approaches have limitations.",
        "When recording and playing real human voices, the cost of data collection is high and the simulator can simulate only the behavior of the humans who were recorded.",

        "Sophisticated user intention modeling should be able to reflect the discourse information.",
        "To satisfy the sequential property and use rich information for user intention modeling, we used linear-chain Conditional Random Field (CRF) model (Lafferty et al., 2001) for user intention modeling.",
