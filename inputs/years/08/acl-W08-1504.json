        "The end of the 20th century witnesses an explosive growth in Internet usage.",
        "We have seen an explosion in the number of browser-based visual applications, from the broad examples we use every day, such as e-commerce, movie or flight schedules, and financial information.",
        "The most common means for accessing information residing on many websites across the globe is still the dominating interface of point and click with a mouse using the graphical user interface (GUI).",
        "Additionally, telephone is also widely used to access information.",
        "Still, in densely populated countries it seems to be difficult to handle large amounts of calls simultaneously, which leads to long call queues and frustrated customers.",
        "However, the challenge that is presented to the present Internet world is to make the enormous web content",
        "2008.",
        "Some rights reserved.",
        "accessible to users who don't have the computers or maybe don't have the money to buy as well as visually impaired users.",
        "Since speech is the most natural means of communication, especially for these users, voice will be a dominating mode in newly designed multi-modal (Oviatt, S.L., 1999) user interfaces for future devices.",
        "This calls for a revolutionary design of a voice user interface (VUI) to supplement the conventional GUIs.",
        "Internet and telephony used to be two separate technologies to build applications accessible over the phone.",
        "VoiceXML bridges the gap; it leverages the existing web infrastructure and enables web developers to build voice-enabled web applications accessible from any telephone, by anyone, anywhere, anytime.",
        "A major advantage of VoiceXML is that it provides web content over a simple telephone device, making it possible to access an application even without a computer and an Internet connection.",
        "VoiceXML finds ready acceptance in the business world due to the following reasons.",
        "Providing a voice-based interface with the web interface is an advantage to the visually challenged who are unable to use a visual interface.",
        "It is also possible to use the application for accessing a web-based interface even while on the move through a mobile phone, which is much easier to carry around than a personal computer.",
        "Phone applications are more spontaneous.",
        "Most people these days always have their phone on their hip.",
        "In many cases, the phone transaction can be completed before the PC even boots or you can log in.",
        "Lastly, there is no possibility of a virus from a phone call and it is typically much more secure.",
        "The number of telephone users is far greater than the number of people who use personal computers or the Internet.",
        "Thus, by using VoiceXML applications, we can reach out to more customers than is possible by using the Internet.",
        "Voice portals put all kinds of information at a consumer's fingertips anytime, anywhere.",
        "Customers just dial into the voice portal's 800 number and use simple voice commands to access whatever information they need.",

        "Hence, this paper is an attempt to peep behind the curtain and analyze the market trends and thereby proposes a solution to resolve the current issues and satisfy the global customers by providing them a solution to access the VoiceXML gateway economically.",

        "We discuss all the essential elements bellow.",
        "Most of the VoiceXML gateways (Ruiz, Q. Sanchez, M. 2003) can operate VoiceXML speech applications on any standard web server and can support both static and dynamic content, and provide a high degree of scalability and platform-independence.",
        "Also, voice applications can be seamlessly integrated into existing enterprise web and IT infrastructure.",
        "There are two ways to accomplish the task:",
        "-Link your existing web server with VSP's voice gateways.",
        "-Port your web applications to VSP's web server.",
        "Linking an existing web application with VoiceXML gateways is fairly straightforward.",
        "As you see in figure 1, when a VoiceXML gateway receives a phone call, it looks at the number dialed to lookup the URL of the web server, then sends the HTTP request.",
        "You need to provide the URL of your web server to VSP.",
        "One VSP provides Web-based GUI for linking an application as shown in Figure 1.",
        "There may be some changes required to your Web server before you connect with your VSP.",
        "Changes vary from VSP to VSP, or depending on your service provider and type of Web server.",
        "As an example, our application residing on an Apache HTTP Server, according to Bevocal, must modify the httpd.conf file to add the new MIME type in the following way.",
        "# AddType allows you to add to or override the MIME configuration.",
        "# file mime.types for specific file types.",
        "# MIME types for VoiceXML-related content.",

        "Speech-enabled Internet portals, or voice portals, are quickly becoming the hottest trend in e-commerce-broadening access to Internet content to everyone with the most universal communications device of all, the telephone.",
        "Currently, voice hosting providers set up local toll free numbers or DID (direct inward dialing) numbers in order to access voice applications through their VoiceXML gateways.",
        "If the VSP is unable to provide the local DID numbers in the desired country, the users from that country have to pay international calling charges, which is sometimes quite expensive.",
        "We propose our idea to resolve this issue as follows.",
        "SIP Mapping: It totally depends upon the telephony infrastructure of the VoiceXML gateway.",
        "If it is asterisk-based (Meggelen, J. V. Madsen, L. Smith J.",
        "2007) then the job is fairly easy, otherwise it could be a tedious task to configure a VoiceXML gateway with a remote telephony network.",
        "Our proposed idea is independent of any kind of telephony infrastructure, provided it supports SIP signaling.",
        "The most promising way to connect a VoiceXML gateway with a third party's Asterisk server (any IP-PBX) is to use the ENUM service.",
        "In order to use ENUM DNS efficiently, there are few steps needed to be followed.",
        "First of all, at e164.org (Ruiz, Q. Sanchez, M. 2003), in the ENUM database, we need to register the IP address and DID number, which is landing on your SIP extension of VoiceXML Gateway, as depicted in the figure 2.",
        "Moreover, they do not want to accept anonymous SIP calls, and want to run their own IP-PBX instead of using client's IP-PBX.",
        "In that case, we propose a very easy solution to set up the SIP extension on the VoiceXML",
        "After editing the ENUM (tElephone NUmber Mapping) entry, we set up the ENUM trunk and outbound route on the remote IP-PBX machine.",
        "We are running Elastix IP-PBX (elastix.org) on the remote side because it is easy to manage the configuration through GUI on Elastix.",
        "Moreover, it is an open source technology, and comes with a self-installing package that installs a complete operating system, Asterisk PBX, FreePBX etc.",
        "9[XXXXXXXXXXXXX (X matches any digit from 0 to 9)",
        "According to our dial plan shown above, let's assume that we need to dial the American DID number 641-543-6745, and dialing pattern would be like: 916415436745.",
        "Our DID number 641-543-6745 is registered at e164.org.",
        "This means that when someone calls the DID, the call will land on the SIP number instead of DID number, as the e164.org DNS zone will provide the IP addressing and protocol information needed to connect to your VoiceXML gateway .",
        "In other words, the call will not go over the DID provider's network (see figure 3).",
        "There would be a native or Packet2Packet SIP bridging between the VoiceXML gateway and remote IP-PBX.",
        "Ultimately, VSP and remote client will not pay any toll to PSTN operator or ITSP (Internet Telephony Service Provider) because the call bypasses their network.",
        "Moreover, the VSP does not need to open all the credentials of telephony setup of the VoiceXML gateway.",
        "So, most of the information will be isolated from the remote client.",
        "This is attractive to the VSP that does not want to register the sip number and IP address of the gateway in the ENUM (tElephone NUmber Mapping) database, (because some people are afraid to disclose their IP addresses to others).",

        "In this scenario, we can register the machines with each other using username and secret or we can use IP-based authentication without registering with each other.",
        "Actually, it is very easy on Elastix because it uses a Freepbx for configuring most of the tasks of Asterisk server.",
        "In other words, it's becoming less and less common to have static IP addresses.",
        "So, if you have a dynamic IP address it is good to go with username and secret.",

        "DID Mapping: We have two scenarios to deal with: a) When a VoiceXML gateway does not support SIP signaling.",
        "b) When VSP wants to land the calls only on a DID number assigned for your application execution.",
        "First, if it is a toll free DID number then the remote client can dial through ENUM in order to connect with a toll free gateway, and call will land on the toll free network, which is connected with a VoiceXML gateway (see figure 5).",

        "We found that ulaw codec is much better for interacting with the ASR engine, and also it provides the best voice quality since it uses no compression.",
        "This means that it has the lowest latency and the highest MOS (Mean Opinion Score) because there are no additional processing delays.",
