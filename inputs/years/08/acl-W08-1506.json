        "During the last few months, we have reorganised the MedSLT translation model in several ways.",
        "In particular, we give a much more central role to the interlingua; we now treat this as a language in its own right, defined by a normal Regulus grammar, and using a syntax which essentially amounts to a greatly simplified form of English.",
        "Making the interlingua into another language has made it easy to enforce tight constraints on well-formedness of interlingual semantic expressions, since checking well-formedness now just amounts to performing generation using the interlingua grammar.",
        "Another major advantage of the scheme is that it is also possible to systematise multilingual development, and only work with translation from source language to interlingua, and from interlingua to target language; here, the important point is that the human-readable interlingua surface syntax makes it feasible in practice to evaluate translation between normal languages and the interlingua.",
        "Development of rules for translation to interlingua is based on appropriate corpora for each source language.",
        "Development of rules for translating from interlingua uses a corpus which is formed by merging together the results of translating each of the individual source-language corpora into interlingua.",
        "We will demonstrate our new capabilities in interlingua-based translation, using a version of the system which translates doctor questions in the headache domain from any language to any language in the set {English, French, Japanese, Arabic}.",
        "Table 1 gives examples of the coverage of the English-input headache-domain version, and Table 2 summarises recognition performance in this domain for the three input languages where we have so far performed serious evaluations.",
        "Differences in the sizes of the recognition vocabularies are primarily due to differences in use of inflection."
