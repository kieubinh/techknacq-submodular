        "Maryland Virtual Patient (MVP) is an agent-oriented environment for automating certain facets of medical training.",

        "This model is implemented in a computer simulation.",
        "The virtual patient is a \"double agent\" that displays both physiological and cognitive function.",
        "Physiologically, it undergoes both normal and pathological processes in response to internal and external stimuli.",
        "Cognitively, it experiences symptoms, has lifestyle preferences, has memory (many of whose details fade with time), and communicates with the human user about its personal history and symptoms.",
        "Other software agents in the MVP environment include consulting physicians, lab technicians and a virtual mentor (tutor).",

        "not trying to recreate the human organism in all its details, we are modeling it to the extent necessary to support its realistic autonomous functioning in applications aimed at training the diagnostic and treatment skills of medical personnel.",
        "Trainees can use MVP to interview a virtual patient; order lab tests; receive the results of lab tests from technician agents; receive interpretations of lab tests from consulting physician agents; posit hypotheses, clinical diagnoses and definitive diagnoses; prescribe treatments; follow-up after those treatments to judge their efficacy; follow a patient's condition over an extended period of time, with the trainee having control over the speed of simulation (i.e., the clock); and, if desired, receive mentoring from the automatic mentor.",
        "The virtual patient (VP) simulation is grounded in an ontologically-defined model of human anatomy and physiology.",
        "Instances of virtual patients with particular diseases and particular physiological peculiarities are generated from core ontological knowledge about human physiology and anatomy by grafting a disease process onto a generic instance of a human.",

        "Our approach to treating dialog is unlike most other approaches in that all language-oriented reasoning is carried out on the basis of formal interpretations of text meaning.",
        "We call these interpretations text meaning representations or TMRs.",
        "Note that TMRs are written using the same ontologically grounded metalanguage as is used to represent interoception.",
        "In short, all knowledge and reasoning in our environment employs the same metalanguage, so whether a patient experiences new symptoms or learns information about its disease from the user, the new information will be stored the same way in the patient's memory.",
        "There are several advantages to orienting an agent's language processing around TMRs rather than text strings.",
        "First, TMRs are unambiguous, since linguistic ambiguity is resolved as the TMRs are being produced.",
        "Second, TMRs reduce to a single representation many types of linguistic paraphrase, be it lexical (esophagus ~ food pipe), syntactic (I will administer it to you ~ It will be administered to you by me) or even semantic (Does the food get stuck when you swallow?",
        "~ Do you have difficulty swallowing?).",
        "Third, TMRs facilitate the detection of which aspects of meaning are central and which are of secondary importance.",
        "For example, the analyzer can determine which portions of input utterances merely convey politeness.",
        "To take an extreme example for illustration, the question \"Do you have difficultly swallowing?\"",
        "could be rendered by an overly polite physician as: \"If you don't mind, I would really appreciate it if you would tell me whether you have any difficulty swallowing.\"",
        "When the VP receives language input, it uses its lexicon, ontology and a reasoning-enabled analyzer to create a TMR corresponding to the input.",
        "Next, it determines the intent of that input - e.g., through the recognition of indirect speech acts.",
        "After that it plans its response then generates its response.",
