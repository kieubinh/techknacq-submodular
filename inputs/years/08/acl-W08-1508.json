        "Recent years have seen increasing research and commercial activity in the area of Spoken Language Translation (SLT) for mission-critical applications.",
        "In the health care area, for instance, such products as Converser (Dillinger & Seligman, 2006), S-MINDS (www.fluentialinc.com), and Med-SLT (Bouillon et al., 2005) are coming into use.",
        "For military applications, products like Phraselator (www.phraselator.com) and S-MINDS (www.fluentialinc.com) have been deployed.",
        "However, the demand for real-time translation is by no means restricted to these areas: it is clear in numerous other areas not yet extensively addressed emergency services, law enforcement, and others.",
        "Ideally, a system produced for one such domain (e.g., health care) could be easily ported to other domains.",
        "However, porting has in practice proven difficult.",
        "This paper will comment on the sources of © 2008.",
        "Some rights reserved.",
        "this difficulty and briefly present an approach to rapid inter-domain portability that we believe is promising.",
        "Three aspects of our approach will be discussed: (1) large general-purpose lexicons for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation (MT), made reliable and usable through interactive facilities for monitoring and correcting errors; (2) easily modifiable facilities for instant translation of frequent phrases; and (3) quickly modifiable custom glossaries.",
        "As preliminary support for our approach, we apply our current SLT system, now optimized for the health care domain, to sample utterances from the military, emergency service, and law enforcement domains.",
        "With respect to the principal source of the porting problems affecting most SLT systems to date: most systems have relied upon statistical approaches for both ASR and MT (Karat and Nahamoo, 2007; Koehn, 2008); so each new domain has required extensive and high-quality in-domain corpora for best results, and the difficulty of obtaining them has limited these systems' portability.",
        "The need for indomain corpora can be eliminated through the use of a quite general corpus (or collection of corpora) for statistical training; but because large corpora give rise to quickly increasing perplexity and error rates, most SLT systems have been designed for specialized domains.",
        "By contrast, breadth of coverage has been a central design goal of our SLT systems.",
        "Before any optimization for a specific domain, we \"give our systems a liberal arts education\" by incorporating very broad-coverage ASR and MT technology.",
        "(We presently employ rule-based rather than statistical MT components, but this choice is not essential.)",
        "For example, our MT lexicons for English<>Spanish translation in the health care area contain roughly 350,000 words in each direction, of which only a small percentage are specifically health care terms.",
        "Our translation grammars (presently licensed from a commercial source, and further developed with our collaboration) are similarly designed to cover the structures of wide-ranging general texts and spoken discourse.",
        "To deal with the errors that inevitably follow as coverage grows, we provide a set of facilities that enable users from both sides of the language barrier to interactively monitor and correct such errors.",
        "We have described these interactive techniques in (Dillinger and Seligman, 2004; Zong and Seligman, 2005; Dillinger and Seligman, 2006; and Seligman and Dillinger, 2006).",
        "With users thus integrated into the speech translation loop, automatically translated spoken conversations can range widely with acceptable accuracy (Seligman, 2000).",
        "Users can move among domains with relative freedom, even in advance of lexical or other domain specialization, because most domains are already covered to some degree.",
        "After a quick summary of our approach (in Section 2), we will demonstrate this flexibility (in Section 3).",
        "While our system's facilities for monitoring and correction of ASR and MT are vital for accuracy and confidence in wide-ranging conversations, they can be time consuming.",
        "Further, interactivity demands a minimum degree of computer and print literacy, which some patients may lack.",
        "To address these issues, we have developed a facility called Translation Shortcuts™, through which prepared translations of frequent or especially useful phrases in the current domain can be instantly executed by searching or browsing.",
        "The facility is described in (Seligman and Dillinger, 2006).",
        "After a quick description of the Translation Shortcuts facility (Section 4), this paper will emphasize the contribution of the Translation Shortcuts facility to domain portability, showing how a domain-specific set of Shortcuts can be composed and integrated into the system very quickly (Section 5).",
        "Finally, while the extensive lexical resources already built into the system provide the most significant boost to domain portability in our system, it will always be desirable to add specialized lexical items or specialized meanings of existing ones.",
        "Section 6 will briefly present our system's glossary import facility, through which lexical items can be added or updated very quickly.",
        "Our concluding remarks appear in Section 7."

        "We now briefly summarize our group's approach to highly interactive, broad-coverage SLT.",
        "Our systems stress interactive monitoring and correction of both ASR and MT.",
        "First, users can monitor and correct the speaker-dependent speech recognition system to ensure that the text which will be passed to the machine translation component is as correct as necessary.",
        "Voice commands (e.g., Scratch That or Correct <incorrect text>) can be used to repair speech recognition errors.",
        "Thus, users of our SLT systems in effect serve to enhance the interface between ASR and MT.",
        "Next, during the MT stage, users can monitor, and if necessary correct, translation errors.",
        "As an initial safeguard against translation errors, we supply a back-translation, or re-translation of the translation.",
        "Using this paraphrase of the initial input, even a monolingual user can make an initial judgment concerning the quality of the preliminary machine translation output.",
        "If errors are seen, the user can modify specific parts of the input and retranslate.",
        "(Other systems, e.g. IBM's MASTOR (Gao et al., 2006), have also employed re-translation.",
        "Our implementations, however, exploit proprietary technologies to ensure that the lexical senses used during back-translation accurately reflect those used in forward translation.",
        "We also allow users to modify part or all of the input before regenerating the translation and back-translation.)",
        "In addition, if uncertainty remains about the correctness of a given word sense, we supply a proprietary set of Meaning Cues™ - synonyms, definitions, examples, pictures, etc.",
        "- which have been drawn from various resources, collated in a database (called SELECT™), and aligned with the respective lexica of the relevant MT systems.",
        "(In the present English<>Spanish version of the system, this database contains some 140,000 entries, corresponding to more than 350,000 lexical entries.",
        "The cues are automatically grouped by meaning, and cue groups are automatically mapped to MT lexica using proprietary techniques - thus in effect retrofitting an MT system with the ability to explain to users the meanings of its pre-existing lexical items.)",
        "With these cues as guides, the user can monitor the current, proposed meaning and if necessary select a different, preferred meaning from among those available.",
        "Automatic updates of translation and back-translation then follow.",
        "(Our current MT vendor has modified its rule-based translation engine to allow specification of a desired sense when translating a word or expression; we provide guidelines for other vendors to do likewise.",
        "Comparable modifications for statistical MT engines will entail the setting of temporary weightings that will bias the selection of word or phrase translations for the current sentence only.)",
        "Future versions of the system will allow personal word-sense preferences thus specified in the current session to be optionally stored for reuse in future sessions, thus enabling a gradual tuning of word-sense preferences to individual needs.",
        "(However, such persistent personal preferences will still be applied sentence by sentence, rather than by permanently modifying lexica or phrase tables.",
        "Further, users will always be able to temporarily override, or permanently reset, their personal preferences.)",
        "Facilities will also be provided for sharing such preferences across a working group.",
        "Given such interactive correction of both ASR and MT, wide-ranging, and even playful, exchanges become possible (Seligman, 2000).",

        "They were pronounced by Seligman using the built-in microphone of a Motion Computing LE1600 tablet PC equipped with a push-to-talk button.",

        "The principal source of the porting problems affecting most SLT systems to date, we have observed, is that, given the general current reliance upon statistical approaches for both ASR and MT, each new domain has required an extensive and difficult-to-obtain new corpus for best results.",
        "One might consider the use of a single very large and quite general corpus (or collection of corpora) for statistical training; but large corpora engender quickly increasing perplexity and error rates, so this very-broad-coverage approach has generally been avoided.",
        "Our approach, however, has been to adopt a broad-coverage design nevertheless, and to compensate for the inevitable increase in ASR and MT errors by furnishing users with interactive tools for monitoring and correcting these mistakes.",
        "(We have to date used rule-based rather than statistical MT components, but comparable interactive facilities could be supplied for the latter as well.",
        "Operational prototypes for English<>Japanese and English<>German suggest that the techniques can also be adapted for languages other than English<>Spanish.)",
        "Because such interactive tools demand some time and attention, we have also put into place easily modifiable facilities for instant translation of frequent phrases (Translation Shortcuts).",
        "And finally, since even systems with very large lexicons will require specialized lexical items or specialized meanings of existing ones, we have implemented a quick glossary import facility, so that lexical items can be added or updated very easily.",
        "Our current SLT system, optimized for health care, is now in use at a medium-sized hospital in New Jersey, with more than twenty machines installed.",
        "For this paper, we have applied the same system, without modifications, to sample utterances from the military, emergency service, and law enforcement domains.",
        "While this exercise has yielded no quantitative results, readers can judge whether it demonstrates that users can convey mission-critical information with acceptable reliability in multiple domains, even in advance of any porting efforts.",
        "Users do pay a price for this flexibility, since time and attention are required for monitoring and correcting to achieve reliable results.",
        "However, when users judge that accuracy is not crucial, or when they are unable to monitor and correct, they can simply accept the first translation attempt as is.",
        "(A bilingual transcript of each conversation, soon to optionally include the back-translation, is always available for later inspection.)",
        "They can also gain considerable time through the use of Translation Shortcuts."
