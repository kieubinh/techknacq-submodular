        "In the development of real-world-applicable language technologies, it is good to find an application with a significant need, and with a complexity that appears to be within the capabilities of current existing technology.",
        "Based on our experience in building speech-to-speech translation, we believe that some important potential uses of the technology do not require a full, complete speech-to-speech translation system; something much more lightweight can be sufficient to aid the end users (Gao et al., 2006).",
        "A particular task of this kind is dealing with emergency call dispatch for police, ambulance, fire and other emergency services (in the US the emergency number is 9-1-1).",
        "A dispatcher must answer a large variety of calls and, due to the multilingual nature of American society, they may receive non-English calls and be unable to service them due to lack of knowledge of the caller language.",

        "As a part of a pilot study into the feasibility of dealing with non-English calls by a monolingual English-speaking dispatcher, we have designed a translation system that will aid the dispatcher in communicating without understanding the caller's language.",
        "The fundamental idea is to use utterance classification of the non-English input.",
        "The non-English is first recognized by a speech recognition system; then the output is classified into a small number of domain-specific classes called Domain Acts (DAs) that can indicate directly to the dispatcher the general intended meaning of the spoken phrase.",
        "Each DA may have a few important parameters to be translated, such as street addresses (Levin et al., 2003; Langley 2003).",
        "The dispatcher can then select from a limited number of canned responses to this through a simple menu system.",
        "We believe the reduction in complexity of such a system compared to a full speech-to-speech translation will be advantageous because it should be much cheaper to construct, easier to port to new languages, and, importantly, sufficient to do the job of processing emergency calls.",
        "In the \"NineOneOne\" project, we have designed an initial prototype system, which we call \"Ayudame\" (Spanish word for \"Help me\").",

        "Our initial interest in this domain was due to contact from the Cape Coral Police Department (CCPD) in Florida.",
        "They were interested in investigating how speech-to-speech translations could be used in emergency 9-1-1 dispatch systems.",
        "Most current emergency dispatching centers use some proprietary human translation service, such as Language Line (Language Line Services).",
        "Although this service provides human translation services for some 180 languages, it is far from ideal.",
        "Once the dispatcher notes that the caller cannot speak/understand English, they must initiate the call to Language Line, including identifying themselves to the Language Line operator, before the call can actually continue.",
        "This delay can be up to a minute, which is not ideal in an emergency situation.",
        "After consulting with CCPD, and collecting a number of example calls, it was clear that full speech-to-speech translation was not necessary and that a limited form of translation through utterance classification (Lavie et al., 2001) might be sufficient to provide a rapid response to non-English calls.",
        "The language for our study is Spanish.",
        "Cape Coral is on the Gulf Coast of Florida and has fewer Spanish speakers than e.g. the Miami area, but still sufficient that a number of calls are made to their emergency service in",
        "Spanish, yet many of their operators are not sufficiently fluent in Spanish to deal with the calls.",
        "There are a number of key pieces of information that a dispatcher tries to collect before passing on the information to the appropriate emergency service.",
        "This includes things like location, type of emergency, urgency, if anyone is hurt, if the situation is dangerous, etc.",
        "In fact many dispaching organizations have existing, well-defined policies on what information they should collect for different types of emergencies."

        "Figure 2 shows an initial design of the web-based interface.",
        "There are sections for a transcript, the current caller utterance, the current dispatcher response choices, and a button to transfer the interaction to a human translator as a fall-back option.",

        "Although initially we expected a substantial issue with recognizing stressed speakers, as one might expect in emergency situations, in the calls we have collected so far, although it is not a negligible issue, it is far less important that we first expected.",

        "The turns that have significant overlap between speakers are omitted from the training and test set.",
        "The acoustic models are trained on 50 Spanish 9-1-1 calls, which amount to 4 hours of speech data.",

        "Each codebook has 32 gaus-sians per state.",
        "The front-end feature extraction uses standard 39 dimensional Mel-scale cepstral coefficients and applies Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) calculated from the training data.",

        "The interpolation weights are determined using the transcriptions of 10 calls (development set).",
        "The test data consists of 15 telephone calls from different speakers, which amounts to a total of 1 hour.",
        "Both development and test set calls consisted of manually segmented and transcribed speaker turns that do not have a significant overlap with other speakers.",
        "The perplexity of the test set according to the language model is 96.7.",
        "The accuracy of the Spanish ASR on the test set is 76.5%.",
        "This is a good result for spontaneous telephone-quality speech by multiple unknown speakers, and compares favourably to the ASR accuracy of other spoken dialog systems.",
        "We had initially planned to investigate novel ASR techniques designed for stressed speech and multiple dialects, but to our surprise these do not seem to be required for this application.",
        "Note that critical information such as addresses will be synthesized back to the caller for confirmation in the full system.",
