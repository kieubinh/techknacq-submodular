        "This could greatly improve safety and quality of care for patients who speak a different language from that of the healthcare provider.",
        "This paper describes the building and testing of a speech translation system, S-MINDS (Speaking Multilingual Interactive Natural Dialog System), built in less than 3 months with Kaiser Permanente Hospital in San Francisco, CA.",
        "The system was able to gain fairly robust results for the domains that it was designed for, and we believe",

      "text": [
        "The number of people in the U.S. who speak a language other than English is large and growing, and Spanish is the most commonly spoken language next to English.",
        "According to the 2000 census, 18% of the U.S. population over age 5 (47 million people) did not speak English at home – a 48% increase from 1990.",
        "In 2000, 8% of the population (21 million) was LEP (Limited English Proficiency), with more than 65% of that population (almost 14 million people) speaking Spanish.",
        "A body of research shows that language barriers impede access to care, compromise quality, and increase the risk of adverse outcomes.",
        "Although trained medical interpreters and bilingual healthcare providers are effective in overcoming such language barriers, the use of semi-fluent healthcare professionals and ad hoc interpreters (such as family members and friends) cause more interpreter errors and lower quality of care (Flores 2005).",
        "When friends and family interpret, they are prone to omit, add, and substitute information.",
        "Often they inject their own opinions and observations, or impose their own values and judgments, rather than interpreting what the patient actually said.",
        "Frequently these ad hoc interpreters have limited English capabilities themselves and are unfamiliar with medical terminology.",
        "Furthermore, many patients are reluctant to disclose private or sensitive information in front of a family member, thus giving the doctor an incomplete picture; this sometimes prevents a correct diagnosis.",
        "For example, a battered woman is unlikely to reveal the true cause of her injuries if her husband is being used as the interpreter.",
        "The California Academy of Family Physicians Foundation conducted practice visits in 2006 and found that, \"Although they realize the use of family members or friends as interpreters is probably not the best means of interpretation, all practice teams use them.\"",
        "(Chen et al. 2007)"

        "Fluential's speech translation system, S-MINDS, has a hybrid architecture (Figure 1) that combines multiple ASR engines and multiple translation engines.",
        "This approach only slightly increases the development cost of new translation applications, but it greatly improves the accuracy and the coverage of the system by leveraging the strengths of both statistical and grammar/rules-based systems.",
        "Furthermore, this hybrid approach enables rapid integration of new speech recognition and translation engines as they become available.",
        "Figure 1.",
        "The hybrid system architecture of S-MINDS combines multiple ASR engines with an interpretation engine and an SMT engine.",
        "Note that this figure describes the interaction in English to-second language direction only.",
        "The 2nd language-to-English direction has only the small ASR engine and the interpretation engine.",
        "S-MINDS has a modular architecture with the components described below.",
        "All of these components already exist, so they will not need to be developed to conduct the research proposed in Phase I.",
        "S-MINDS employs multiple acoustic engines so the best engine can be chosen for each language.",
        "Within each language, two separate language models are active at the same time, telling the ASR engines which words and phrases to recognize.",
        "A smaller, more directed language model with higher accuracy is used to capture important and frequently used concepts.",
        "For less frequently used concepts, a larger language model that generally has broader coverage but somewhat lower accuracy is used.",
        "The combination of these two provides high accuracy for responses that can be anticipated and slightly lower accuracy but broader coverage for everything else.",
        "This method also allows development of new domains with very little data – for each domain, only a new domain-specific small language model needs to be built.",
        "Fluential has created an interpretation engine that is an alternative to an SMT engine.",
        "The S-MINDS interpretation engine uses information extracted from the output of the ASR engine and then performs a paraphrase translation in semantic space.",
        "This process is similar to what human interpreters do when they convey the essential meaning without providing a literal translation.",
        "The advantage of an interpretation engine is that new domains can be added more quickly and with less data than is possible with an SMT engine.",
        "For high-volume, routine interactions, an interpretation engine can be extremely fast and highly accurate; however, the translation may lose some of the nuance.",
        "Again, this means that highly accurate target applications can be built with very little data – only a few examples of each concept are needed to train the interpretation engine.",
        "For the S-MINDS SMT engine, Fluential is developing a novel approach that has generally improved the accuracy of speech translation systems.",
        "This approach capitalizes on the intuition that language is broadly divided into two levels:",
        "System implemented.",
        "structure and vocabulary.",
        "Traditional statistical approaches force the system to learn both types of information simultaneously.",
        "However, if the acquisition of structural information is kept separate from the acquisition of vocabulary, the resulting system should learn both levels more efficiently.",
        "And by modifying the existing corpus to separate structure and vocabulary, we have been able to take full advantage of all the information in the bilingual corpus, producing higher-quality MT without requiring large bodies of training data.",
        "The most recent modification to this approach was the use of distance-based ordering (Zens and Ney, 2003) and lexicalized ordering (Tillmann and Zhang, 2005) to allow for multiple language models, including non-word models such as part-of-speech improved search algorithm, in order to improve its speed and efficiency.",
        "S-MINDS has a flexible user interface that can be configured to use VUI only or VUI+GUI for either the English speaker or the second-language speaker.",
        "Also, the English speaker can experience a different user interface than the second-language speaker.",
        "The system has the flexibility to use multiple types of microphones, including open microphones, headsets, and telephone headsets.",
        "Speech recognition can be confirmed by VUI, GUI, or both, and it can be configured to verify all utterances, no utterances, or just utterances that fall below a certain confidence level.",
        "S-MINDS can use text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis throughout the system; alternatively, it can use TTS in its SMT-based system and chunk-based recordings that are spliced together in its interpretation engine.",
        "Fluential licenses its TTS technology from Cepstral, and other vendors.",
        "In general we do not expect to be doing any research and development activities in this area, as Cepstral can easily create good synthesis models from the 10 hours of provided speech data (Schultz and Black, 2006, Peterson, 2007)."

        "To define the task, Fluential conducted a two-hour focus group with six registered nurses from Med/Surg unit of Kaiser Medical Center in San Francisco.",
        "In this focus group, the nurses identified six nurse-patient encounter types that they wanted to use for the evaluation.",
        "These were: (1) Greeting/Goodbye, (2) Vital Signs, (3) Pain Assessment, (4) Respiratory Assessment, (5) Blood Sugar, (6) Placement of an I.V.",
