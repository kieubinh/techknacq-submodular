        "In the following, we adopt the definition from (Lecceuche et al., 1999): focus stands for the \"set of all the things to which participants in a dialogue are attending to at a certain point in a dialogue\".",
        "In general, all theories of dialogue focus considered by Lecceuche et al.",
        "claim that the focus changes according to some specific and well defined patterns, following the rules proposed by the respective theory.",
        "The main difference between these theories lies in how these rules are formulated.",
        "A major distinguishing feature of different focus theories has been the question whether they address global or local focus.",
        "While the latter explain coherence between consecutive sentences, the former are concerned with how larger parts of the dialogue can be coherent.",
        "We claim that in \"information seeking dialogue\" this distinction is moot, and the two kinds of foci collapse into one.",
        "Furthermore, our empirical investigation shows that it suffices to consider a rather short history of the dialogue, i.e. the previous user question and previous system answer, when looking for relations between previous dialogue and a FU Q.",
        "Salient transitions between two consecutive questions are defined in (Chai and lin, 2004) under the name of \"informational transitions\".",
        "The authors aim to describe how the topic within a dialogue evolves.",

        "We take this analysis as our starting point, extend it and propose an algorithm to automatically detect the kind of focus transition a user performs when asking a FU Q, and evaluate our extended theory with real dialogue data.",

        "For all forthcoming examples of dialogues, questions and answers, we will base our discussion on an actual prototype IQA system we have been developing; this system is supposed to provide library-related information in a university library setting.",
        "In the dialogues collected via an earlier Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) experiment (Kirschner and Bernardi, 2007), we observed that users either seem to have some specific library-related task (action, e.g. \"search\") in mind that they want to ask the system about, or they want to retrieve information on some specific entity (e.g., \"guided tour\").",
        "People tend to use FU Qs to \"zoom into\" (i.e., find out more about) either of the two.",
        "In line with this analysis, the focus of a FU Q might move from the task (action/verb) to the entities that are possible fillers of the verb's semantic argument slots.",
        "Based on these simple observations, we propose a task/entity-based model for describing the focus of questions and answers in our IQA setting.",
        "Our theory of focus structure is related to the task-based theory of (Grosz, 1977).",
        "Tasks correspond to verbs, which are inherently connected to an argument structure defining the verb's semantic roles.",
        "By consulting lexical resources like Prop-Bank (Palmer et al., 2005), we can use existing knowledge about possible semantic arguments of the tasks we have identified.",
        "We claim that actions/verbs form a suitable and robust basis for describing the (informational) meaning of utterances in IQA.",
        "Taking the main verb along with its semantic arguments to represent the core meaning of user questions seems to be a more feasible alternative to deep semantic approaches that still lack the robustness for dealing with unconstrained user input.",
        "Further, we claim that analyzing user questions on the basis of their task/entity structure provides a useful level of abstraction and granularity for empirically studying informational transitions in IQA dialogues.",
        "We back up this claim in Section 6.",
        "Along the lines of (Kirschner and Bernardi, 2007), we aim for a precise definition of focus structure for IQA questions.",
        "Our approach is similar in spirit to (Chai and lin, 2004), whereas we need to reduce the complexity of their discourse representation (i.e., their number of possible question \"topics\") so that we arrive at a representation of focus structure that lends itself to implementation in a practical IQA system.",

        "Our underlying assumption is that the focus (as identified by the focus triple) of a question is identical to that of the corresponding answer.",

        "Our original hypothesis was that a) knowledge about the dialogue history, and b) lexical knowledge about semantic arguments could improve an IQA system's ability to answer FU Qs.",
        "We opera-tionalized these notions by formulating a set of 10 features that evaluate whether a candidate answer is the correct one given a new (FU) user question.",
        "We then used regression modeling to investigate the usefulness of each individual feature by learning from annotated IQA dialogue data, showing that certain knowledge about the dialogue history (the previously focused task, and the entities mentioned in the previous system answer) and about semantic arguments are useful for distinguishing correct from wrong answers to a FU Q.",
        "Finally, we evaluated these results by showing how our Q^A mapping algorithm's answer accuracy improved by using the empirically learned scores for all statistically significant predictors/features.",
        "The features and the Q^A algorithm as a whole are based on a simple way to describe IQA questions in terms of focus triples.",

        "It would be interesting to see how this type of knowledge could be added to other IQA or dialogue systems in general.",
        "We see several directions for future work.",
        "Regarding coherent focus transitions, we have to look into which transitions to different tasks/entities are more coherent than others, possibly based on semantic similarity.",
        "A major desideratum for showing the scaleability of our work is to explore the influence of the subjects on our data annotation.",
        "We are currently working on getting an objective inter-annotator agreement measure, using external annotators.",
        "Finally, we plan to collect a large corpus of IQA dialogues via a publicly accessible IQA system, and have these dialogues annotated.",
        "With more data, coming from genuinely interested users instead of experimental subjects, and having these data annotated by external annotators, we expect to have more power to find significant and generally valid patterns of how focus evolves in IQA dialogues."
