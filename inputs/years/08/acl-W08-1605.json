        "Information overload, i.e. the presence of an excessive amount of data from which to search for relevant information, is a common problem to Information Retrieval (IR) and its subdiscipline of Question Answering (QA), that aims at finding concise answers to questions in natural language.",
        "In Web-based QA in particular, this problem affects the relevance of results with respect to the users' needs, as queries can be ambiguous and even answers extracted from documents with relevant content but expressed in a difficult language may be ill-received by users.",
        "While the need for user personalization has been addressed by the IR community for a long time (Belkin and Croft, 1992), very little effort has been carried out up to now in the QA community in this direction.",
        "Indeed, personalized Question Answering has been advocated in TREC-QA starting from 2003 (Voorhees, 2003); however, the issue was solved rather expeditiously by designing a scenario where an \"average news reader\" was imagined to submit the 2003 task's definition questions.",
        "Moreover, a commonly observed behavior in users of IR systems is that they often issue queries not as standalone questions but in the context of a wider information need, for instance when researching a specific topic.",
        "Recently, a new research direction has",
        "© 2008.",
        "Some rights reserved.",
        "been proposed, which involves the integration of QA systems with dialogue interfaces in order to encourage and accommodate the submission of multiple related questions and handle the user's requests for clarification in a less artificial setting (Maybury, 2002); however, Interactive QA (IQA) systems are still at an early stage or applied to closed domains (Small et al., 2003; Kato et al., 2006).",
        "Also, the \"complex, interactive QA\" TREC track (www.umiacs.umd.edu/ ~ jimmylin/ciqa/) has been organized, but here the interactive aspect refers to the evaluators being enabled to interact with the systems rather than to dialogue per se.",
        "In this paper, we first present an adaptation of User Modelling (Kobsa, 2001) to the design of personalized QA, and secondly we design and implement an interactive open-domain QA system, YourQA.",
        "Section 2 briefly introduces the baseline architecture of YourQA.",
        "In Section 3, we show how a model of the user's reading abilities and personal interests can be used to efficiently improve the quality of the information returned by a QA system.",
        "We provide an extensive evaluation methodology to assess such efficiency by improving on our previous work in this area (Quarteroni and Manand-har, 2007b).",
        "Moreover, we discuss our design of interactive QA in Section 4 and conduct a more rigorous evaluation of the interactive version of YourQA by comparing it to the baseline version on a set of TREC-QA questions, obtaining encouraging results.",

        "• Question Processing: The query is classified and the two top expected answer types are estimated; it is then submitted to the underlying search engine;",

        "Note that our answers are in the form of sentences with relevant words or phrases highlighted (as visible in Figure 2) and surrounded by their original passage.",
        "This is for two reasons: we believe that providing a context to the exact answer is important and we have been mostly focusing on non-factoids, such as definitions, which it makes sense to provide in the form of a sentence.",
        "A thorough evaluation of YourQA is reported in e.g. (Moschitti et al., 2007); it shows an Fl of 48±.7 for non-factoids on Web data, further improved by a SVM-based re-ranker.",

        "We approach reading level estimation as a supervised learning task, where representative documents for each of the three UM reading levels are collected to be labelled training instances and used to classify previously unseen documents.",
        "Our training instances consist of about 180 HTML documents from a collection of Web portals where",
        "Although the reading level can be modelled separately from the age range, for simplicity we here assume that these are paired in a reading level component.",

        "For this purpose, we use Kea (Witten et al., 1999), which splits documents into phrases and chooses some of the phrases as be key-phrases based on two criteria: the first index of their occurrence in the source documents and their TF x IDF score with respect to the current document collection.",
        "Kea outputs for each document in the set a ranked list where the candidate key-phrases are in decreasing order; after experimenting with several values, we chose to use the top 6 as key-phrases for each document.",

        "The personalized answer ranking takes wP into account as a secondary ranking criterion with respect to the baseline system's similarity score; as before, Google rank of the source document is used as further a tie-breaking criterion.",
        "Notice that our approach to User Modelling can be seen as a form of implicit (or quasi-implicit) relevance feedback, i.e. feedback not explicitly obtained from the user but inferred from latent information in the user's documents.",
        "Indeed, we take inspiration from (Teevan et al., 2005)'s approach to personalized search, computing the relevance of unseen documents (such as those retrieved for a query) as a function of the presence and frequency of the same terms in a second set of documents on whose relevance the user has provided feedback.",
        "Our approaches to personalization are evaluated in Section 3.4.",
        "The evaluation of our personalized QA algorithms assessed the contributions of the reading level attribute and of the profile attribute of the User Model.",
        "Reading level estimation was evaluated by first assessing the robustness of the unigram language models by running 10-fold cross-validation on the set of documents used to create such models, and averaging the ratio of correctly classified documents with respect to the total number of documents for each fold.",
        "Our results gave a very high accuracy, i.e. 94.23% ± 1.98 standard deviation.",
        "However, this does not prove a direct effect on the user's perception of such levels.",
        "For this purpose, we defined Reading level agreement (Ar) as the percentage of documents rated by the users as suitable to the reading level to which they were assigned.",
        "We performed a second experiment with 20 subjects aged between 16 and 52 and with a self-assessed good or medium English reading level.",
        "They evaluated the answers returned by the system to 24 questions into 3 groups (basic, medium and advanced reading levels), by assessing whether they agreed that the given answer was assigned to the correct reading level.",
        "Our results show that altogether, evaluators found answers appropriate for the reading levels to which they were assigned.",
        "The agreement decreased from 94% for Aadv to 85% for Amed to 72% for Abas; this was predictable as it is more constraining to conform to a lower reading level than to a higher one.",
        "The impact of the UM profile was tested by using as a baseline the standard version of YourQA, where the UM component is inactive.",
        "Ten adult participants from various backgrounds took part in the experiment; they were invited to form an individual profile by brainstorming key-phrases for 2-3 topics of their interest chosen from the Yahoo!",
        "directory (dir.",
        "yahoo.com): examples were \"ballet\", \"RPGs\" and \"dog health\".",
        "For each user, we created the following 3 questions so that he/she would submit them to the QA system: Qper, related to the user's profile, for answering which the personalized version of YourQA would be used; Qbas, related to the user's profile, for which the baseline version of the system would be used; and Qunr, unrelated to the user's profile, hence not affected by personalization.",
        "The reason why we handcrafted questions rather than letting users spontaneously interact with YourQA's two versions is that we wanted the results of the two versions to be different in order to measure a preference.",
        "After examining the top 5 results to each question, users had to answer the following questionnaire:",
        "• For each of the five results separately:",

        "1) Too long, 2) Quite long, 3) Not too long, 4) Quite little, 5) Very little TEST4: For this query, the system results were sensitive to my profile:",
        "The experiment results are summarized in Table 1.",
        "The first row reports a remarkable difference between the perceived usefulness for question Qrei with respect to question Qbas (answers to TEST1).",
        "The results were compared by carrying out a oneway analysis of variance (ANOVA) and performing the Fischer test using the usefulness as factor (with the three queries as levels) at a 95% level of confidence.",
        "The test revealed an overall significant difference between factors, confirming that users are positively biased towards questions related to their own profile when it comes to perceived utility.",
        "To analyze the answers to TEST2 (Table 1, row 2), which measured the perceived relatedness of each answer to the current profile, we used ANOVA again and and obtained an overall significant difference.",
        "Hence, answers obtained without using the users' profile were perceived as significantly less related to those obtained using their own profile, i.e. there is a significant difference between Qrei and Qbas- As expected, the difference between Qrei and QUnr is even more significant.",
        "Thirdly, the ANOVA table computed using average perceived time (TEST3) as variable and the three questions as factors did not give any significance, nor did any of the paired t-tests computed over each result pair.",
        "We concluded that apparently, the time spent browsing results is not directly correlated to the personalization of results.",
        "Finally, the average sensitivity of the five answers altogether (TEST4) computed over the ten participants for each query shows an overall significant difference in perceived sensitivity between the answers to question Qrei (3.9±0.7) and those to question Qbas (2.5±1.1) and Qunr (1.8±1.2).",
        "To conclude, our experience with profile evaluation shows that personalized QA techniques yield answers that are indeed perceived as more satisfying to users in terms of usefulness and relatedness to their own profile."

        "Concerning interaction comfort, users seemed to feel that the interactive version understood better their requests than the standard one (Q2); they also found it easy to reformulate questions when the former asked to (Qe)- However, while the pace of interaction was judged slightly more appropriate in the interactive case (Q7), interaction was considered faster when using the standard version {Qi).",
