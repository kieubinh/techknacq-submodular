        "For example, extracting arguments from legal texts (ICAIL 2005) or for answering opinion questions is a major challenge of primary use.",
        "We have developed a quite detailed analysis of procedural texts, identifying their main basic components as well as their global structure.",
        "For that purpose, we have defined two levels: a segmentation level that basically tags structures considered as terminal structures (titles, instructions, advices, prerequisites, etc.)",

        "We first present, in this section, the general organization of the explanation structure as it emerged from corpus analysis.",
        "Then we develop the major component of procedural texts: the instructional compound.",
        "From our development corpus, we established a classification of the different forms explanations may take.",
        "Basically, the explanation structure is meant to guide the user by making sure that he will effectively realize actions as they are specified, via e.g. threats, rewards, evaluations, advices and warnings.",
        "The main structures are facilitation and argumentation structures; they are either global (they are adjoined to goals, and have scope over the whole procedure) or local, included into instructional compounds, with a scope local to the instructional compound.",
        "This latter case is by far the most frequently encountered.",
        "These structures are summarized as follows (the terms we use are either borrowed from works on rhetorical relations or are just ours if none exist):",
        "• facilitation structures, which are rhetorical in essence (Kosseim et al. 2000) (Van der Linden 1993), correspond to How to do X ?",
        "questions, these include two subcategories:",
        "(1) user help, with: hints, evaluations and encouragements and (2) controls on instruction realization, with two cases: (2.1) controls on actions: guidance, focusing, expected result and elaboration and (2.2) controls on user interpretations: definitions, reformulations, illustrations and also elaborations.",
        "• argumentation structures, corresponding to why do X ?",
        "questions.",
        "These have either:",
        "(1) a positive orientation with the author involvement (promises) or not (advices and justifications) or (2) a negative orientation with the author involvement (threats) or not (warnings).",
        "In what follows, we will mainly concentrate on this second point, and in particular on warnings and advices which are the most frequently encountered (since there are rarely involvements from the author).",
        "These will be used to construct the know-how knowledge base.",
        "Argumentation structures are relatively general to an applications domain, while facilitation structures are much more specific to the text and the targeted audiences.",
        "There are several ways of defining and approaching argumentation.",
        "Without entering any debate, we consider here the approach where an argument is composed of one or more supports associated with a certain statement, as in the following warning: carefully plug in your mother card vertically, otherwise you will most likely damage its connectors, where if the intruction (carefully plug in...) is not correctly realized, the user know the consequences.",
        "In most types of texts, we do not find just sequences of simple instructions but much more complex compounds composed of clusters of instructions, that exhibit a number of semantic dependencies between each other, that we call instructional compounds.",
        "These are organized around a few main instructions, to which a number of subordinate instructions, warnings, arguments, and explanations of various sorts may possibly be adjoined.",
        "All these elements are, in fact, essential in a compound for a good understanding of the procedure at stake.",
        "An instructional compound has a relatively well organized discourse structure, composed of several layers, which are:",
        "• The goal and justification level, which has wider scope over the remainder of the compound, indicates motivations for doing actions that follow in the compound (e.g. in",
        "your bedroom, you must clean regularly the curtains..., which here motivates actions to undertake).",
        "It gives the fundamental motivation of the compound.",
        "• The instruction kernel structure, which contains the main instructions.",
        "These can be organized temporally or be just sets of actions.",
        "Actions are identified most frequently via the presence of action verbs (in relation to the domain) in the imperative form, or in the infinitive form introduced by a modal.",
        "We observed also a number of subordinated instructions forms adjoined to the main instructions.",
        "These are in general organized within the compound by means of rhetorical relations, introduced below.",
        "• The deontic and illocutionary force structures: consist of marks that operate over instructions, outlining different parameters.",
        "These linguistic structures play a major role in argumentation:",
        "- deontic: obligatory, optional, forbidden or impossible, alternates (or),",
        "- illocutionary and related aspects: stresses on actions: necessary, advised, recommended, to be avoided, etc.",
        "These marks are crucial to identify the weight of an argument.",
        "• a temporal structure that organizes sequences of instructions (and, at a higher level, instructional compounds).",
        "In general,",
        "the temporal structure is very simple, with sequences of actions to carry out.",
        "In some cases, parallel actions are specified, which partially overlap.",
        "• The conditional structure: introduces conditions over instructions within the compound or even over the whole instructional compound.",
        "We encounter quite a lot of structures organizing mutually exclusive cases.",
        "• the causal structure that indicates the goal of an action.",
        "We identify four types of causal relations, following (Talmy 2001): intend-to (direct objective of an action: push the button to start the engine), Instrumented {use a 2 inch key to dismount the door), Facilitation {enlarge the hole to better empty the tank) and Continue {keep the liquid warm till its colour changes).",
        "• The rhetorical structure whose goal is to enrich the kernel structure by means of a number of subordinated aspects (realized as propositions, possibly instructions) among which, most notably: enablement, motivation, circumstance, elaboration, instrument, precaution, manner.",
        "A group of relations of particular interest in this paper are arguments, developed hereafter.",
        "Explanations and arguments help the user understand why an instruction must be realized and what are the risks or the drawbacks if he does not do it properly.",
        "An example of an instructional compound is:",
        "instructional compound [coal To clean leather armchairs,] ar gument: advice [instruction choose specialized products dedicated to furniture, [instruction and prefer them colourless ]], [support they will play a protection role, add beauty, and repair some small damages.]]]",

        "In this section let us first give a quite informal definition of what an argument is, and how it interacts with the goal-instructions structure.",
        "Let us then focus on warnings and advices which are, by far, the most frequently encountered structures.",
        "Most warnings and advices are included into instructional compounds.",
        "Roughly, argumentation is a process that allows speakers to construct statements for or against another statement called the conclusion.",
        "These former statements are called supports.",
        "The general form of an argument is : Conclusion 'because' Support (noted as C because S).",
        "In natural language, conclusions often appear before the support, but they may also appear after.",
        "A conclusion may receive several supports, possibly of different natures (advices and warnings).",
        "Arguments may be more or less strong, they bear in general a certain weight, induced from the words they contain (Anscombre et al.",
        "1981), (Moeschler 1985), (Am-goud et ali.",
        "2001).",
        "In natural contexts, this weight is somewhat vague, and only general classes can be produced, e.g. from light to strong.",
        "In the case of procedural texts, the representation and the role of arguments in a text can be modelled roughly as follows.",
        "Let G be a goal which can be reached by the sequence of instructions Ai, i G [l,n], whatever their exact temporal structure is.",
        "A subset of those instructions is interpreted as arguments where each instruction (Aj, viewed as a conclusion) is paired with a support Sj that stresses the importance of Aj (Carefully plug in your mother card vertically, otherwise you will damage the connectors).",
        "Their general form is: Aj because Sj (we use here the term 'because' which is more vague than the implication symbol used in formal argumentation, because natural language is not so radical).",
        "Supports Sk which are negatively oriented are warnings whereas those which are positively oriented are advices.",
        "Neutral supports simply introduce basic explanations.",
        "Similarly to the principles of argument theory, but within the framework of action theory (e.g. Davidson 2003), if Aj is associated with a support of type warning Sj then if Aj is not realized correctly, the warning Sj is 'active' and attacks the goal G, i.e. it makes its realization more difficult, if not impossible.",
        "Conversely, if Sj is an advice, it supports the goal G, making its full realization easier, or providing better results if Aj is executed.",
        "Note however that there is an implicit gradabil-ity in the realization of an action, which may be more or less accurately and completely realized.",
        "In that case, negative or positive consequences on the main goal evolve accordingly.",
        "Supports can themselves receive supports : don't add natural fertilizer, this may attract insects, which will damage your young plants.",
        "In the same range of ideas, instructions Aj which are advices or warnings have a different status than 'normal', unsupported instructions (although one can say that most of them could be associated with an implicit support such as otherwise you will fail).",
        "Advices are often optional instructions: they are a kind of invitation to do the associated action for better results, whereas warnings are an incitation to be more careful.",
        "Therefore, instructions in a procedure do not have all the same operational strength and status.",
        "As can be noted, our definition includes terms which are gradual: 'more difficult', 'easier', because in practice, failing to realize an instruction properly does not necessarily means that the goal cannot be reached, but the user will just be less successful, for various reasons.",
        "In the natural language expressions of conclusions (the Aj) as well as of supports, there are many modals or classes of verbs (like risk verbs) that modulate the consequences on G, contrast for example: use professional products to clean your leathers, they will give them a brighter aspect, with: carefully plug in your mother card vertically, otherwise you will most likely damage its connectors.",
        "In the latter case, the goal 'mounting your own PC is likely to fail, whereas in the former, the goal 'cleaning your leathers' will just be less successful.",
        "From the above observations, we have defined a set of patterns that recognize instructions which are conclusions and their related supports.",
        "We defined those patterns from a development corpus of about 1700 texts from various domains (cooking, do it yourself, gardening, video games, social advices, etc.).",
        "The study is made on French, English glosses are given here for ease of reading.",
        "The recognition problem is twofold: identifying propositions as conclusions or supports by means of specific linguistic marks (sometimes we also found a few typographic marks), and then delimiting these elements.",
        "In general, boundaries are either sentences or, by default, instructional compound boundaries.",
        "In procedural texts, roughly, the proportion of advices and warnings is almost equivalent.",
        "Warnings are basically organized around a unique structure composed of an 'avoid expression' combined with a proposition.",
        "The variations around the 'avoid expressions' capture the illocutionary force of the argument via several devices, ordered here by increasing force :",
        "(1) 'prevention verbs like avoid' NP / to VP (avoid hot water) (3) it is essential, vital, ... to never VP(infinitive).",
        "In cases where the conclusion is relatively weak in terms of consequences, it may not have any specific mark, its recognition is then based on the observation that it is the instruction that immediately precedes an already identified support.",
        "Supports are propositions which are identified from various marks:",
        "(1) via connectors such as: sinon, car, sous peine de, au risque de (otherwise, under the risk of), etc.",
        "or via verbs expressing consequence, (2) via negative expressions of the form: in order not to, in order to avoid, etc.",
        "(3) via specific verbs such as risk verbs introducing an event (you risk to break).",
        "In general the embedded verb has a negative polarity.",
        "(4) via the presence of very negative terms, such as: nouns: death, disease, etc., adjectives, and some verbs and adverbs.",
        "We have a lexicon of about 200 negative terms found in our corpora.",
        "Some supports have a more neutral formulation: they may be a portion of a sentence where a conclusion has been identified.",
        "For example, a proposition in the future tense or conditional following a conclusion is identified as a support.",
        "However, as will be seen below, some supports may be empty, because they can easily be inferred by the reader.",
        "In that case, the argument is said to be truncated.",

        "From the above observations, with some generalizations and the eonstruetion of lexieons of marks, we have summarized the extraetion proeess in only 8 patterns for supports and 3 patterns for eonelusions.",

        "Each of these pages is associated with an index composed of the set of titles it contains and the list of supports identified (reconstructed supports are not yet included).",
        "Titles are used to make the procedure context more precise so that the scope of supports is more clear, since some supports are vague.",
        "A short example is given in Fig. 2 below.",
        "Supports which are too vague to be of any use are filtered out.",
        "At the moment we are studying various forms of filters based on the type of words they contain and their relevance.",
        "In general, attempting to match queries directly with supports in order to get the advice, i.e. the associated conclusion does not lead to the best results because supports are often incomplete or they contain a lot of pronominal references.",
        "Our matching procedure therefore includes the taking into account of the page title, or subtitles together with support contents.",
        "It seems that this leads to better results in terms of accuracy and relevance.",
        "Related to Fig. 2, a query could be: how to get smooth plaster surfaces on a wall ?.",

        "Answering this question is realized by the following steps:",
        "(1) based on keywords which appear as objects in the query, select a domain and a topic in the knowledge base.",
        "(2) then, over the topics selected, match the query with one or more supports.",
        "Matching is obviously not direct and requires, as in most systems, some flexibility.",
        "Of interest here are adjectives, which abound in this type of question, for which we need to develop scales that capture the different language expressions of the properties they characterize.",
        "This type of scale, in (Cruse 1986), is called non branching proportional series.",
        "For example 'smooth' will appear on a scale of type 'surface granularity' that includes other adjectives such as rough, grainy, etc."
