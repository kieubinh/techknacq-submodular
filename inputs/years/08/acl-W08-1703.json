        "In contrast to previous work, which has been primarily oriented towards parsing, our goal has been to develop an analysis of punctuation that is well suited for both parsing and surface realization.",
        "In addition, while Briscoe and Doran have simply included punctuation rules in their manually written grammars, our approach has been to revise the CCGbank itself with punctuation categories and more precise linguistic analyses, and then to extract a grammar from the enhanced corpus.",
        "In developing our analysis, we illustrate how aspects of Briscoe's (1994) approach, which relies on syntactic features to constrain the appearance of balanced and unbalanced commas and dashes to appropriate sentential contexts, is unattractive for CCG, with its more flexible handling of word order.",
        "Consequently, as an interim solution, we have chosen to identify and filter undesirable configurations when scoring alternative realizations.",
        "We also point to other ways in which punctuation constraints could be incorporated into the grammar, for exploration in future work.",

        "CCG (Steedman, 2000) is a unification-based cat-egorial grammar formalism which is defined almost entirely in terms of lexical entries that encode sub-categorization information as well as syntactic feature information (e.g. number and agreement).",
        "Complementing function application as the standard means of combining a head with its argument, type-raising and composition support transparent analyses for a wide range of phenomena, including right-node raising and long distance dependencies.",

        "Surface realization is the process by which logical forms are transduced to strings.",
        "OpenCCG uses a hybrid symbolic-statistical chart realizer (White, 2006) which takes logical forms as input and produces sentences by using CCG combinators to combine signs.",
        "Alternative realizations are ranked using integrated n-gram scoring.",
        "To illustrate the input to OpenCCG, consider the semantic dependency graph in Figure 1.",
        "In the graph, each node has a lexical predication (e.g. make.03) and a set of semantic features (e.g. (NUM)sg); nodes are connected via dependency relations (e.g. (arg0)).",
        "Internally, such graphs are represented using Hybrid Logic Dependency Semantics (HLDS), a dependency-based approach to representing linguistic meaning (Baldridge and Kruijff, 2002).",
        "In HLDS, each semantic head (corresponding to a node in the graph) is associated with a nominal that identifies its discourse referent, and relations between heads and their dependents are modeled as modal relations."

        "The linguistic analysis aims to make a broad coverage OpenCCG grammar extracted from the CCGbank (White et al., 2007) more precise by adding lexicalized punctuation categories to deal with constructions involving punctuation.",
        "The original CCGbank corpus does not have lexical categories for punctuation; instead, punctuation marks carry categories derived from their part of speech tags and form part of a binary rule.",
        "It is assumed that there are no dependencies between words and punctuation marks and that the result of punctuation rules is the same as the non-punctuation category.",

        "More generally, binary rules miss out on many linguistic generalizations, such as the presence of mandatory balancing marks in sentence-medial comma or dash adjuncts.",
        "The literature discusses various means to address the issue of overgeneration: absorption rules (Nunberg, 1990), syntactic features (Doran, 1998) and (Briscoe, 1994) and semantic features (White, 2006).",

        "Contexts and constructions in which punctuation marks occur were isolated and the corpus was then restructured by inserting new categories and modified derivations using XSL transforms.",
        "In many cases this also involved modifying the gold standard derivations substantially and adding semantic representations to syntactic categories using logical form templates.",

        "Syntactic categories and their semantics are linked by index variables in the feature structures of categories.",

        "To support modifier modifiers, as in (2), semantic heads of modifiers are also made available through a modifier index feature, with a variable conventionally named M} Here, the effect of combining the comma with the phrase headed by despite is to add the (emph-intro)+ feature to the despite-phrase's semantics.",
        "Following (Bayraktar et al., 1998), this feature indicates that the comma has the discourse function of emphasizing an introductory clause or phrase.",
        "During realization, the feature triggers the lookup of the category in (2), and prevents the reapplication of the category to its own output (as the feature should only be realized once).",
        "The category in (2) illustrates our approach, which is to assign to every punctuation mark (other than balancing marks) a category whose LF includes a feature or relation which represents its discourse semantic function in broad-brush terms such as emphasis, elaboration and apposition.",

        "Another possibility would be to follow Doran (1998) in analyzing the above construction by using the verb itself to select for the comma.",

        "They attain their surface form when a set of presentation rules are applied.",
        "This approach ensures that all sentence medial cases like (6) and (10) above are generated correctly, while unacceptable examples (7) and (11) would not be generated at all.",
        "Example (8) would at first be generated as (9): to deal with such sentences, where two points happen to coincide, Nunberg posits an implicit point which is absorbed by the adjacent point.",
        "Absorption occurs according to the \"strength\" of the two points.",
        "Strength is determined according to the Point Absorption Hierarchy, which ranks commas lower than dashes, semi-colons, colons and periods.",
        "As White (1995) observes, from a generation-only perspective, it makes sense to generate text adjuncts which are always balanced and post-process the output to delete lower ranked points, as absorption uses relatively simple rules that operate independently of the hierarchy of the constituents.",
        "However, using this approach for parsing would involve a preprocessing step which inserts commas into possible edges of possible constituents, as described in (Forst and Kaplan, 2006).",
        "To avoid this considerable complication, Briscoe (1994) has argued for developing declarative approaches involving syntactic features, with no deletions or insertions of punctuation marks.",
        "Unfortunately, the feature-based approach appears to be inadequate for dealing with the class of examples presented above in CCG.",
        "This approach involves the incorporation of syntactic features for punctuation into atomic categories so that certain combinations are blocked.",

        "Possible categories for a transitive verb and the full stop appear below:",
        "Here the feature variables BAL and PE of the rightmost argument of the verb would unify with the corresponding result category feature values to realize the main clauses of (8) and (9) with the following feature values:",

        "As Figure 2 shows, an unacceptable case like (17) is not blocked.",
        "Even when the sentence final NP is balanced, the end=comma value is not propagated to the root level.",
        "This is because the end feature for the relative clause should depend on the first (indirect) object of gave, rather than the second (direct) object as in a full ditransitive clause.",
        "A possible solution would be to introduce more features which record the presence of punctuation in the leftward and rightward arguments of complex categories; this would be rather baroque, however.",
        "Another issue is how crossing composition, used with adverbs in heavy NP shift contructions, interacts with appositives, as in the following examples:",
        "(18) Mary loves madly John, CEO of ABC.",
        "(19) * Mary loves madly John, CEO of ABC,.",
        "For examples (10) and (11), which do not involve crossing composition, the category for the adverb should be the one in (20):",
        "Here the bal= + feature on the argument of the adverb madly ensures that the direct object of the verb is balanced, as in (10); otherwise, the derivation fails, as in (11).",
        "Irrespective of the value of the end feature of the argument, the result of the adverb has the feature end=nil as the post-modifier is lexical material which occurs after the VP.",
        "With crossing composition, however, category (20) would licence an erroneous derivation for example (19), as the end=nil feature on the result of the adverb category would prevent the percolation of the end feature at the edge of the phrase to the clausal root, as Figure 3 shows.",
        "To block such derivations, one might consider giving the adverb another category for use with crossing composition:",
        "The use of the non-associative, permutative modality x on the main slash allows the crossing composition rule to be applied, and feature inheritance",
        "that John gave Bill, his brother,",

        "Thus, in example (19), the punctuation at the edge of the phrase would be percolated to the clausal root, where the sentence-final period would block the derivation.",
        "However, in the slash modality inheritance hierarchy proposed by Baldridge (2002), the x modality inherits the properties of function application.",
        "Consequently, this category could also lead to the erroneous derivation of example (11).",
        "In such a derivation, category (21) will not require the direct object to have a balanced appositive; meanwhile, the end=nil feature on the direct object will propagate to the clausal root, where it will happily combine with the category for the full stop.",
        "Finally, having two distinct categories for the adverb would offset the advantage of multi-modal categorial grammar in dealing with word order variation, where it is possible to use one category in situations where otherwise several categories would be required.",
        "For the reasons discussed in the preceding section, we decided not to use syntactic features to constrain overgeneration.",

        "We have shown that incorporating a more precise analysis of punctuation into a broad-coverage reversible grammar extracted from the CCGbank yields substantial increases in the number of exact matches and BLEU scores when performing surface realization with OpenCCG, contributing to state-of-the-art results.",
        "Our discussion has also highlighted the inadequacy of using syntactic features to control punctuation placement in CCG, leading us to develop a filter to ensure appropriately balanced commas and dashes.",
        "In future work, we plan to investigate a more satisfactory grammatical treatment involving constraints in independent orthographic derivations, perhaps along the lines of the autonomous prosodic derivations which Steedman and Prevost (1994) discuss.",
        "An evaluation of parsing side performance is also planned."
