        "In grammar sharing, existing grammar rules are directly shared between languages rather than just being recycled as they are in grammar adaptation.",
        "Compared to both the monolingual grammar approach and the grammar adaptation approach, grammar sharing reduces the amount of code that needs to be written as the central rules are written only once.",
        "This automatically leads to coherence between language descriptions for different languages, which improves grammar maintainability, and eliminates the duplication effort that otherwise occurs when monolingual grammars are used.",

        "Experiments have shown that these shared rules perform equally well on all three languages (San-taholma, 2007).",
