        "A typical breakdown of parsing time of XLE components with the English grammar is Morphology (1.6%), Chart (5.8%) and Unifier (92.6%).",
        "It is clear that the major bottleneck in processing is in unification.",

        "However, the results were encouraging enough for a c-structure pruning mechanism to be fully integrated into the XLE system.",
        "The paper is structured as follows: we present the pruning model that has been integrated into the XLE system (Section 2), and how it can be applied successfully to more than one language.",
        "We present experiments for English (Section 3), German (Section 4) and Norwegian (Section 5) showing that for both German and English, a significant improvement in speed is achieved, while the quality of the f-structures remains stable.",
        "For Norwegian a speedup is also achieved, but more training data is required to sustain the accuracy of the f-structures.",

        "The XLE system is designed to deal with large amounts of data in a robust manner.",
        "There are several mechanisms which facilitate this, including fragmenting and skimming.",
        "Fragmenting is called when the grammar is unable to provide a complete parse for the input sentence, and a fragment analysis of largest possible chunks is built.",
        "Skimming is called when too much time or memory has been used by XLE.",
        "Any constituents that have not been fully processed are \"skimmed\", which means that the amount of work carried out in processing the constituent is limited.",
        "This guarantees that XLE will finish processing the sentence in polynomial time.",
        "XLE uses a chart-based mechanism for building parses, and has been complemented with a c-structure pruning mechanism to speed up parsing time.",
        "During pruning, subtrees at a particular cell in the chart are pruned if their probabilities are not higher than a certain threshold.",
        "The chart pruner uses a simple stochastic CFG model.",
        "The probability of a tree is the product of the probabilities of each of the rules used to form the tree, including the rules that lead to lexical items (such as N – > dog).",
        "The probability of a rule is basically the number of times that that particular form of the rule occurs in the training data divided by the number of times the rule's category occurs in the training data, plus a smoothing term.",
        "This is similar to the pruning described in Charniak and Johnson (2005) where edges in a coarse-grained parse forest are pruned to allow full evaluation with finegrained categories.",
        "The pruner prunes at the level of individual constituents in the chart.",
        "It calculates the probabilities of each of the subtrees of a constituent and compares them.",
        "The probability of each subtree is compared with the best subtree probability for that constituent.",
        "If a subtree's probability is lower than the best probability by a given factor, then the subtree is pruned.",
        "In practice, the threshold is the natural logarithm of the factor used.",
        "So a value of 5 means that a subtree will be pruned if its probability is about a factor of 150 less than the best probability.",
        "If two different subtrees have different numbers of morphemes under them, then the probability model is biased towards the subtree that has fewer morphemes (since there are fewer probabilities multiplied together).",
        "XLE counteracts this by normalizing the probabilities based on the difference in length.",
        "To illustrate how this works, we give the following example.",
        "The string Fruit flies like bananas has two different analyses.",
        "Figures 1 and 2 give their analyses along with hypothetical probabilities for each rule.",
        "These two analyses come together at the S constituent that spans the whole sentence.",
        "The probability of the first analysis is 8.4375E-14.",
        "The probability of the second analysis is 4.21875E-12.",
        "This means that the probability of the second analysis is 50 times higher than the probability of the first analysis.",
        "If the threshold is less than the natural logarithm of 50 (about 3.9), then the subtree of the first analysis will be pruned from the S constituent."

        "This results in a speedup of 67% for English, 49% for German and 40% for Norwegian.",
        "The amount of training data for Norwegian was much less than that for English or German, therefore further work is required to fully investigate the effect of c-structure pruning.",
        "However, the results, even from the small training data, were encouraging and show the same general patterns as English and German.",
        "We showed that for the German training data, 32,000 sentences was the optimal number in order to achieve the highest oracle f-score.",
        "There remains some work to be done in tuning the parameters for the c-structure pruning, as our error analysis shows.",
        "Of course, with statistical methods one can never be guaranteed that the correct parse will be produced; however we can adjust the parameters to account for known problems.",
        "We have shown that the c-structure pruning mechanism described is an efficient way of reducing parse times, while maintaining the accuracy of the overall system."
