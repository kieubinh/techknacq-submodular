        "Technologically they should be as low level as possible, and platform independent, and be equally accessible to practising field linguists as to NLP researchers in computational settings.",

        "* Slots are interconnected by '-' (hyphen).",
        "* Distinct items inside a slot are interconnected by '_' (underline).",
        "* An item label containing neither '-' nor '_' is an uninterrupted string of letters.",
        "Internal composition is indicated by alternation between small and capital letters.",

        "The valence slot includes information as to referential status of the arguments.",
        "We say that a direct syntactic argument is standardly linked when it has referential content and has a semantic argument function relative to the verb.",
        "This excludes expletive subjects and expletive objects, as well as 'raised' full NPs.",
        "The following substrings in slot 2 indicate the presence of items that are not standardly linked: Impers ('impersonal'), Presentational, Epon ('extraposition'), Nrf ('non-referential'), Rais ('item raised, i.e., non-argument'), Nrg ('nonargument' - used in slot 3)).",
        "Specifications are sought to be non-redundant.",

        "For instance, for the template in (2) -v-trScpr-scSuNrg scAdj-obCog_scThSit-PROPOSITIONALATTITUDE one could see this as equivalent to a unification of syntactic types representing, resp., 'verb-headed', 'transitive with a secondary predicate', 'secondary predicate predicated of raised subject', and 'secondary predicate headed by an adjective', and the semantic types 'cognizer, as role of object', and 'situational theme', as role of secondary predicate.",
        "In the tdl notation used in LKB grammars, this would suggest (3) as one of its type definitions (ignoring the situation type label for now):",

        "Here, the type in line 1 is defined as the unification of the types interconnected with '&'.",

        "As individual types (as is customary, mention of such types is done with italics) v, trScpr, scSuNrg, scAdj, obCog and scThSit will all be at 'sign' level.",
        "That is: when, in an LKB-like grammar, these types are to unify with each other, they must belong to a common supertype, and given that what they are composing together is the type of a verb lexeme, this is, in a Matrix-type grammar, an instance of the type sign.",
        "For instance, the type definition for scAdj, relative to NorSource, is (with PREDIC being an attribute introducing secondary predicates, and QVAL introducing grammatical relations in a non-list fashion, a la LFG):",
        "[SYNSEM | LOCAL | CAT | QVAL | PREDIC | LOCAL | CAT | HEAD adj].",
        "In what part of the overall grammar will these types be introduced?",
        "A first question is if 'construction' is a type of entity to be assumed among the building blocks of the grammar.",
        "In standard HPSG and LFG design, the tendency is to project construction types into the inventory of lexical types, so that verb-construction types enter the grammar through the subcategorization frames associated with verbs.",
        "On this view, a definition like (3) will be in an inventory of lexical type definitions.",
        "How do lexical items, in this case verbs, relate to these types?",
        "If we consider the more standard design in HPSG and LFG grammars, where a verb has as many entries as there are construction frames in which it can enter, most verbs can enter more than one constructional environment.Thus, in the typical case, a verb will be associated with a subset of the totality of types derivable from the template collection, and thus have entries each one defined by one of these types.",
        "Some points of useful flexibility in this mapping may be noted, illustrated with the choice of head in secondary predicate constructions (cf. (4)): in constructions like those discussed, eligible such heads are in principle adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, predicative particles and in-finitivals.",
        "For a given verb, the full range of options need not be open, hence in defining the general verb type corresponding to the template v-trScpr-scSuNrg_scAdj-obCog_scThSit one may want to leave the sc-head open, and rather have a way of appending that information for each individual verb.",
        "By separating out the relevant part (_scAdj, _scAdv...,), and defining v-trScpr-sSubNrg scAdj, v-trScpr-scSuNrg_scAdv, etc.",
        "as subtypes of v-trScpr-sSubNrg, one can in an LKB grammar enter each verb in the lexicon with the appropriate last part provided (and leave them out when the verb actually can combine with all options).",
        "In such an approach one has to define all constellations in the relevant type file, the gain lies in the flexibility one has in the lexical entry specifications.",
        "The same advantages apply with regard to specification of semantic roles."

        "An alternation, such as the 'spray-load alternation', can be viewed as a pair of construction types in which a number of verbs can participate, typically with rather similar semantics, highlighting - by a 'minimal pair' technique - semantic properties of the constructions chosen.)"
