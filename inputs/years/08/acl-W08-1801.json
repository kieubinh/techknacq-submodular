        "The task of Question Answering (QA) involves taking a question phrased in natural human language and locating specific answers to that question expressed within a text collection.",
        "Regardless of system architecture, or whether the system is operating over a closed text collection or the web, most QA systems use text retrieval as a first step to narrow the search space for the answer to the question to a subset of the text collection (Hirschman and Gaizauskas, 2001).",
        "The remainder of the QA process amounts to a gradual narrowing of the search space, using successively more finely-grained filters to extract, validate and present one or more answers to the question.",

        "Some rights reserved.",
        "Perhaps the most popular system architecture in the QA research community is the modular architecture, in most variations of which, text retrieval is represented as a separate component, isolated by a software abstraction from question analysis and answer extraction mechanisms.",
        "The widely-accepted pipelined modular architecture imposes a strict linear ordering on the system's control flow, with the analysis of the input question used as input to the text retrieval module, and the retrieved results feeding into the downstream answer extraction components.",
        "Proponents of the modular architecture naturally view the QA task as decomposable, and to a certain extent, it is.",
        "The modules, however, can never be fully decoupled, because question analysis and answer extraction components, at least, depend on a common representation for answers and perhaps also a common set of text processing tools.",
        "This dependency is necessary to enable the answer extraction mechanism to determine whether answers exist in retrieved text, by analyzing it and comparing it against the question analysis module's answer specification.",
        "In practice, the text retrieval component does not use the common representation for scoring text; either the question analysis module or an explicit query formulation component maps it into a representation queryable by the text retrieval component.",
        "The pipelined modular QA system architecture also carries with it an assumption about the com-positionality of the components.",
        "It is easy to observe that errors cascade as the QA process moves through downstream modules, and this leads to the intuition that maximizing performance of individual modules minimizes the error at each stage of the pipeline, which, in turn, should maximize overall end-to-end system accuracy.",

        "Ignoring the dependency between the answer extraction mechanism and the text retrieval component creates a problem.",
        "The answer extraction module is not able to handle the more sophisticated types of matches provided by the improved text retrieval module, and so it ignores them, leaving end-to-end system performance largely unchanged.",
        "The lesson learned is that a module improved in isolation does not necessarily provide an improvement in end-to-end system accuracy, and the paper concludes with recommendations for further research in bringing text retrieval and answer extraction closer together."

        "Improving the quality of text retrieval is essential because once the likely location of the answer is narrowed down to a subset of the text collection, anything not retrieved text can not be searched for answers in downstream modules.",
