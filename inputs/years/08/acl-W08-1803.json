        "Passage retrieval in question answering is different from information retrieval in general.",
        "Extracting relevant passages from large document collections is only one step in answering a natural language question.",
        "There are two main differences: i) Passage retrieval queries are generated from complete sentences (questions) compared to bag-of-keyword queries usually used in IR.",
        "ii) Retrieved passages have to be processed further in or-",
        "©2008.",

        "der to extract concrete answers to the given question.",
        "Hence, the size of the passages retrieved is important and smaller units are preferred.",
        "Here, the division of documents into passages is crucial.",
        "The textual units have to be big enough to ensure IR works properly and they have to be small enough to enable efficient and accurate QA.",
        "In this study we investigate whether semantically motivated passages in the retrieval component lead to better QA performance compared to the use of document retrieval and window-based segmentation approaches.",
        "In this paper, we experiment with various possibilities of dividing documents into passages before indexing them.",
        "This is also called index-time passaging and refers to a one-step process of retrieving appropriate textual units for subsequent answer extraction modules (Roberts and Gaizauskas, 2004; Greenwood, 2004).",
        "This is in contrast to other strategies using a two-step procedure consisting of document retrieval and search-time passaging thereafter.",
        "Here, we can distinguish between approaches that only return one passage per relevant document (see, for example, (Robertson et al., 1992)) and the ones that allow multiple passages per document (see, for example (Moldovan et al., 2000)).",
        "In general, allowing multiple passages per document is preferable for QA as possible answers can be contained at various positions in a document (Roberts and Gaizauskas, 2004).",
        "For this, an index-time approach has the advantage that the retrieval of multiple passages per documents is straightforward because all of them compete which each other in the same index using the same metric for ranking.",
        "A comparison between index-time and searchtime passaging has been carried out in (Roberts and Gaizauskas, 2004).",
        "In their experiments, index-time passaging performs similarly to search-time passaging in terms of coverage and redundancy (measures which have been introduced in the same paper; see section 4.2 for more information).",
        "Significant differences between the various approaches can only be observed in redundancy on higher ranks (above 50).",
        "However, as we will see later in our experiments (section 4.2), redundancy is not as important as coverage for our QA system .",
        "Furthermore, retrieving more than about 40 passages does not produce significant improvements of the QA system anymore but slows down the processing time substantially.",
        "Another argument for our focus on a one-step retrieval procedure can be taken from (Tellex et al., 2003).",
        "In this paper, the authors do not actually use any index-time passaging approach but compare various search-time passage retrieval algorithms.",
        "However, they obtain a huge performance difference when applying an oracle document retriever (only returning relevant documents in the first retrieval step) instead of a standard IR engine.",
        "Compared to this, the differences between the various passage retrieval approaches tested is very small.",
        "From this we can conclude that much improvement can be gained by improving the initial retrieval step, which seems to be the bottleneck in the entire process.",
        "Unfortunately, the authors do not compare their results with index-time approaches.",
        "However, looking at the potential gain in document retrieval and keeping in mind that the performance of index-time and search-time approaches is rather similar (as we have discussed earlier) we believe that the index-time approach is preferable.",
        "Certainly, IR performance is effected by changing the size of the units to be indexed.",
        "The task in document segmentation for our index-time passaging approach is to find the proper division of documents into text passages which optimize the retrieval in terms of overall QA performance.",
        "The general advantages of passage retrieval over full-text document retrieval has been investigated in various studies, e.g., (Kaszkiel and Zobel, 2001; Callan, 1994; Hearst and Plaunt, 1993; Kaszkiel and Zobel, 1997).",
        "Besides the argument of decreasing the search space for subsequent answer extraction modules in QA, passage retrieval also improves standard IR techniques by \"normalizing\" textual units in terms of size which is especially important in cases where documents come from very diverse sources.",
        "IR is based on similarity measures between documents and queries and standard approaches have shortcomings when applying them to documents of various sizes and text types.",
        "Often there is a bias for certain types raising problems of discrimination between documents of different lengths and content densities.",
        "Passages on the other hand provide convenient units to be returned to the user avoiding such ranking difficulties (Kaszkiel and Zobel, 2001).",
        "For IR, passagelevel evidence may be incorporated into document retrieval (Callan, 1994; Hearst and Plaunt, 1993) or passages may be used directly as retrieval unit (Kaszkiel and Zobel, 2001; Kaszkiel and Zobel, 1997).",
        "For QA only the latter is interesting and will be applied in our experiments.",
        "Passages can be defined in various ways.",
        "The most obvious way is to use existing markup (explicit discourse information) to divide documents into smaller units.",
        "Unfortunately, such markup is not always available or ambiguous with other types of separators.",
        "For example, headers, list elements or table cells might be separated in the same way (for example using an empty line) as discourse related paragraphs.",
        "Also, the division into paragraphs may differ a lot depending on the source of the document.",
        "For example, Wikipedia entries are divided on various levels into rather small units whereas newspaper articles often include very long paragraphs.",
        "There are several ways of automatically dividing documents into passages without relying on existing markup.",
        "One way is to search for linguistic clues that indicate a separation of consecutive text blocks.",
        "These clues may include lexical patterns and relations.",
        "We refer to such approaches as semantically motivated document segmentation.",
        "Another approach is to cut documents into arbitrary pieces ignoring any other type of information.",
        "For example, we can use fixed-sized windows to divide documents into passages of similar size.",
        "Such windows can be defined in terms of words and characters (Kaszkiel and Zobel, 2001; Monz, 2003) or sentences and paragraphs (Zobel et al., 1995; Llopis et al., 2002).",
        "It is also possible to allow varying window sizes and overlapping sections to be indexed (Kaszkiel and Zobel, 2001; Monz, 2003).",
        "In this case it is up to the IR engine to decide which of the competing window types is preferred and it may even return overlapping sections multiple times.",
        "In the following sections we will discuss two techniques of semantically motivated document segmentation and compare them to simple window-based techniques in terms of passage retrieval and QA performance."

        "It is worth noting that including coreferential chains without length restriction forced the retrieval engine to return a lot of very long passages which resulted in a degraded QA performance (also in terms of processing time which is not shown here).",
        "The combination of paragraphs and coreferential passages with length restrictions produced MRRqa scores above the baseline.",

        "Applying TextTiling yielded improved scores in both passage retrieval and QA performance (MRRqa and CLEF).",
        "The MRRqa improvement is statistically significant according to the same test.",
        "In comparison to the semantically motivated passages discussed above we also looked at simple window-based passages as described earlier.",
        "Here we do not consider any linguistic clues for dividing the documents besides the sentence and document boundaries.",

        "Table 3: Passage retrieval with window-based document segmentation (A means significant with p < 0.05 and Wilcoxon Matched-pair Signed-Ranks Test)",
        "Surprisingly, we can see that window-based segmentation approaches with small sizes between 2 and 7 sentences yield improved scores compared to the baseline.",
        "Two of the improvements (using 2-sentence passages and 4-sentence passages) are statistically significant.",
        "Three settings also outperform the best semantically motivated segmentation approach.",
        "This result was unexpected especially considering the naive way of splitting documents into parts disregarding any discourse structure (besides document boundaries) and other semantic clues.",

        "Our experiments show that passage retrieval is indeed different to general document retrieval.",
        "Improved retrieval scores do not necessarily lead to better QA performance.",
        "Important for QA is to reduce the search space for subsequent answer extraction modules and, hence, passage retrieval has to balance retrieval accuracy and retrieval size.",
        "In our setup it seems to be preferable to return very small units with a reasonable coverage.",
        "For this, index-time passaging is very effective.",
        "In this study we were especially interested in semantically motivated approaches to document segmentation.",
        "In particular, two techniques have been investigated, one using the well-known TextTil-ing algorithm and one using coreference chains for passage boundary detection.",
        "We compared them to simple window-based techniques using various sizes.",
        "From our experiments we can conclude that simple document segmentation techniques using small fixed-sized windows work best among the ones tested here.",
        "Semantically motivated passages in the retrieval component helped to slightly improve QA performance but do not justify the effort spent in producing them.",
        "One of the main reasons for the failure of using coreference chains for segmentation might be the fact that this approach produces many overlapping passages which does not seem to be favorable for passage retrieval.",
        "This can also be seen in the sliding window approach which did not perform as well as the one without overlapping units (except for two-sentence passages).",
        "In conclusion, uniformity in terms of length and uniqueness (in terms of non-overlapping contents) seem to be more important than semantic coherence for one-step passage retrieval in QA.",
        "A future direction could be to test an approach that balances both a uniform document segmentation and semantic coherence.",
