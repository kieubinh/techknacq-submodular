        "In question answering (QA), text passages are an important intermediary between full documents and exact answers.",
        "They form a very natural unit of response for QA systems (Tellex et al., 2003) and it is known from user studies that users prefer answers to be embedded in paragraph-sized chunks (Lin et al., 2003) because they can provide the context of an answer.",
        "Therefore, almost all state-of-the-art QA systems implement some technique for extracting paragraph-sized fragments of text from a large corpus.",
        "Most QA systems have a pipeline architecture consisting of at least three components: question analysis, document/passage retrieval, and answer extraction (Hirschman and Gaizauskas, 2001;",

        "The quality of a QA system heavily depends on the effectiveness of the integrated retrieval system (second step of the pipeline): if a retrieval system fails to find any relevant documents for a question, further processing steps to extract an answer will inevitably fail too (Monz, 2003).",
        "This motivates the need to study passage retrieval for QA.",
        "There are two common approaches to retrieving passages from a corpus: one is to index each passage as separate document and retrieve them as such.",
        "The other option is to first retrieve relevant documents for a given question and then retrieve passages from the retrieved documents.",
        "The passages themselves can vary in size and degree of overlap.",
        "Their size can be fixed as a number of words or characters, or varying with the semantic content (Hearst and Plaunt, 1993) or the structure of the text (Callan, 1994).",
        "The overlap between two adjacent passages can be either zero, in which case we speak of disjoint passages, or the passages may be overlapping, which we refer to as sliding passages.",
        "In this paper, we compare the effectiveness of several passage retrieval techniques with respect to their usefulness for QA.",
        "Our main interest is the contribution of sliding passages as apposed to disjoint passages, and we will experiment with a number of retrieval models.",
        "We evaluate the retrieval approaches on two different QA tasks: (1) factoid-QA, as defined by the test collection provided by TREC (Voorhees, 2002; Voorhees, 2003), and (2) a relatively new problem in the QA field: that of answering w/ry-questions (why-QA).",

        "We use the Lemur retrieval engine for passage retrieval because it provides a flexible support for different types of retrieval models including vector space models and language models.",
        "In this paper we have selected two vector space models: TFIDF and Okapi BM25 (Robertson and Walker, 1999), and one language model based on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence (Lafferty and Zhai, 2001).",
        "The TFIDF weighting scheme is often used in information retrieval.",
        "There are several variations of the TFIDF weighting scheme that can effect the performance significantly.",
        "The Lemur toolkit provides a variant of the TFIDF model based on the Okapi TF formula (Robertson et al., 1995).",
        "Lemur also provides the implementation of the original Okapi BM25 model, and we have used this model with default values of 1.2 for kl, 0.75 for b and 7 for k3 as suggested by (Robertson and Walker, 1999).",
        "The KL-divergence retrieval model, which implements the cross entropy of the query model with respect to the document model, is a standard metric for comparing distributions, which has proven to work well in IR experiments in the past.",
        "To address the data sparseness problem during model estimation, we use the Dirichlet smoothing method (Zhai and Lafferty, 2004) with default parameter values provided in the Lemur toolkit.",

        "The Wikipedia XML collection consists of 659,388 articles as they oc-cured in the online Wikipedia in the summer of 2006.",
        "As we have discussed in Section 2, (Tiede-mann, 2007) discovered that discourse-based segmentation into paragraphs works well with standard information retrieval techniques.",
        "They also observe that larger retrieval units produce better results for passage retrieval, since larger units have higher chance to cover the required information.",
        "Therefore, we decide to segment each document into similar sized passages while taking into account complete paragraphs only.",
        "For document segmentation, our method first detects sentences in the text using punctuation marks as separators, and then paragraphs using empty lines as separators.",
        "Sentence boundaries are necessary because we aim at retrieving passages that do not contain any broken sentences.",
        "The required passages are identified by aligning over paragraph boundaries (merging paragraphs into units until they have the required length ,i.e. 500 characters).",
        "The disjoint passages do not share any content with each other, and the sliding passages slide with the difference of one paragraph boundary, i.e., we start forming a new passage from beginning of each paragraph of the document.",

        "TDRR is an extension of MRR that favors a system that ranks more that one relevant passage higher than all non-relevant passages.",

        "In this paper we have investigated the contribution of sliding windows as apposed to disjoint windows with different retrieval modules for two different QA tasks: the TREC-QA 2002-2003 task and why-QA.",
        "For the TREC factoid-QA task, we have found that retrieval of sliding windows outperfoms retrieval of disjoint windows in returning as many relevant passages as possible on top ranks (according to the TDRR metric).",
        "The experimental results show that a language model based on Kullback-Leibler divergence gives better performance than two vector space models for both types of windows retrieval according to MRR, success@n and TDRR evaluation metrics.",
        "We found that the number of answered questions (success@n) was slightly lower when we used sliding windows for passage retrieval than disjoint windows, but we think one of the reasons is that sliding windows are more homogeneous than disjoint windows, and therefore for some questions more irrelevant passages are returned at top ranks and relevant passages are surpressed down.",
        "For the task of retrieving answers to why-questions from Wikipedia data, we found that the best retrieval model is TFIDF, and sliding windows give significantly better results than disjoint windows.",
        "We also found better performance for our complete why-pipeline system after applying our existing re-ranking module to the passages retrieved with TFIDF-sliding.",
        "In general, we find that for QA, sliding windows give better results than disjoint windows in the passage retrieval step.",
        "The best scoring retrieval model depends on the task under consideration, because the nature of the documents and question sets differ.",
        "This shows that for each specific QA task, different retrieval models should be considered.",
        "In the future, we aim to boost passage retrieval for QA even more by applying query expansion techniques that are specific to the QA tasks that we consider, i.e. TREC factoid-QA and why-QA.",
