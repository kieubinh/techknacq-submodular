        "known.",
        "The aim of an automated question answering system is to provide a single, unambiguous response to a natural language question, given a text collection as a knowledge source, within a certain amount of time.",
        "Since 1999, the Text Retrieval Conferences have included a task to evaluate such systems, based on a large predefined corpus (such as AQUAINT, containing around a million news articles in English) and a set of unseen questions.",
        "Many information retrieval systems perform document retrieval, giving a list of potentially relevant documents when queried - Google's and Yahoo!",
        "'s search products are examples of this type of application.",
        "Users formulate a query using a few keywords that represent the task they are trying to perform; for example, one might search for \"eif-fel tower height\" to determine how tall the Eiffel tower is.",
        "IR engines then return a set of references to potentially relevant documents.",
        "In contrast, QA systems must return an exact answer to the question.",
        "They should be confident that the answer has been correctly selected; it is no longer down to the user to research a set of document references in order to discover the information themselves.",
        "Further, the system takes a natural language question as input, instead of a few user-selected key terms.",
        "Once a QA system has been provided with a question, its processing steps can be described in three parts - Question Pre-Processing, Text Retrieval and Answer Extraction:",
        "1.",
        "Question Pre-Processing TREC questions are grouped into series which relate to a given target.",
        "For example, the target may be \"Hinden-burg disaster\" with questions such as \"What type of craft was the Hindenburg?\"",
        "or \"How fast could it travel?\".",
        "Questions may include pronouns referencing the target or even previous answers, and as such require processing before they are suitable for use.",
        "2.",
        "Text Retrieval An IR component will return a ranked set of texts, based on query terms.",
        "Attempting to understand and extract data from an entire corpus is too resource intensive, and so an IR engine defines a limited subset of the corpus that is likely to contain answers.",

        "Answer Extraction (AE) Given knowledge about the question and a set of texts, the AE system attempts to identify answers.",
        "It should be clear that only answers within texts returned by the IR component have any chance of being found.",
        "Reduced performance at any stage will have a knock-on effect, capping the performance of later stages.",
        "If questions are left unprocessed and full of pronouns (e.g.,\"When did it sink?\")",
        "the IR component has very little chance of working correctly - in this case, the desired action is to retrieve documents related to the Kursk submarine, which would be impossible.",
        "IR performance with a search engine such as Lucene returns no useful documents for at least 35% of all questions - when looking at the top 20 returned texts.",

        "For each question, answers are provided in the form of regular expressions that match answer text, and a list of documents containing these answers in a correct context.",
        "As references to correct documents are available, it is possible to explore a data-driven approach to query analysis.",
        "We determine which questions are hardest then concentrate on identifying helpful terms found in correct documents, with a view to building a system than can automatically extract these helpful terms from unseen questions and supporting corpus.",
        "The availability and usefulness of these terms will provide an estimate of performance for query expansion techniques.",
        "There are at least two approaches which could make use of these term sets to perform query expansion.",

        "The performance of an IR system can be quantified in many ways.",
        "We choose and define measures pertinent to IR for QA.",
        "Work has been done on relevance feedback specific to IR for QA, where it is has usually be found to be unhelpful.",
        "We outline the methods used in the past, extend them, and provide and test means of validating QA relevance feedback.",
        "This paper uses two principle measures to describe the performance of the IR component.",
        "Coverage is defined as the proportion of questions where at least one answer bearing text appears in the retrieved set.",
        "Redundancy is the average number of answer bearing texts retrieved for each question (Roberts and Gaizauskas, 2004).",
        "Both these measures have a fixed limit n on the number of texts retrieved by a search engine for a query.",
        "As redundancy counts the number of texts containing correct answers, and not instances of the answer itself, it can never be greater than the number of texts retrieved.",
        "The TREC reference answers provide two ways of finding a correct text, with both a regular expression and a document ID.",
        "Lenient hits (retrievals of answer bearing documents) are those where the retrieved text matches the regular expression; strict hits occur when the document ID of the retrieved text matches that declared by TREC as correct and the text matches the regular expression.",
        "Some documents will match the regular expression but not be deemed as containing a correct answer (this is common with numbers and dates (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999)), in which case a lenient match is found, but not a strict one.",
        "The answer lists as defined by TREC do not include every answer-bearing document - only those returned by previous systems and marked as correct.",
        "Thus, false negatives are a risk, and strict measures place an approximate lower bound on the system's actual performance.",
        "Similarly, lenient matches can occur out of context, without a supporting document; performance based on lenient matches can be viewed as an approximate upper bound (Lin and Katz, 2005).",
        "Relevance feedback is a widely explored technique for query expansion.",
        "It is often done using a specific measure to select terms using a limited set of ranked documents of size r; using a larger set will bring term distribution closer to values over the whole corpus, and away from ones in documents relevant to query terms.",
        "Techniques are used to identify phrases relevant to a query topic, in order to reduce noise (such as terms with a low corpus frequency that relate to only a single article) and query drift (Roussinov and Fan, 2005; Allan, 1996).",
        "In the context of QA, Pizzato (2006) employs blind RF using the AQUAINT corpus in an attempt to improve performance when answering factoid questions on personal names.",
        "This is a similar approach to some content in this paper, though limited to the study of named entities, and does not attempt to examine extensions from the existing answer data.",
        "Monz (2003) finds a negative result when applying blind feedback for QA in TREC 9, 10 and 11, and a neutral result for TREC 7 and 8's ad hoc retrieval tasks.",
        "Monz's experiment, using r = 10 and standard Rocchio term weighting, also found a further reduction in performance when r was reduced (from 10 to 5).",
        "This is an isolated experiment using just one measure on a limited set of questions, with no use of the available answer texts.",
        "Robertson (1992) notes that there are issues when using a whole document for feedback, as opposed to just a single relevant passage; as mentioned in Section 3.1, passage-and document-level retrieval sets must also be compared for their performance at providing feedback.",
        "Critically, we will survey the intersection between words known to be helpful and blind RF terms based on initial retrieval, thus showing exactly how likely an RF method is to succeed."

        "We first investigated the possibility of an IR-component specific failure leading to impaired coverage by testing a variety of IR engines and configurations.",
        "Then, difficult questions were identified, using various performance thresholds.",
        "Next, answer bearing texts for these harder questions were checked for words that yielded a performance increase when used for query expansion.",
        "After this, we evaluated how likely a RF-based approach was to succeed.",
        "Finally, blind RF was applied to the whole question set.",
        "IR performance was measured, and terms used for RF compared to those which had proven to be helpful as extension words.",
        "A QA framework (Greenwood, 2004a) was originally used to construct a QA system based on running a default Lucene installation.",
        "As this only covers one IR engine in one configuration, it is prudent to examine alternatives.",
        "Other IR engines should be tested, using different configurations.",
        "The chosen additional engines were: Indri, based on the mature INQUERY engine and the Lemur toolkit (Allan et al., 2003); and Terrier, a newer engine designed to deal with corpora in the terabyte range and to back applications entered into TREC conferences (Ounis et al., 2005).",
        "We also looked at both passage-level and document-level retrieval.",
        "Passages can be defined in a number of ways, such as a sentence, a sliding window of k terms centred on the target term(s), parts of a document of fixed (and equal) lengths, or a paragraph.",
        "In this case, the documents in the AQUAINT corpus contain paragraph markers which were used as passage-level boundaries, thus making \"passage-level\" and \"paragraph-level\" equivalent in this paper.",
        "Passage-level retrieval may be preferable for AE, as the number of potential distracters is somewhat reduced when compared to document-level retrieval (Roberts and Gaizauskas, 2004).",
        "The initial IR component configuration was with Lucene indexing the AQUAINT corpus at passage-level, with a Porter stemmer (Porter, 1980) and an augmented version of the CACM (Jones and van Rijsbergen, 1976) stopword list.",
        "Indri natively supports document-level indexing of TREC format corpora.",
        "Passage-level retrieval was done using the paragraph tags defined in the corpus as delimiters; this allows both passage-and document-level retrieval from the same index, according to the query.",
        "All the IR engines were unified to use the Porter",

        "The top n documents for each question in the TREC2004, TREC2005 and TREC2006 sets were retrieved using every combination of engine, and configuration.",
        "The questions and targets were processed to produce IR queries as per the default configuration for the QA framework.",
        "Examining the top 200 documents gave a good compromise between the time taken to run experiments (between 30 and 240 minutes each) and the amount one can mine into the data.",
        "Tabulated results are shown in Table 1 and Table 2.",
        "Queries have had anaphora resolution performed in the context of their series by the QA framework.",
        "AE components begin to fail due to excess noise when presented with over 20 texts, so this value is enough to encompass typical operating parameters and leave space for discovery (Greenwood et al., 2006).",
        "A failure analysis (FA) tool, an early version of which is described by (Sanka, 2005), provided reporting and analysis of IR component performance.",
        "In this experiment, it provided high level comparison of all engines, measuring coverage and redundancy as the number of documents retrieved, n, varies.",
        "This is measured because a perfect engine will return the most useful documents first, followed by others; thus, coverage will be higher for that engine with low values of n.",
        "Once the performance of an IR configuration over a question set is known, it's possible to produce a simple report listing redundancy for each question.",
        "A performance reporting script accesses the",

        "Engines may use passage-or document-level configurations.",
        "Data on the performance of the three engines is described in Table 2.",
        "As can be seen, the coverage with passage-level retrieval (which was often favoured, as the AE component performs best with reduced amounts of text) languishes between 51% and 71%, depending on the measurement method.",
        "Failed anaphora resolution may contribute to this figure, though no deficiencies were found upon visual inspection.",
        "Not all documents containing answers are noted, only those checked by the NIST judges (Bilotti et al., 2004).",
        "Match judgements are incomplete, leading to the potential generation of false negatives, where a correct answer is found with complete supporting information, but as the information has not been manually flagged, the system will mark this as a failure.",
        "Assessment methods are fully detailed in Dang et al.",
        "(2006).",
        "Factoid performance is still relatively poor, although as only 1.95 documents match per question, this may be an effect of such false negatives (Voorhees and Buck-land, 2003).",
        "Work has been done into creating synthetic corpora that include exhaustive answer sets (Bilotti, 2004; Tellex et al., 2003; Lin and Katz, 2005), but for the sake of consistency, and easy comparison with both parallel work and prior local results, the TREC judgements will be used to evaluate systems in this paper.",

        "HEWs are often found in answer bearing texts, though these are hard to identify through simple TF-based RF.",

        "HEWs also provide an effective means of evaluating other RF methods, which can be developed into a generic rapid testing tool for query expansion techniques.",
        "TF-based RF, while finding some HEWs, is not effective at discovering extensions, and reduces overall IR performance.",
        "There was not a large performance change between engines and configurations.",
        "Strict paragraph-level coverage never topped 65%, leaving a significant number of questions where no useful information could be provided for AE.",
        "The original sets of difficult questions for individual engines were small - often less than the 35% suggested when looking at the coverage figures.",
        "Possible causes could include:",
        "Difficult questions being defined as those for which average redundancy is zero: This limit may be too low.",
        "To remedy this, we could increase the redundancy limit to specify an arbitrary number of difficult questions out of the whole set.",
        "The use of both strict and lenient measures: It is possible to get a lenient match (thus marking a question as non-difficult) when the answer text occurs out of context.",
        "Reducing n from 20 to 5 (Table 4) increased the number of difficult questions produced.",
        "From this we can hypothesise that although many search engines are succeeding in returning useful documents (where available), the distribution of these documents over the available ranks is not one that bunches high ranking documents up as those immediately retrieved (unlike a perfect engine; see Section 3.1), but rather suggests a more even distribution of such documents over the returned set.",
        "The number of candidate extension words for queries (even after filtering) is often in the range of hundreds to thousands.",
        "Each of these words creates a separate query, and there are two variations, depending on whether the target is included in the search terms or not.",
        "Thus, a large number of extended queries need to be executed for each question run.",
        "Passage-level retrieval returns less text, which has two advantages: firstly, it reduces the scope for false positives in lenient matching; secondly, it is easier to scan result by eye and determine why the engine selected a result.",
        "Proper nouns are often helpful as extensions.",
        "We noticed that these cropped up fairly regularly for some kinds of question (e.g. \"Who\").",
        "Especially useful were proper nouns associated with locations - for example, adding \"Pakistani\" to a query containing the word Pakistan lifted redundancy above zero for a question on President Musharraf, as in Table 9.",
