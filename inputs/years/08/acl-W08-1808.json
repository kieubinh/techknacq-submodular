        "The development of computational systems which can answer natural language questions using large text collections as knowledge sources is widely seen as both intellectually challenging and practically useful.",
        "To stimulate research and development in this area the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has organized a shared task evaluation as one track at the annual TExt Retrieval Conference (TREC) since 1999.",
        "These evaluations began by considering factoid-type questions only (e.g. How many calories are",
        "Â©2008.",
        "Some rights reserved.",
        "'http://tree.ni st.gov/",
        "there in a Big Mac?)",
        "each of which was asked in isolation to any of the others.",
        "However, in an effort to move the challenge towards a long term vision of interactive, dialogue-based question answering to support information analysts (Burger et al., 2002), the track introduced the notion of question targets and related question series in TREC2004 (Voorhees, 2005), and this approach to question presentation has remained central in each of the subsequent TRECs.",
        "In this simulated task, questions are grouped into series where each series has a target of a definition associated with it (see Figure 1).",
        "Each question in the series asks for some information about the target and there is a final \"other\" question which is to be interpreted as \"Provide any other interesting details about the target that has not already been asked for explicitly\".",
        "In this way \"each series is a (limited) abstraction of an information dialogue in which the user is trying to define the target.",
        "The target and earlier questions in a series provide the context for the current question.\"",
        "(Voorhees, 2005).",
        "One consequence of putting questions into series in this way is that questions may not make much sense when removed from the context their series provides.",
        "For example, the question When was he born?",
        "cannot be sensibly interpreted without knowledge of the antecedent of he provided by the context (target or prior questions).",
        "Interpreting questions in question series, therefore, becomes a critical component within a QA systems.",
        "Many QA systems have an initial document retrieval stage that takes the question and derives a query from it which is then passed to a search engine whose task is to retrieve candidate answering bearing documents for processing by the rest of the system.",
        "Clearly a question such as When was he born?",
        "is unlikely to retrieve documents relevant to answering a question about Kafka's date of birth if passed directly to a search engine.",
        "This problem can be addressed in a naive way by simply appending the target to every question.",
        "However, this has several disadvantages: (1) in some cases co-reference in a question series is to the answer of a previous question and not to the target, so blindly substituting the target is not appropriate; (2) some approaches to query formulation and to answer extraction from retrieved documents may require syntactically well-formed questions and may be able to take advantage of the extra information, such as syntactic dependencies, provided in a fully de-referenced, syntactically correct question.",
        "Thus, it is helpful in general if systems can automatically interpret a question in context so as to resolve co-references appropriately, and indeed most TREC QA systems do this to at least a limited extent as part of their question pre-processing.",
        "Ideally one would like a system to be able to reformulate a question as a human would if they were to reexpress the question so as to make it independent of the context of the preceding portion of the question series.",
        "To support the development of such systems it would useful if there were a collection of \"gold standard\" reformulated questions against which systems' outputs could be compared.",
        "However, to the best of our knowledge no such resource exists.",
        "In this paper we describe the creation of such a corpus of manually reformulated questions, measures we have investigated for comparing system generated reformulations against the gold standard, and experiments we have carried out comparing our TREC system's automatic question re-formulator against the gold standard and insights we have obtained therefrom."

        "Our aim was to take the questions in a TREC question series and re-express them as questions that would naturally be asked by a human asking them as a single, standalone question outside the context of the question series.",
        "Our intuition was that most adult native speakers would agree on a small number of variant forms these reformulated questions would take.",
        "We explored this intuition by having two persons iteratively reformulate some questions independently, compare results and evolve a small set of guidelines for the process.",
        "Ten question sets were randomly selected from sets available at http://trec.nist.",

        "At this point the reformulators' outputs were sufficiently close to each other and the guidelines sufficiently stable that, given limited resources, it was decided reformulation could proceed singly.",
        "Using the guidelines, therefore, a further 48 question sets from 2007 were reformulated, where this time each question set was only reformulated by a single person.",
        "Each question set contained between 5 and 7 individual questions therefore around 406 questions were reformulated, creating one or more gold standard forms for each question.",
        "In total there are approximately 448 individual reformulations, with a maximum number of 3 reformulations for any single question and a mean of 1.103 reformulations per question.",

        "To assess how close a system's reformulation of a question in a questions series is to the gold standard requires a measure of proximity.",
        "Whatever metric we adopt should have the property that reformulations that are closer to our gold standard reformulations get a higher score.",
        "The closest possible score is achieved by getting an identical string to that of the gold standard.",
        "Following conventional practice we will adopt a metric that gives us a value between 0 and 1, where 1 is highest (i.e. a score of 1 is achieved when the preprocessed reformulation and the gold standard are identical).",
        "Another requirement for the metric is that the ordering of the words in the reformulation is not as important as the content of the reformulation.",
        "We assume this because one key use for reformulated questions in the retrieval of candidate answer bearing documents and the presence of key content terms in a reformulation can help to find answers when it is used as a query, regardless of their order Ordering does still need to be taken into account by the metric but it should alter the score less than the content words in the reformulation.",
        "Related to this point, is that we would like reformulations that simply append the target onto the end of the original question to score more highly on average than the original questions on their own, since this is a default strategy followed by many systems that clearly helps in many cases.",
        "These requirement can help to guide metric selection.",
        "There are many different systems which attempt to measure string similarity.",
        "We considered a variety of tools like ROUGE (Lin, 2004) and METEOR (Lavie and Agarwal, 2007) but decided they were unsuitable for this task.",
        "ROUGE and METEOR were developed to compare larger stretches of text - they are usually used to compare paragraphs rather than sentences.",
        "We decided developing our own metric would be simpler than trying to adapt one of these existing tools.",
        "To explore candidate similarity measures we created a program which would take as input a list of reformulations to be assessed and a list of gold standard reformulations and compare them to each other using a selection of different string comparison metrics.",
        "To find out which of these metrics best scored reformulations in the way which we expected, we created a set of test reformulations to compare against the gold standard reformulations.",
        "Three test data sets were created: one where the reformulation was simply the original question, one where the reformulation included the target appended to the end, and one where the refor-mualation was identical to the gold standard.",
        "The idea here was that the without target question set should score less than the with target question set and the identical target question set should have a score of 1 (the highest possible score).",
        "We then had to choose a set of metrics to test and chose to use metrics from the SimMetrics library as it is an open source extensible library of string similarity and distance metrics .",
        "After running the three input files against the metrics we could see that certain metrics gave a score which matched our requirements more closely than others.",
        "Table 1 shows the metrics used and the mean scores across the data set for the different question sets.",
        "A description of each of these metrics can be found in the SimMetrics library.",
        "From these results we can see that certain metrics are not appropriate.",
        "SmithWaterman, Jaro and JaroWinkler all do the opposite to what we require them to do in that they score a reformulation without the target higher than one with the target.",
        "This could be due to overemphasis on word ordering.",
        "These metrics can therefore be discounted.",
        "Levenshtein, NeedlemanWunch and QGrams-Distance can also be discounted as the difference between With target and Without target is not large enough.",
        "It would be difficult to measure improvements in the system if the difference is this small.",
        "MongeElkan can also be discounted as overall its scores are too large and for this reason it would be difficult to measure improvements using it.",
        "Of the five remaining metrics - DiceSimilar-ity, JaccardSimilarity, BlockDistance, Euclidean-Distance and CosineSimilarity - we decided that we should discount EuclideanDistance as it had the smallest gap between with target and without target.",
        "We now look at the other four metrics in more detail:",
        "Block Distance metric is variously named block distance, LI distance or city block distance.",
        "It is a vector-based approach, where q and r are defined in n-dimensional vector space.",
        "The L\\ or block distance is calculated from summing the edge distances.",
        "This can be described in two dimensions with discrete-valued vectors.",
        "When we can picture the set of points within a grid, the distance value is simply the number of edges between points that must be traversed to get from q to r within the grid.",
        "This is the same problem as getting from corner a to b in a rectilinear street map, hence the name \"city-block metric\".",
        "This is based on Dice coefficient which is a term based similarity measure (0-1) whereby the similarity measure is defined as twice the number of terms common to compared entities divided by the total number of terms in both.",
        "A coefficient result of 1 indicates identical vectors while a 0 indicates orthogonal vectors.",
        "This is a token based vector space similarity measure like the cosine distance.",
        "Jaccard Similarity uses word sets from the comparison instances to evaluate similarity.",
        "The Jaccard measure penalizes a small number of shared entries (as a portion of all non-zero entries) more than the Dice coefficient.",
        "Each instance is represented as a Jaccard vector similarity function.",
        "The Jaccard similarity between two vectors X and Y is (X-Y)/(\\X\\\\Y\\ -(X-Y)) where (X â  Y) is the inner product of X and Y, and \\X\\ = {X â  X)/, i.e. the Euclidean norm of X.",
        "This can more easily be described as {\\X n Y\\)/{\\X U Y\\)",
        "This is a common vector based similarity measure similar to the Dice Coefficient.",
        "The input string is transformed into vector space so that the Euclidean cosine rule can be used to determine similarity.",
        "The cosine similarity is often paired with other approaches to limit the dimensionality of the problem.",
        "For instance with simple strings a list of stopwords is used to reduce the dimensionality of the comparison.",
        "In theory this problem has as many dimensions as terms exist.",
        "All four of these measures appear to value the content of the strings higher than ordering which is what we want our metric to do.",
        "However the scores are quite large, and as a result we considered refining the metrics to give scores that are not as close to 1.",
        "To do this we decided to try and increase the importance of ordering by also taking into account shared bigrams and trigrams.",
        "As we do not want ordering to be too important in our metric we introduced a weighting mechanism into the program to allow us to used a weighted combination of shared unigrams, bigrams and trigrams.",

        "Our system does do better than just adding the target on the end, and this difference is exaggerated (Table 8) when bigrams are taken into account, as expected since this weighting increases the metric's sensitivity to recognising our system's ability to put the target in the correct place.",
        "Mean scores across a data set tell part of the story, but to gain more insight we need to examine the distribution of scores and then, in order to improve the system, we need to look at questions which have a low score and work out what has gone wrong.",

        "Once again the low score has helped us to quickly identify a problem: the system is only interpreting pronouns as references to the target, which is clearly insufficient.",
        "Furthermore should the preprocessing system be altered to address a problem like this the gold system and scoring software can be used for regression testing to ensure no previously correct reformulations have been lost.",
        "Another example of a poor scoring reformulation is:",

        "For this example Jaccard gave our system reformulation a score of 0.61.",
        "The problem here is our system blindly expanded a substring of the target appearing in the question to the full target without recognizing that in this case the substring is not an abbreviated reference to the target (an event) but to an entity that figured in the event."
