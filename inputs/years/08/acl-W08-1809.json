        "Many textual QA systems use Information Retrieval to retrieve a subset of the documents/passages from the source corpus in order to reduce the amount of text that needs to be investigated in finding the correct answers.",
        "This use of Information Retrieval (IR) plays an important role, since it imposes an upper bound on the performance of the entire QA system: Subsequent answer extraction operations cannot make up for the failure of IR to fetch text that contains correct answers.",
        "Several techniques have been developed to cut down the amount of text that must be retrieved in order to ensure against the loss of answer material, but processing any text for downstream operations still takes up valuable on-line time.",

        "The answers to many factoid questions are named entities – eg, \"Who is the president of India?",
        "\", \"Where was Eric Clapton born?",
        "\", etc.",
        "The basic idea of this paper's central method, Topic Indexing and Retrieval for Question Answering (or TOQA subsequently), is to extract such expressions offline from a textual corpus as potential answers and gather evidence that supports their direct retrieval as answers to questions using off-the-shelf IR.",
        "Central here is the notion of topics.",
        "Under this method, any named entities (proper names) found in a corpus are regarded as potential answers.",
        "However, named entities are not just treated as words or phrases but as topics with three kinds of information useful for Question Answering.",
        "First, as a locus of information, a topic has textual content which talks about this topic.",
        "This comprises the set of all sentences from the corpus that mention this topic.",
        "Textual content is important because it provides the means to judge the topic's suitability as an answer to a question via textual similarity between the question and some part of the topic's textual content.",
        "Second, a topic has an ontological type (or types).",
        "This type information is very important for QA because the question requires the answer to be of certain type.",
        "A topic must be of the same type (or some compatible type via ISA relation) in order to be considered as an answer candidate.",
        "For example, the question, \"Who is the president of India?\"",
        "requires the answer to be of type PERSON (or more specifically, PRESIDENT).",
        "Finally, a topic has relations to other topics.",
        "For example, the topic, \"Dolly the sheep\", is closely related to the topic, \"Ian Wilmut\".",
        "While the precise nature of this relation may vary, the frequent co-occurence of two topics in sentences can be regarded as an evidence that the two are related.",
        "Related topics are useful for question answering because they reduce the search space.",
        "For example, the answer to the question, e.g. \"Who created Dolly the sheep?\"",
        "can be found among all the topics that are related to the topic contained in the question (or question topic), e.g. \"Dolly\" here.",
        "These three kinds of information are the base material for Question Answering using topics: they provide the means to directly retrieve answers to questions."

      "text": [
        "This section describes the technical details of how to collect these three kinds of information used for topic based QA, and how to process and store them off-line in order to enable fast and efficient online question answering.",
        "The stored material consists of (1) a Topic Repository, which stores topics with their variant names and ontological types, (2) a topic document collection that stores the textual content of topics, and (3) a set of indices created by indexing the topic document collection for fast and efficient retrieval.",
        "The Topic Repository stores topics, along their variant names and their ontological types, in hash tables for fast look-up.",
        "Building a topic repository requires identifying topics within the given corpus.",
        "For this we have used the C&C named entity recogniser (Curran and Clark, 2003), which is run on pos-tagged and chunked documents in the corpus to identify and extract named entities as potential topics.",
        "This also identifies the base type of a subset of named entities as PERSON, LOCATION and ORGANISATION.",
        "This is stored for later use in building type-separated indices.",
        "When a named entity is identified, we first check whether it represents a topic already found in the topic repository.",
        "This is done by checking the topic-name hash table in the repository, which serves as the main data storage for the variant names of topics.",
        "To resolve a target named entity to the appropriate topic, we use Wikipedia's Redirect table, which contains many common variant names for the same topic.",
        "The topic-name hash table is updated accordingly.",
        "Hash table entries consist of pairs like ('George Clooney', 1745442), where the name 'George Clooney' is one of the names that belong to the unique topic with the ID number of 1745442.",
        "We currently do nothing to disambiguate topics, so different individuals with the same name will all be considered the same topic.",
        "Fine-grained ontological types of topics are identified and stored as well in a separate topic-type table.",
        "In order to discover fine-grained topic types, the ontology database Yago is used (Suchanek et al., 2007).",
        "Yago contains such information for Wikipedia topics, derived by mapping the category information about target topic supplied by a Wikipedia user to the appropriate Word-Net concept.",
        "(Wikipedia categories are not consistent and uniform, and they are more like tags that characterise a topic rather than strictly classify it.)",
        "Using this ontology to look up the type(s) of each topic-type (i.e. the corresponding WordNet concept) and by tracing up the WordNet concept hierarchy, we created a fine-grained, multilevel (with respect to ISA) topic-type hash table for all the topics in the topic repository.",
        "The topic-type hash table not only contains the ontological type of a topic, but also a significant amount of world knowledge typically associated to the topic, due to the nature of Wikipedia categories as descriptive tags.",
        "For example, 'Bill Gates' is identified as 'CEO' (a title-role), and 'Pusan' as 'a province of Korea' (geographical knowledge).",
        "Such diverse and significant knowledge, as well as the breadth and the depth of the fine types contained in the topic-type hash table, enable a very powerful match between the answer type from a question to that of a candidate topic.",
        "The set of fine-grained answer types used here differs from the set of answer types such as Li and Roth (2002) used elsewhere in that the set is open-ended, and new types can be added for an entity at any time.",
        "The topic repository is used in re-ranking answer candidates by the fine-grained anwer type and for question topic identification, as well as in building topic document collection to be explained next.",
        "As noted, the textual content of a topic is the set of all sentences in a corpus that mentions this topic.",
        "(Since anaphora resolution is not yet performed, the sentences that only mention a particular topic anaphorically are missed.)",
        "Such set of sentences is assembled into one file per topic.",
        "This can then be regarded as a document on its own with the topic name as its title.",
        "We henceforth call such a document, a topic document.",
        "Figure 1 illustrates a topic document for the topic, Dolly the sheep.",
        "The topic document collection thus created for all topics identified can be regarded as a reorganised corpus with respect to the original corpus as the Figure ??",
        "illustrates.",
        "The topic document collection for the full set of topics is a subset of the original corpus, reorganized around topics.",
        "The process of creating the topic document collection (which we refer to as the topic document method) is actually performed at the same time as the creation of Topic Repository.",
        "Any sentence that contains identifiable topics is appended to the topic document of each topic it contains.",
        "The topic document collection so created is central to our Question Answering because retrieving a topic document (specifically, its topic) equates to generating an answer candidate for a given question.",
        "Hence, via topic documents, finegrained IR can be used to retrieve answers directly.",
        "In order to facilitate such retrieval, however, a topic document collection needs to be indexed.",
        "In our implemented system (described in Section 5), this is done using the indexing module of the Lemur Toolkit.",
        "For type specific retrieval, three separate indices corresponding to PERSON, LO-",
        "CATION and ORGANISATION are created according to the base types of the topics identified at the time of Named Entity Recognition.",
        "In addition, an index for all topic documents regardless of types, TOTAL, is also created for questions from which the answer type cannot be determined or for which their answer types differ from the three base types.",
        "Of note here is that separate indices are created only for these base types, as we have not explored separate indexing by fine-grained answer types.",
        "These fine-types are only used for reranking after the candidate topics have been retrieved from the base indices.",

        "Thus, the first necessary operation is Question Analysis.",
        "Question Analysis identifies the question type (eg, definition question, factoid question, list question, etc); the answer type, and the question topics (if any) and produces a shallow parse of the question text (pos-tagged and chunked) for query formulation.",
        "(Identifying the question type is a formality since the method only deals with factoid questions.)",
        "The question topic identification is straightforward: Any proper name present in a particular question is a question topic.",
        "For answer type identification, we use a simple rule based algorithm that looks at the WH-word (e.g. \"Where\" means location), the head noun of a WH-phrase with \"Which\" or \"What\" (e.g. \"Which president\" means the answer type is of president), and if the main verb is a copula, the head of the post-copula noun phrase (e.g. for \"Who is the president ..\", here again \"president\" is the answer type.)",
        "Word-Net is used to identify the base type of the answer type identified from the question when it is not one of the base types (PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANISATION).",
        "For example, \"president\" is traced to its base type, \"PERSON\".",
        "Next is the retrieval of topics as answer candidates for a given question.",

        "For example, for the question, \"Who is the president of Germany?",
        "\", the answer type is identified as 'president'.",
        "But since the answer type, 'president', is not the base type, WordNet is used to trace from 'president' to a base type (PERSON) and the corresponding index is selected (because separate indices exist only for base types).",
        "If none of the three base types is found by this process, the total index is used.",
        "Retrieval uses the InQuery retrieval system within the Lemur Tool Kit (Ogilvie and Callan, 2002).",
        "InQuery supports a powerful and flexible structured query language.",
        "Taking advantage of this, a structured query is formulated from the target question.",
        "So for example, the parsed form of the question, \"Who is the president of Germany?\"",
        "is used to generate the following query \\sum(is president of germany \\phrase(president of germany)).",
        "In this example, \"president of germany\" forms a phrase, and it is inserted as part of the query element with the '\\phrase' operator.",
        "However, the individual keywords are also included as bag of words since we have found it to give better performance in the trials that we have run.",
        "The overall operator is then enclosed by the '\\sum' operator that gives the overall score of the query with respect to a document.",

        "An example of a bi-topic document is the following Figure 2, which represents the two topics (Dolly, Ian Wilmut).",
        "Such a bi-topic document represents the general relation between two topics via the context in which they co-occur.",
        "(As already noted, the precise character of the relation is ignored.)",
        "The terms that more frequently appear in such document characterise the relation between the two topics in statistical fashion, and this document would be given a higher score for retrieval with respect to a question, if the question contains such a relatively frequently appearing term.",
        "For example, in scoring the bi-topic document pertaining to (Dolly, Ian Wilmut) bi-topic document with respect to the question, \"Who created the first cloned sheep, Dolly?",
        "\", the frequently appearing term in the document, 'cloned' would give a very high mark for this document with respect to this question.",
        "We construct a bi-topic document collection is a recursive application of the topic document method first on the original documents and then to the resulting topic documents.",
        "So given a single topic document, e.g. for \"Dolly\", the same topic document generating process is then applied to this document.",
        "This generates a new set of topic documents that, in addition to having their own topics, e.g. \"Ian Wilmut\", will also contain the topic \"Dolly\" since the original topic document has the topic \"Dolly\" in its every sentence.",
        "The resulting bi-topic documents would comprise (Dolly, Ian Wilmut), (Dolly, Bonnie), (Dolly, Roslin), etc., all as bi-topic documents.",
        "These topic documents all concern the topic \"Dolly\", which we call the anchor topic, and indexing these amounts to creating a \"Dolly\" (anchored) index.",
        "Separate indices for base types as in the case of the single topic documents need not be created since the number of bi-topic documents anchored to one topic is some magnitude smaller compared to the number of total single topic documents.",
        "QA using a bi-topic document index is essentially the same as for the single topic document index, except in selecting the appropriate anchored index using the question topic identified from the question.",
        "So the \"Dolly\" index is chosen if the question topic is \"Dolly\", as in the question, e.g. \"Who created the fist cloned sheep, Dolly?\".",
        "Re-ranking based on fine-grained answer types can still be performed although question topic filtering is no longer necessary.",
        "This bi-topic method has the drawback of generating a lot of documents and corresponding indices since the number of bi-topic documents is the product of the number of topics with all the associated topics.",
        "This takes a lot of space for storage and time for generating such a collection.",
        "For the evaluation to be described in the next section, we have created bi-topic documents and indices that only pertain to questions (ie only for the question topics within the test set) due to the limitation of space.",
        "To be able to scale this method generally, XML information retrieval technique might be applicable as this supports richer retrieval elements other than whole documents and therefore the bi-topic documents pertaining to one anchor topic could be all embedded within one topic document.",

        "In predictive annotation (Prager et al., 1999), the text of the target corpus is preprocessed in such a way that phrases that are potential answers are marked and annotated with respect to their answer types (or QA-tokens as they call them) including PERSONS, DURATIONS, etc.",
        "Then the text is indexed not only with ordinary terms but also with these QA-tokens as indexing elements.",
        "The main advantage of this approach is that QA-tokens are used as part of the query enhancing the passage retrieval performance.",

        "For every potential answer in the corpus, a set of text spans up to three sentences long (the sentence in which it appears, plus whatever following sentences that are linked to this sentence via lexical chain totalling no more than three sentences in size) is stored and later sued to retrieve a potential answer.",
        "Although similar to our work, the main difference is in the way the textual evidence is aggregated.",
        "In Topic Indexing and Retrieval, all the evidence (aka textual content) available throughout the corpus for a possible answer is aggregated, whereas Kim uses text spans up three sentences long from a single document connected by a co-reference chain for each answer candidate.",
