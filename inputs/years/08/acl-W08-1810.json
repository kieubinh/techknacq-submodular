        "In this paper we confirm the intuition that SRL at indexing stage improves the performance of QA and propose a simplified technique named the Question Prediction Language Model (QPLM), which provides similar information with a much lower cost.",

        "Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) has been implemented or suggested as a means to aid several Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as information extraction (Kogan et al., 2005), multi-document summarization (Barzilay et al., 1999) and machine translation (Quantz and Schmitz, 1994).",
        "Question Answering (QA) is one task that takes advantage of SRL, and in fact much of the research about the application of SRL to NLP is related to QA.",
        "Thus, Narayanan and Harabagiu (2004) apply the argument-predicate relationship from PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) together with the semantic frames from FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) to create an inference mechanism to improve QA.",

        "Shen and La-pata (2007) developed an answer extraction module that incorporates FrameNet style semantic role information.",
        "They deal with the semantic role assignment as a optimization problem in a bipartite graph and the answer extraction as a graph matching over the semantic relations.",
        "Most of the studies that use SRL or similar techniques to QA apply semantic relation tools on the input or output of the Information Retrieval phase of their system.",
        "Our paper investigates the use of semantic information for indexing documents.",
        "Our hypothesis is that allowing Semantic Role information at the indexing stage the question analyzer and subsequent stages of the QA system can obtain higher accuracy by providing an implicit query analyzer as well as more precise retrieval.",
        "Theoretically, the inclusion of this information at indexing time can also speed up the overall QA process since syntactic rephrasing or re-ranking of documents based on semantic roles would not be necessary.",
        "However, SRL techniques are still highly complex and they demand a computational power that is not yet available to most research groups when working with large corpora.",
        "In our experience the annotation of a 3GB corpus, such as the AQUAINT (Graff, 2002), using a semantic role labeler, for instance SwiRL from Surdeanu and Turmo (2005) can take more than one year using a standard PC configuration.",
        "In order to efficiently process a corpus with semantic relations, we have developed an alternative annotation strategy based on word-to-word relations instead of noun phrase-to-predicate relations.",
        "We define semantic triples based on syntactic clues; this approach was also studied by Litkowski (1999) but some major differences with our work are that we use automatically learned rules to generate the semantic relations, and that we use different semantic labels than those defined by Litkowski, some more specific and some more general.",
        "Our annotation scheme is named the Question Prediction Language Model (QPLM) and represents relations between pairs of words using labels such as Who and When, according to how one word complements the other.",
        "In the following section we provide an overview of the proposed semantic annotation module.",
        "Then in Section 3 we detail the information retrieval framework used that allows the indexing and retrieval of semantic information.",

        "QPLM, as described in Pizzato and Molla (2007), represents sentences by specifying the semantic relationship among its components using question words.",
        "In this way, we focus on dividing the problem of representing a large sentence into small questions that could be asked about its components.",
        "QPLM is expressed by triples 9(uo) – > a where 6 is a question word, uj is the word that concerns the question word 6 and a is the word that answers the relation 6 about uj.",
        "For instance the relation Who(eat) – > Jack tells us that the person who eats is Jack.",
        "The representation of our semantic relations as triples 9(uo) – > a is important because it allows the representation of sentences as directed graphs of semantic relations.",
        "This representation has the capacity of generating questions about the sentence being analyzed.",
        "Figure 1 shows such a representation of the sentence: \"John asked that a flag be placed in every school\".",
        "Having the sentence of Figure 1 and removing a possible answer a from any relation triple, it is possible to formulate a complete question about this sentence that would require a as an answer.",
        "For instance, we can observe that removing the node John we obtain the question \"Who asked for a flag to be placed in every school?\"",
        "where Who was extracted from the triple Who(ask) – > John.",
        "The same is valid for other relations, such as removing the word school to obtain the question \"Where did John ask for a flag to be placed?\".",
        "The name Question Prediction for this model is due to its capability of generating questions regarding the sentence that has been modeled.",
        "We have developed a process to automatically annotate QPLM information, the process is rule based where the rules are automatically learned from a corpus obtained from mapping PropBank into QPLM instances.",
        "The mapping between semantic roles and QPLM is not one-to-one, which reduces the accuracy of the training corpus.",
        "A sample of 40 randomly selected documents was manually evaluated showing that nearly 90% of the QPLM triples obtained were correctly converted from the PropBank mapping.",
        "PropBank does not give us some relations that we wish to include such as ownership (Whose(car) – > Maria) or quantity (HowMany (country ) – > twenty)), but it does give us the benefits of a large training set covering a variety of different predicates.",
        "Our QPLM annotation tool, like most SRL tools, makes use of a syntactic parser and a named-entity (NE) recognizer.",
        "We are currently using Connexor for syntactic parsing and LingPipe for named-entity recognition.",
        "An evaluation of our QPLM annotation has shown a reasonable precision (50%) with a low recall (24%).",
        "Both precision and recall seem to be connected with the choice of training corpus.",
        "The high precision is influenced by the large training set and the different variety of predicates.",
        "The low recall is due to the low amount of connections that can be mapped from one sentence in Prop-Bank to QPLM.",

        "The task of IR requires fast indexing and retrieval of information regardless of the amount of data stored and how it is going to be retrieved.",

        "In the semantic role/QPLM case it is important to develop an indexing structure that can maintain the annotation information.",

        "Because of their lower frequency, it is expected that the components of FR-V and, in a lesser extent, of PR-V to have a stronger impact on the calculation of similarity than the components of BoW-V. With this approach, for queries with relations that are not indexed, the method is equivalent to a traditional BoW approach."

        "The retrieval experiments were carried out using only a reduced set of documents from the AQUAINT corpus because the semantic role labelers tested were not able to parse the full set, unlike QPLM which parsed all documents successfully.",
        "The SRL tool SwiRL (Surdeanu and Turmo, 2005) has a good precision and coverage, however it is slow and quite unstable when parsing large amounts of data.",
        "We have assembled a cluster of computers in order to speed up the corpus annotation, but even when having around ten dedicated computers the estimated completion time was larger than one year.",
        "The lack of semantic annotators that can quickly evaluate large amount of data gave us the stimulus needed to use a simplified and quicker technique.",
        "We used the QPLM annotation tool which takes less than 3 weeks to fully annotate the 3GB of data from the AQUAINT corpus using a single machine.",
        "Since we wanted to determinate how QPLM compares to SRL, particularly on the basis of its usage for IR and for QA, we performed some tests using the available amount of data annotated with semantic roles, and the same documents with QPLM.",
        "The part of the AQUAINT corpus annotated includes the first 41,116 documents, in chronological order, from the New York Times (NYT) newspaper.",
        "We used the 1,448 questions from the QA track of 2004, 2005 and 2006 from the TREC competition.",
        "Since these questions are not always self contained and in some cases (OTHER-type questions) not even a proper natural language sentence, we performed some question modification so that the entire topic text could be included.",
        "These modifications include substitution of key pronouns as well as the inclusion of the whole topic text when shorter representations were found.",
        "In some extreme cases when no substitution was possible and the question did not mention the topic, we added a phrase containing the topic at the start of the question.",
        "Some examples are presented in Figure 5.",
        "Using these questions as queries for our IR framework, we retrieved a set of 50 documents for every question.",
        "We analyzed the impact of the semantic annotation when used on document indices by checking the presence of the answer string in the documents returned.",
        "We also obtained a list of 50 documents using solely the BoW approach in order to compare what is the gain over standard retrieval.",
        "Table 1 presents the results of the retrieval set using TREC's QA track from 2004, 2005 and 2006 using the BoW, the SRL and the QPLM approaches.",
        "Because we performed the evaluation of these documents automatically, we consider a document relevant on the only basis of the presence of the required answer string.",
        "We adopted the evaluation metrics for QA documents sets proposed by Roberts and Gaizauskas (2004).",
        "We used the following metrics: p@n as the precision at n documents or percentage of documents containing an answer when retrieving at most n documents; c@n as the coverage at n documents or percentage of questions that can be answered using up to n documents for each question; and r@n as the redundancy at n document or the average number of answers found in the first n documents per question.",
        "As observed in Table 1, the SRL approach gives the best results for all question sets on all evaluation metrics, with the exception of c@50 on the 2006 question set.",
        "In most other retrieval sets the baseline performs worse than both QPLM and SRL, however for 2004 questions it performed better than QPLM on p@50 and r@50.",
        "It is interesting to observe that the QPLM results for the same year on c@50 are better than the BoW approach indicating that a larger amount of questions can potentially be answered by QPLM.",

        "Because of the high dependency on Web sources, the MetaQA system performed rather poorly.",
        "As explained earlier, the results were measured using C@10 instead of C@l. The reason for this is that the MetaQA system is meant to be an aggregator of information sources and its ranking mechanisms only work when sufficient evidence is given for certain entities.",
        "Not only was the system not designed for the single-source setup, but it was not designed to provide a single answer.",
        "Nevertheless, even with the nonconformity of the system, it appears to support that semantic markup can enhance the IR results for QA.",
        "Not surprisingly the extra redundancy presented in the 2004 BoW retrieval contributed to better results in this redundancy based QA system.",

        "In this work we propose the use of semantic relation in QA.",
        "We also present QPLM as an alternative to SRL.",
        "QPLM is a simpler approach to semantic annotation based on relations between pairs of words, which gives a large advantage in speed performance over SRL.",
        "We show some comparison of retrieval sets using the questions from the QA track of TREC and conclude that SRL and QPLM improve the quality of the retrieval set over a standard BoW approach.",
        "From these results we also observe that QPLM performance does not fall much behind SRL.",
        "We performed an evaluation using four QA systems.",
        "These systems are conceptually different which gives a broad perspective of the obtained results.",
        "The results once again show the effectiveness of semantic annotation.",
        "Over QA, SRL has performed better than the other techniques, but was closely followed by QPLM.",
        "The results obtained here suggest that QPLM is a cheaper and effective method of semantic annotation that can help in tuning the search component of a QA system to find the correct answers for a question.",
        "The results presented in this work for all QA systems are much lower than those reported in the literature.",
        "This is an undesirable but expected problem that occurred not only because of the modifications carried on the QA systems but mainly because of the reduced number of documents used for this evaluation.",
        "We are looking into more efficient alternatives for performing the SRL annotation of the AQUAINT corpus.",
        "Only recently we have been able to test Koomen et al.",
        "(2005) SRL tool.",
        "This SRL tool is the top ranking SRL tool at the CoNLL-2005 Shared Task Evaluation and it seems to be much faster than SwiRL.",
        "Preliminary tests suggest that it is able to perform the annotation of AQUAINT in almost one full year using a single computer; however, this tool, like SwiRL, is not very stable, crashing several times during the experiments.",
        "As further work, we plan to employ several computers and attempt to parse the whole AQUAINT corpus with this tool.",
        "It is important to point out that although the tool of Koomen et al.",
        "seems much faster than SwiRL, QPLM still outperforms both of them on speed by large.",
        "QPLM represents word relations that are built using rules from syntactic and NE information.",
        "This simpler representation, combined with a smaller number of supporting NLP tools, allow QPLM to be faster than current SRL tools.",
        "We plan to carry out further work on the QPLM tool to increase its performance on both speed and accuracy.",
        "QPLM's precision and recall figures are going to be improved by using a hand annotated corpus.",
        "QPLM's speed suggest that it can be currently used on IR tools as a preprocessing engine.",
        "It is understandable that any delay in the IR phases is undesirable when dealing with large amount of data, therefore optimizing the speed of QPLM is one of our priorities.",
