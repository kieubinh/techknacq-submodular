        "ProPOSEL (Brierley and Atwell, 2008) is a prosody and part-of-speech (PoS) English lexicon which merges information from respected electronic dictionaries and databases, and which is purpose-built for linkage with corpora; for populating tokenized corpus text with a priori linguistic knowledge; for machine learning tasks which involve the prosodic-syntactic chunking of text; and for open source distribution with NLTK - the Python-based Natural Language Toolkit (Bird et al., 2007a).",

        "A pronunciation lexicon like ProPOSEL is an integral part of the front-end natural language processing (NLP) module in a generic text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis system and constitutes a natural way of giving such a system phonetic, prosodic and morpho-syntactic insights into input text.",
        "For English, three such resources, originally developed for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and listing words and their phonetic transcriptions, are widely used: CELEX-2 (Baayen et al., 1996); PRONLEX (Kingsbury et al., 1997); and CMU, the Carnegie-Mellon Pronouncing Dictionary (Carnegie-Mellon University, 1998).",
        "The latter is used in Edinburgh's state of the art Festival speech synthesis system (Black et al., 1999) and is included as one of the datasets in",
        "NLTK.",
        "The starting point for ProPOSEL is CUVPlus(Pedler, 2002), a computer-usable and human-readable dictionary of inflected forms which uniquely identifies word class for each entry via C5 PoS tags, the syntactic annotation scheme used in the BNC or British National Corpus (Burnard, 2000).",
        "CUVPlus is an updated version of CUV2 (Mitton, 1992), an electronic dictionary in accessible text file format which in turn derives from the traditional paper-based Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary of Current English (Hornby, 1974).",
        "Recently, lexica for thirteen world languages, including US-English, have been created via the European-funded LC-STAR project (Hartinkainen et al., 2003) to address the shortage of language resources in the form of wide coverage lexica with detailed morpho-syntactic information that meet the needs of ASR, TTS and speech-to-speech translation (SST) applications.",
        "The incorporation of C5 PoStags in CUVPlus provides this kind of detail and distinguishes this lexicon from other paper-based and electronic English dictionaries, including",
        "CELEX-2, PRONLEX and CMU; it also facilitates linkage with machine-readable corpora like the BNC.",
        "However, CUVPlus entries compact PoS variants for a given word form into a single field as in the following example where burning is classified as an adjective, a present participle and a noun in Table 1:",
        "An early operation during ProPOSEL build was therefore to introduce one-to-one mappings of word form to word class, as defined by C5, to facilitate their use as compound lookup keys when the lexicon is transformed into a Python dictionary or associative array (§4).",
        "2 ProPOSEL: a repository of phonetic, syntactic and prosodic concepts",
        "The current revised version of ProPOSEL is a text file of 104049 separate entries, each comprising 15 pipe-separated fields arranged as follows:",
        "(1) word form; (2) BNC C5 tag; (3) CUV2 capitalisation flag alert for word forms which start with a capital letter; (4) SAM-PA phonetic transcription; (5) CUV2 tag and frequency rating; (6) C5 tag and BNC frequency rating; (7) syllable count; (8) lexical stress pattern; (9) Penn Treebank tag(s); (10) default content or function word tag; (11) LOB tag(s); (12) C7 tag(s); (13) DISC stressed and syllabified phonetic transcription; (14) stressed and unstressed values mapped to DISC syllable transcriptions; (15) consonant-vowel [CV] pattern.",
        "Table 2 shows an example entry showing all fields; subsequent illustrative examples include only a subset of fields.",
        "For an explanation of fields 3 to 7, the reader is referred to Pedler (2002) and Mitton (1992).",
        "A full account of Pro-POSEL build is planned for a subsequent paper, where phonology fields in source lexica (CU-",
        "VPlus, CELEX-2 and CMU) and new phonology fields in the prosody and PoS English lexicon will be discussed in detail.",
        "The rationale for fields displaying syllable count, lexical stress pattern and CFP status is summarised here in section 3.",
        "Four major PoS tagging schemes have been included in ProPOSEL to facilitate linkage with several widely used speech corpora: C5 (field 2) with the BNC as mentioned; Penn Treebank",
        "LOB (Johansson et al., 1986) (field 11) with MARSEC (Roach et al., 1993); and C7 (field 12) with the 2 million-word BNC Sampler Corpus.",
        "The lookup mechanism described in section 4 where a match is sought between (token, tag) tuples in incoming corpus text and ProPOSEL's compound dictionary keys, also in the form of (token, tag) tuples, is possible for all four syntactic annotation schemes represented in the lexicon.",
        "3 Accessing the lexicon through sound, syllables and rhythmic structure",
        "One field of particular significance for Pro-POSEL's target application of prosodic phrase break prediction (§3) is field (8) for lexical stress patterns, symbolic representations of the rhythmic structure of word forms via a string of numbers.",
        "Thus the pattern for the word form ,objec'tivity - with secondary stress on the first syllable and primary stress on the third syllable is 2 0100.",
        "For some homographs, this lexical stress pattern can fluctuate depending on part-of-speech category and meaning.",
        "The wordform present is a case in point, as demonstrated by fields 1, 2, 4, 7, 8 and 10 for all its entries in ProPOSEL shown in Table 3:",
        "Two well established phonetic transcription schemes are also represented in ProPOSEL: the original SAM-PA transcriptions in field 4 and DISC stressed and syllabified transcriptions in fields 13 and 14 which, unlike SAM-PA and the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), use a single character to represent dipthongs: /p8R/ for pair, for example.",

        "As previously stated, the rationale for ProPOSEL was to integrate information from different dictionaries and databases into one lexicon, customised for language engineering tasks which involve the prosodic-syntactic chunking of text.",
        "One such task is automated phrase break prediction: the classification of junctures (whitespaces) between words in the input text as either breaks (the minority class) or non-breaks.",
        "Typically, the machine learner is trained on PoS-tagged and boundary-annotated text - the speech corpus or gold standard - and then tested on an unseen reference dataset, minus the boundary tags, from the same corpus.",
        "Finally, it is evaluated by counting how many of the original boundary locations have been recaptured or predicted by the model.",
        "Phrase break classifiers have been trained on additional text-based features besides PoS tags.",
        "The CFP status of a token - is it a content word (e.g. nouns or adjectives) or function word (e.g. prepositions or articles) or punctuation mark?",
        "-has proved to be a very effective attribute in both deterministic and probabilistic models (Liberman and Church, 1992; Busser et al., 2001) and therefore, a default content-word/function-word tag is assigned to each entry in ProPOSEL in field (10).",
        "It is anticipated that further research will suggest modifications to this default status when the CFP attribute interacts with other text-based features.",
        "Syllable counts - field (7) in ProPOSEL - have already been used successfully in phrase break models for English (Atterer and Klein, 2002).",
        "However, they assume uniformity in terms of duration of syllables whereas we know that in connected speech, an indefinite number of unstressed syllables are packed into the gap between one stress pulse (Mortimer, 1985) and another, English being a stress-timed language.",
        "A lexical stress pattern, where syllables are weighted 0, 1 or 2, has therefore been included in fields (8) and (14) for entries in ProPOSEL because of its potential as a classificatory feature in the machine learning task of phrase break prediction.",
        "The thematic programme for PASCAL in 2008 focuses on approaches to supplementing raw training data (e.g. the speech corpus) with a priori knowledge (e.g. the lexicon) to improve performance in machine learning.",
