        "Many lexicographers recognise users need dictionaries to look for a word that has escaped their memory although they remember the concept.",
        "From a semantic point of view, Baldinger (1980) takes user needs into account and thus distinguishes dictionaries that serve as aids in encoding from those that help with decoding.",
        "The best known dictionaries of this type allow users to find the meaning of a word they already know.",
        "Such dictionaries are semasiological: they associate meanings with expressions/words, i.e. within entries we move from word to meaning.",
        "© 2008.",
        "Some rights reserved.",
        "The second kind of dictionary helps those users who have an idea to convey and want to find a word to designate it.",
        "Such dictionaries are ono-masiological: they connect names to concepts, i.e. within entries we move from meaning or concept to name or word.",
        "Sierra (2000) confirmed the well known observation that the organisation of the world varies from author to author, by contrasting some recognized onomasiological dictionaries, such as Roget's Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases (1852), Bernstein's Reverse Dictionary (1975), and WordNet (Miller et al., 2008).",
        "In order to build a system that maps natural language descriptions of concepts to the terms corresponding to those concepts, Sierra and McNaught (2000) outlined the design of an Onomasiological Search System.",
        "They described the principles of the system, whereas the architecture and its components are presented as part of the design.",
        "This also includes an idealised user interface, with a discussion of the organisation of the probable terms and additional information that can help the user to identify precisely the term he is looking for.",
        "As cognitive issues for the design of such system, this paper attempts to present the conceptualisation people engage in, in order to arrive at a word from its meaning.",
        "In this sense, it breaks the traditional lexicographic assumption that one should utilise a semasiological approach to provide formal representations to describe the meaning of a word.",
        "In contrast, in the onomasiological approach, the user can formulate a concept in several ways and use a variety of words in order to find a particular word.",
        "Our starting point is to understand what conceptualisation is (section 2), and the process of designation (section 3).",
        "To validate our approach in practice, section 4 presents the results of an experiment, which is compared with other studies on conceptual analysis.",
        "Finally, the conclusions are stated."

        "The concept is a mental representation of an object which is formed in the mind of individuals through a process of abstraction.",
        "We call this process of constructing an internal representation of external things a conceptualisation.",
        "Conceptualisation is a mental activity of grouping the data of common properties according to external factors, and then concepts are internalised and form part of each individual's knowledge.",
        "The terms property, characteristic or feature have been used for the knowledge necessary to describe and classify a concept.",
        "The identification of properties is crucial to concept analysis since it helps to define concepts and identify their interrelationships.",
        "According to Sager (1990) some properties are necessary and sufficient to distinguish a concept from any other, and these properties reflect the essential characteristics of a concept.",
        "Conversely, other properties are inessential, merely observable in an individual thing, so that they are accidental, may change with time and may not even be necessarily true in a scientific sense (Petofi, 1982).",
        "The dichotomy of these two opposing types of properties has been discussed from a psycholinguistic point of view.",
        "Aitchison (1994) does not consider that it is obvious that experts and ordinary people distinguish between essential and inessential characteristics.",
        "Despite the fact that experts might be able to specify the true nature of things, they sometimes provide information which is irrelevant to the mental lexicon.",
        "Conversely, ordinary people disagree and change their minds.",
        "As the comparative analysis in section 4 shows, the essential characteristics are not necessarily present in the mental lexicon of a person; each one describes different properties.",
        "Nevertheless, even a description of the inessential characteristics, given together, provides enough information to identify the term (Wierzbicka, 1985).",
        "People acquire knowledge about things on the basis of cultural, geographical and social factors.",
        "The environment conditions the conceptualisation of reality and the use of language.",
        "In order to communicate effectively, people will try to use language in a similar way to that of the collective view of the community, in agreement with the social norm.",
        "In fact, because of the social norm, there is an idealised knowledge structure which makes it possible to use the same names for the same things.",
        "In the contrary case, when the designation of a concept is outside that norm, people assume that the individual's knowledge is wrong.",
        "However, as we will see in the final analysis, we must accept that an individual's knowledge cannot cover the whole knowledge of the community norm.",
        "Reality goes beyond the perception of individuals.",
        "Our knowledge about reality has increased throughout human history.",
        "No one -human, computer or even the biggest library-possesses the whole knowledge about reality.",
        "The knowledge structure of things varies from one person to the other, so that their description of concepts will be different.",
        "As Fugman (1993) states, since the number of properties is virtually unlimited, people concentrate on those characteristics which appear essential, according to their personal or professional view.",
        "As an example, he points out the different essential properties for the concept \"benzene\" given by a physicist, a biologist, an engineer, a fire-fighter and a chemist.",
        "Even the same person can demonstrate different conceptualisations of simple things, such as \"dog\" or \"apple\", depending on the contextual situation.",

        "Designation is the identification of a term for a concept and the result is a word.",
        "To retrieve a term, one can use a terminological definition, which provides the information necessary to identify and differentiate a concept within a system of concepts, so that it sometimes comprises encyclopaedic information, not usually necessary in a lexicographic definition.",
        "Just as a word may have many meanings (semasiological approach), a concept, which is described by a set of properties, may be designated by more than one word (onomasiological approach).",
        "Within the onomasiological approach, all the properties together provide the necessary and sufficient information to identify the concept.",
        "However, since the description of concepts in natural language does not incorporate all knowledge or ideas associated with each concept, it can happen that the projection of a concept, i.e., the query formulation of the user, will retrieve a set of terms.",
        "For example, the concept \"strong winds\", consisting of two properties, can retrieve, in the domain of weather terminology, a variety of terms, such as: \"gale\", \"tornado\", \"hurricane\", \"typhoon\", etc.",
        "The concept a user has in mind when looking for a target word is expressed by a sentence.",
        "When a person hears this sentence, he translates each word into his own language and easily identifies the context.",

        "From the context, at the same time, he may differentiate whether the word \"air\" refers to the atmosphere or the air of a tyre.",
        "Equally, either the lack or change of any one property may result in the identification of a different concept.",

        "• A device to measure air pressure.",

        "Although a small group is unrepresentative for any generalisation to be made from a statistical point of view, it has been sufficient for our purpose to demonstrate that the conceptualisation used by a random set of students is far from the definitions found in a dictionary.",
        "From two sets of five words, each student was asked to take a set and write on a blank sheet of paper, similar to an onomasiological search, a concept, a definition or the ideas suggested to them by each word.",
        "After interchanging the sheets, the other students participating in the experiment wrote the word or words designating the concepts identified or written on the blank sheets by the previous student.",

        "• Set A: water, squirrel, bench, euthanasia, hurricane.",
        "• Set B: lemon, bucket, clothing, monopoly, barometer.",
        "The general words were chosen because they permit us, as can be observed from the following sections, to compare the results with the words analysed by other researchers as well.",
        "We will next introduce our definitions by comparing with four studies on conceptualisation.",
        "Putnam (1975) proposes the representation of the meaning of a word as a finite sequence of at least four properties:",
        "The syntactic markers, which are the category-indicators used in a host of contexts to classify words.",
        "The semantic markers, which are the most central properties, form part of a widely used classification system and very may be affected by any change in the knowledge about the thing.",
        "A description of the features of the stereotype, which is a conventional idea of what the object looks like or acts like or is, regardless whether it is true or not for all the objects.",
        "For example, \"yellow\" is a stereotype of \"gold\", even when gold is white by nature.",
        "A description of the extension, i.e., the set of things of which a term is true.",
        "The extension is determined socially depending upon the nature of the particular things, rather than on the concept of the individual speaker.",
        "The first three properties belong to the individual competence of speakers.",
        "The extension does not necessarily have to be known to every member of a linguistic community.",
        "According to Petofi (1982), the semantic markers and the stereotype may be compared with Ullman's concept of meaning.",
        "From the perspective of the lexicographic definition, they resemble genus and differentia, respectively.",
        "The description of the meaning of \"water\", as a particular natural kind, following these components, is given in table 1.",
        "In order to permit comparison of the definitions given in our experiment with his meaning of \"water\", the same four kinds of properties are used.",
        "Our definitions, as shown in Table 2, include the property \"fluid\", which easily can be classified as a semantic marker.",
        "The properties referring to the boiling and freezing points of water, given in definitions 7 and 8 in our experiment, may be considered as part of the concept's extension, since these properties depend upon the nature of the water.",
        "Therefore, definitions one to nine include the semantic marker \"liquid\", beside the particular features of water, the stereotypes, and/or the description by extension.",
        "The definition ten, which does not include the semantic marker, describes water by extension.",

        "In our context, efficiency means that a dictionary has to satisfy the requirements of a particular kind of user, in a certain domain of a terminology with a specific background.",
        "Therefore, the design of an onoma-siological dictionary must first foresee a multiplicity of properties for each concept and secondly the diversity of words that can be used to name them.",
        "Then, the task consists in the accurate interpretation of the description of the concept and providing the word or probable words the user is looking for.",
        "The core of such onomasiological dictionary, as reported by Sierra and McNaught (2000), is the lexical knowledge base (LKB), which should provide all the necessary knowledge to be manipulated in order to enable onomasiological search.",
        "In principle, it must represent what a person knows about both concepts and their corresponding terms.",
        "Such LKB consists then of a set of terms, a set of definitions for each term, a set of keywords associated with the definitions and a set of lexical paradigms that group keywords with the same meaning.",
        "It not only includes the databases that constitute these sets of data, but the interrelationships among all the sets."
