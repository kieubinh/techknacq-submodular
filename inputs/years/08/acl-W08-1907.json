        "Computational conceptual access to multilingual lexicon can be achieved through the use of ontology or WordNet as interlingual links.",
        "Some languages do conventionally encode semantic classification information, such as the linguistic system of classifiers or the orthographic system of characters.",
        "We attempt to make use of these implicitly encoded linguistic knowledge for conceptual access to lexical information.",
        "On the other hand, even though ontology seems to be a natural choice for conceptual framework to access multilingual lexical information, there is no large-scale implementation nor is there any direct evidence for psychological reality of the frameworks of ontology.",
        "Hence, we hope that using a conventionalized semantic classification system will mitigate some of the problems and provide the constructed ontology some motivation since they are the shared and implicit conceptual systems."

        "Hanzi and kanji: Shared Orthography of Two Typologically Different Languages",
        "Chinese and Japanese are two typologically different languages sharing the same orthography since they both use Chinese characters in written text.",
        "What makes this sharing of orthography unique among languages in the world is that Chinese characters (kanji in Japanese and hanzi in Chinese) explicitly encode information of semantic classification (Xyu 121, Chou and Huang 2005).",
        "This partially explains the process of Japanese adopting Chinese orthography even though the two languages are not related.",
        "The adaptation is supposed to be based on meaning and not on cognates sharing some linguistic forms.",
        "However, this meaning-based view of kanji/hanzi orthography faces a great challenge given the fact that Japanese and Chinese form-meaning pair do not have strict one-to-one mapping.",
        "There are meanings instantiated with different forms, as well as same forms representing different meanings.",
        "The character j§ is one of most famous faux amis.",
        "It stands for 'hot soup' in Chinese and 'hot spring' in Japanese.",
        "In sum, these are two languages where their forms are supposed to be organized according to meanings, but show inconsistencies.",
        "It is important to note that WordNet and the Chinese character orthography are not so different as they appear.",
        "WordNet assumes that there are some generalizations in how concepts are clustered and lexically organized in languages and propose an explicit lexical level representation framework which can be applied to all languages in the world.",
        "Chinese character orthography intuited that there are some conceptual bases for how meanings are lexicalized and organized, hence devised a sub-lexical level representation to represent semantic clusters.",
        "Based on this observation, the study of cross-lingual homo-forms between Japanese and Chinese in the context of WordNet offers an unique window for different approaches to lexical conceptualization.",
        "Since Japanese and Chinese use the same character set with the same semantic primitives (i.e. radicals), we can compare their conceptual systems with the same atoms when there are variations in meanings of the same word-forms.",
        "When this is overlaid over WordNet, we get to compare the ontology of the two represent systems.",

        "Hantology and the Ontologization of the Semantic Classification of the Radicals",
        "The design of Hantology differs from other word-based ontology.",
        "A typical word-based ontology is WordNet which describes the different relations among synonyms.",
        "All of the relations among synonyms are based on the senses of words.",
        "Therefore, WordNet only needs to take senses into consideration.",
        "Hantology is more complicated than WordNet because it describes orthographic forms, pronunciations, senses, variants, lexicalization, the spread of Chinese characters and Japanese kanji.This approach can systematically illustrate the development of Chinese writing system (Chou et al.",
        "2007).",
        "Hantology also provides mapping with Sinica BOW(Academia Sinica Bilingual Ontological WordNet).",

        "The structure of Hantology is divided into three parts: orthography, pronunciation, and lexicalization.",
        "The orthographic part of Hantology describes the structure of characters, the principles of formatting characters, the evolution of script, glyph expression, the relation of variant and the spread of Chinese characters.",
        "(1) The structure of characters describes the components of each hanzi/kanji, including semantic and phonetic symbols.",
        "(2) The principles of formatting Chinese characters encode the classification of the relation used to compose the character from its components: The pictographic characters were formed by reformatting the pictures of concrete objects.",
        "The ideographic (zhi3shi4, refer-event) characters are formed by abstract representation of an concept.",
        "The compound ideographic characters are formed by combining two (ore more) semantic symbols.",
        "The semantic-phonetic (xing2sheng1) characters, representing over 90 percent of Chinese character, are formed by combining a semantic symbol and a phonetic symbol.",
        "(3) The evolution of script illustrates the different scripts of Chinese characters.",
        "The script is a kind of writing style.",
        "Because Chinese characters have been used for thousands years, the scripts have changed.The orthographic forms do not change with different scripts.",
        "Hantology provides Bronze, Lesser Seal, Kaishu scripts to illustrate evolution of Chinese scripts used from 3000 years ago.",
        "(4) Variants are the characters with different orthographic forms with identical pronunciation and meaning.",
        "For example, Chinese characters pEfand Mare variants.",
        "Variants relations are an important feature in Hantology, similar to WordNet synset relations.",
        "(5) The contrasts between kanji and hanzi glyphs are also encoded.",
        "The Japanese language continues to evolve and change after the adoption of Chinese characters.",
        "Hence the kanji system includes both historical changes and cross-lingual variations.",
        "The kanji system has its own variants which are not necessarily the same set of variants in the hanzi system.",
        "Most of Chinese characters adopted by simplified kanji are the variants already used in Chinese.",
        "For example, '15' is a simplified kanji of traditional kanji 'HÜ'.",
        "In addition, Chinese character 'H' is also the variant of Chinese charac-ter'ü'.",
        "So, 'H'and'IH' both are variants in Chinese and Japanese.",

        "For example, new kanji is the variant of old kanji in Japan.",
        "However, is not the variant of in Chinese.",
        "The second reason of the kanji orthographic form to to be changed is that Japanese not only adopted Chinese characters but also have created hundreds kanji known as Kokuji (H^).",
        "Most Kokuji characters have only Japanese pronunciations.",
        "Some of Kokuji have been adopted in Chinese.",

        "We assume that the concept, synonyms, near-synonyms, and paraphrases are the synset of each jwd.In the case when there is no English definition for the word, we assume that there is no equivalent term in English, therefore we use the concept definition of the jwd as its definition.",
        "In the previous experiment, the CWN, which contains a list of 8,624 Chinese word (cwd) entries, was used as the cwd data, however since the number of cwds was too small, many jwds were not mapped, even when there is actually a corresponding J-C word pairs exists.",
        "This time we adopt SinicaBow, which contains 9,9642 entries, hoping to find more valid corresponding J-C word pairs.In SinicaBow, each entry is a definition and it contains one or more cwds corresponds to the definition.",
