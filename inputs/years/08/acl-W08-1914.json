        "The idea that human memory functions associatively goes back to Aristotle who formulated that",
        "To explain the behavior documented in the association norms, in the literature a multiplicity of different mechanisms underlying human memory are proposed, thereby, for example, assuming phonological, morphological, syntactical, semantical, and contextual relations between words stimulus word, subjects had to respond with the first other word that occurred to them spontane(Wettler, 1980).",
        "However, as yet there is no agreement whether these mechanisms should be considered of equal status, or if some may be derived from others.",
        "Already in 1750 the physiologist David Hartley suggested that it may be possible to reduce the multiplicity of proposed association laws to only a single one based on temporal contiguity.",
        "This was formulated as one of the earliest psychological laws by William James (1890: 561): \"Objects once experienced together tend to become associated in the imagination, so that when any one of them is thought of, the others are likely to be thought of also, in the same order of sequence or coexistence as before.",
        "This statement we may name the law of mental association by contiguity.\"",
        "Assuming that the \"objects\" referred to in this law are words, the law of association by contiguity implies the following two phases:",
        "1) Learning phase: When perceiving language, strong associative connections are developed between words that frequently occur in close temporal succession.",
        "2) Retrieval phase: These associations determine the words that come to mind during",

        "generation.",
        "Only words that are strongly interconnected or have strong associations to external stimuli can be uttered or written down.",
        "Pre-supposing the validity of the law of association, it should be possible to derive free word associations from the distribution of words in texts.",
        "Following Church & Hanks (1990), Rapp seems to be successful.",
        "The recent simulation algorithms generate results which largely agree with the free word associations as found in the association norms.",
        "An example is shown in Table 1, where the observed and the simulated responses to the stimulus word cold are compared.",
        "the sequence of our memories is determined by the concepts of similarity and proximity (Strube, 1984:34).",
        "As early as 1879, Francis Galton tried to systematically observe human associative be ously.",

        "Some rights",
        "When judging these results it should be kept in mind that among subjects there is some variation of responses.",
        "Therefore, the simulation results can be considered satisfactory if the difference between the predicted and the observed answers is on average not larger than the difference between an answer of an average test subject and the answers of the remaining test subjects.",

        "results.",
        "However, while most previous work considered only associations to individual stimulus words, the question to be dealt with here is whether the associative responses to several stimuli can likewise be predicted from the cooccurrences of words in texts.",
        "This is of considerable interest as all utterances and texts can be considered as accumulations of stimulus words, which together lead to a systematic activation of other words and concepts in the mind of the listener or reader.",
        "How uniform the reactions of test subjects can be upon presentation of several stimulus words can be seen from examples like the word pairs circus - laugh or King - girl where subjects tend to think of clown and princess, respectively.",
        "tion nor ual stimuli, the observed results are not always obvious.",
        "For example, in a large database of association norms, namely the Edinburgh Associative Thesaurus (Kiss et al., 1973), among the responses to King the word princess is completely missing, and the same is true for girl.",
        "This means that the combination of stimulus words can lead to associations which are only weakly linked to the individual words and therefore cannot easily be deduced from conventional association norms.",
        "Accordingly it is not obvious whether the method used for the simulation of the associative behavior to single words can be extended in a straightforward way in the case of several stimulus words.",
        "The organization of this paper is as follows: We first look at association norms collected for pairs of stimulus words.",
        "We then introduce a corpus-based algorithm that simulates the observed behavior which is applicable in the case of single or multiple stimuli.",

        "Then all 90 possible pairs of these words were constructed, and the answers of the subjects upon presentation of these pairs were collected.",
        "The subjects were asked to come up with the first word spontaneously coming to mind.",
        "In addition, associations to the individual words were also collected.",
        "As for the pairs it turned out that word order did not have a noticeable effect on the responses, the responses to pairs differing only in word order were merged.",
        "In Table 2 the associative responses as given by the test subjects for two sample pairs of stimulus words are listed.",
        "In comparison to responses to individual stimulus words, the responses to pairs of words are generally less uniform, i.e. there is considerably more variation in the case of word pairs.",
        "For example 25 of 31 test subjects come up with the association Mädchen (girl) given the stimulus word Junge (boy).",
        "In contrast, the most frequently mentioned associative response upon presentation of the stimulus pair Junge Mädchen (boy girl), which is Kinder (children), is given by only seven test persons.",

        "To determine word co-occurrences, for each word in the corpus it was counted how often its close neighbors occurred within a text window of plus and minus six words.",
        "Assuming that approximately every second word is a function word, a window size of plus and minus six words after removal of the function words roughly corresponds to a window size of plus and minus 12 words without such pre-processing.",

        "It can be expected",

        "We therefore propose another approach, which to our knowledge is novel in this context: The idea is that a potential associative response to a pair of stimulus words should have a strong and preferably symmetric associative connection to each of the stimulus words, and that a strong association to only one of them does not suffice.",
        "Such a behavior can usually be ensured by a multiplication.",
        "However, we do not multiply the association strengths, as the log-likelihood ratio has an inappropriate (exponential) value characteristic.",

        "As in the association experiment the subjects rarely answer with inflected forms or function words, for com the other stimulus, which is not desirable.",

        "(The application presented in section 5.2 successfully processes 30 stimulus words.)",
