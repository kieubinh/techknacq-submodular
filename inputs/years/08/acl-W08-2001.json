        "Morphology is traditionally considered to be the field of linguistics that studies the structure of words.",
        "In this conception, words are made of morphemes which combine according to rules of inflexion, derivation and composition.",
        "If the morpheme-based theoretical framework is both elegant and easy to implement, it suffers many drawbacks pointed out by several authors (Anderson, 1992; Aronoff, 1994).",
        "The alternative theoretical models that have been proposed falls within lexeme-based or word-based morphology in which the minimal units are words instead of morphemes.",
        "Words then do not have any structure at all and morphology becomes a level of organization of the lexicon based on the sharing of semantic and formal properties.",

        "The morpheme-based / lexeme-based distinction shows up on the computational level.",
        "In the morpheme-based conception, the morphological analysis of a word aims at segmenting it into a sequence of morphemes (Déjean, 1998; Goldsmith, 2001; Creutz and Lagus, 2002; Bernhard, 2006).",
        "In a lexeme-based approach, it is to discover the relations between the word and the other lexical items.",
        "These relations serve to identify the morphological family of the word, its derivational series, and the analogies in which it is involved.",
        "For instance, the analysis of the French word dérivation may be considered as satisfactory if it connects dérivation with enough members of its family (dériver 'derivate', dérivationnel 'derivational', derivable, dérive 'drift', dériveur 'sailing dinghy', etc.)",
        "and of its derivational series (formation 'education', séduction, variation, émission, etc.).",
        "Each of these relations is integrated into a large collection of analogies that characterizes it semantically and formally.",
        "For instance, the relation between dérivation and dérivable is part of a series of analogies which includes dérivatiow.dérivable: wariationwariable, dérivatiomdérivable : : modification : modifiable, etc.",
        "Similarly, dérivation and variation participates in a series of analogies such as dérivationwaria-tion: :dériverwarier, dérivationwariation: :dériva-tionnetvariationnel, dérivationwariation: :dériva-blewariable."

        "We have presented a computational model that makes the morphological structure of the lexicon emerge from the formal and semantic regularities of the words it contains.",
        "The model is radically lexeme-based.",
        "It integrates the semantic and formal properties of the words in a uniform manner and represents them into a bipartite graph.",
        "Random walks are used to simulate the spreading of activations in this lexical network.",
        "The level of activation obtained after the propagation indicates the lexical relatedness of the words.",
        "The members of the morphological family and the derivational series of each word are then identified among its lexical neighbors by means of formal analogies.",
        "This is work in progress and we still have to separate the members of the families from the members of the series.",
        "We also intend to conduct a similar experiment on the English lexicon and to evaluate our results in a more classical manner by using the CELEX database (Baayen et al., 1995) as gold standard.",
        "The evaluation should also be done with respect to well known systems like Lin-guistica (Goldsmith, 2001) or the morphological analyzer of Bernhard (2006)."
