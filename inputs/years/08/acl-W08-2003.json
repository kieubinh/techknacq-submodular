        "We know from the 19th century philosopher-mathematician Frege that the referent and the meaning (or \"sense\") of a word (or phrase) are not the same thing: two different words or phrases can refer to the very same object without having the same meaning (Frege, 1948): \"George W. Bush\" and \"the current president of the United States of America\" have the same referent but a different meaning.",
        "So do \"human females\" and \"daughters\".",
        "And \"things that are bigger than a breadbox\" and \"things that are not the size of a breadbox or smaller\".",

        "©2008.",
        "Some rights reserved.",
        "things fall within its extension.. A word's meaning is hence something closer to a rule for picking out its referent.",
        "Is the dictionary definition of a word, then, its meaning?",
        "Clearly, if we do not know the meaning of a word, we look up its definition in a dictionary.",
        "But what if we do not know the meaning of any of the words in its dictionary definition?",
        "And what if we don't know the meanings of the words in the definitions of the words defining those words, and so on?",
        "This is a problem of infinite regress, called the \"symbol grounding problem\" (Harnad, 1990; Harnad, 2003): the meanings of words in dictionary definitions are, in and of themselves, ungrounded.",
        "The meanings of some of the words, at least, have to be grounded by some means other than dictionary definition look-up.",
        "How are word meanings grounded?",
        "Almost certainly in the sensorimotor capacity to pick out their referents (Harnad, 2005).",
        "Knowing what to do with what is not a matter of definition but of adaptive sensorimotor interaction between autonomous, behaving systems and categories of \"objects\" (including individuals, kinds, events, actions, traits and states).",
        "Our embodied sensorimotor systems can also be described as applying information processing rules to inputs in order to generate the right outputs, just as a thermostat defending a temperature of 20 degrees can be.",
        "But this dynamic process is in no useful way analogous to looking up a definition in a dictionary.",
        "We will not be discussing sensorimotor grounding (Barsalou, 2008; Glenberg & Robertson, 2002; Steels, 2007) in this paper.",
        "We will assume some sort of grounding as given: when we consult a dictionary, we already know the meanings of at least some words, somehow.",
        "A natural first hypothesis is that the grounding words ought to be more concrete, referring to things that are closer to our overt sensorimotor experience, and learned earlier, but that remains to be tested (Clark, 2003).",
        "Apart from the question of the boundary conditions of grounding, however, there are basic questions to be asked about the structure of word meanings in dictionary definition space.",
        "In the path from a word, to the definition of that word, to the definition of the words in the definition of that word, and so on, through what sort of a structure are we navigating (Ravasz & Barabasi, 2003; Steyvers & Tenenbaum, 2005)?",
        "Meaning is compositional: A definition is composed of words, combined according to syntactic rules to form a proposition (with a truth value: true or false).",
        "For example, the word to be defined w (the \"definiendum\") might mean w\\ & & ... & wn, where the Wi are other words (the \"definientes\") in its definition.",
        "Rarely does that proposition provide the full necessary and sufficient conditions for identifying the referent of the word, w, but the approximation must at least be close enough to allow most people, armed with the definition, to understand and use the defined word most of the time, possibly after looking up a few of its definientes dw, but without having to cycle through the entire dictionary, and without falling into circularity or infinite regress.",
        "If enough of the definientes are grounded, then there is no problem of infinite regress.",
        "But we can still ask the question: What is the size of the grounding vocabulary?",
        "and what words does it contain?",
        "What is the length and shape of the path that would be taken in a recursive definitional search, from a word, to its definition, to the definition of the words in its definition, and so on?",
        "Would it eventually cycle through the entire dictionary?",
        "Or would there be disjoint subsets?",
        "This paper raises more questions than it answers, but it develops the formal groundwork for a new means of finding the answers to questions about how word meaning is explicitly represented in real dictionaries – and perhaps also about how it is implicitly represented in the \"mental lexicon\" that each of us has in our brain (Hauk etal.,2008).",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we introduce the graph-theoretical definitions and notations used for formulating the symbol grounding problem in Section 3.",
        "Sections 4 and 5 deal with the implication of this approach in cognitive sciences and show in what ways grounding kernels may be useful."

        "A dictionary is a formal symbol system.",
        "The preceding section showed how formal methods can be applied to this system in order to extract formal features.",
        "In cognitive science, this is the basis of com-putationalism (or cognitivism or \"disembodied cognition\" (Pylyshyn, 1984)), according to which cognition, too, is a formal symbol system - one that can be studied and explained independently of the hardware (or, insofar as it concerns humans, the wetware) on which it is implemented.",
        "However, pure computationalism is vulnerable to the problem of the grounding of symbols too (Hamad, 1990).",
        "Some of this can be remedied by the competing paradigm of embodied cognition (Barsalou, 2008; Glenberg & Robertson, 2002; Steels, 2007), which draws on dynamical (noncompu-tational) systems theory to ground cognition in sensorimotor experience.",
        "Although computationalism and symbol grounding provide the background context for our investigations and findings, the present paper does not favor any particular theory of mental representation of meaning.",
        "A dictionary is a symbol system that relates words to words in such a way that the meanings of the definienda are conveyed via the definientes.",
        "The user is intended to arrive at an understanding of an unknown word through an understanding of its definition.",
        "What was formally demonstrated in Section 3 agrees with common sense: although one can learn new word meanings from a dictionary, the entire dictionary cannot be learned in this way because of circular references in the definitions {cycles, in graph theoretic terminology).",
        "Information - nonverbal information - must come from outside the system to ground at least some of its symbols by some means other than just formal definition (Cangelosi & Harnad, 2001).",
        "For humans, the two options are learned sensorimotor grounding and innate grounding.",
        "(Although the latter is no doubt important, our current focus is more on the former.)",
        "The need for information from outside the dictionary is formalized in Section 3.",
        "Apart from confirming the need for such external grounding, we take a symmetric stance: In natural language, some word meanings – especially highly abstract ones, such as those of mathematical or philosophical terms – are not or cannot be acquired through direct sensorimotor grounding.",
        "They are acquired through the composition of previously known words.",
        "The meaning of some of those words, or of the words in their respective definitions, must in turn have been grounded through direct sensorimotor experience.",
        "To state this in another way: Meaning is not just formal definitions all the way down; nor is it just sensorimotor experience all the way up.",
        "The two extreme poles of that continuum are sensorimotor induction at one pole (trial and error experience with corrective feedback; observation, pointing, gestures, imitation, etc.",
        "), and symbolic instruction (definitions, descriptions, explanation, verbal examples etc.)",
        "at the other pole.",
        "Being able to identify from their lexicological structure which words were acquired one way or the other would provide us with important clues about the cognitive processes underlying language and the mental representation of meaning.",
        "To compare the word meanings acquired via sensorimotor induction with word meanings acquired via symbolic instruction (definitions), we first need access to the encoding of that knowledge.",
        "In this component of our research, our hypothesis is that the representational structure of word meanings in dictionaries shares some commonalities with the representational structure of word meanings in the human brain (Hauk et al., 2008).",
        "We are thus trying to extract from dictionaries the grounding kernel (and eventually a minimum grounding set, which in general is a proper subset of this kernel), from which the rest of the dictionary can be reached through definitions alone.",
        "We hypothesize that this kernel, identified through formal structural analysis, will exhibit properties that are also reflected in the mental lexicon.",
        "In parallel ongoing studies, we are finding that the words in the grounding kernel are indeed (1) more frequent in oral and written usage, (2) more concrete, (3) more readily imageable, and (4) learned earlier or at a younger age.",
        "We also expect they will be (5) more universal (across dictionaries, languages and cultures) (Chicoisne et al., 2008)."

        "In earlier research (Clark, 2003), we have been analyzing two special dictionaries: the Longman's Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE) (Procter, 1978) and the Cambridge International Dictionary of English (CIDE) (Procter, 1995).",
        "Both are officially described as being based upon a defining vocabulary: a set of 2000 words which are purportedly the only words used in all the definitions of the dictionary, including the definitions of the defining vocabulary itself.",
        "A closer analysis of this defining vocabulary, however, has revealed that it is not always faithful to these constraints: A significant number of words used in the definitions turn out not to be in the defining vocabulary.",
        "Hence it became evident that we would ourselves have to generate a grounding kernel (roughly equivalent to the defining vocabulary) from these dictionaries.",
        "The method presented in this paper makes it possible, given the graph structure of a dictionary, to extract a grounding kernel therefrom.",
        "Extracting this structure in turn confronts us with two further problems: morphology and polysemy.",
        "Neither of these problems has a definite algorithmic solution.",
        "Morphology can be treated through stemming and associated lookup lists for the simplest cases (i.e., was – > to be, and children – > child), but more elaborate or complicated cases would require syntactic analysis or, ultimately, human evaluation.",
        "Polysemy is usually treated through statistical analysis of the word context (as in Latent Semantic Analysis) (Kintsch, 2007) or human evaluation.",
        "Indeed, a good deal of background knowledge is necessary to analyse an entry such as: \"dominant: the fifth note of a musical scale of eight notes\" (the LDOCE notes 16 different meanings of scale and 4 for dominant, and in our example, none of these words are used with their most frequent meaning).",
        "Correct disambiguation of a dictionary is time-consuming work, as the most effective way to do it for now is through consensus among human evaluators.",
        "Fortunately, a fully disambiguated version of the Word-Net database (Fellbaum, 1998; Fellbaum, 2005) has just become available.",
        "We expect the grounding kernel of WordNet to be of greater interest than the defining vocabulary of either CIDE or LDOCE (or what we extract from them and disambiguate automatically, and imperfectly) for our analysis."

        "We have seen that the problem of finding a minimum grounding set is NP-complete for general graphs.",

        "Let D be a dictionary, G = (V, E) its associated graph, and U C V any subset of vertices satisfying a given property P. We can use Algorithm 1 to test whether or not U is a grounding set.",
        "In particular, it would be interesting to test different sets U satisfying different cognitive constraints.",
        "Relaxing the grounding conditions.",
        "In this paper we imposed strong conditions on the learning of new words: One must know all the words of the definition fully in order to learn a new word from them.",
        "This is not realistic, because we all know one can often understand a definition without knowing every single word in it.",
        "Hence one way to relax these conditions would be to modify the learning rule so that one need only understand at least r% of the definition, where r is some number between 0 and 100.",
        "Another variation would be to assign weights to words to take into account their morphosyntactic and semantic properties (rather than just treating them as an unordered list, as in the present analysis).",
        "Finally, we could consider \"quasi-grounding sets\", whose associated reachable set consists of r% of the whole dictionary.",

        "Analyzing real dictionaries raises, in its full generality, the problem of word and text disambiguation in free text; this is a very difficult problem.",
        "For example, if the word \"make\" appears in a definition, we do not know which of its many senses is intended – nor even what its grammatical category is.",
        "To our knowledge, the only available dictionary that endeavors to provide fully disambiguated definitions is the just-released version of WordNet.",
        "On the other hand, dictionary definitions have a very specific grammatical structure, presumably simpler and more limited than the general case of free text.",
        "It might hence be feasible to develop automatic disambiguation algorithms specifically dedicated to the special case of dictionary definitions.",
