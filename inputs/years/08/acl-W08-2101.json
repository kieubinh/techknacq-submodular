        "In statistical natural language processing, considerable ingenuity and insight have been devoted to developing models of syntactic information, such as statistical parsers and taggers.",
        "Successes in these syntactic tasks have recently paved the way to applying novel statistical learning techniques to levels of semantic representation, such as recovering the logical form of a sentence for information extraction and question-answering applications (Miller et al., 2000; Ge and Mooney, 2005; Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2007; Wong and Mooney, 2007).",
        "In this paper, we also focus our interest on learning semantic information.",
        "Differently from other work that has focussed on logical form, however, we explore the problem of recovering the syntactic structure of the sentence, the propositional",
        "© 2008.",
        "Some rights reserved.",
        "argument-structure of its main predicates, and the substantive labels assigned to the arguments in the propositional structure, the semantic roles.",
        "This rich output can be useful for information extraction and question-answering, but also for anaphora resolution and other tasks for which the structural information provided by full syntactic parsing is necessary.",
        "The task of semantic role labelling (SRL), as has been defined by previous researchers (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), requires collecting all the arguments that together with a verb form a predicate-argument structure.",
        "In most previous work, the task has been decomposed into the argument identification and argument labelling sub tasks: first the arguments of each specific verb in the sentence are identified by classifying constituents in the sentence as arguments or not arguments.",
        "The arguments are then labelled in a second step.",
        "We propose to produce the rich syntactic-semantic output in two steps, which are different from the argument identification and argument labelling sub tasks.",
        "First, we generate trees that bear both syntactic and semantic annotation, such as those in Figure 1.",
        "The parse tree, however, does not explicitly encode information about predicate-argument structure, because it does not explicitly associate each semantic role to the verb that governs it.",
        "So, our second step consists in recovering the predicate-argument structure of each verb by gleaning this information in an already richly decorated tree.",
        "There are linguistic and computational reasons to think that we can solve the joint problem of recovering the constituent structure of a sentence and its lexical semantics.",
        "From a linguistic point of view, the assumption that syntactic distributions will be predictive of semantic role assignments is based on linking theory (Levin, 1986).",
        "Linking theory assumes the existence of a hierarchy of semantic roles which are mapped by default on a hierarchy of grammatical functions and syntactic positions, and it attempts to predict the mapping of the underlying semantic component of a predicate's meaning onto the syntactic structure.",
        "For example, Agents are always mapped in syntactically higher positions than Themes.",
        "From a computational point of view, if the internal semantics of a predicate determines the syntactic expressions of constituents bearing a semantic role, it is then reasonable to expect that knowledge about semantic roles in a sentence will be informative of its syntactic structure.",
        "It follows rather naturally that semantic and syntactic parsing can be integrated into a single complex task.",
        "Our proposal also addresses the problem of semantic role labelling from a slightly different perspective.",
        "We identify and label argument nodes first, while parsing, and we group them in a predicate-argument structure in a second step.",
        "Our experiments investigate some of the effects that result from organising the task of semantic role labelling in this way, and the usefulness of some novel features defined on syntactic trees.",
        "In the remainder of the paper, we first illustrate the data and the graphical model that formalise the architecture used and its extension for semantic parsing.",
        "We then report on two kinds of experiments: we first evaluate the architecture on the joint task of syntactic and semantic parsing and then evaluate the joint approach on the task of semantic role labelling.",
        "We conclude with a discussion which highlights the practical and theoretical contribution of this work."

        "The parser uses a form of left-corner parsing strategy to map parse trees to sequences of derivation steps.",
        "We choose this parser because it exhibits the best performance for a single generative parser, and does not impose hard independence assumptions.",
        "It is therefore promising for extensions to new tasks.",

        "As can be seen the relationship between different probabilistic parsing decisions are not Markovian, nor do the decisions influence each other directly.",
        "Past decisions can influence the current decision through state vectors of independent latent variables, referred to as Si.",
        "These state vectors encode the probability distributions of features of the history of parsing steps (the features are indicated by s\\ in Figure 2).",
        "As can be seen from the picture, the pattern of interconnectivity allows previous non-adjacent states to influence future states.",
        "Not all states in the history are relevant, however.",
        "The interconnectivity is defined dynamically based on the topological structure and the labels of the tree that is being developed.",
        "This interconnectivity depends on a notion of structural locality (Henderson, 2003; Musillo and Merlo, 2006).",
        "In order to extend this model to learn decisions concerning a joint syntactic-semantic representation, the semantic information needs to be highlighted in the model in several ways.",
        "We modify the network connectivity, and bias the learner.",
        "First, we take advantage of the network's dynamic connectivity to highlight the portion of the tree that bears semantic information.",
        "We augment the nodes that can influence parsing decisions at the current state by explicitly adding the vectors of latent variables related to the most recent child bearing a semantic role label of either type (REL, AO to A5 or AM-X) to the connectivity of the current decision.",
        "These additions yield a model that is sensitive to regularities in structurally defined sequences of nodes bearing semantic role labels, within and across constituents.",
        "These extensions enlarge the locality domain over which dependencies between predicates bearing the REL label, arguments bearing an A0-A5 label, and adjuncts bearing an AM-X role can be specified, and capture both linear and hierarchical constraints between predicates, arguments and adjuncts.",
        "Enlarging the locality domain this way ensures for instance that the derivation of the role DIR in Figure 1 is not independent of the derivations of the roles TMP, REL (the predicate) and AO.",
        "Second, this version of the Bayesian network tags its sentences internally.",
        "Following (Musillo and Merlo, 2005), we split some part-of-speech tags into tags marked with semantic role labels.",
        "The semantic role labels attached to a non-terminal directly projected by a preterminal and belonging to a few selected categories (dir, ext, loc, mnr, prp, caus or tmp) are propagated down to the pre-terminal part-of-speech tag of its head.",
        "This third extension biases the parser to learn the relationship between lexical items, semantic roles and the constituents in which they occur.",

        "The fact that the parser learns these labels without explicit annotation of the link between the arguments and the predicate to which they are assigned, but based on the smoothed representation of the derivation of the parse tree and only very limited lexicalisation, appears to confirm linking theory, which assumes a correlation between the syntactic configuration of a sentence and the lexical semantic labels.",

        "We experimented with two methods: a simple rule-based method and a more complex learning method.",
        "The rule-based extraction method is the natural second step to solve the complete semantic role labelling task, after we identify and label semantic roles while parsing.",
        "Since in our proposal, we solve most of the problem in the first step, then we should be able to collect the predicate-argument pairs by simple, deterministic rules.",
        "The simplicity of the method also provides a useful comparison for more complex learning methods, which can be justified only if they perform better than simple rule-based predicate-argument extraction.",
        "Our rule-based method automatically compiles finite-state automatata defining the paths that connect the first node dominating a predicate to its semantic roles from parse trees enriched with semantic role labels.",
        "Such paths can then be used to traverse parse trees returned by the parsing model and collect argument structures.",
        "More specifically, a sample of sentences are randomly selected from the training section of the PTB/PRBK.",
        "For each predicate, then, all the arguments left and right of the predicate and all the adjuncts left and right respectively are collected and filtered by simple global constraints, thereby guaranteeing that only one type of obligatory argument label (AO to A5) is assigned in each proposition.",
        "When evaluated on gold data, this rule-based extraction method reaches 94.9% precision, 96.9% recall, for an F-measure of 95.9%.",
        "These results provide an upper bound as well as indicating that, while not perfect, the simple extraction rules reach a very good level of correctness if the input from the first step, syntactic and semantic parsing, is correct.",
        "The performance is much lower when parses are not entirely correct, and semantic role labels are missing, as indicated by the results of 72.9% precision, 66.7% (F-measure 69.7%), obtained when using the best automatic parse tree.",
        "The fact that performance depends on the quality of the output of the first step, indicates that the extraction rules are sensitive to errors in the parse trees, as well as errors in the labelling.",

        "Minimality is a typical property of natural languages that is attested in several domains.",
        "In recovering predicate-argument structures, minimality guarantees that the arguments are related to the closest verb in a predicate domain, which is not always the verb to which they are connected by the shortest path.",

        "Minimality is encoded as a binary feature that indicates whether a verb w intervenes between the verb v and the candidate argument srn.",
        "Minimality is defined both in terms of linear precedence (indicated below as -<) and of dominance within the same VP group.",

        "On the one hand, as can be noticed in Table 3, our learning method yields the best precision, but often the worse recall and it has the most extreme difference between these two scores.",
        "This is very likely to be a consequence of the method.",
        "Since the assignment of the semantic role labels proper is performed during parsing, the number of nodes that require a semantic role is only 20% of the total.",
        "Therefore the parser develops a bias against assigning these roles in general, and recall suffers.",
        "On the other hand, precision is very good, thanks to the rich context in which the roles are assigned.",
        "This property of our method suggests that combining our results with those of other existing semantic role labellers might be beneficial, since the errors it performs are quite different.",
        "We tested this hypothesis by combining our outputs, which are the most precise, with the outputs of the system that reported the best recall (Haghighi et al., 2005).",
        "The combination, performed on sections 24 and 23, gives priority to our system when it outputs a non-null label (because of its high precision) and uses the other system's label when our system outputs a null label.",
        "This combination produces a result of 79.0% precision, 80.4% recall, and 79.7% F-measure for section 24, and 80.5% precision, 81.4% recall, and 81.0% F-measure for section 23.",
        "We conclude that the combination is indeed able to exploit the positive aspects of both approaches, as the F-measure of the combined result is better than each individual result.",
        "It is also the best compared to the other systems of the CoNLL shared task.",
        "Comparatively, we find that applying the same combination technique to the output of the system by (Haghighi et al., 2005) with the output of the best system in the CoNLL 2005 shared task (Punyakanok et al., 2005) yields combined outputs that are not as good as the better of the two systems (P:76.3%; R:78.6%; F:77.4% for section 24; P:78.5%; R:80.0%; F:79.3% for section 23).",
        "This result confirms our initial hypothesis, that combination of systems with different performance characteristics yields greater improvement.",
        "Another direct consequence of assigning roles in a rich context is that in collecting arguments for a given verb we hardly need to verify global constraints.",
        "Differently from previous work that had found that global coherence constraints considerably improved performance (Punyakanok et al., 2005), using global filtering contraints showed no improvement in our learning model.",
        "Thus, these results confirm the observations that a verb does not assign its semantic roles independently of each-other (Haghighi et al., 2005).",
        "Our method too can be seen as a way of formulating the SRL problem in a way that is not simply classification of each instance independently.",
        "Because identification of arguments and their labelling is done while parsing, the parsing history, both syntactic and semantic, is taken into account in identifying and labelling an argument.",
        "Semantic role labelling is integrated in structured sequence prediction.",
        "Further integration of semantic role labelling in structured probabilistic models related to the one described here has recently been shown to result in accurate synchronous parsers that derive both syntactic and semantic dependency representations (Henderson et al., 2008).",
