        "The average sentence length in the data set we use (the Penn WSJ treebank) is over 23 words; the grammar constant G can easily take a value of 1000 or greater.",
        "These factors make exact inference algorithms virtually intractable for training or decoding GLMs for full syntactic parsing.",
        "As a result, in spite of the potential advantages of these methods, there has been very little previous work on applying GLMs for full parsing without the use of fairly severe restrictions or approximations.",
        "For example, the model in (Taskar et al., 2004) is trained on only sentences of 15 words or less; reranking models (Collins, 2000; Charniak and Johnson, 2005) restrict ^(x) to be a small set of parses from a first-pass parser; see section 1.1 for discussion of other related work.",
        "The following ideas are central to our approach:",

        "A driving motivation for our approach comes from the flexibility of the feature-vector representations f(x, y) that can be used in the model.",

        "Any of these feature types can be combined with surface features of the sentence x, in a similar way to the use of surface features in conditional random fields (Lafferty et al., 2001).",
        "Crucially, in spite of these relatively rich representations, the formalism can be parsed efficiently (in 0(nG) time) using dynamic-programming algorithms described by Eisner (2000) (unlike many other TAG-related approaches, our formalism is \"splittable\" in the sense described by Eisner, leading to more efficient parsing algorithms).",

        "The lower-order parser runs in 0(nH) time where H <C G; experiments show that it is remarkably effective in pruning the search space of the full TAG parser.",
        "Experiments on the Perm WSJ treebank show that the model recovers constituent structures with higher accuracy than the approaches of (Charniak, 2000; Collins, 2000; Petrov and Klein, 2007), and with a similar level of performance to the reranking parser of (Charniak and Johnson, 2005).",
        "The model also recovers dependencies with significantly higher accuracy than state-of-the-art dependency parsers such as (Koo et al., 2008; McDonald and Pereira, 2006).",

        "In reranking approaches, a first-pass parser is used to enumerate a small set of candidate parses for an input sentence; the reranking model, which is a GLM, is used to select between these parses (e.g., (Ratnaparkhi et al., 1994; Johnson et al., 1999; Collins, 2000; Charniak and Johnson, 2005)).",
        "A crucial advantage of our approach is that it considers a very large set of alternatives in IV (x), and can thereby avoid search errors that may be made in the first-pass parser.",
        "Another approach that allows efficient training of GLMs is to use simpler syntactic representations, in particular dependency structures (McDonaid et al., 2005).",
        "Dependency parsing can be implemented in (9(n) time using the algorithms of Eisner (2000).",
        "In this case there is no grammar constant, and parsing is therefore efficient.",
        "A disadvantage of these approaches is that they do not recover full, constituent-based syntactic structures; the increased linguistic detail in full syntactic structures may be useful in NLP applications, or may improve dependency parsing accuracy, as is the case in our experiments.",

        "The parsing formalism we use is related to the tree adjoining grammar (TAG) formalisms described in (Chiang, 2003; Shen and Joshi, 2005).",
        "However, an important difference of our work from this previous work is that our formalism is defined to be \"splittable\", allowing use of the efficient parsing algorithms of Eisner (2000).",
        "A derivation in our model is a pair (E, D) where E is a set of spines, and D is a set of dependencies specifying how the spines are combined to form a parse tree.",
        "The spines are similar to elementary trees in TAG.",
        "Some examples are as follows:",
        "These structures do not have substitution nodes, as is common in TAGs.",
        "Instead, the spines consist of a lexical anchor together with a series of unary projections, which usually correspond to different X-bar levels associated with the anchor.",
        "The operations used to combine spines are similar to the TAG operations of adjunction and sister adjunction.",
        "We will call these operations regular adjunction (r-adjunction) and sister adjunction (s-adjunction).",
        "As one example, the cake spine shown above can be s-adjoined into the VP node of the ate spine, to form the tree shown in figure 1(a).",
        "In contrast, if we use the r-adjunction operation to adjoin the cake tree into the VP node, we get a different structure, which has an additional VP level created by the r-adjunction operation: the resulting tree is shown in figure 1(b).",
        "The r-adjunction operation is similar to the usual adjunction operation in TAGs, but has some differences that allow our grammars to be splittable; see section 2.3 for more discussion.",

        "< m or m < m!",
        "< h).",
        "It would be sufficient to define I to be the pair (POS, A) – the inclusion of rjh, rjm and L adds redundant information that can be recovered from the set E, and other dependencies in D – but it will be convenient to include this information in the label.",
        "In particular, it is important that given this definition of I, it is possible to define a function GRM(Z) that maps a label I to a triple of nonterminals that represents the grammatical relation between m and h in the dependency structure.",

        "In the tree shown in figure 1(b), the grammatical relation between cake and ate is the triple GRM(Z) = (VP VP NP).",
        "The conditions under which a pair (E, D) forms a valid derivation for a sentence x are similar to those in conventional LTAGs.",

        "The efficiency of the parsing algorithm is important in applying the parsing model to test sentences, and also when training the model using discriminative methods.",
        "The grammar constants G and H introduced in the previous section are polynomial in factors such as the number of possible spines in the model, and the number of possible states in the finite-state automata implicit in the parsing algorithm.",

        "We now turn to how the marginals /x(x, h, m, I) are defined and computed.",
        "A simple approach would be to use a conditional log-linear model (Lafferty et al., 2001), with features as defined by McDonald et al.",

        "In this case we could define which can be computed with inside-outside style algorithms, applied to the data structures from (Eisner, 2000).",
        "The complexity of training and applying such a model is again 0(Gn), where G is the number of possible labels, and the number of possible labels (triples of non-terminals) is around G = 1000 in the case of treebank parsing; this value for G is still too large for the method to be efficient.",
        "Instead, we train three separate models fj.2, and /J.3 for the three different positions in the non-terminal triples.",

        "Section 2.2 described the use of feature vectors associated with spines used in a derivation, together with first-order, sibling, and grandparent dependencies.",
        "The dependency features used in our experiments are closely related to the features described in (Carreras, 2007), which are an extension of the McDonald and Pereira (2006) features to cover grandparent dependencies in addition to first-order and sibling dependencies.",
        "The features take into account the identity of the labels I used in the derivations.",
        "The features could potentially look at any information in the labels, which are of the form (POS, A, rjh, rjm, L), but in our experiments, we map labels to a pair (GRM((P0S, A, r]h, r]m, L)), A).",
        "Thus the label features are sensitive only to the triple of nonterminals corresponding to the grammatical relation involved in an adjunction, and a binary flag specifiying whether the operation is s-adjunction or r-adjunction.",
        "For the spine features e(x, (i, rj)), we use feature templates that are sensitive to the identity of the spine rj, together with contextual features of the string x.",
        "These features consider the identity of the words and part-of-speech tags in a window that is centered on Xi and spans the range",
        "In the experiments in this paper, the following three-step process was used: (1) derivations were extracted from a training set drawn from the Penn WSJ treebank, and then used to train a parsing model; (2) the test data was parsed using the resulting model, giving a derivation for each test data sentence; (3) the resulting test-data derivations were mapped back to Penn-treebank style trees, using the method described in section 2.1.",
        "To achieve step (1), we first apply a set of head-finding rules which are similar to those described in (Collins, 1997).",
        "Once the head-finding rules have been applied, it is straightforward to extract",

        "Other similar trees, but with more VP levels, will give the same set D. However, this issue appears to be benign in the Penn WSJ treebank.",
        "For example, on section 22 of the treebank, if derivations are first extracted using the method described in this section, then mapped back to parse trees using the method described in section 2.3, the resulting parse trees score 100% precision and 99.81% recall in labeled constituent accuracy, indicating that very little information is lost in this process.",
        "Sentences in training, test, and development data are assumed to have part-of-speech (POS) tags.",
