        "Data-driven dependency parsing has recently received extensive attention in the parsing community and impressive results have been obtained for a range of languages (Nivre et al., 2007).",
        "Even with high overall parsing accuracy, however, data-driven parsers often make errors in the assignment of argument relations such as subject and object and the exact influence of data-derived features on the parsing accuracy for specific linguistic constructions is still relatively poorly understood.",
        "There are a number of studies that investigate the influence of different features or representational choices on overall parsing accuracy, (Bod, 1998; Klein and Manning, 2003).",
        "There are also attempts at a more fine-grained analysis of accuracy, targeting specific linguistic constructions or grammatical functions (Carroll and Briscoe, 2002; Kiibler and Prokic, 2006; McDonald and Nivre, 2007).",

        "In this paper, we investigate the influence of a set of linguistically motivated features on parse results for Swedish, and in particular on the analysis of argument relations such as subjects, objects and subject predicatives.",
        "Motivated by an error analysis of the best performing parser for Swedish in the CoNLL-X shared task, we extend the feature model employed by the parser with a set of linguistically motivated features and go on to show how these features may be acquired automatically.",
        "We then present results from corresponding parse experiments with automatic features.",
        "The rest of the paper is structured as follows.",
        "In section 2 we present relevant properties of Swedish morphosyntax, as well as the treebank and parser employed in the experiments.",
        "Section 3 presents an error analysis of the baseline parser and we go on to motivate a set of linguistic features in section 4, which are employed in a set of experiments with gold standard features, discussed in section 5.",

        "The features fed to the classifier for making these decisions naturally focus on attributes of top, next and neighbouring tokens in S, I or G. In the baseline feature model, these attributes are limited to the word form (form), part of speech (pos), and dependency relation (dep) of a given token, but in later experiments we will add other linguistic features (feats).",
