        "A semantic parsing learning system typically exploits the given MRG of the MRL to learn a semantic parser (Kate and Mooney, 2006; Wong and Mooney, 2006).",
        "Although in different ways, but the systems presented in these papers learn how the NL phrases relate to the productions of the MRG, and using this information they parse a test sentence to compositionally generate its best MR.",
        "In order to learn a good semantic parser, it is necessary that the productions of the MRG accurately represent the semantics being expressed by the natural language.",
        "However, an MRL and its MRG are typically designed to best suit the application with little consideration for how well they correspond to the semantics of a natural language.",
        "Some other semantic parser learning systems which need MRL in the form of Prolog (Tang and Mooney, 2001) or A-calculus (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2007; Wong and Mooney, 2007) do not use productions of the MRG but instead use predicates of the MRL.",
        "However, in order to learn a good semantic parser, they still require that these predicates correspond well with the semantics of the natural language.",

        "The MRs do not change but only the way they are parsed may change because of grammar transformations.",
        "This is important because the MRs are to be used in an application and hence should not be changed.",

In the context of semantic parsing learning algorithm, this operator introduces a new semantic concept the previous grammar was not explicit about.",

In order to ensure that this operator preserves the coverage of the grammar, before applying it, it is made sure that if one of these non-terminals, say T\\, occurs on the RHS of a production tt\\ then there also exist productions 7T2, irn which are same as n\\ except that t2, Tn respectively occur in them in place of T\\.",
        "If this condition is violated for any production of any of the n non-terminals then this operator is not applicable.",
        "This operator enables generalization of some non-terminals which occur in similar contexts leading to generalization of productions in which they occur on the RHS.",

This operator will not eliminate other occurrences of T\\ and t2 on the RHS of other productions in which they do not occur adjacent to each other.",
        "In the context of semantic parsing, this operator adds an extra level in the MR parses which does not seem to be useful in itself, but later if the non-terminals T\\ and t2 get eliminated (by the application of the DeleteProd operator described shortly), this operator will be combining the concepts represented by the two non-terminals.",

        "In order to transform an MRG to improve semantic parsing, since a simple hill-climbing type approach to search the space of all possible MRGs will be computationally very intensive, we use the following error-driven heuristic search which is faster although less thorough.",

        "Finally, we tested our MRG transformation algorithm on the clang domain using its original MRG in which all the chief regions of the soccer field were in the form of numeric MR expressions which do not correspond to their meanings in the natural language.",
        "Its corpus contains 300 examples of NL-MR pairs.",
        "Figure 6 shows the results.",
        "After applying the MRG transformations the performance improved by a large margin.",
        "The gain was due to transformations obtained using macros while the grammar transformation operators did not help with this MRG.",
        "Although the precision was lower for low recall values, the recall increased by a large quantity and the best F-measure improved from 50% to 63%.",
        "But the performance still lagged behind that obtained using the manually-engineered MRG.",
        "The main reason for this is that the manual MRG introduced some domain specific expressions, like left, right, left-quarter etc., which correspond directly to their meanings in the natural language.",
        "On the other hand, the only way to specify \"left\" of a region using the original clang MRG is by specifying the coordinates of the left region, like (rec(pt -32 -35) (pt 0 0)) is the left of (rec (pt -32 -35) (pt 0 35)) etc.",
        "It is not possible to learn the concept of \"left\" from such expressions even with MRG transformations.",
