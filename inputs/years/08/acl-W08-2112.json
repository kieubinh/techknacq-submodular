        "An important open problem in cognitive science and artificial intelligence is how children successfully learn their native language despite the lack of explicit training.",
        "A key challenge in the early stages of language acquisition is to learn the notion of abstract syntactic categories (e.g., nouns, verbs, or determiners), which is necessary for acquiring the syntactic structure of language.",
        "Indeed, children as young as two years old show evidence of having acquired a good knowledge of some of these abstract categories (Olguin and Tomasello, 1993); by around six years of age, they have learned almost all syntactic categories (Kemp et al., 2005).",
        "Computational models help to elucidate the kinds of learning mechanisms that may be capable of achieving this feat.",
        "Such studies shed light on the possible cognitive mechanisms at work in human language acquisition, and also on potential means for unsupervised learning of complex linguistic knowledge in a computational system.",
        "Learning the syntactic categories of words has been suggested to be based on the morphological and phonological properties of individual words, as well",
        "©2008.",
        "Some rights reserved.",
        "as on the distributional information about the contexts in which they appear.",
        "Several computational models have been proposed that draw on one or more of the above-mentioned properties in order to group words into discrete unlabeled categories.",
        "Most existing models only intend to show the relevance of such properties to the acquisition of adult-like syntactic categories such as nouns and verbs; hence, they do not necessarily incorporate the types of learning mechanisms used by children (Schütze, 1993; Red-ington et al., 1998; Clark, 2000; Mintz, 2003; Onnis and Christiansen, 2005).",
        "For example, in contrast to the above models, children acquire their knowledge of syntactic categories incrementally, processing the utterances they hear one at a time.",
        "Moreover, children appear to be sensitive to the fact that syntactic categories are partially defined in terms of other categories, e.g., nouns tend to follow determiners, and can be modified by adjectives.",
        "We thus argue that a computational model should be incremental, and should use more abstract category knowledge to help better identify syntactic categories.",
        "Incremental processing also allows a model to incorporate its partially-learned knowledge of categories, letting the model bootstrap its development.",
        "To our knowledge, the only incremental model of category acquisition that also incorporates bootstrapping is that of Cartwright and Brent (1997).",
        "Their template-based model, however, draws on very specific linguistic constraints and rules to learn categories.",
        "Moreover, their model has difficulty with the variability of natural language data.",
        "We address these shortcomings by developing an incremental probabilistic model of syntactic category acquisition that uses a domain-general learning algorithm.",
        "The model also incorporates a bootstrapping mechanism, and learns syntactic categories by looking only at the general patterns of distributional similarity in the input.",
        "Experiments performed on actual (noisy) child-directed data show that an explicit bootstrapping component improves the model's ability to learn adult-like categories.",
        "The model's learning trajectory resembles some relevant behaviours seen in children, and we also show that the categories that our model learns can be successfully used in a lexical disambiguation task."

        "We adapt a probabilistic incremental model of unsupervised categorization (i.e., clustering) proposed by Anderson (1991).",
        "The original model has been used to simulate human categorization in a variety of domains, including the acquisition of verb argument structure (Alishahi and Stevenson, 2008).",
        "Our adaptation of the model incorporates an explicit bootstrapping mechanism and a periodic merge of clusters, both facilitating generalization over input data.",
        "Here, we explain the input to our model (Section 2.1), the categorization model itself (Section 2.2), how we estimate probabilities to facilitate bootstrapping (Section 2.3), and our approach for merging similar clusters (Section 2.4).",
        "We aim to learn categories of words, and we do this by looking for groups of similar word usages.",
        "Thus, rather than categorizing a word alone, we categorize a word token with its context from that usage.",
        "The initial input to our model is a sequence of unannotated utterances, that is, words separated by spaces.",
        "Before being categorized by the model, each word usage in the input is processed to produce a frame that contains the word itself (the head word of the frame) and its distributional context (the two words before and after it).",
        "For example, in the utterance T gave Josie a present,' when processing the head word Josie, we create the following frame for input to the categorization system:",
        "gave Josie a present where wQ denotes the head word feature, and w_2, w+\\, w+2 are the context word features.",
        "A context word may be 'null' if there are fewer than two preceding or following words in the utterance.",
        "Using Anderson's (1991) incremental Bayesian categorization algorithm, we learn clusters of word usages (i.e., the input frames) by drawing on the overall similarity of their features (here, the head word and the context words).",
        "The clusters themselves are not predefined, but emerge from similarities in the input.",
        "More formally, for each successive frame F in the input, processed in the order of the input words, we place F into the most likely cluster, either from the K existing clusters, or a new one:",
        "where k = 0,1,.., K, including the new cluster k = 0.",
        "Using Bayes' rule, and dropping P(F) from the denominator, which is constant for all k, we find:",
        "The prior probability of k, P(k), is given by:",
        "where nk is the number of frames in k, and n is the total number of frames observed at the time of processing frame F. Intuitively, a well-entrenched (large) cluster should be a more likely candidate for categorization than a small one.",
        "We reserve a small probability for creating a new cluster (Eq.",
        "4).",
        "As the model processes more input overall, it should become less necessary to create new clusters to fit the data, so P(0) decreases with large n. In our experiments, we set c to a large value, 0.95, to further increase the likelihood of using existing clusters.",
        "The probability of a frame F given a cluster k, P(F\\k), depends on the probabilities of the features in F given k. We assume that the individual features in a frame are conditionally independent given k, hence:",
        "where Phis the head word probability, i.e., the likelihood of seeing wo as a head word among the frames in cluster k. The context word probability P(w;|fc) is the likelihood of seeing Wi in the ith context position of the frames in cluster k. Next, we explain how we estimate each of these probabilities from the input.",
        "For the head word probability P#(wo|fc), we use a smoothed maximum likelihood estimate (i.e., the proportion of frames in cluster k with head word vj0).",
        "For the context word probability P(wi\\k), we can form two estimates.",
        "The first is a simple maximum likelihood estimate, which enforces a preference for creating clusters of frames with the same context words.",
        "That is, head words in the same cluster will",
        "'The prior P(k) is equivalent to the prior in a Dirichlet process mixture model (Sanborn et al., 2006), commonly used for sampling clusters of objects.",
        "tend to share the same adjacent words.",
        "We call this word-based estimate PWOrd-",
        "Alternatively, we may consider the likelihood of seeing not just the context word w;, but similar words in that position.",
        "For example, if w; can be used as a noun or a verb, then we want the likelihood of seeing other nouns or verbs in position i of frames in cluster k. Here, we use the partial knowledge of the learned clusters.",
        "That is, we look over all existing clusters k', estimate the probability that w; is the head word of frames in k', then estimate the probability of using the head words from those other clusters in position i in cluster k. We refer to this category-based estimate as PCat.",
        "where Pi(k'\\k) is the probability of finding usages from cluster k' in position i given cluster k. To support this we record the categorization decisions the model has made.",
        "When we categorize the frames of an utterance, we get a sequence of clusters for that utterance, which gives additional information to supplement the frame.",
        "We use this information to estimate Pi(k'\\k) for future categorizations, again using a smoothed maximum likelihood formula.",
        "In contrast to the Pword estimate, the estimate in Eq.",
        "(6) prefers clusters of frames that use the same categories as context.",
        "While some of the results of these preferences will be the same, the latter approach lets the model make second-order inferences about categories.",
        "There may be no context words in common between the current frame and a potential cluster, but if the context words in the cluster have been found to be distributionally similar to those in the frame, it may be a good cluster for that frame.",
        "We equally weight the word-based and the category-based estimates for P(wi\\k) to get the likelihood of a context word; that is:",
        "This way, the model sees an input utterance simultaneously as a sequence of words and as a sequence of categories.",
        "It is the Pcat component, by using developing category knowledge, that yields the bootstrapping abilities of our model.",
        "Our model relies heavily on the similarity of word contexts in order to find category structure.",
        "In natural language, these context features are highly variable, so it is difficult to draw consistent structure from the input in the early stages of an incremental model.",
        "When little information is available, there is a risk of incorrectly generalizing, leading to clustering errors which may be difficult to overcome.",
        "Children face a similar problem in early learning, but there is evidence that they may manage the problem by using conservative strategies (see, e.g., Tomasello, 2000).",
        "Children may form specific hypotheses about each word type, only later generalizing their knowledge to similar words.",
        "Drawing on this observation, we form early small clusters specific to the head word type, then later aid generalization by merging these smaller clusters.",
        "By doing this, we ensure that the model only groups words of different types when there is sufficient evidence for their contextual similarity.",
        "Thus, when a cluster has been newly created, we require that all frames put into the cluster share the same head word type.",
        "When clusters are small, this prevents the model from making potentially incorrect generalizations to different words.",
        "Periodically, we evaluate a set of reasonably-sized clusters, and merge pairs of clusters that have highly similar contexts (see below for details).",
        "If the model decides to merge two clusters with different head word types – e.g., one cluster with all instances of dog, and another with cat – it has in effect made a decision to generalize.",
        "Intuitively, the model has learned that the contexts in the newly merged cluster apply to more than one word type.",
        "We now say that any word type could be a member of this cluster, if its context is sufficiently similar to that of the cluster.",
        "Thus, when categorizing a new word token (represented as a frame F), our model can choose from among the clusters with a matching head word, and any of these 'generalized' clusters that contain mixed head words.",
        "Periodically, we look through a subset of the clusters to find similar pairs to merge.",
        "In order to limit the number of potential merges to consider, we only examine pairs of clusters in which at least one cluster has changed since the last check.",
        "Thus, after processing every 100 frames of input, we consider the clusters used to hold those recent 100 frames as candidates to be merged with another cluster.",
        "We only consider clusters of reasonable size (here, at least 10 frames) as candidates for merging.",
        "For each candidate pair of clusters, k\\ and k2, we first evaluate a heuristic merge score that determines if the pair is appropriate to be merged, according to some local criteria, i.e., the size and the contents of the candidate clusters.",
        "For each suggested merge (a pair whose merge score exceeds a predetermined threshold), we then look at the set of all clusters, the global evidence, to decide whether to accept the merge.",
        "The merge score combines two factors: the entrenchment of the two clusters, and the similarity of their context features.",
        "The entrenchment measure identifies clusters that contain enough frames to show a significant trend.",
        "We take a sigmoid function over the number of frames in the clusters, giving a soft threshold approaching 0 for small clusters and 1 for large clusters.",
        "The similarity measure identifies pairs of clusters with similar distributions of word and category contexts.",
        "Given two clusters, we measure the symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence for each corresponding pair of context feature probabilities (including the category contexts P;(fc'|fc), 8 pairs in total), then place the sum of those measures on another sigmoid function.",
        "The merge score is the sum of the entrenchment and similarity measures.",
        "Since it is only a local measure, the merge score is not sufficient on its own for determining if a merge is appropriate.",
        "For each suggested merge, we thus examine the likelihood of a sample of input frames (here, the last 100 frames) under two states: the set of clusters before the merge, and the set of clusters if the merge is accepted.",

        "Given a word that the model has previously seen as various different parts of speech, we examine how well the model can use that ambiguous word s context to determine its category in the current usage.",
        "For example, by presenting the word kiss in separate noun and verb contexts, we expect that the model should categorize kiss as a noun, then as a verb, respectively.",
        "We also wish to examine the effect of the target word s lexical bias, that is, the predominance of a word type to be used as one category over another.",

        "To make the most use of the context information, we allow no null words in the input frames.",
        "We also ensure that the contexts are distinctive enough to guide disambiguation.",
        "For each PoS sequence surrounding a noun (e.g., 'V Det head Prep Det'), we ensure that over 80% of the instances of that pattern in the corpus are for nouns, and likewise for verbs.",

        "An 'equibiased' condition uses 4 words of approximately equal bias, and a novel word condition provides an unbiased case.",
        "For the six sets of test words, we measure the effect of placing each of these words in both noun and verb contexts.",
        "That is, each word in each condition was used as the head word in each of the 500 noun and 500 verb disambiguating frames.",
        "For example, we create 500 frames where book is used as a noun, and 500 frames where it is used as a verb.",

        "Figure 3 presents the measured PoS proportions for each of the six conditions.",
        "For both the equibias and novel word conditions, we see that the clusters chosen for the noun context frames (labeled N) contain more nouns than verbs, and the clusters chosen for the verb context frames (V) contain more verbs than nouns.",
        "This suggests that although the model's past experience with the head word is not sufficiently informative, the model can use the word's context to disambiguate its category.",
        "In the 'unambiguous' and the 'biased' conditions, the head words' lexical biases are too strong for the model to overcome.",
        "However, the results show a realistic effect of the lexical bias.",
        "Note the contrasts from the 'noun only' condition, to the 'noun biased' condition, to 'equibi-ased' (and likewise for the verb biases).",
        "As the lexical bias weakens, the counter-bias contexts (e.g., a noun bias with a verb context) show a stronger effect on the chosen clusters.",
        "This is a realistic effect of disambiguation seen in adults (MacDonald, 1993).",
        "Strongly biased words are more difficult to categorize in conflict with their bias than weakly biased words."

        "We have developed a computational model of syntactic category acquisition in children, and demonstrated its behaviour on a corpus ofnaturalistic child-directed data.",
        "The model is based on domain-general properties of feature similarity, in contrast to earlier, more linguistically-specific methods.",
        "The incremental nature ofthe algorithm contributes to a substantial improvement in psychological plausibility over previous models of syntactic category learning.",
        "Furthermore, due to its probabilistic framework, our model is robust to noise and variability in natural language.",
        "Our model successfully uses a syntactic bootstrapping mechanism to build on the distributional properties of words.",
        "Using its existing partial knowledge of categories, the model applies a second level of analysis to learn patterns in the input.",
        "By making few assumptions about prior linguistic knowledge, the model develops realistic syntactic categories from the input data alone.",
        "The explicit bootstrapping component improves the model's ability to learn adult categories, and its learning trajectory resembles relevant behaviours seen in children.",
        "Using the contextual patterns of individual parts of speech, we show differential learning rates across nouns, verbs, and adjectives that mimic child development.",
        "We also show an effect of a lexical bias in category disambiguation.",
        "The algorithm is currently only implemented as an incremental process.",
        "However, comparison with a batch version of the algorithm, such as by using a Gibbs sampler (Sanborn et al., 2006), would help us further understand the effect of incrementality on language fidelity.",
        "While we have only examined the effects of learning categories from simple distributional information, the feature-based framework of our model could easily be extended to include other sources of information, such as morphological and phonological cues.",
        "Furthermore, it would also be possible to include semantic features, thereby allowing the model to draw on correlations between semantic and syntactic categories in learning."
