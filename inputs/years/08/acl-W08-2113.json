        "Taxonomies are crucial for any knowledge-based system.",
        "They are in fact important because they allow to structure information, thus fostering their search and reuse.",
        "However, it is well known that any knowledge-based system suffers from the so-called knowledge acquisition bottleneck, i.e. the difficulty to actually model the domain in question.",
        "As stated in (Caraballo, 1999), WordNet has been an important lexical knowledge base, but it is insufficient for domain specific texts.",
        "So, many attempts have been made to automatically produce taxonomies (Grefenstette, 1994), but (Caraballo, 1999) is certainly the first work which proposes a complete overview of the problem by (1) automatically building a hierarchical structure of nouns based on bottom-up clustering methods and (2) labeling the internal nodes of the resulting tree with hypernyms from the nouns clustered underneath by using patterns such as \"B is a kind of A\".",

        "Some rights reserved.",
        "In this paper, we are interested in dealing with the second problem of the construction of an organized lexical resource i.e. discovering general-specific noun relationships, so that correct nouns are chosen to label internal nodes of any hierarchical knowledge base, such as the one proposed in (Dias et al., 2006).",
        "Most of the works proposed so far have (1) used predefined patterns or (2) automatically learned these patterns to identify hypernym/hyponym relationships.",
        "From the first paradigm, (Hearst, 1992) first identifies a set of lexico-syntactic patterns that are easily recognizable i.e. occur frequently and across text genre boundaries.",
        "These can be called seed patterns.",
        "Based on these seeds, she proposes a bootstrapping algorithm to semi-automatically acquire new more specific patterns.",
        "Similarly, (Carabal-lo, 1999) uses predefined patterns such as \"X is a kind of Y\" or \"X, Y, and other Zs\" to identify hypernym/hyponym relationships.",
        "This approach to information extraction is based on a technique called selective concept extraction as defined by (Riloff, 1993).",
        "Selective concept extraction is a form of text skimming that selectively processes relevant text while effectively ignoring surrounding text that is thought to be irrelevant to the domain.",
        "A more challenging task is to automatically learn the relevant patterns for the hypernym/hyponym relationships.",
        "In the context of pattern extraction, there exist many approaches as summarized in (Stevenson and Greenwood, 2006).",
        "The most well-known work in this area is certainly the one proposed by (Snow et al., 2005) who use machine learning techniques to automatically replace hand-built knowledge.",
        "By using dependency path features extracted from parse trees, they introduce a general-purpose formalization and generalization of these patterns.",
        "Given a training set of text containing known hypernym pairs, their algorithm automatically extracts useful dependency paths and applies them to new corpora to identify novel pairs.",
        "(Sang and Hofmann, 2007) use a similar way as (Snow et al., 2006) to derive extraction patterns for hy-pernym/hyponym relationships by using web search engine counts from pairs of words encountered in WordNet.",
        "However, the most interesting work is certainly proposed by (Bollegala et al., 2007) who extract patterns in two steps.",
        "First, they find lexical relationships between synonym pairs based on snippets counts and apply wildcards to generalize the acquired knowledge.",
        "Then, they apply a SVM classifier to determine whether a new pair shows a relation of synonymy or not, based on a feature vector of lexical relationships.",
        "This technique could be applied to hypernym/hyponym relationships although the authors do not mention it.",
        "On the one hand, links between words that result from manual or semi-automatic acquisition of relevant predicative or discursive patterns (Hearst, 1992; Carballo, 1999) are fine and accurate, but the acquisition of these patterns is a tedious task that requires substantial manual work.",
        "On the other hand, works done by (Snow et al., 2005; Snow et al., 2006; Sang and Hofmann, 2007; Bollegala et al., 2007) have proposed methodologies to automatically acquire these patterns mostly based on supervised learning to leverage manual work.",
        "However, training sets still need to be built.",
        "Unlike other approaches, we propose an unsupervised methodology which aims at discovering general-specific noun relationships which can be assimilated to hypernym/hyponym relationships detection.",
        "The advantages of this approach are clear as it can be applied to any language or any domain without any previous knowledge, based on a simple assumption: specific words tend to attract general words with more strength than the opposite.",
        "As (Michelbacher et al., 2007) state: \"there is a tendency for a strong forward association from a specific term like adenocarcinoma to the more general term cancer, whereas the association from cancer to adenocarcinoma is weak\".",
        "Based on this assumption, we propose a methodology based on directed graphs and the TextRank algorithm (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004) to automatically induce general-specific noun relationships from web corpora frequency counts.",
        "Indeed, asymmetry in Natural Language Processing can be seen as a possible reason for",

        "The higher the number of votes that are cast for a vertex, the higher the importance of the vertex.",

        "Our intuition of using graph-based ranking algorithms is that more general words will be more likely to have incoming associations as they will be associated to many specific words.",
        "On the opposite, specific words will have few incoming associations as they will not attract general words (see Figure 1).",

        "But on the opposite, the precision is high for higher levels of generality which is promising for the automatic construction of hierarchical thesauri.",
        "Indeed, our approach can be computed recursively so that each level of analysis is evaluated as if it was at the hypernym level, thus taking advantage of the good performance of our approach at upper levels of generality.",

        "It is interesting to note that in the case of the web estimated list, the weighted graphs evidence much better results than the unweighted ones, although they do not show improved results compared to the WordNet list.",
        "On the one hand, these results show that our methodology is capable to map to WordNet lists as easily as to Web lists even that it is based on web frequency counts.",
        "On the other hand, the fact that weighted graphs perform best, shows that the topology of the graph lacks in accuracy and needs the application of weights to counterpoint this lack.",

        "Looking at Table 2, feedback is a clear example of this statement.",
        "As we are not dealing with a single domain within which one can expect to see the \"one sense per discourse\" paradigm, it is clear that the Rho coefficient would not be as good as expected as it is clearly biased by \"incorrect\" counts.",
        "One direct implication of this comment is the use of web estimated lists to evaluate the methodology.",
        "Also, there has been a great discussion over the last few months in the corpora list whether one should use web counts instead of corpus counts to estimate word frequencies.",
        "In our study, we clearly see that web counts show evident problems, like the ones mentioned by (Kilgarriff, 2007).",
        "However, they cannot be discarded so easily.",
        "In particular, we aim at looking at web counts in web directories that would act as specific domains and would reduce the space for ambiguity.",
