        "In SMA method, a short interval has a little effect, while a long one may result in low accuracy.",
        "So we should specify a proper interval.",
        "Through experiments we find that an appropriate interval is between 10 and 20.",
        "Smoothed time series is as follows:",
        "Smoothed time series of terms can be described as curves, in which the coordinate x is day t and coordinate y is Cwt .",
        "Through these curves we can see that, catchwords appear in certain period of time and its usage frequency increases in this period.",

        "2) Peak Value: maximum usage frequency within certain period of time; the larger the peak value is, the higher the popular degree is.",
        "3) Popular Keeping: the decreasing process of usage frequency; the more gently the popular keeping changes, the higher the popular degree is.",
