        "Pictorial communication may also facilitate literacy development and rapid browsing of documents through pictorial summaries.",
        "Pictorial communication research is in its infancy with a spectrum of experimental systems, which we review in Section 2.",
        "At one end of the spectrum, some systems render highly realistic 3D scenes but require specific scene-descriptive language.",
        "At the other end, some systems perform dictionary-based iconic transliteration (turning words into icons one by one) on arbitrary text but the pictures can be hard to understand.",
        "We are interested in using pictorial communication as an assistive communication tool.",
        "Thus, our system needs to be able to handle general text yet produce easy-to-understand pictures, which is in the middle of the spectrum.",

        "Given a piece of text (e.g., a sentence), it first identifies important and easy-to-depict words (or phrases) with natural language processing (NLP) techniques.",
        "It then finds one good icon per word, either from a manually created picture-dictionary, or via image analysis on image search results.",
        "Finally, it lays out the icons to create the picture.",
        "Each step involves several interesting research problems.",
        "This paper focuses exclusively on the picture layout component and addresses the following question: Can we use machine learning and NLP techniques to learn a good picture layout that improves picture comprehension for our target audiences of limited literacy?",

        "At one extreme, there has been significant prior work on \"text-to-scene\" type systems, which were often intended to aid graphic designers in placing objects in a 3D environment.",

        "Perhaps the best known system of this type, WordsEye (Coyne and Sproat, 2001), uses a large manually tagged collection of 3D polyhedral models to create photo-realistic scenes.",
        "Similarly, Car-Sim (Johansson et al., 2005) can create animated scenes, but operates exclusively in the limited domain of reconstructing road accidents from traffic reports.",
        "These systems cater to detailed descriptive text with visual and spatial elements.",
        "They are not intended as assistive tools to communicate general text, which is our goal.",

        "The result is a pictorial summary representing the main idea of the original text, but precisely determining the original text by looking at the picture can be difficult.",
        "At the other extreme, augmentative and alternative communication software allows users to input arbitrary text.",
        "The words, and sometimes common phrases, are semi-automatically transliterated into icons, and displayed in sequential order.",

        "A good picture layout scheme must be intuitive to humans and easy to generate by computers.",
        "To design such a layout, we conducted a pilot study.",
        "Five human annotators produced freehand pictures of many sentences.",
        "Analyzing these pictures, we found a large amount of agreement in the use of arrows to mark actions and to provide structure to what would otherwise be a jumble of icons.",
        "Motivated by the pilot study, we propose a simple layout scheme called ABC.",
        "It features three positions, referred to as A, B, and C. In addition, an arrow points from A through B to C (Figure 1).",
        "These positions are meant to denote certain semantic roles: roughly speaking, A denotes \"who,\" B denotes \"what action,\" and C denotes \"to whom, for what.\"",
        "Each position can contain any number of icons, each representing a word or phrase in the text.",
        "Words that do not play a significant role in the text will be omitted from the ABC layout.",
        "There are two main advantages of the ABC layout:",
        "1.",
        "The ABC positioning of icons allows users to infer the semantic role of the corresponding concepts.",
        "In particular, we found that verbs can be difficult to depict and understand without such hints.",
        "The B position serves as an action indicator to disambiguate between multiple senses of the same icon.",
        "For example, in Figure 1, the school bus icon clearly represents the verb phrase \"rides the bus,\" rather than just the noun \"bus.\"",
        "2.",
        "Such a layout is particularly amenable to machine learning.",
        "Specifically, we can turn the problem of finding the optimal layout for an input sentence into a sequence tagging problem, which is well-studied in NLP.",
        "The girl rides the bus to school in the morning OABBBOCOO B",
        "Given an input sentence, one can assign each word a tag from the set {A, B, C, O}.",
        "The bottom row in Figure 1 shows an example tag sequence.",
        "The tag specifies the ABC layout position of the icon corresponding to that word.",
        "Tag O means \"other\" and marks words not included in the picture.",
        "Within each position, icons appear in the word order in the input sentence.",
        "Therefore, a tag sequence uniquely determines an ABC layout of the picture.",
        "Finding the optimal ABC layout of the input sentence is thus equivalent to computing the most likely tag sequence given the input sentence.",
        "We adopt a machine learning approach by training a sequence tagger for this task.",
        "To do so, we need to collect labeled training data in the form of sentences with manually annotated tag sequences.",
        "We discuss our annotation effort next, and present our machine learning models in Section 4.",
        "We asked the five annotators to manually label 571 sentences compiled from several online sources, including grade school texts about history and science, children's books, and recent news headlines.",
        "Some sentences were written by the annotators and describe daily activities.",
        "The annotators tagged each sentence using a Web-based tool to drag-and-drop icons into the desired positions in the layout.",
        "To gauge the quality of the manually labeled data, and to understand the difficulty of the ABC layout, we computed inter annotator agreement among three of the five annotators on a common set of 48 sentences.",
        "Considering all pairwise comparisons of the three annotators, the overall average tag agreement was 77%.",
        "This measures the total number of matching tags (across all sentences) divided by the total number of tags.",
        "Matching strictly requires both the correct tag and the correct modifier.",
        "We also computed Fleiss' kappa, which measures the degree of inter-annotator agreement beyond the amount expected by chance (Fleiss, 1971).",
        "The values range from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating perfect agreement.",
        "The kappa statistic was 0.71, which is often considered moderate to high agreement.",
        "Further inspection revealed that most disagreement was due to annotators reversing A and C tags.",
        "This could arise from interpreting passive sentences in different ways or trying to represent physical movement.",
        "For example, some annotators found it more natural to depict eating by placing a food item in A and the eater in C, treating the arrow as the transfer of food.",
        "It was also common for annotators to disagree on whether certain adverbs and time modifiers belong in B or in C. These differences all suggest the highly subjective nature of conceptualizing pictures from text."

      "heading": "4. A Conditional Random Field Model for ABC Layout Prediction",
      "text": [
        "We now introduce our approach to automatically predicting the ABC layout of an input sentence.",
        "While it was most natural for human annotators to annotate text at the word level, early experiments quickly revealed that predicting tags at this level is quite challenging.",
        "Most of this stems from the fact that human annotators tend to fragment the text into many small segments based on the availability of good icons.",
        "For example, the phrase \"the white pygmy elephant\" may be tagged as \"O A O A\" because it is difficult for the annotator to find an icon of this exact phrase or the word \"pygmy,\" but easy to find icons of \"white\" and \"elephant\" separately.",
        "Essentially, human annotation combines two tasks in one: deciding where each phrase goes in the layout, and deciding which words within a phrase can be depicted with icons.",
        "To rectify this situation, we make layout predictions at the level of chunks (phrases); that is, we automatically break the text into chunks, then predict one A, B, C, or O tag for each chunk.",
        "Since the tag choices made for different chunks may depend on each other, we employ Conditional Random Fields (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001), which are frequently used in sequential labeling tasks like information extraction.",
        "Our choice of chunking is described in Section 4.1, and the CRF models and input features are described in Section 4.2.",
        "The task of deciding which words within a chunk should appear in the picture is addressed by a \"word pictura-bility\" model, and is discussed in a separate paper.",
        "For training, we automatically map the wordlevel tags in our annotated data to chunk-level tags based on the majority ABC tag within a chunk.",
        "Ideally, we would like semantically coherent text chunks to be represented pictorially in the same layout position.",
        "To obtain such chunks, we leverage existing semantic role labeling (SRL) technology (Palmer et al., 2005; Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002).",
        "SRL is an active NLP task in which words or phrases in a sentence are assigned a label indicating the role they play with respect to a particular verb (also known as the target predicate).",
        "SRL systems like FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) and PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) aim to provide a rich representation for applications requiring some degree of natural language understanding, and are thus perfectly suited for our needs.",
        "We shall focus on PropBank labels because they are easier to use for our task.",
        "To obtain semantic role labels, we use the automatic statistical semantic role labeler ASSERT (Pradhan et al., 2004), trained to identify PropBank arguments through the use of support vector machines and full syntactic parses.",
        "To understand how SRL can be useful for deriving pictorial layouts, consider the sentence \"The boy gave the ball to the girl.\"",
        "PropBank marks the semantic role labels of the \"arguments\" of verbs.",
        "The target verb \"give\" is part of the frameset \"transfer,\" with core arguments \"Arg0: giver\" (the boy), \"Arg1: thing given\" (the ball), and \"Arg2: entity given to\" (the girl).",
        "Verbs can also involve non-core modifier arguments, such as ArgM-TMP (time), ArgM-LOC (location), ArgM-CAU (cause), etc.",
        "The entities playing semantic roles are likely to be entities we want to portray in a picture.",
        "For PropBank, Arg0 often represents an Agent, and Arg1 the Patient or Theme.",
        "If we could map the different semantic role labels to ABC tags with simple rules, then we would be done.",
        "Unfortunately, it is not this simple, as Prop-Bank roles are verb-specific.",
        "As Palmer et al.",
        "pointed out, \"No consistent generalizations can be made across verbs for the higher-numbered arguments\" (Palmer et al., 2005).",
        "In the above example, we might expect a layout rule of [Arg0] – A, [Target, Arg1] – B, [Arg2] – C.",
        "However, this rule does not generalize to other verbs, such as \"drive,\" as in the sentence \"The boy drives his parents crazy,\" which also has three core arguments \"Arg0: driver,\" \"Arg1: thing in motion,\" and \"Arg2: secondary predication on Arg1.\"",
        "However, here the action is figurative, and we would expect a layout rule that puts Arg1 in position C: [Arg0] – A, [Target] – B, [Arg1,Arg2] – C.",
        "In addition, while modifier arguments have the same meaning across verbs, their pictorial representation may differ based on context.",
        "Consider the sentences \"Polar bears live in the Arctic.\"",
        "and \"Yesterday at the zoo, the students saw a polar bear.\"",
        "In the former, a human annotator is likely to place an icon for the ArgM-LOC \"in the Arctic\" in position C (e.g., following a polar bear icon in A and a house icon in B).",
        "However, the ArgM-LOC in the second sentence, \"at the zoo,\" seems more appropriately placed in position B since it describes where this particular action occurred.",
        "Finally, the situation is further complicated when a sentence contains multiple verbs.",
        "SRL treats each verb in isolation, producing multiple sets of role labels, yet our goal is to produce a single picture.",
        "Clearly, the mapping from semantic roles to layout positions is non-trivial.",
        "We describe our statistical machine learning approach next.",
        "We use a linear-chain CRF as our sequence tagging model.",
        "A CRF is a discriminative model of the conditional probability p(y|x), where y is the sequence of layout tags in Y ={A,B,C,O}, and x is the sequence of SRL chunks produced by the process described in Section 4.1.",
        "Our CRF has the general form where the model parameters are {Ak}.",
        "We use binary features fk(yt,yt-1, x,t) detailed below.",
        "Finally, we use an isotropic Gaussian prior N(0, aI) on parameters as regularization.",
        "We explored three versions of the above model by specializing the weighted feature function Ak fk().",
        "Model 1 ignores the pairwise label potentials and treats each labeling prediction independently: Ajk1{yt=j}fk(x,t), where 1{z} is an indicator function on z.",
        "This is equivalent to a multi-class logistic regression classifier.",
        "Model 2 resembles a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) by factoring pairwise label potentials and emission potentials:",
        "Model 3 has the most general linear-chain potential: Ajk 1{yt-1=i}1{yt=j}fk(x,t).",
        "Model 3 is the most flexible, but has the most weights to learn.",
        "We use the following binary predicate features fk (x, t) in all our models, evaluated on each chunk produced by the semantic role labeler:",
        "1.",
        "PropBank role label(s) of the chunk (e.g., Target, Arg0, Arg1, ArgM-LOC).",
        "A chunk can have multiple role labels if the sentence contains multiple verbs; in this case, we merge the multiple SRL results by taking their union.",
        "2.",
        "Part-of-speech tags of all the words in the chunk.",
        "All syntactic parsing results are obtained from the Stanford Parser (Klein and Manning, 2003), using the default PCFG model.",
        "3.",
        "Phrase type (e.g., NP, VP, PP) of the deepest syntactic parse tree node covering the entire chunk.",
        "We also include a feature indicating whether the phrase is nested within an ancestor VP.",

        "Supersenses are 41 broad semantic categories (e.g., noun.location, verb.communication).",
        "By dividing lexical features in this way, we hope to learn specific qualities of common words, but generalize across rarer words.",
        "We also experimented with features derived from typed dependency relations, but these did not improve our models.",
        "We suspect the PropBank role labels capture much of the same information.",
        "In addition, the Google 5000-word list was the best among several word lists that we explored for splitting up the lexical features.",

        "The only tuning parameter is the Gaussian prior variance, a.",
        "We performed 5-fold cross validation, varying a and comparing performance across models.",
        "Figure 2 demonstrates that peak per-chunk accuracy (77.6%) and macro-averaged F1 scores are achieved using the most general sequence labeling model.",
        "As a result, the user study in the next section is based on layouts predicted by Model 3 with a = 1.0, trained on all the data.",
        "To understand which features contribute most to performance, we experimented with removing each of the four types (individually).",
        "Peak accuracy drops the most when lexical features are removed (76.4%), followed by PropBank features (76.5%), phrase features (76.9%), and POS features (77.1%).",
        "The features in the final learned model make intuitive sense.",
        "It prefers tag transitions A-B and B C, but not AC or C A.",
        "The model likes the word \"I\" and noun phrases (not nested in a verb phrase) to have tag A. Verbs and ArgM-NEGs are frequently tagged B, while noun.object's, Arg4s, and ArgM-CAUs are typically C. The model discourages Arg0s and conjunctions in B, and dislikes adverbial phrases and noun.time's in C.",
        "While 77.6% cross validation accuracy may seem low, it is in fact close to the 81% inter annotator agreement, and thus close to optimal.",
        "The confusion matrix (not shown) reveals that most errors probably arise from disagreements in the individual annotators.",
        "The most common errors are predicting B for chunks labeled O and confusing tags B and C. Manually inspecting the pictures in our training set shows that annotators often omitted the verb (such as \"is\" or \"has\") and left the B position empty, since it could be inferred by the presence of the arrow and the images in A and C. Also, annotators tended to disagree on the location of adverbial expressions, dividing them between positions B and C. Finally, only 3.3% of chunks were incorrectly omitted from the pictures.",
        "Therefore, we conclude that our CRF models are capable of predicting the ABC layouts."

        "We describe a user study as our first attempt to answer this question.",

        "In contrast, METEOR finds a one-to-one word alignment between the texts that allows partial matches (after stemming and by considering WordNet-based synonyms) and optionally ignores stop words.",
        "Based on this alignment, unigram precision, recall, and weighted F measure are computed, and the final meteor score is obtained by scaling F to account for word-order preservation.",
        "We computed METEOR using its default parameters and the stop word list from the Snowball project (Porter, 2001).",
        "[Results]: We report average meteor and bleu scores, confidence ratings, and response time for the 4 conditions (native vs. non-native, ABC vs. linear) in Table 1.",
        "The most striking observation is that native speakers perform better (in terms of METEOR and BLEU) with the linear layout, while non-native speakers do better with ABC.",
        "To explain this finding, it is worth noting that SymWriter pictures include function words, whose icons are abstract but distinct.",
        "We speculate that even though none of our subjects were trained to recognize these function-word icons, the native speakers are more accustomed to the English syntactic structure, so they may be able to transliterate those icons back to words.",
        "In an ABC layout, the sentence order is mostly removed, and some phrases might be omitted due to the O tag.",
        "Thus native speakers do not get as many syntactic hints.",
        "On the other hand, non-native speakers do not have the same degree of built-in English syntactic knowledge.",
        "As such, they do not gain much from seeing the whole sentence sequence including function-word icons.",
        "Instead, they may have benefited from the ABC layout's added organization and potential exclusion of irrelevant icons.",
        "If this reasoning holds, it has interesting implications for viewers who have lower English literacy: they might take away more meaning from a semantically structured layout like ABC.",
        "Verifying this is a direction for future work.",
        "Finally, it is interesting that all subjects feel more confident in their responses to ABC layouts than linear layouts, and, despite their added complexity, ABC layouts do not require more response time than linear layouts.",
