        "The civilization of ancient Greece, from which the Western world has received much of its heritage, has justly received a significant amount of scholarly attention.",
        "To gain a deeper understanding of the civilization, access to the essays, poems, and other Greek documents in the original language is indispensable.",
        "Ancient Greek is a highly inflected Indo-European language.",
        "A verb, for example, is inflected according to its person, number, voice, tense/aspect and mood.",
        "According to (Crane, 1991), \"a single verb could have roughly 1,000 forms, and, if we consider that any verb may be preceded by up to three distinct prefixes, the number of forms explodes to roughly 5,000,000.\"",
        "The inflections are realized by prefixes and suffixes to the stem, and sometimes spelling changes within the stem.",
        "'All Greek words are transcribed into the Roman alphabet in this paper.",
        "The acute, grave and circumflex accents are represented by diacritics, as in 6, b and o, respectively.",
        "Smooth breathing marks are omitted; rough breathing marks are signalled by h. Underbars used in e and o represent eta and omega.",
        "These numerous forms can be further complicated by accents, and by additional spelling changes at morpheme boundaries for phonological reasons.",
        "The overall effect can yield an inflected form in which the root is barely recognizable.",
        "Indeed, a staple exercise for students of ancient Greek is to identify the root form of an inflected verb.",
        "This skill is essential; without knowing the root form, one cannot understand the meaning of the word, or even look it up in a dictionary.",
        "For Classics scholars, these myriad forms also pose formidable challenges.",
        "In order to search for occurrences of a word in a corpus, all of its forms must be enumerated, since words do not frequently appear in their root forms.",
        "This procedure becomes extremely labor-intensive for small words that overlap with other common words (Crane, 1991).",
        "Automatic morphological analysis of ancient Greek would be useful for both educational and research purposes.",
        "In fact, one of the first analyzers was developed as a pedagogical tool (Packard, 1973).",
        "Today, a widely used analyzer is embedded in the Perseus Digital Library (Crane, 1996), an internet resource utilized by both students and researchers.",
        "This paper presents an analyzer of ancient Greek that infers the root form of a word.",
        "It introduces two innovations.",
        "First, it utilizes a nearest-neighbor framework that requires no hand-crafted rules, and provides analogies to facilitate learning.",
        "Person/Num Form Person/Num Form lst/singular lüo lst/plural lüomen 2nd/singular lüeis 2nd/plural lüete 3rd/singular lüei 3rd/plural lüousi(n) of an unseen verb.",
        "The nearest-neighbor machine learning framework is utilized to provide these analogies.",
        "Given a word in an inflected form (e.g., phereis), the algorithm searches for the root form (pherq) among its \"neighbors\", by making substitutions to its prefix and suffix.",
        "Valid substitutions are to be harvested from pairs of inflected and root forms (e.g., {lueis, luo)) in the training set; these pairs, then, can serve as analogies to reinforce learning.",
        "Furthermore, these affix substitutions can be learned automatically, reducing the amount of engineering efforts.",
        "They also increase the transparency of the analyzer, showing explicitly how it derives the root.",
        "Ancient Greek, in its many dialects, has been used from the time of Homer to the Middle Ages, in texts of a wide range of genres.",
        "Even the most comprehensive dictionaries do not completely cover its extensive vocabulary.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, all existing analyzers for ancient Greek require a predefined database of stems; thus, they are likely to run into words with unknown or novel roots, which they are not designed to analyze.",
        "Rather than expanding an existing database to increase coverage, we create a mechanism to handle all novel roots.",
        "Since words do not often appear in their root forms, inferring a novel root from a surface form is no easy task (Linden, 2008).",
        "We propose the use of unlabelled data to guide the determination of a novel root."

        "After a brief discussion on morphological analysis in general, we will review existing analyzers for ancient Greek in particular.",
        "A fundamental task in morphological analysis is the segmentation of a word into morphemes, that is, the smallest meaningful units in the word.",
        "Unsupervised methods have been shown to perform well in this task.",
        "In the recent Pascal challenge, the best results were achieved by (Keshava and Pitler, 2006).",
        "Their algorithm discovers affixes by considering words that appear as substrings of other words, and by estimating probabilities for morpheme boundaries.",

        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "We first motivate these innovations (§2) and summarize previous research in morphological analysis (§3).",

        "Typically, a student of ancient Greek is expected to memorize a series of \"paradigms\", such as the one shown in Table 1, which can fill several pages in a grammar book.",
        "Although the paradigm table shows the inflection of only one particular verb, luo (\"to loosen\"), the student needs to apply the patterns to other verbs.",
        "In practice, rather than abstracting the patterns, many students simply memorize these \"paradigmatic\" verbs, to be used as analogies for identifying the root form of an unseen verb.",
        "Suppose the unseen verb is phereis (\"you carry\"); the reasoning would then be, \"I know that lueis is the second person singular form of the root luo; similarly, phereis must be the second person singular form of phero?'",
        "The use of analogy can be especially useful when dealing with a large number of rules, for example with the so-called \"contract verbs\".",
        "The stem of a contract verb ends in a vowel; when a vowel-initial suffix is attached to the stem, spelling changes occur.",
        "For instance, the stem plero- (\"to fill\") combined with the suffix omen becomes pler-ou-men, due to interaction between two omicrons at the boundary.",
        "While it is possible to derive these changes from first principles, or memorize the rules for all vowel permutations (e.g., \"o\" + \"o\" = \"om\"), it might be easier to recall the spelling changes seen in a familiar verb (e.g., pleroo – ► pleroumen), and then use analogy to infer the root proach is the use of Minimum Description Length, which iteratively shortens the length of the morphological grammar (Goldsmith, 2001).",
        "Spelling changes at morpheme boundaries (e.g., deny but denial) can be captured by orthographic rules such as \"change y-to /- when the suffix is -aF\\ Such rules are specified manually in the two-level model of morphology (Koskenniemi, 1983), but they can also be induced (Dasgupta, 2007).",
        "Al-lomorphs (e.g., \"denf and \"dew/') are also automatically identified in (Dasgupta, 2007), but the general problem of recognizing highly irregular forms is examined more extensively in (Yarowsky and Wicentowski, 2000).",
        "They attempt to align every verb to its root form, by exploiting a combination of frequency similarity, context similarity, edit distance and morphological transformation probabilities, all estimated from an unannotated corpus.",
        "An accuracy of 80.4% was achieved for highly irregular words in the test set.",
        "Ancient Greek presents a few difficulties that prevent a naive application of the minimally supervised approach in (Yarowsky and Wicentowski, 2000).",
        "First, frequency and context analyses are sensitive to data sparseness, which is more pronounced in heavily inflected languages, such as Greek, than in English.",
        "Many inflected forms do not appear more than a few times.",
        "Second, many root forms do not appear in the corpus.",
        "In Finnish and Swahili, also highly inflected languages, only 40 to 50% of words appear in root forms (Linden, 2008).",
        "The same may be expected of ancient Greek.",
        "Indeed, for these languages, predicting novel roots is a challenging problem.",
        "This task has been tackled in (Adler et al., 2008) for modern Hebrew, and in (Linden, 2008) for Finnish.",
        "In the former, features such as letter ra-grams and word-formation patterns are used to predict the morphology of Hebrew words unknown to an existing analyzer.",
        "In the latter, a probabilistic approach is used for harvesting prefixes and suffixes in Finnish words, favoring the longer ones.",
        "However, no strategy was proposed for irregular spelling in stems.",
        "Table 2: Sample data from parts of Genesis 1:2 (\"and the Spirit of God was hovering over...\").",
        "The original annotation is more extensive, and only the portion utilized in this research is shown here.",
        "The two most well-known analyzers for ancient Greek are both rule-based systems, requiring a priori knowledge of the possible stems and affixes, which are manually compiled.",
        "To give a rough idea, some 40,000 stems and 13,000 inflections are known by the morpheus system, which will be described below.",
        "The algorithm in morph (Packard, 1973) searches for possible endings that would result in a stem in its database.",
        "If unsuccessful, it then attempts to remove prepositions and prefixes from the beginning of the word.",
        "Accents, essential for disambiguation in some cases, are ignored.",
        "The analyzer was applied on Plato's Apology to study the distribution of word endings, for the purpose of optimizing the order of grammar topics to be covered in an introductory course.",
        "Evaluation of the analyzer stressed this pedagogical perspective, and the accuracy of the analyses is not reported.",
        "Morpheus (Crane, 1991) augments Morph with a generation component which, given a stem, enumerates all possible inflections in different dialects, including accents.",
        "When accents are considered during analysis, the precision of the analyzer improves by a quarter.",
        "However, the actual precision and the test set are not specified.",

        "As discussed in §6.1, the algorithm first searched with circumfix.",
        "For 77.5% of the words, a neighbor was found using this subset of affix transformations.",
        "The rest were then processed using the backup procedure, Prefix/Suffix, allowing prefix and suffix transformations culled from different word-pairs.",
        "This procedure found neighbors for 10.8% of the words; novel roots were hypothesized for the remainder.",
        "Not surprisingly, known roots were more reliably predicted (94.5%) with circumfixes than with separate prefixes and suffixes (61.2%), but both categories still achieved higher accuracy than the challenging task of proposing novel roots (50.0%).",
        "We now take a closer look at the errors for both known and novel roots.",
        "There are three main sources of error.",
        "The first is noise in the affix transformations.",

        "When applied on pasato, along with a suffix transformation, it yielded the false root form phasko.",

        "This prefix is by itself perfectly viable, but \"e-\" and \"-antes\" cannot occur together as a circumfix.",
        "The resulting string happened to match the root kteino, rather than the true root teino.",
        "A third source is confusion between parts-of-speech, most commonly noun and verb.",
        "For example, the nearest neighbor of the genitive noun lupon was the verb lupesei, yielding the verb root lupeo rather than the noun lupe.",
        "As a baseline, the distance metric (§5.1) was used alone to rank the novel candidate roots.",
        "As seen in Table 6, performance dropped to 45.0%.",
        "When the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae corpus was utilized to rerank the novel candidate roots proposed by the baseline, an absolute gain of 5% was achieved.",
        "A further 5.2% of the mistakes were due to placing the accent incorrectly, such as ktendtrophos rather than ktenotrophos, mostly on nouns and adjectives.",
        "These mistakes are difficult to rectify, since multiple positions are often possible.",
        "Finally, to measure the extent to which part-of-speech (POS) confusions are responsible, we performed an experiment in which the gold-standard POS of each word was supplied to the analyzer (see \"Oracle POS\" in Table 6).",
        "When deriving novel roots, only those affix transformations belonging to the oracle POS were considered.",
