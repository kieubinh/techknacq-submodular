        "This shared task not only unifies the shared tasks of the previous four years under a unique dependency-based formalism, but also extends them significantly: this year's syntactic dependencies include more information such as named-entity boundaries; the semantic dependencies model roles of both verbal and nominal predicates.",

        "Using this formalism, this shared task merges both the task of syntactic dependency parsing and the task of identifying semantic arguments and labeling them with semantic roles.",
        "Conceptually, the 2008 shared task can be divided into three sub tasks: (i) parsing of syntactic dependencies, (ii) identification and disambiguation of semantic predicates, and (iii) identification of arguments and assignment of semantic roles for each predicate.",
        "Several objectives were addressed in this shared task:",
        "• SRL is performed and evaluated using a dependency-based representation for both syntactic and semantic dependencies.",
        "While SRL on top of a dependency treebank has been addressed before (Hacioglu, 2004), our approach has several novelties: (i) our constituent-to-dependency conversion strategy transforms all annotated semantic arguments in PropBank and NomBank not just a subset; (ii) we address propositions centered around both verbal (PropBank) and nominal (NomBank) predicates.",
        "• Based on the observation that a richer set of syntactic dependencies improves semantic processing (lohansson and Nugues, 2007), the syntactic dependencies modeled are more complex than the ones used in the previous CoNLL shared tasks.",
        "For example, we now include apposition links, dependencies derived from named entity (NE) structures, and better modeling of long-distance grammatical relations.",
        "• A practical framework is provided for the joint learning of syntactic and semantic dependencies.",
        "Given the complexity of this shared task, we limited the evaluation to a monolingual, English-only setting.",
        "The evaluation is separated into two different challenges: a closed challenge, where systems have to be trained strictly with information contained in the given training corpus, and an open challenge, where systems can be developed making use of any kind of external tools and resources.",
        "The participants could submit results in either one or both challenges.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 defines the task, including the format of the data, the evaluation metrics, and the two challenges.",
        "Section 3 introduces the corpora used and our constituent-to-dependency conversion procedure.",
        "Section 4 summarizes the results of the submitted systems.",

      "text": [
        "In this section we provide the definition of the shared task, starting with the format of the shared task data, followed by a description of the evaluation metrics used and a discussion of the two shared task challenges, i.e., closed and open.",
        "The data format used in this shared task was highly influenced by the formats used in the 2004-2007 shared tasks.",
        "The data follows these general rules:",
        "• The files contain sentences separated by a blank line.",
        "• A sentence consists of one or more tokens and the information for each token is represented on a separate line.",
        "• A token consists of at least 11 fields.",
        "The fields are separated by one or more whites-pace characters (spaces or tabs).",
        "Whitespace characters are not allowed within fields.",
        "Table 1 describes the fields stored for each token in the closed-track data sets.",
        "Columns 1-3 and 5-8 are available at both training and test time.",
        "Column 4, which contains gold-standard part-of-speech (POS) tags, is not given at test time.",
        "The same holds for columns 9 and above, which contain the syntactic and semantic dependency structures that the systems should predict.",
        "The PPOS and PPOSS fields were automatically predicted using the SVMTool POS tagger (Gimenez, 2004).",
        "To predict the tags in the training set, a 5-fold cross-validation procedure was used.",
        "The LEMMA and SPLIT_LEMMA fields were predicted using the built-in lemmatizer in WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) based on the most frequent sense for the form and part-of-speech tag.",
        "Since NomBank uses a sub-word analysis in some hyphenated words (such as \\finger]j±KG-\\pointing]pRED}> ^e data format represents the parts in hyphenated words as separate tokens (columns 6-8).",
        "However, the format also represents how the parts originally fit together before splitting (columns 2-5).",
        "Padding characters (\"_\") are used in columns 2-5 to ensure the same number of rows for all columns corresponding to one sentence.",
        "All syntactic and semantic dependencies are annotated relative to the split word forms (columns 6-8).",
        "Table 2 shows the columns available to the systems participating in the open challenge: named-entity labels as in the CoNLL-2003 Shared Task (Tjong Kim San and De Meulder, 2003) and from the BBN Wall Street lournal Entity Corpus,WordNet supersense tags, and the output of an off-the-shelf dependency parser (Nivre et al., 2007b).",
        "Columns 1-3 were predicted using the tagger of Ciaramita and Altun (2006).",
        "Because the BBN corpus shares lexical content with the Penn Treebank, we generated the BBN tags using a 2-fold cross-validation procedure.",
        "We separate the evaluation measures into two groups: (i) official measures, which were used for the ranking of participating systems, and (ii) additional unofficial measures, which provide further insight into the performance of the participating systems.",
        "The official evaluation measures consist of three different scores: (i) syntactic dependencies are scored using the labeled attachment score (LAS), (ii) semantic dependencies are evaluated using a labeled Fi score, and (iii) the overall task is scored with a macro average of the two previous scores.",
        "We describe all these scoring measures next.",
        "The LAS score is defined similarly as in the previous two shared tasks, as the percentage of to-",
        "Table 1 : Column format in the closed-track data.",
        "The columns in the lower part of the table are unseen at test time and are to be predicted by systems.",
        "kens for which a system has predicted the correct HEAD and DEPREL columns (see Table 1).",
        "Same as before, our scorer also computes the unlabeled attachment score (UAS), i.e., the percentage of tokens with correct HEAD, and label accuracy, i.e., the percentage of tokens with correct DEPREL.",
        "The semantic propositions are evaluated by converting them to semantic dependencies, i.e., we create a semantic dependency from every predicate to all its individual arguments.",
        "These dependencies are labeled with the labels of the corresponding arguments.",
        "Additionally, we create a semantic dependency from each predicate to a virtual ROOT node.",
        "The latter dependencies are labeled with the predicate senses.",
        "This approach guarantees that the semantic dependency structure conceptually forms a single-rooted, connected (but not necessarily acyclic) graph.",
        "More importantly, this scoring strategy implies that if a system assigns the incorrect predicate sense, it still receives some points for the arguments correctly assigned.",
        "For example, for the correct proposition:",
        "the system that generates the following output for the same argument tokens:",
        "receives a labeled precision score of 2/4 because two out of four semantic dependencies are incorrect: the dependency to ROOT is labeled 0 2 instead of 01 and the dependency to the ARGM-TMP is incorrectly labeled ARGM-LOC.",
        "Using this strategy we compute precision, recall, and Fi scores for both labeled and unlabeled semantic dependencies.",
        "Finally, we combine the syntactic and semantic measures into one global measure using macro averaging.",
        "We compute macro precision and recall scores by averaging the labeled precision and recall for semantic dependencies with the LAS for syntactic dependencies:",
        "where LMP is the labeled macro precision and LPsem is the labeled precision for semantic dependencies.",
        "Similarly, LMR is the labeled macro recall and LRsem is the labeled recall for semantic dependencies.",
        "Wsem is the weight assigned to the semantic task.",

        "The first additional measure used is Exact Match, which reports the percentage of sentences that are completely correct, i.e., all the generated syntactic dependencies are correct and all the semantic propositions are present and correct.",
        "While this score is significantly lower than any of the official scores, it will award systems that performed joint learning or optimization for all subtasks.",
        "In the same spirit but focusing on the semantic subtasks, we report the Perfect Proposition F\\ score, where we score entire semantic frames or propositions.",
        "This measure is similar to the PProps accuracy score from the 2005 shared task (Carreras and Marquez, 2005), with the caveat that this year this score is implemented as an Fi measure, because predicates are not provided in the test data.",
        "Hence, propositions may be over or under generated at prediction time.",
        "Lastly, we analyze systems based on the ratio between labeled Fi score for semantic dependencies and the LAS for syntactic dependencies.",
        "In other words, this measure normalizes the semantic scores relative to the performance of the parsing component.",
        "This measure estimates the true overall performance of the semantic subtasks, independent of the syntactic parser.",
        "For example, this score addresses the situations where the semantic labeled Fi score of one system is artificially low because the corresponding syntactic component does not perform well.",
        "Similarly to the CoNLL-2005 shared task, this shared task evaluation is separated into two challenges:",
        "Closed Challenge - systems have to be built strictly with information contained in the given training corpus, and tuned with the development section.",
        "In addition, the PropBank and NomBank lexical frames can be used.",
        "These restrictions mean that constituent-based parsers or SRL systems can not be used in this challenge because the constituent-based annotations are not provided in our training set.",
        "The aim of this challenge is to compare the performance of the participating systems in a fair environment.",
        "Open Challenge - systems can be developed making use of any kind of external tools and resources.",
        "The only condition is that such tools or resources must not have been developed with the annotations of the test set, both for the input and output annotations of the data.",
        "In this challenge, we are interested in learning methods which make use of any tools or resources that might improve the performance.",
        "For example, we encourage the use of semantic information, as provided by NE recognition or word-sense disambiguation (WSD) systems (such state-of-the-art annotations are provided by the organizers, see Table 2).",
        "Also, in this challenge participants are encouraged to use constituent-based parsers and SRL systems, as long as these systems were trained only with the sections of Penn Treebank used in the shared task training corpus.",
        "To encourage the participation of the groups that are only interested in SRL, the organizers provide also the output of a state-of-the-art dependency parser as input in this challenge.",
        "The comparison of different systems in this setting may not be fair, and thus ranking of systems is not necessarily important.",
        "The corpora used in the shared task evaluation were generated through a process that merges several input corpora and converts them from the constituent-based formalism to dependencies.",
        "This section starts with an introduction of the input corpora used, followed by a description of the constituent-to-dependency conversion process.",
        "The section concludes with an overview of the shared task corpora.",
        "Input to our merging procedures includes the Penn Treebank, BBN's named entity corpus, PropBank and NomBank.",
        "In this section, we will provide brief descriptions of these annotations in terms of both form and content.",
        "All annotations are currently being distributed by the Linguistic Data Consortium, with the exception of NomBank, which is freely downloadable.",
        "The Penn Treebank 3 corpus (Marcus et al., 1993) consists of hand-coded parses of the Wall Street Journal (test, development and training) and a small subset of the Brown corpus (W. N. Francis and H. Kucera, 1964) (test only).",
        "These hand parses are notated in-line and sometimes involve changing the strings of the input data.",
        "For example, in file wsj_0309, the token fearlast in the text corresponds to the two tokens fear and last in the annotated data.",
        "In a similar way, cannot is regularly split to can and not.",
        "It is significant that the other annotations assume the tokenization of the Penn Treebank, as this makes it easier for us to merge the annotation.",
        "The Penn Treebank syntactic annotation includes phrases, parts of speech, empty category representations of various filler/gap constructions and other phenomena, based on a theoretical perspective similar to that of Government and Binding Theory (Chomsky, 1981).",
        "BBN's NE annotation of the Wall Street Journal corpus (Weischedel and Brunstein, 2005) takes the form of SGML inline markup of text, tokenized to be completely compatible with the Penn Treebank annotation, e.g., fearlast and cannot are split in the same ways.",
        "Named entity categories include: Person, Organization, Location, GPE, Facility, Money, Percent, Time and Date, based on the definitions of these categories in MUC (Chin-chor and Robinson, 1998) and ACE tasks.",
        "Subcategories are included as well.",
        "Note however that from this corpus we only use NE boundaries to derive NAME dependencies between NE tokens, e.g., we create a NAME dependency from Mary to Smith given the NE mention Mary Smith.",
        "The PropBank annotation (Palmer et al., 2005) classifies the arguments of all the main verbs in the Penn Treebank corpus, other than be.",
        "Arguments are numbered (ARGO, ARG1,...) based on lexical entries or frame files.",
        "Different sets of arguments are assumed for different rolesets.",
        "Dependent constituents that fall into categories independent of the lexical entries are classified as various types of ARGM (TMP, ADV, etc.).",
        "Rather than using PropBank directly, we used the version created for the CoNLL-2005 shared task (Carreras and Marquez, 2005).",
        "PropBank's pointers to subtrees are converted into the list of leaves of those subtrees, minus the empty categories.",
        "On occasion, arguments of verbs end up being two non-adjacent substrings.",
        "For example, the argument of claims in the following sentence is indicated in bold: This sentence, Mary claims, is self-referential.",
        "The CoNLL-2005 format handles this by marking both strings Al (This sentence and is self-referential), but adding a C-prefix to the argument tag on the second argument.",
        "Another difference between the PropBank annotation and the CoNLL-2005 version of it is their treatments of filler gap constructions involving empty categories.",
        "PropBank annotation includes the whole chain of empty categories, as well as the antecedent of the empty category (the filler of the gap).",
        "In contrast, the CoNLL-2005 version only includes the filler of the gap and if there is no filler, the argument is omitted, e.g., no ARGO (subject) for leave would be included in / said to leave because the subject of leave is unspecified.",
        "NomBank annotation (Meyers et al., 2004) uses essentially the same framework as PropBank to annotate arguments of nouns.",
        "Differences between PropBank and NomBank stem from differences between noun and verb argument structure; differences in treatment of nouns and verbs in the Penn Treebank; and differences in the sophistication of previous research about noun and verb argument structure.",
        "Only the subset of nouns that take arguments are annotated in NomBank and only a subset of the non-argument siblings of nouns are marked as ARGM.",
        "These limitations were necessary to make the NomBank task consistent and tractable.",
        "In addition, long distance dependencies of nouns, e.g., the relation between Mary and walk in Mary took dozens of walks is handled as follows: Mary is marked as the ARGO of walk and took + dozens + of is marked as a support chain in NomBank.",
        "In contrast, verbal long distance dependencies can be handled by means of empty categories in the Penn Treebank, e.g., the relation between John and walked in John seemed t to walk.",
        "Support chains are needed because nominal long distance dependencies are not captured under the Penn Treebank's system of empty categories.",
        "There exists no large-scale dependency treebank for English, and we thus had to construct a dependency-annotated corpus automatically from the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993).",
        "Since dependency syntax represents grammatical structure by means of labeled binary head-dependent relations rather than phrases, the task of the conversion procedure is to identify and label the head-dependent pairs.",
        "The idea underpinning constituent-to-dependency conversion algorithms (Magerman, 1994; Collins, 1999; Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003) is that head-dependent pairs are created from constituents by selecting one word in each phrase as the head and setting all other as its dependents.",
        "The dependency labels are then inferred from the phrase-subphrase or phrase-word relations.",
        "Our conversion procedure (Johansson and Nugues, 2007) differs from this basic approach by exploiting the rich structure of the constituent format used in Penn Treebank 3:",
        "• Grammatical function labels that often can be directly used in the dependency framework.",
        "• Long-distance grammatical relations represented by means of empty categories and secondary edges, which can be used to create (often nonprojective) dependency links.",
        "Of the grammatical function tags available in the Treebank, we removed the HLN, NOM, TPC, and TTL tags since they represent structural properties of single phrases rather than binary relations.",
        "For compatibility between the WSJ and Brown corpora, we removed the ETC, UNF, and IMP tags from Brown and the CLR tag from WSJ.",
        "Algorithms 1 and 2 show the constituent-to-dependency conversion algorithm and function labeling, respectively.",
        "The first steps apply structural transformations to the constituent trees.",
        "Next, a head word is assigned to each constituent.",
        "After this, grammatical functions are inferred, allowing a dependency tree to be created.",

        "NE annotation, e.g., identifying that Smith depends on Mary which depends on appointment in the Mary Smith appointment; (iii) identifying TITLE and POSTHON dependencies, e.g., determining that Ms. and /// depend on Mary in Ms. Mary Smith III.",
        "These identifications were carried out by hand-coded rules that have been fine tuned as part of GLARF, over the past several years.",
        "For example, identifying apposition constructions requires identifying that both the head and the apposite can stand alone - proper nouns {John Smith), plural nouns {books), and singular common nouns with determiners {the book) are standalone cases, whereas singular nouns without determiners {green book) do not qualify.",
        "We split Treebank tokens at a hyphen (-) or a forward slash (/) if the segments on either side of these delimiters are: (a) a word in a dictionary (COMLEX Syntax or any of the dictionaries available on the NOMLEX website); (b) part of a markable Named Entity; or (c) a prefix from the list: co, pre, post, un, anti, ante, ex, extra, fore, non, over, pro, re, super, sub, tri, bi, uni, ultra.",
        "For example, York-based was split into 3 segments: (1) York, (2) - and (3) based.",
        "When encoding the semantic dependencies, it was necessary to convert the underlying constituent analysis of PropBank and NomBank into a dependency analysis.",
        "Because semantic predicates are already assigned to individual tokens in both PropBank (the version used for the CoNLL-2005 shared task) and NomBank, constituent-to-dependency conversion is thus necessary only for semantic arguments.",
        "Conceptually, this conversion can be handled using similar heuristics as described in Section 3.2.1.",
        "However, in order to avoid replicating this effort and to ensure compatibility between syntactic and semantic dependencies, we decided to generate semantic dependencies using only argument boundaries and the syntactic dependencies generated in Section 3.2.1, i.e., ignoring syntactic constituents.",
        "Given this input, we identify the head of a semantic argument using the following heuristic:",
        "The head of a semantic argument is assigned to the token inside the argument boundaries whose head is a token outside the argument boundaries.",
        "This heuristic works remarkably well: over 99% of the PropBank arguments in the training corpus have a single token whose head is located outside of the argument boundaries.",
        "As a simple example, consider the following annotated text: [sold]pRED[1214 cars] ARG1 [in the US.]ARGM_LQC.",
        "Using the above heuristic, the head of the ARG1 argument is set to cars, because it has an OBJ dependency to sold, and the head of the ARGM-LOC argument is set to in, because it modifies sold through a LOC dependency.",
        "While this heuristic processes the vast majority of arguments, there are several cases that require special treatment.",
        "We discuss these situations in the remainder of this section.",
        "Arguments with several syntactic heads",
        "For 0.7% of the semantic arguments, the above heuristic detects several syntactic heads for the given boundary.",
        "For example, in the text [it] ARGO [experts]pre[its U.S. sales to remain steady at about 1200 cars]ARG^, ^e ab°ve heuristic assigns two syntactic heads to ARG1: sales, which modifies expects through an OBJ dependency, and to, which modifies expects through a PRD dependency.",
        "These situations are caused by the constituent-to-dependency conversion process described in Section 3.2.1, which in some cases interprets syntax differently than the original Treebank annotation, e.g., the raising phenomenon for the PRD dependency in the above example.",
        "In such cases, we split the original argument into a sequence of discontinuous arguments, e.g., the ARG1 in the above example becomes [its U.S. sales] ARG^ [to remain steady at about 1200 cars]c_ARG1.",
        "Merging discontinuous arguments",
        "While in the above case we split arguments, there are situations where we can merge arguments that were initially discontinuous in PropBank or NomBank.",
        "This typically happens when the Prop-Bank/NomBank predicate is infixed inside one of its arguments.",
        "For example, in the text [Million-dollar conferences] arg 1 were [^e^]pRED it0chew on subjects such as... ]c-ARGl' PropBank lists multiple constituents as aggregately filling the ARG1 slot of held.",
        "These cases are detected automatically because the least common ancestor of the argument pieces is actually one of the argument segments.",
        "In the above example, to chew on subjects such as... depends on Million-dollar conferences because to modifies conferences through a NMOD dependency.",
        "In these situations, we treat the least common ancestor, e.g., conferences in the above text, as the true argument.",
        "This heuristic allowed us to merge 1665 (or 0.6% of total) arguments that were initially discontinuous in the Prop-Bank training corpus.",
        "Empty categories",
        "PropBank and NomBank both encode chains of empty categories.",
        "As with the 2005 shared task (Carreras and Marquez, 2005), we used the head of the antecedent of empty categories as arguments rather than empty categories.",
        "Furthermore, empty category arguments with no antecedents were ignored.",
        "For example, given The man wanted t to make a speech, we assume that the AO of make and speech is man, rather than the chain consisting of the empty category represented as t and man.",

        "In this case, the constituents are adjacent to each other.",
        "For example, consider the NP the human rights discussion.",
        "In this case, the Penn Treebank would treat each of the four words the, human, rights, discussion as daughters of a single NP node.",
        "However, NomBank would treat human rights as a single ARG1 of discussion.",
        "Since noun noun modification constructions are head final, we can easily determine (via GLARF) that rights is the markable dependent of discussion.",
        "Support chains",
        "Finally, NomBank's encoding of support chains is handled as chains of dependencies in the data (although these are not scored).",
        "For example, given Mary took dozens of walks, where Mary is the ARG0 of walks, the support chain took + dozens + of is represented as a sequence of dependencies: of depends on Mary, dozens depends on of and took depends on dozens.",
        "Each of these dependencies is labeled SU.",

        "Nineteen groups submitted test runs in the closed challenge and five groups participated in the open challenge.",
        "Three of the latter groups participated only in the open challenge, and two of these submitted results only for the semantic subtask.",
        "These results are summarized in Tables 10 and 11.",
        "Table 10 summarizes the official results - i.e., results at evaluation deadline - for the closed challenge.",
        "Note that several teams corrected bugs and/or improved their systems and they submitted post-evaluation scores (accounted in the shared task website).",
        "The table indicates that most of the top results cluster together: three systems had a labeled macro Fi score on the WSJ+Brown corpus around 82 points (che, ciaramita, and zhao); five systems scored around 79 labeled macro Fi points (yuret, samuelsson, zhang, henderson, and watanabe).",
        "Remarkably, the top-scoring system (Johansson) is in a class of its own, with scores 2-3 points higher than the next system.",
        "This is most likely caused by the fact that Johansson and Nugues (2008) implemented a thorough system that addressed all facets of the task with state-of-the-art methods: second-order parsing model, argument identification/classification models separately tuned for PropBank and NomBank, rerank-ing inference for the SRL task, and, finally, joint optimization of the complete task using meta-learning (more details in Section 5).",
        "Table 11 lists the official results in the open challenge.",
        "The results in this challenge are lower than in the closed challenge, but this was somewhat to be expected considering that there were fewer participants in this challenge and none of the top five groups in the closed challenge submitted results in the open challenge.",
        "Only one of the systems that participated in both challenges (zhang) improved the results submitted in the closed challenge.",
        "Zhang et al.",
        "(2008) achieved this by extracting features for their semantic subtask models both from the parser used in the closed challenge and a secondary parser that was trained on a different corpus.",
        "The improvements measured were relatively small for the in-domain WSJ corpus (0.2 labeled macro Fi points) but larger for the out-of-domain Brown corpus (approximately 1 labeled macro Fi point).",
        "Tables 10 and 11 indicate that in both challenges the results on the out-of-domain corpus (Brown) are much lower than the results measured in-domain (WSJ).",
        "The difference is around 7-8 LAS points for the syntactic subtask and 12-14 labeled Fi points for semantic dependencies.",
        "Overall, this yields a drop of approximately 10 labeled macro Fi points for most systems.",
        "This performance decrease on out-of-domain corpora is consistent with the results reported in CoNLL-2005 on SRL (using the same Brown corpus).",
        "These results indicate that domain adaptation is a problem that is far from being solved for both syntactic and semantic analysis of text.",
        "Furthermore, as the scores on the syntactic and semantic subtasks indicate, domain adaptation becomes even harder as the task to be solved gets more complex.",

        "Furthermore, the average difference between labeled Fi scores on the Brown corpus alone is 12.36 points.",
        "This indicates that the problem of SRL for nominal predicates is more sensitive to domain changes than the equivalent problem for verbal predicates.",
        "Our conjecture is that, because there is very little syntactic structure between nominal predicates and their arguments, SRL models for nominal predicates select mainly lexical features, which are more brittle than syntactic or other non-lexicalized features.",

        "This can give a significant boost to the adoption of this technology in real-world applications.",
