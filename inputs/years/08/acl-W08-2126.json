        "For obtaining syntactic dependencies, we have combined the results of two state-of-the-art dependency parsers: the MST parser (McDonald et al., 2005) and the MaltParser (Nivre et al., 2007).",
        "The MST parser formalizes dependency parsing as searching for maximum spanning trees (MSTs) in directed graphs.",
        "A major advantage of their framework is the ability to naturally and efficiently model both projective and non-projective parses.",
        "To learn these structures they used online large-margin learning that empirically provides state-of-the-art performance.",

        "The learning method they applied is support vector machine and experimental evaluation confirms that the MaltParser can achieve robust, efficient and accurate parsing for a wide range of languages.",
        "Since both their parsing algorithms and machine learning methods are quite different, we decide to take advantages of them.",

        "The semantic role labeling component of our system is comprised of a pipeline model with four subcomponents that performs predicate identification (PI), argument identification (AI), argument classification (AC) and predicate classification (PC) respectively.",
        "The output in previous steps are taken as input information to the following stages.",
        "All these components are essentially based on a maximum entropy statistical classifier, although with different task-specific optimizations and feature configurations in each step.",
        "Depending on the available information from the input data structure, the same architecture is used for both closed and open challenge runs, with different feature types.",
        "Note that our system does not make use of or predict SU chains.",
        "Predicate Identification The component makes binary prediction on each input token whether it forms a predicate in the input sentence.",
        "This predictor precedes other components because it is a relatively easy task (comparing to the following components).",
        "Also, making this prediction early helps to cut down the search space in the following steps.",
        "Based on the observation on the training data, we limit the PI predictor to only predict for tokens with certain POS types (POSes marked as predicates for at least 50 times in the training set).",
        "This helps to significantly improve the system efficiency in both training and prediction time without sacrificing prediction accuracy.",
        "It should be noted that the prediction of nominal predicates are generally much more difficult (based on CoNLL 2008 shared task annotation).",
        "The PI model achieved 96.32 F-score on WSJ with verbal predicates, but only 84.74 on nominal ones.",
        "Argument Identification After PI, the arguments to the predicted predicates are identified with the AI component.",
        "Similar to the approach taken in Hacioglu (2004), we use a statistical classifier to select from a set of candidate nodes in a dependency tree.",
        "However, instead of selecting from a set of neighboring nodes from the predicate word , we define the concept of argument path as a chain of dependency relations from the predicate to the argument in the dependency tree.",
        "For instance, an argument path [sbj | tmp] indicates that if the predicate is syntactically depending as sbj on a node which has a tmp child, then the tmp node (sibling to the predicate) is an argument candidate.",
        "While Hacioglu (2004)'s approach focus mainly on local arguments (with respect to the syntactic dependencies), our approach is more suitable of capturing long distance arguments from the predicate.",
        "Another minor difference is that we allow predicate word to be its own argument (which is frequently the case for nominal predicates) with an empty argument path [ | ].",
        "The set of effective argument paths are obtained from the training set, sorted and filtered according to their frequencies, and used in testing to obtain the candidate arguments.",
        "By setting a frequency threshold, we are able to select the most useful argument paths.",
        "The lower the threshold is, the higher coverage one might get in finding candidate arguments, accompanied with a higher average candidate number per predicate and potentially a more difficult task for the statistical classifier.",
        "By experimenting with different frequency thresholds on the training set, we established a frequency threshold of 40, which guarantees candidate argument coverage of 95%, and on average 5.76 candidates per predicate.",
        "Given that for the training set each predicate takes on average 2.13 arguments, the binary classifier will have relatively balanced prediction classes.",
        "Argument Classification For each identified argument, an argument label will be assigned during the argument classification step.",
        "Unlike the binary classifiers in previous two steps, AC uses a multi-class classifier that predicts from the inventory of argument labels.",
        "For efficiency reasons, we only concern the most frequent 25 argument labels.",
        "Predicate Classification The final step in the SRL component labels the predicted predicate with a predicate name.",
        "Due to the lack of lexical resources in the closed competition, this step is scheduled for the last, in order to benefit from the predictions made in the previous steps.",
        "Unlike the previous steps, the statistical model used in this step is a ranking model.",
        "We obtained a list of candidate frames and corresponding rolesets from the provided PropBank and NomBank data.",
        "Each predicted predicate is mapped onto the potential role-sets it may take.",
        "When the frame for the predicate word is missing from the list, or there is only one candidate roleset for it, the predicate name is assigned deterministically (word stem concatenated with \".01\" for frame missing predicates, the unambiguous roleset name when there is only one candidate).",
        "When there are more than one candidate rolesets, a ranking model is trained to select the most probable roleset for a given predicate given the syntactic and semantic context.",
        "The feature types used in our SRL component are summarized in Table 1, with the configurations of our submitted \"closed\" and \"open\" runs marked.",
        "Numerous different configurations with these feature types have been experimented on training and development data.",
        "The results show that feature types 1-14 are the best performing ones.",
        "Features related to the siblings of the predicate only introduce minor performance variation.",
        "We also find the named entity labels does not lead to immediate improvement of SRL performance.",
        "The WordNet sense feature does achieve minor performance increase on PI and PC, although the significant remains to be further examined.",
        "Based on the pipeline model, we find it difficult to achieve further improvement by incorporate more features types from provided annotation.",
        "And the variance of SRL performance with different open features is usually less than 1%.",
        "To clearly show the contribution of extra external resources, these less contributing features (siblings, named entity labels and WordNet sense) are not used in our submitted \"open\" runs.",
        "MRSes as features to SRL As a novel point of our SRL system, we incorporate parsing results from a linguistic grammar-based parsing system in our \"open\" competition run.",
        "In this experiment, we used English Resource Grammar (ERG, Flickinger (2000)), a precision HPSG grammar for English.",
        "For parsing, we used PET (Callmeier, 2001), an efficient HPSG parser, together with extended partial parsing module (Zhang et al., 2007) for maximum robustness.",
        "The grammar is handcrafted and the disambiguation models are trained on Redwoods treebanks.",
        "They present general linguistic knowledge, and are not tuned for the specific domains in this competition.",
        "While the syntactic analysis of the HPSG grammar is largely different from the dependency annotation used in this shared task, the semantic representations do share a similar view on predicate-argument structures.",
        "ERG uses as its semantic representation the Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS, Copestake et al.",
        "(2005)), a non-recursive flat structure that is suitable for underspecifying scope ambiguities.",
        "A predicate-argument backbone of MRS can be extracted by identifying shared variables between elementary predications (eps).",
        "In order to align the HPSG parser's I/O with CoNLL's annotation, extensive mapping scripts are developed to preprocess the texts, and extract backbone from output MRSes.",
        "The unknown word handling techniques (Zhang and Kordoni, 2005) are used to overcome lexical gaps.",
        "Only the best analysis is used for MRS extraction.",
        "Without partial parsing, the ERG achieves around 70% of raw coverage on the training data.",
        "When partial parsing is used, almost all the sentences received either full or partial analysis (except for several cases where computational resources are exhausted), and the SRL performance improves by -0.5%."
