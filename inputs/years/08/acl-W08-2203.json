      "text": [
        "Grammar Matrix-derived grammars associate surface strings with MRS representations (or MRSs), in a bidirectional mapping that allows both parsing and generation.",
        "An MRS consists of a multiset of elementary predications (eps), each of which is a single relation with its associated arguments, labeled by a handle; a set of handle constraints relating the labels of eps to argument positions within other eps; and a top handle indicating which of the labels has outermost scope (Copestake et al., 2001, 2005).",
        "The MRSs produced by these grammars are underspecified for scope, allowing multiple different fully-scoped variants, according to the handle constraints.",
        "Each ep has a predicate (PRED) value and one or more argument positions, usually labeled ARG0 through ARGn.",
        "By convention, we refer to elementary predications by their PRED values.",
        "For scope-taking eps (including quantifiers as well as clause-embedding predicates such as _believe_v_rel and scopal modifiers such as negation), at least one argument position is handle-valued, and related (in a well-formed structure) to the label of another ep.",
        "For non-scopal predications, the values of the argument positions are variables (also called indices) which may themselves be associated with 'variable properties', such as person, number and gender on individual variables, or tense, aspect, sentential force and mood on event variables.",
        "One benefit of MRS is that it is designed to be compatible with feature-structure grammars.",
        "We build up MRSs through an HPSG implementation of the MRS algebra in Copestake et al.",
        "(2001), in which each constituent bears features recording the eps and handle constraints contributed within the constituent, as well as a set of properties exposed through the feature HOOK to facilitate further composition.",
        "These properties include pointers to the local top handle (LTOP), the constituent's primary index (INDEX), and the external argument, if any (XARG).",
        "Eps are canonically contributed by lexical entries, with one ep per lexical entry.",
        "Lexical entries can, however, contribute more than one ep or no eps at all.",
        "In addition, syntactic constructions can also contribute eps of their own.",

        "The semantic representations used in the Grammar Matrix were originally derived from those used in the English Resource Grammar (Flickinger, 2000), a wide-coverage grammar of English.",
        "In this paper, we propose to refine the semantic representations for phenomena connected to discourse status in light of the constraints on the syntax-semantics interface we find in a range of languages.",
        "This is not to say that we are promoting working towards an interlingua: indeed, even if it were possible to define a suitable interlingual set of representations, we believe it wouldn't be possible to map from surface strings to such representations in one compositional step.",
        "Nonetheless, it is useful to harmonize representations across languages while still allowing for necessary differences, for at least two reasons.",
        "First, when semantic representations are as similar as they practically can be, this simplifies both the transfer componentin transfer-based machine translation systems (e.g., Oepen et al., 2007) and the design of downstream components that make use of semantic representations in multilingual NLP systems in general.",
        "Second, harmonized semantic representations facilitate the creation of libraries in a resource like the Grammar Matrix, which in turn promotes both the reuse of analyses within implemented grammars and the exploration of computational linguistic typology.",
        "This paper builds on a tradition of work investigating the way the discourse status of referents influences the form of the referring expressions used to refer to them, or alternatively, the way that speakers use contrasts in form to signal to their interlocutors the discourse (or cognitive) status of their intended referents (Chafe, 1976, 1994; Prince, 1981; Gundel et al., 1993; Borthen and Haugereid, 2005; Arnold, 2008).",
        "Borthen and Haugereid (2005) (henceforth B&H) present arguments from a range of languages that the discourse status associated with referring expressions can be constrained by multiple intersecting syntactic factors.",
        "They use this to motivate embedding the discourse status information within the semantic features of a sign, rather than on the contextual features.",
        "They adapt the implicational scale proposed by Gun-del et al.",
        "(1993) and Prince (1981), representing discourse referents as having a range of values from 'type identifiable' through 'in focus'.",
        "In Gundel et al.",
        "and Prince's work, this is an implicational scale, where a discourse status of 'in focus', for example, also entails a discourse status of 'activated'.",
        "B&H argue that it needs to be represented within the syntax by a type hierarchy that makes each discourse status type incompatible with the others, while also creating supertypes that represent ranges of discourse status values.",
        "Their intuition is that the syntactic constraints restrict the distribution of certain forms based on the highest discourse status they are compatible with, rather than on the actual discourse status of the referent they are used to evoke in a given context.",
        "The cognitive status hierarchy, as we adopt it from Borthen and Haugereid (2005) is shown in Fig 1."

        "The first phenomenon we consider is markers of definiteness.",
        "In English, these are syntactically identified with determiners, and thus the English Resource Grammar represents the semantic contrast between the and a with the pred value of the ep contributed by the determiner: _the_q_rel vs. _a_q_rel (where 'q' stands for 'quantifier').",
        "Crosslinguistically, however, definiteness is not always marked in lexical determiners which might plausibly contribute quantifier relations.",
        "For example, in Norwegian, definiteness is signaled in part by an affix on the noun:",
        "(1) Jeg sa bilen.",
        "This does not lend itself to the analysis of definiteness in English provided by the ERG: First, the definite suffix can co-occur with something else in the determiner role, as in (2).",
        "Second, even if the affix did contribute a _def_q_rel, this would lead to ill-formed MRSs as soon as there were any intersective modifiers: Eps introduced by intersective modifiers (such as nye in (2)) should be labeled with the same handle as the ep introduced by the noun.",
        "But according to the MRS model of semantic com-positionality, the label of the noun's relation is not available for further composition once the quantifier has attached.",
        "I saw the new.DEF car.DEF",
        "Third, adjectives can also take definite forms.",
        "We would like to enforce the compatibility of this information, rather than having each instance of the definite suffix contribute an additional ep.",
        "Per B&H, this supports treating definiteness in terms of a feature rather than through eps.",
        "Following B&H, we note that the apparently binary distinction between definites and indefinites is better assimilated to the cognitive status hierarchy.",
        "There are mor-phosyntactic phenomena in various languages which divide the cognitive status hierarchy into two separate ranges, though the division point may vary across languages and within languages across phenomena.",
        "Using a single feature for cognitive status that takes its values from the type hierarchy in Fig 1 allows these various distinctions to be modeled elegantly.",
        "B&H propose wrapping semantic indices in a new structure ref-prop, which contains cog-st as well as other features related to the referential properties of a noun phrase.",
        "In this paper, we focus on COG-ST and leave the other dimensions to future work.",
        "However, we differ from B&H in proposing that COG-ST, at least, should be a feature of semantic indices, rather than inside a parallel structure (i.e., their ref-prop).",
        "This has the benefit of causing the COG-ST information from particular words or affixes to be included in the compositionally created semantic representations of phrases and sentences without any further effort: wherever the index so marked appears, it will carry its COG-ST value with it.",
        "It also makes the (correct, we believe) prediction that whenever an index appears in multiple places in the semantic representation, it should bear the same cognitive status information in all of them.",
        "For example, the MRS for (3) is as in (4), where the variable 'x5' represents the cat, and appears as a value in four separate elementary predications: ARG0 of _cat_n_rel, ARG0 of _exist_q_rel, ARG1 of _want_v_rel, and ARG1 of _go+out_v_rel.",
        "We claim that in all of these guises, the cognitive status of the referent is the same; there is only one mental representation of the referent involved.",

        "B&H consider this possibility and dismiss it on the grounds that coreferential noun phrases don't necessarily share the same cognitive status.",
        "However, placing the COG-ST value on the index does not necessarily entail that the expressions The cat, herself, and her impute the same cognitive status to their discourse referent in (5).",
        "As far as the syntactic processing is concerned, these expressions introduce distinct indices.",
        "It is up to a separate reference resolution component to identify them, and that component could merge their COG-ST values or not, as appropriate.",
        "(5) The cat opened the door herself with her paw.",

        "Crosslinguistically, however, demonstratives functioning as nominal dependents can also appear as adjectives or affixes (Dryer, 2008).",
        "In such languages, within the general constraints of composition of MRS, it is not elegant or natural-seeming to have an adjective contribute a quantifier relation or constrain the PRED value of a relation contributed by a separate determiner or non-branching NP construction.",
        "Instead, it seems more appropriate to decompose the semantic representation of determiners into a quantifier relation (_exist_q_rel) and a separate one-place modifier relation (e.g., _distal+dem_a_rel, for 'that').",

        "Conversely, nouns without the ha-prefix are interpreted as indefinite, unless they are modified by a demonstrative adjective.",
        "It is unclear at this point whether there is a difference in interpretation between (9) and (10) (from Wintner, 2000:334), but it seems likely that type-id is not the correct cognitive status for (9); that is, it is most likely not an indefinite.",

        "This requires an additional syntactic feature to control the application of the NPs rules, but this seems motivated: As Wintner notes, ha-is functioning as an agreement marker; its distribution has become grammaticized and drifted somewhat from what purely semantic constraints would predict.",
        "To provide complete representations for demonstratives, we also need to address the additional information they carry in many languages, such as the relative proximity of the referent to the speaker and/or the hearer, its visibility or elevation (Diessel, 1999).",
        "These distinctions appear to be at least partially independent of the COG-ST dimension.",
        "In addition, in the absence of any evidence for syntactically-mediated agreement between elements of a sentence along this dimension, for now we represent this part of the meaning of demonstratives as an elementary predication rather than as a feature.",
        "Some languages (e.g., Lithuanian) have a demonstrative element which does not express any distance contrast, in addition to ones that do (Diessel, 2008).",
        "In this case, it might make sense to reduce the contribution of the former sort of element to the constraints it places on the noun's COG-ST value.",

        "Building on Borthen and Haugereid (2005)'s proposal to treat cognitive status as a semantic feature within HPSG, we have developed representations for definite, demonstrative and null NPs, and sketched means of arriving at them compositionally.",
        "In future work, we plan to expand the range of these analyses to cover phenomena such as Irish demonstratives taking scope over coordinated noun phrases and cross-linguistic variation in the marking of generics as definite or indefinite.",
        "On the basis of these analyses, we plan to develop libraries for the Grammar Matrix customization system covering the topics discussed here.",
        "The Grammar Matrix customization system (Bender and Flickinger, 2005; Drellishak and Bender, 2005) presents the linguist-user with a typological questionnaire which elicits information about the language to be described.",
        "On the basis of the user's responses to the questionnaire, the customization system compiles a working starter grammar out of the Matrix core grammar and analyses stored in libraries.",
        "The new libraries will cover argument optionality (both general pro-drop and lexically-licensed), as well as demonstratives of different syntactic types (pronouns, determiners, adjectives and affixes), the marking of definiteness, and definiteness agreement."
