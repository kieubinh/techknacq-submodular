        "In this paper we present LXGram, a hand-built, general purpose computational grammar for the deep linguistic processing of Portuguese, specially geared to high precision processing of Noun Phrases.",
        "This grammar is based on the framework of Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG; Pollard and Sag (1994)), one of the most prominent linguistic theories being used in natural language processing.",
        "Like several other computational HPSGs, LXGram uses Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS; Copes-take et al.",
        "(2005)) for the representation of meaning.",
        "LXGram is developed in the Linguistic Knowledge Builder (LKB) system (Copes-take, 2002), a development environment for constraint-based grammars.",
        "This environment provides a GUI, debugging tools and very efficient algorithms for parsing and generation with the grammars developed there (Malouf et al., 2000; Carroll et al., 1999).",
        "Several broad-coverage grammars have been developed in the LKB.",
        "Currently, the largest ones are for English (Copestake and Flickinger, 2000), German (Müller and Kasper, 2000) and Japanese (Siegel and Bender, 2002).",
        "The grammars developed with the LKB are also supported by the PET parser (Callmeier, 2000), which allows for faster parsing times due to the fact that the grammars are compiled into a binary format in a first step.",
        "As the LKB grammars for other languages, LXGram is in active development, and it is intended to be a broad-coverage, open-domain grammar for Portuguese.",
        "At the same time, it produces detailed representations of meaning in tandem with syntactic structures, making it useful for a wide range of applications.",
        "In Section 2, we describe the framework foundations of the grammar.",
        "The major design features of the grammar are introduced in Section 3.",
        "We talk about the coverage of LXGram in Section 4.",

        "LXGram adopts the HPSG framework, a popular linguistic theory with a large body of literature covering many natural language phenomena.",
        "These insights can be directly incorporated in the implementation of a computational grammar.",
        "HPSG resorts to a declarative formalism to model linguistic data.",
        "It employs a type system (supporting multiple inheritance) and typed feature structures (recursive data structures defining \"has-a\" relations) in order to describe the properties of linguistic objects (words, phrases, rules).",
        "Unification of types and feature structures is central to HPSG, used to ensure that the various elements have compatible properties.",
        "For instance, the fact that a transitive verb takes an NP as its complement is captured in HPSG by defining a lexical type for transitive verbs, say transitive-verb-lex(eme), with constraints like the following (among others), presented in the Attribute-Value Matrix (AVM) format widely employed in HPSG:",
        "transitive-verb-lex",
        "head noun synsem|local|cat|val|comps ( localIcat [spr (}1 )",
        "The NP complement of the verb is represented in this AVM as the value of the attribute comps .",
        "This attribute takes a list as its value (indicated by the angle brackets).",
        "In this case the sole element of this list describes an object with a head feature of the type noun and empty complements (the attribute comps) and specifier (the feature spr) (i.e. they have been saturated at the point where the verb combines with this element), which is the HPSG description of an NP.",
        "Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS) is used as the format of semantic representations that LXGram associates with expressions from Portuguese.",
        "MRS has several properties that are interesting for applications.",
        "A relevant one is the use of pointers to represent scope effects that are handled via recursion in traditional formal semantics.",
        "This use of pointers (called handles) allows for the underspecification of scope relations, which avoids listing all scope possibilities for ambiguous sentences (although they can still be computed on demand with the LKB machinery).",
        "This is a useful property: scope does not need to be resolved in all applications (e.g. machine translation does not require it), but at the same time scoped formulas can be obtained on demand if required (e.g. for automated inference).",
        "We provide an example MRS representation derived for the sentence \"todas as equipas podem vencer\" (all teams can win) in Figure 1.",
        "This MRS describes the",

        "The first reading is the one that says that each team has a chance to win, while the second reading says that it is possible for there to be a situation in which all teams win (false assuming common sense knowledge).",
        "A single MRS representation is obtained for these two readings by instantiating the ARG1 feature of the relation _poder_v (can) with the handle h9, which is related to the handle h1o labeling the relation _vencer_v (win) via a qeq relation (equality modulo intervening quantifiers).",
        "This is the way of saying that these two handles are the same (first reading) or that there is an intervening generalized quantifier relation (second reading).",
        "Semantic representations abstract from many grammatical and superficial details of language, like word order, syntactic structure and morphology.",
        "As such, they are very similar across different natural languages (modulo predicate names).",
        "This is also true of MRS.",
        "Furthermore, semantic representations hide grammar implementation.",
        "As such, they are the preferred grammar's interface for applications, that do not need any knowledge of the grammatical properties of Portuguese and may not need to look at syntactic analysis.",
        "The MRS format is also used with several other computational HPSGs, for other languages.",
        "Several applications (e.g. Machine Translation) have been used with other HPSGs that communicate with these grammars via the MRSs (Bond et al., 2004).",
        "These applications can be easily integrated with grammars for different languages that also use MRS: they are almost completely language independent."

      "text": [
        "Given the foundational options, LXGram adheres to a number of important design features.",
        "Bidirectionality LXGram is bidirectional.",
        "The formalism employed is completely declarative.",
        "It can be used for parsing (yielding syntactic analyses and semantic representations from natural language input) and also for generation (yielding natural language from meaning representations).",
        "As such it can be useful for a wide range of applications.",
        "Precision LXGram aims at high precision of linguistic processing.",
        "Modulo bugs, the grammar cannot parse ungrammatical input.",
        "Although this feature may have a negative impact on robustness, it is an important aspect of the grammar when it is used for generation, as it means it is not possible to generate ungrammatical strings.It is indeed possible to mark some rules and some lexical entries to only be used for parsing and not for generation.",
        "In the configuration files for the LKB one can list these rules and lexical items.",
        "We are currently using this feature in order to be able to parse input that is not ungrammatical but is marked with respect to register, but preventing the grammar from generating such strings.",
        "Importantly, the fact that it cannot parse ungrammatical input also means that the grammar will not produce impossible analyses for grammatical sentences.",
        "Broad Coverage LXGram development is aimed at a broad coverage.",
        "We also seek to make LXGram neutral with respect to regional variation as much as possible.",
        "Currently, the grammar accommodates both European Portuguese and Brazilian",
        "Portuguese.",
        "Aspects of variation that are accounted for include lexical differences (merely affecting spelling or more substantial ones) as well as syntactic discrepancies (e.g. definite articles before possessives, word order between clitic pronouns and the verb).",
        "Efficiency The processors on which LXGram runs (LKB, PET) are very efficient.",
        "In addition, there are grammar engineering techniques that improve efficiency (e.g. (Flickinger, 2000)) that are also exploited in our implementation.",
        "Robustness The LKB and PET systems provide several ways to combine a grammar with the output of shallow tools, like part-of-speech taggers.",
        "Such integration can improve grammar coverage, as the grammar needs information about all words in the input, and some words may be missing in the grammar's lexicon.",
        "We have successfully combined LXGram with a part-of-speech tagger and a morphological analyzer (more in Section 6).",
        "The grammar code includes mappings from the input format (XML) to the feature structures that are manipulated by the grammar.",
        "Availability A version of LXGram is publicly available at http ://nlxgroup.",
        "di.",
        "fc.ul.pt/lxgram.",
        "LXGram can be used by applications without any knowledge of the grammar's implementation or internal workings.",
        "The LKB allows for applications to communicate with the grammar via sockets, accepting parser input in XML or raw text and returning semantic representations in XML, for which a DTD is available.",
        "It is also possible to automatically produce a list of all the predicates known by the grammar together with their arity and argument types (from the lexicon and syntax rules), that can be manually annotated with comments and examples.",

        "Furthermore, the amount of information included in the lexicon that is used by an HPSG is very large.",
        "Part-of-speech and morphological information is not sufficient.",
        "For the correct assignment of semantic representations, subcategorization frames as well as other information pertaining to semantics must be correctly associated with every lexical item, something that cannot be known with sufficient quality by just using shallower tools, like part-of-speech taggers.",
        "In LXGram a hand-crafted lexicon containing several hundreds of nouns, adjectives and verbs was developed.",
        "However, the manual creation of lexica with this amount of information is time consuming and error prone.",
        "We are exploring methods to alleviate this problem.",
        "An option is to combine the grammar with shallower tools in order to have access to some of the information needed and assume default values for the information that cannot be obtained this way.",
        "We have already integrated the grammar with a set of shallow tools (a part-of-speech tagger, a lemmatizer and a morphological analyzer) in order to guess information about unknown words.",
        "Preliminary results indicate an increase in coverage on unrestricted newspaper text from 2% to 13%.",
        "Although this approach cannot guarantee correct semantic representations (or even syntactic trees, since subcategorization frames constrain syntactic structure), it can be useful in applications that only require some restricted amount of linguistic information.",

        "We also make sure that definite articles always carry quantifier semantics when no floated quantifier is present.",
        "The implementation revolves around allowing floated quantifiers to attach to verbs, resulting in verb-headed nodes that combine with NP subjects lacking quantifier semantics.",
        "Raising verbs, like the form \"vao\" in this example, constrain their subject according to the constraints of the subject of their VP complement.",

        "Because the grammar is entirely bidirectional, a paraphraser is gained for free from the implementation of LXGram: the grammar can simply be used to generate from the semantic representations that it derives from an input sentence, thus producing paraphrases of the textual input.",
        "We are also working to integrate the grammar, running under this functionality, into the QA system.",
        "On a par with the above lines of research, we are intensively using the grammar to semi-automatically produce a treebank that contains syntactic representations and semantic descriptions of the sentences in a newspaper corpus.",
        "LXGram has also served in the past to implement and experiment with novel linguistic analyses of interesting phenomena (self-reference).",
        "By making it freely available, we intend to encourage this sort of experimentation also by other researchers.",
        "One can reap important benefits from computationally implementing linguistic analyses: the debugging tools allow for fast checking of correctness; the impact on other analyses that are already implemented can be immediately assessed via regression testing, making it possible to test the interaction between linguistic analyses for different phenomena; it is possible to automatically compare different competing analyses for efficiency, based on test suites or corpora."
