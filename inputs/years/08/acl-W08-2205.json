        "One of the big challenges in understanding text, i.e., constructing an overall coherent representation of the text, is that much information needed in that representation is unstated (implicit).",
        "Thus, in order to \"fill in the gaps\" and create an overall representation, language processing systems need a large amount of world knowledge, and creating those knowledge resources remains a fundamental challenge.",
        "In our current work, we are seeking to augment WordNet as a knowledge resource for language understanding in several ways: adding in formal versions of its word sense definitions (glosses); classifying the morphosemantic links between nouns and verbs; encoding a small number of \"core theories\" about WordNet's most commonly used terms; and adding in simple representations of scripts.",

        "By one estimate, the ratio of explicit to implicit facts is 1:8 (Graesser, 1981), making the task of understanding text, i.e., constructing a coherent representation of the scene that the author intended to convey, very difficult, even given the generally reasonable quality of syntactic interpretation that today's systems produce.",
        "For example, given the sentence:",
        "A soldier was killed in a gun battle.",
        "a reader will infer that (probably):",
        "The soldier was shot; The soldier died; There was a fight; etc.",
        "even though none of these facts are explicitly stated.",
        "A person is able to draw these plausible conclusions because of the large amounts of world knowledge he/she has, and his/her ability to use them to construct an overall mental model of the scene being described.",
        "A key requirement for this task is access to a large body of world knowledge.",
        "However, machines are currently poorly equipped in this regard.",
        "Although a few knowledge encoding projects are underway, e.g., Cyc (Lenat and Guha, 1989), developing such resources continues to be a major challenge, and any contribution to this task has significant potential benefit.",
        "WordNet (Miller, 1995; Fellbaum, 1998) presents an unique avenue for making inroads into this problem: It already has broad coverage, multiple lexicosemantic connections, and significant knowledge encoded (albeit informally) in its glosses.",
        "It can thus be viewed as on the way to becoming an extensively leveragable, \"lightweight\" knowledge base for reasoning.",
        "In fact, WordNet already plays a central role in many question-answering systems e.g., 21 of the 26 teams in the recent PASCAL RTE3 challenge used WordNet (Giampiccolo et al., 2007), and most other large-scale resources already include mappings to it and thus can leverage it easily.",
        "In our work we are developing several augmentations to WordNet to improve its utility further, and we report here on our experiences to date.",
        "Although we are performing experiments with recognizing textual entailment (RTE) (determining whether a hypothesis sentence H follows from some text T), it is important to note that RTE is not our end-goal.",
        "Many existing RTE systems, e.g., (Adams et al., 2007; Chambers et al., 2007) largely work by statistically scoring the match between T and H, but this to an extent sidesteps \"deep\" language understanding, namely building a coherent, internal representation of the overall scenario the input text was intended to convey.",
        "RTE is one way of measuring success in this endeavor, but it is also possible to do moderately well in RTE without the system even attempting to \"understand\" the scenario the text is describing.",
        "It is yet to be seen whether very high performance in RTE can be obtained without some kind of deep language understanding of the entire scene that a text conveys.",
        "We are testing our work with BLUE, Boeing's Language Understanding Engine, which we first describe.",
        "We then present the WordNet augmentations that we are developing, and our experience with these as well as with the DIRT paraphrase database.",

        "Parsing is performed using SAPIR, a mature, bottom-up, broad coverage chart parser (Harrison and Maxwell, 1986).",
        "The parser's cost function is biased by a database of manually and corpus-derived \"tuples\" (good parse fragments), as well as hand-coded preference rules.",
        "During parsing, the system also generates a logical form (LF), a semi-formal structure between a parse and full logic, loosely based on Schubert and Hwang (1993).",
        "The LF is a simplified and normalized tree structure with logic-type elements, generated by rules parallel to the grammar rules, that contains variables for noun phrases and additional expressions for other sentence constituents.",
        "Some disambiguation decisions are performed at this stage (e.g., structural, part of speech), while others are deferred (e.g., word senses, semantic roles), and there is no explicit quantifier scoping.",
        "A simple example of an LF is shown below (items starting with underscores _aAI denote variables):",
        "The LF is then used to generate ground logical assertions of the form r(x,y), containing Skoleminstances, by applying a setofsyntactic rewriterules recursively to it.",
        "Verbs are reified as individuals, Davidsonian-style.",
        "An example of the output is:",

        "object(kill01,soldier01) in (kill01,battle01) modifier(battle01,gun01)",
        "plus predicates associating each Skolem with its corresponding input word.",
        "At this stage of processing, the predicates are syntactic relations (subject(x,y), object(x,y), modifier(x,y), and all the prepositions, e.g., in(x,y)).",
        "Definite coreference is computed by a special module which uses the (logic for the) referring noun phrase as a query on the database of assertions.",
        "Another module performs special structural transformations, e.g., when a noun or verb should map to a predicate rather than an individual.",
        "Two additional modules perform (currently naive) word sense disambiguation (WSD) and semantic role labelling (SRL), described further in Clark and Harrison (2008).",
        "However, for our RTE experiments we have found it more effective to leave senses and roles underspecified, effectively considering all valid senses and roles (for the given lexical features) during reasoning until instantiated by the rules that apply.",
        "A basic operation for reasoning is determining if one set ofclauses subsumes (is more general than, is thus implied by) another, e.g., (the logic for) \"A person likes a person\" subsumes \"A man loves a woman\".",
        "This basic operation is used both to determine if an axiom applies, and in RTE to determine if a text H subsumes (is implied by) a text T or its axiom-expanded elaboration.",

        "To handle these cross-POS variants, when finding the word senses of a word (above) our system considers all POS, independent of its POS in the original text.",

        "Although this is work in progress, we have evaluated some of these augmentations using our test suite.",

Although not using statistical similarity clearly hurts our score, in particular assuming \"no entailment\" when the elaborated representation ofT is not subsumed by H, we believe this keeps us appropriately focused on our longer-term goal of deeper understanding of text.",

        "hypernym errors, fine-grained senses) also caused errors in our tests (outside the scope of this paper).",

        "A big challenge for deep understanding of text – constructing a coherent representation of the scene it is intended to convey – is the need for large amounts of world knowledge.",

        "Existing WordNet already provides extensive leverage for language processing, as evidenced by the large number of groups using it.",
        "The contribution of this paper is some preliminary insight into avenues and challenges for further developing this resource.",
