        "Various applications in Natural Language Processing, such as Question Answering (Novischi and Moldovan, 2006), Topic Detection (Carthy, 2004), and Text Summarization (Barzilay and Elhadad, 1997), rely on semantic relatedness (similarity or distance) measures either based on word nets and/or corpus statistics as a resource.",
        "In the HyTex project, funded by the German Research Foundation, we develop strategies for the text-to-hypertext conversion using text-grammatical features.",
        "One strand of research in this project consists of topic-based linking methods using lexical chaining as a resource (Cramer and Finthammer, 2008).",
        "Lexical chaining is a well-known method to calculate partial text representations; it relies on semantic relatedness values as basic input.",
        "We therefore implemented eight semantic relatedness measures – (Hirst and St-Onge, 1998; Jiang and Conrath, 1997; Leacock and Chodorow, 1998; Lin, 1998; Resnik, 1995; Wu and Palmer, 1994) – based on GermaNet Lemnitzer and Kunze (2002) and three based on Google co-occurrence counts (Cilibrasi and Vi-tanyi, 2007).",
        "In order to evaluate the performance of these measures we conducted two human judgment experiments and computed the correlation between the human judgment and the values of the eleven semantic measures.",
        "We also compared our results with those reported in the literature and found that the correlations between human judgments and semantic measures are extremely scattered.",
        "In this paper we compare the correlation of our own human judgment experiments and the results of three similar studies.",
        "In our opinion this comparison points to the necessity of a thorough analysis of the methods used in these experiments.",
        "We argue that this analysis should aim at answering the following questions:",
        "• How does the setting of the human judgment experiment influence the results?",
        "• How does the selection of the word-pairs influence the results?",
        "• Which aspects of semantic relatedness are included in human judgments?",
        "Thus, what do these experiments actually measure?",
        "• Are the semantic relatedness measures proposed in the literature able to capture all of these aspects?",
        "In this paper we intend to open the above mentioned analysis and therefore assembled a set of aspects which we consider to be important in order to answer these questions.",
        "Consequently, the remainder of this paper is structured as follows: In Section 2 we How Well Do Semantic Relatedness Measures Perform?",
        "A Meta-Study 61 present our own human judgment experiments.",
        "In Section 3 we describe three similar studies, two conducted with English data and one with German.",
        "In Section 4 we compare the results of the four studies and discuss (with respect to the experimental setting and goals) potential differences and possible causes for the observed inconsistency of the results.",

        "In order to evaluate the quality of a semantic measure, a set of pre-classified (i.e. judged with respect to their semantic relatedness by subjects) word-pairs is necessary.",
        "In previous work for English data, most researchers used the word-pair list by Rubenstein and Goodenough (1965) as well as the list by Miller and Charles (1991) as an evaluation resource.",
        "For German there are – to our knowledge – two research groups, which compiled lists of word-pairs with respective human judgment:",
        "• Gurevych et al.",
        "constructed three lists (a translation of Rubenstein and Good-enough's list (Gurevych, 2005), a manually generated set of word-pairs, and a semi-automatically generated one (Zesch and Gurevych, 2006)).",
        "• While investigating lexical chaining for German corpora, we additionally compiled a total of six lists, each of which consists of 100 word-pairs with respective human judgments.",
        "The goal of our experiments was to cover a wide range of relatedness types, i.e. systematic and unsystematic relations, and relatedness levels, i.e. various degrees of relation strength.",
        "However, we only included nouns in the construction of our sets of word-pairs, since we consider cross-part-of-speech (cross-POS) relations to be an additional challenge, which we intend to address in a continuative experiment.",
        "Furthermore, in order to identify a potential bias of the lists and the impact of this bias on the results, we applied two different methods for the compilation of word-pairs.",
        "For our first human judgment experiment (Cramer and Finthammer, 2008) we collected nouns (analytically) of diverse semantic classes, e.g. abstract nouns, such as das Wissen (Engl.",
        "knowledge), and concrete nouns, such as das Bügeleisen (Engl.",
        "flat-iron).",
        "By this means, we constructed a list of approximately 300 word-pairs.",
        "We picked approximately 75 and randomized them.",
        "For the remaining 25 word-pairs, we selected five words and constructed word-pairs such as Sonne-Wind (Engl.",
        "sun-wind), Sonne-Wärme (Engl.",
        "sun-warmth), Sonne-Wetter (Engl.",
        "sun-weather) etc.",
        "We arranged these 25 pairs into sequences in order to focus our subjects' attention on small semantic relatedness distinctions.",
        "For the five remaining lists (WP2-WP6), we applied a different method: firstly, we again analytically collected word-pairs which are part of collocations, i.e. the two nouns Rat and Tat (mit Rat und Tat helfen, Engl.",
        "to help with words and deeds) or Qual and Wahl (die Qual der Wahl haben, Engl.",
        "to be spoilt for choice).",
        "Secondly, we assembled word-pairs which feature association relations, i.e. Afrika (Engl.",
        "Africa) and Tiger (Engl.",
        "tiger) or Weihnachten (Engl.",
        "Christmas) and Zimt (Engl.",
        "cinnamon).",
        "Thirdly, we automatically constructed a list of randomword-pairs using the Wacky corpus (Baroni and Bernardini, 2006) as a resource and manually excluded ad-hoc-constructions.",
        "Finally, out of these three resources we compiled five sets of 100 randomized word-pairs with no more than 20% of the collocation and association word-pairs.",
        "We asked subjects to rate the word-pairs on a 5-level scale (0 = not related to 4 = strongly related).",
        "The subjects were instructed to base the rating on their intuition about any kind of conceivable relation between the two words.",
        "WP1 was rated by 35 subjects and WP2 to WP6 were each rated by 15 subjects.",
        "We then calculated the average judgment per word-pair and ranked the word-pairs accordingly.",
        "The correlation between the human judgments and the eleven semantic measures is shown in Table 1.",
        "The difference between the correlation coefficients of WP1 and WP2-WP6 suggests that the method of construction might have an impact on the results of the experiments.",
        "The manual compilation of word-pairs seems to lead to better correlation coefficients and might therefore cause an overestimation of the performance of the semantic measures.",
        "Furthermore, with respect to the list construction methods, the two resources and respective measures, namely GermaNet (TreePath-Lin) and Google (GoogleQ-GooglePMI), seem to respond differently: whereas the correlation coefficients of the eight GermaNet based measures drop to a greater or lesser extend (Table 1: r for WP1 and r for WP2-WP6), the correlation coefficients of the three Google based measures approximately level off.",
        "Table 1: Our Correlation Coefficients: Correlation between Average Human Judgment and Semantic Measure Values",
        "In any case, since the correlation coefficients are rather low, there is much room for improvement.",
        "However, as all measures scatter in the same range – independently of the precise algorithm or resource used, as it seems – we argue that the reason for this critical performance might be one of the following two aspects (most probably a combination of both):",

        "As mentioned above various researchers rely on human judgment experiments as an evaluation resource for semantic relatedness measures.",
        "In this section, three such studies are summarized in order to identify differences with respect to the methods adopted and results obtained.",
        "Budanitsky and Hirst (2006) specify the purpose of their paper Evaluating WordNet-based Measures of Lexical Semantic Relatedness as a comparison of the performance of various relatedness measures.",
        "Accordingly, they sketch a number of measures and identify three evaluation methods: firstly, the theoretical examination (of e.g. the mathematical properties of the respective measure); secondly, the comparison with human judgments; thirdly, the evaluation of a measure with respect to a given NLP-application.",
        "They regard the second and third method as being the most appropriate ones and therefore focus on them in their empirical work presented in the paper.",
        "As a basis for the second evaluation method, i.e. the comparison between semantic measure and human judgments, they use two word-pair lists: the first compiled by Ruben-stein and Goodenough (1965) and containing 65 word-pairs, the second compiled by Miller and Charles (1991) and containing 30 word-pairs.",
        "In order to evaluate the performance of five different measures (and potentially in order to find a ranking), Budanitsky and Hirst (2006) compute the semantic relatedness values for the word-pairs and compare them with the human judgments.",
        "They thus find the correlation coefficients summarized in Table 2.",
        "Budanitsky and Hirst (2006) regard this evaluation method, i.e. comparing measure values and human judgments, as the ideal approach.",
        "However, in examining the results of this comparison, they identify several limitations; i.e. they point out that the amount of data available (65 word-pairs) might be inadequate for real NLP-applications.",
        "They additionally emphasize that the development of a large-scale data set would be time-consuming and expensive.",
        "Moreover, they argue that the experiments by Rubenstein and Goodenough (1965) as well as Miller and Charles (1991) focus on relations between words rather than relations between word-senses (concepts), which would be – especially when taking potential NLP-applications into account – more appropriate.",
        "They note that it might however be difficult to trigger a specific concept without biasing the subjects.",
        "In contrast to the above mentioned experiments by Budanitsky and Hirst (2006), the research reported in Adding Dense, Weighted Connections to WordNet aims at the development of a new, conceptually different layer of relations to be included into a word net.",
        "Boyd-Graber et al.",
        "(2006) are motivated in their work by three widely acknowledged shortcomings of word nets:",
        "• The lack of cross-POS links connecting the sub-graphs containing nouns, verbs, or adjectives, respectively.",
        "• The low density of relations in the sub-graphs, i.e. potentially missing types of relations such as 'actor' or 'instrument'.",
        "• The absence of weights assigned to the relations, i.e. representing the degrees of semantic distance of different subordinates of the same superordinate.",
        "In order to address these shortcomings, Boyd-Graber et al.",
        "ask subjects to assign values of 'evocation' representing the relations between 1,000 synsets.",

        "The subjects are given a manual explaining a couple of details about the task and are trained on a sample of 1,000 (two sets of 500) randomly selected pairs.",
        "Although the research objective of the work presented in this paper is to construct a new relations layer for Princeton WordNet rather than to evaluate semantic relatedness measures, Boyd-Graber et al.",

        "(2006) the concept-pairs were randomly selected, whereas the word-pairs used by Budanitsky and Hirst (2006) were constructed analytically.",
        "In the studies by Gurevych (2005), Zesch and Gurevych (2006), and Cramer and Finthammer (2008), some were analytically constructed and some randomly (semi-automatically) selected.",
        "In addition, the data sets vary with respect to their size: Budanitsky and Hirst (2006), Gurevych (2005), and Cramer and Finthammer (2008) only use small sets of word-pairs (concept-pairs), i.e. a few hundred pairs, whereas Boyd-Graber et al.",
        "(2006) investigate a huge amount of data; their experiment therefore certainly constitutes the most representative one.",
        "All studies also indicate the (mean/median) inter-subject correlation which varies from 0.48 (concept-pair based) in Zesch and Gurevych (2006) and 0.72 (concept-pair based) in Boyd-Graber et al.",
        "(2006) to 0.85 (word-pair based) in Budanitsky and Hirst",
        "(2006).",
        "We think that this comparison of the various experiments points to two aspects which probably cause the large statistical spread shown in Table 5: the selection of the word-pairs (concept-pairs) and the type of relation (relatedness, similarity, evocation, distance).",
        "We assume that it should be possible to condense the comparison into one (more or less simple) rule: the narrower the relation concept (similarity < relatedness < evocation) and the narrower the data considered (lexical semantic selection rule < any kind of selection rule < random selection) the better the correlation between human judgment and semantic measure.",
        "In any case, it seems essential to determine which relation types the subjects (knowingly or unknowingly) bear in mind when they judge word-pairs with respect to semantic relatedness.",
        "In order to achieve this goal and be able to integrate all relevant relations into the resources used for calculating semantic relatedness, the human judgments collected in the above-mentioned studies should be dissected into components (i.e. components for which systematic/unsystematic lexical semantic relations account etc.",
        "); such a decomposition certainly also helps render more precisely the deinition of semantic relatedness.",
        "Furthermore, it is – in our opinion – an unsettled issue whether the three types of semantic relation at hand, thus the relations 1. represented in a word net or corpus (both computed via semantic measure),",
        "2. existing between any given word-pair in a text (which is mostly relevant for NLP-applications), 3. and the one assigned by subjects in a human judgment experiment correspond at all.",
        "In principle, word nets, corpus statistics, and human judgments should be related to (theoretically even represent) the (at least partially) shared knowledge of humans about the underlying 'lexical semantic system', whereas relations between words in a concrete text represent an instantiation of a system.",
        "From this point of view, at least the human judgments should correspond to the semantics encoded in a word net (or corpus statistics).",
        "Instead of using human judgments as an evaluation resource (for e.g. word net based semantic measures), they might as well be directly integrated into the word net as a (preferably dense) layer of (potentially cognitively relevant, weighted but unlabeled) semantic relations, which is best adopted in Boyd-Graber et al.",
        "(2006), as summarized in Section 3.",
        "This approach has several advantages: irstly, the calculation of a semantic relatedness value is – given such a layer – trivial, since it merely consists in a lookup procedure.",
        "Secondly, NLP-applications using word nets as a resource would certainly benefit from the thus enhanced density of relations, i.e. cross-POS relations.",
        "Thirdly, an elaborate and standardized experimental setup for human judgment experiments could be used for the construction of such a layer in different languages (and domains) and would also guarantee the modeling quality.",
        "Finally, such a new word net layer would hopefully resolve the above mentioned open issue of the diverging correlation coeficients.",
        "Alternatively, since it is completely unclear if the evocation relation can really act as a substitute for classical semantic relatedness measures in NLP-applications, current word nets should be enhanced by systematically augmenting existing relation types and integrating new ones.",
        "On that condition and given that a common evaluation framework exists, it should be possible to determine which semantic relatedness measure performs best under what conditions.",
        "Last but not least, in order to determine the relation between an underlying semantic system (represented by a semantic measure or as mentioned above the evocation layer) and the instantiation of this system in a concrete text, a study similar to the one reported in Zesch and Gurevych (2006) should be conducted.",
        "Such a study probably also shows if the evocation relation is able to substitute (or at least complement) semantic relatedness measures typically used in NLP-applications."
