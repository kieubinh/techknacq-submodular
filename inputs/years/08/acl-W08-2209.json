        "GETARUNS is a GEneral multilingual Text And Reference UNderstander which follows a linguistically based approach to text understanding and embodies a number of general strategies on how to implement linguistic principles in a running system.",
        "The system addresses one main issue: how to restrict access to extralinguistic knowledge of the world by contextual reasoning, i.e. reasoning from linguistically available cues.",
        "Another important issue addressed by the system is multilinguality.",
        "In GETARUNS the user may switch from one language to another by simply unloading the current lexicon and uploading the lexicon for the new language: at present Italian, German and English are implemented.",
        "Multilinguality has been implemented to support the theoretical linguistic subdivision of Universal Grammar into a Core and a Peripheral set of rules.",
        "The system is organized around another fundamental assumption: the architecture of such a system must be modular thus requiring a pipeline of sequential feeding processes of information, each module providing one chunk of knowledge, backtracking being allowed only within each single module.",
        "The architecture of the system is organized in such a way as to allow for feedback into the parser from Anaphoric Binding: however, when pronominals have been finally bound or left free, no more changes are allowed on the f-structure output of the parser.",
        "Thus, we can think of the system as being subdivided into two main meta-modules or levels: Low Level System, containing all modules that operate at Sentence Level; High Level System, containing all the modules that operate at Discourse and Text Level by updating the Discourse Model.",
        "The deep and complete version of the system that we present here can be used with strictly closed domains and does not need any supporting ontology.",
        "However, it has also been used in one such context with a different architecture, which had OWL and RDFs as final external knowledge representation formalisms.",
        "Ontologies and Knowledge Sources should be used as Word Sense Disambiguation tools (we have not produced results on this however).",
        "Texts belonging to what we define as closed domains are characterized by the fact that the system has all the semantic information which is needed process then; and most importantly, sentences making up the texts can be fully parsed without failures.",
        "In practice, these texts are relatively short and the length of sentences is below a certain threshold, typically 25 words.",
        "They are used for text understanding practice in a language learning environment.",
        "In this context, question answering is used to validate the appropriateness of the user's answer.",
        "Some such texts will be presented below.",

        "Informally, a Discourse Model (DM) may be described as the set of entities \"specified\" in a discourse, linked together by the relations they participate in.",
        "They are called discourse entities, but may also be regarded as discourse referents or cognitive elements.",
        "A discourse entity (DE) inhabits a speaker's discourse model and represents something the speaker has referred to.",
        "A speaker refers to something by utterances that either evoke (if first reference) or access (if subsequent reference) its corresponding discourse entity.",
        "As soon as a DE is evoked, it gets a description.",
        "The initial description ID that tags a newly evoked DE might have a special status, because it is the only information about an entity that can be assumed to be shared (though not necessarily believed) by both speaker and listener alike.",
        "However certain types of DE must be derived from other ones inferentially.",
        "Definite descriptions can be used like definite pronouns to access entities which are presumably in the listener's DM, or they can be used to evoke new entities into that model.",
        "Building a DM is clearly only a part of the overall process of understanding which makes heavy use of background mutual knowledge on the side of the addressee in order to carry out the complex inferences required.",
        "In order to build an adequate Discourse Model we rely on a version of Situation Semantics which takes perspectives or point of view as the higher node in a hierarchical scheme in which there is a bifurcation between factual and non-factual situations.",
        "Partially following Burke (1991) we assume that the notion of perspectives is significant in situation theory insofar as the very same situations can be viewed by an agent (or by different agents) from different perspectives, hence situations may support different and perhaps conflicting kinds of information (ibid., p.134).",
        "Situations are characterized in terms of infons, or better the infons that they support.",
        "In turn we distinguish between facts and concepts where the former have to do with concrete ostensive entities which yield information that is referential, in that they explicitly involve objects in the world relative to a given perspective.",
        "On the contrary concepts constitutes a piece of general information about the world relative to a given perspective, which does not directly refer to any particular entity or object, nor is it specific to particular ostensive entities.",
        "Infons are built according to situation theory: a basic infon consists of a relation, its argument roles, a polarity, and a couple of indices anchoring the event/state/processe to a given spatiotemporal location.",
        "In our system, facts may describe information relative to a subjective or an objective discourse domain: subjective facts are thus computable as situations viewed from the perspective of a given agent's mind, in our case also corresponding to the Main Topic of discourse.",
        "On the contrary, objective facts are reported from the perspective of the text's author.",
        "However, to highlight the difference existing between subjective and objective information in the model, we decided to call facts only objective infons; subjective infons are called sit.",
        "Also generic facts are treated as sits.",
        "These main constituents of situations are further described by taking as primitives individuals, relations and locations and by using as logical notation set theory.",
        "Thus, individuals and inferences on individuals are wrought out in set theory notation: we use ind for a unique individual, set for a collection of individuals which can be individuated by means of membership, card for the cardinality of any set with a numerical or indefinite quantified value, in to indicate membership, class for generic sets which can be made up of an indefinite quantity however big enough to encompass sets, subsets, classes or individuals.",
        "Each entity is assigned a constant value or id and an infon which are uniquely individuated by a number.",
        "Infons may express or contain a main relation: relations may be properties, social or relational roles, events or states, locational modifiers or specifiers – that is attributes, etc.. Simplex properties predicate some property of a semantic identifier; complex properties take individuals and propositions as their arguments and in this case individuals are usually associated to a semantic role.",
        "Semantic roles are inherited from the lexical form associated to a given predicate in the lexicon and transferred into the f-structure of the utterance under analysis.",
        "Semantic roles are paramount in the choice and construction of questions and answers.",
        "Inferences are produced every time a given property is reintroduced in the story in order to ascertain whether the same property was already present in the model and should not be reasserted, or whether it should be added to it.",
        "Properties may be anchored to a given location or be universally anchored: a name, is a rigid designator in that it is computed as a property associated to a given individual and has a universal locational anchoring, meaning that the same individual will always be individuated by that name in the story.",
        "The same would apply to permanent properties like the substance or matter constituting an object, like a house, or other such properties.",
        "Persistence may then be computed both for entities, properties, relations and locations; also, a Relevance Score is computed by a separate module that analyzes information structure for each s mplex utterance."

        "In both cases it uses some sort of equational reasoning in order to ascribe properties to already asserted semantic identifiers, by taking advantage of linguistic information encoded in Function/Role, according to a linguistically well-defined hierarchy which treats arguments and adjuncts as semantically different.",
        "New semantic individuals are added when needed.",
        "The module handling semantic individuals treats new individuals to be asserted in the DM separately from already asserted ones – in which case, the semantic index should be inherited from properties belonging to previously asserted individuals.",
        "In addition, quantified expressions should be treated differently from individuals or sets, be they singleton sets, or sets with a given cardinality.",
