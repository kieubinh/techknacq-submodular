        "Reference resolution and idiom processing have received much attention in natural language processing (NLP), but these phenomena are commonly treated in isolation of each other, and most treatments address only a single aspect of the respective overall problems.",
        "For example, much of the work on practical reference resolution has concentrated on establishing textual coreference relations for a subset of pronouns (e.g. Mitkov et al., 2002), and the most widely pursued aspect of idiom processing has been the automatic extraction of multi-word expressions (of which idioms are a subtype) from corpora (e.g. Baldwin and Villavicencio, 2002).",
        "Of course, some contributions in both of these subfields have ventured much wider; however, we have found few practical approaches that explore the interaction of idiomaticity and reference resolution and its implications for NLP.",
        "One might ask, why treat these phenomena together?",
        "Perhaps the best reason is to highlight the indispensability for real progress in NLP of semantic analysis that goes beyond what the most researchers are currently pursuing in practical system building.",
        "Another reason to integrate the study of reference and idioms is to address the difficulties that automatic text analyzers will encounter in detecting and processing idioms when some of their components are elided.",
        "Ellipsis, a means of expressing reference, thus, becomes an important component of this study.",
        "The approach suggested here should, we believe, alleviate some of the inherent difficulties of these complex tasks.",
        "Note that similar kinds of problems are discussed in Pulman (1993), which suggests the need for \"contextual reasoning\" applied to idioms, which is \"the process of taking the information that can be derived linguistically from a sentence and fleshing it out with information supplied by the local context or general background knowledge\" (Pulman, 1993, p. 251).",
        "The proposed analysis delineates several categories of idioms according to their reference needs and shows how the encoding of idioms in a semantically oriented lexicon can support both basic semantic analysis and reference resolution.",
        "Although the analysis is theory-and system-neutral, the exposition follows a specific, implemented theory of natural language processing.",
        "This theory, called Ontological Semantics (Niren-burg and Raskin, 2004), colors our understanding of the nature of meaning-oriented NLP, including our treatment of reference and idioms.",
        "Ontological Semantics seeks to achieve full semantic and pragmatic analysis of texts such that interpreted structures, rather than textual strings, serve as the input to automatic reasoners.",
        "Ontological Semantics relies on knowledge obtained through many layers of processing: preprocessing followed by morphological, syntactic, semantic and discourse analysis.",
        "The static knowledge resources, which are interconnected and all use the same metalanguage of description, are a lexicon and onomas-ticon for each language processed, a language-independent ontology (a knowledge base of concept types), and a language-independent fact repository (a knowledge base of concept instances).",
        "Static resources are compiled manually, using sophisticated editing environments, to ensure high quality, though we are experimenting with machine learning to speed the acquisition process.",
        "Text analysis involves the automatic evaluation of semantic preferences recorded in the lexicon and ontology, as well as preferences based on stochastically trained measures of semantic distance among ontological concepts.",
        "Within this semantically-oriented, knowledge-based environment we define reference resolution rather differently than in most NLP applications, where resolving reference is understood as linking coreferring text strings.",
        "In fact, our conceptualization of reference resolution strongly influences how we approach resolving reference in idioms and therefore must be clarified from the outset."

      "text": [
        "We define reference resolution as the anchoring of referring expressions in the episodic memory of an intelligent text processing agent.",
        "This knowledge base of stored memories, called the fact repository, differs from the ontology in that it contains indexed instances of ontological concepts and their property-based interconnections.",
        "Anchoring entities in the fact repository is the culmination of semantic analysis and reference resolution.",
        "When presented with a new text, the system must first semantically analyze every sentence, creating an unambiguous text meaning representation (TMR); reference is then resolved for the correct meaning of each string.",
        "The TMR contains the crucial clues for determining which entities are referring expressions: numbered instances of ontological concepts are referring expressions whereas properties, literal property fillers, and so on, are not.",
        "As an example, consider the following context which, although contrived, illustrates many relevant phenomena at one go.",
        "(1) At 4:48 it became clear that the programmers couldn't finish debugging the system before the 5:00 deadline.",
        "All hell broke loose, the boss was fit to be tied – almost strangled his project manager!",
        "Let us concentrate on the second sentence.",
        "In the tables below, each string or idiomatic group of strings from that sentence (top row) is associated with its corresponding semantic structure (bottom row).",
        "The concept instances set in italics must be resolved.",
        "The important thing to notice is that the system must orient around semantic structures rather than strings in order to create the correct inventory of referring expressions.",
        "Highlights of the analysis are as follows:",
        "• Whereas all hell and broke loose could individually be referring expressions in some other context, when the are used in this idiom they together represent a single meaning, chaos, this instance of which is called chaos-1 – the first instance of the concept chaos encountered while processing the given text or corpus.",
        "This event, like all instances of objects and events in TMRs, requires reference resolution: it must be determined whether this is a new event to",

        "In this case, it is a new event, since the algorithm used to detect event coreference requires either (a) that there be an ample overlap of properties associated with a candidate fact repository \"anchor\" or (b) that the new event be referred to using a definite description (e.g., the strike), with the definite description triggering the search for a coreferent in the context or fact repository.",
        "• Whereas the boss and his project manager can either be descriptors (as in This man is a boss and that man is a project manager) or referring expressions, here they are referring expressions and must be resolved.",
        "• Whereas fit and tied can be referring expressions in isolation, in this idiom they are not referring expressions, nor is the idiom on the whole a referring expression: it indicates the highest value of the property anger.",
        "• Although the second half of the sentence has no overt subject, he is the understood subject.",
        "The reference resolver must detect this missing entity and create a coreference link between it and manager 1.",
        "• Almost is never a referring expression: it indicates a value of less than 1 for epistemic modality scoping over the given event (here, strangle-1).",
        "However, some other adverbs are referring expressions (e.g., here, yesterday) and must be resolved.",
        "• strangle 1, like all events, must undergo reference resolution.",
        "Once all referring expressions have been detected, the system must resolve them against the fact repository.",
        "There are several possible scenarios: (a) the entity has a textual antecedent, in which case the new entity is linked to the same fact repository anchor as that antecedent; (b) the entity does not have a textual antecedent but is already a known entity (like the earth or Plato) and is linked to the existing anchor in the fact repository; (c) the entity is determined to be new and a new anchor is established for it in the fact repository.",
        "This, in a nutshell, is how reference is resolved in our semantic analysis environment, OntoSem.",
        "Our reference resolver for English is implemented and covers all the eventualities posed by this sentence.",
        "It has not yet undergone formal evaluation.",
        "We will now describe how idioms are encoded to support this process.",
        "The examples used for illustration are not from English, they are from Russian, a language that is not currently supported in OntoSem.",
        "The reason for using Russian examples even though the implemented system does not yet cover Russian is that Russian presents a superset of challenges for reference resolution – namely, a much wider use of ellipsis, or the null referring expression; therefore, showing that the scope of phenomena presented by Russian can be handled a fortiori shows that the same phenomena can be handled in English.",
        "Indeed, the OntoSem environment supports multilingual text processing, using a language-independent ontology and fact repository, and using the same types of lexicon entries regardless of the language processed (see McShane et al., 2005)."

        "A cornerstone of theoretical, descriptive, computational and psycholinguistc work on idioms is the attempt to understand to what extent idioms are fixed and to what extent they are flexible (see, e.g., Cacciari and Tabossi (1993), whose component articles include extensive overviews of the literature).",
        "The competing classifications can derive from both theoretical considerations, like psycholinguistic evidence, and practical considerations, like whether an NLP system attempts to analyze only those idioms that are recorded or whether it attempts to analyze new coinages as well.",
        "The scope of the current analysis is idioms that are recorded as well as certain types of free modifications of them.",

        "The only special syntactic feature is that the roots of the lexical components of the prepositional phrase are explicitly listed: v (into) and grob (grave).",
        "The semantic zone (sem-struc) records the semantic interpretation: it is headed by a kill event whose agent and theme are productively analyzed as the meaning of the subject and direct object, respectively.",
        "The meanings of v (into) and grob (grave), which are – under this analysis – non-compositional, are attributed null semantics.",
        "Two aspects of semantic interpretation require comment.",
        "First, in most contexts this idiom is not used to threaten actual killing; however, the same can be said for the lexeme kill used in the threat I'll kill you!",
        "; this aspect of interpretation is clearly extra-lexical.",
        "Second, although it is likely that a person who did not know this idiom would be able to interpret its meaning using the meanings of the component elements, most NLP systems would struggle.",
        "Once we decide to record a phrase as idiomatic to ease processing, the level of transparency of the components becomes unimportant.",
        "Analysis of a clause that uses vgonjat' v grob 'kill' will generate three referring expressions that must be resolved: the agent of the killing, the theme of the killing (we will not quibble here about which case role to choose for the person killed), and the act of killing.",
        "These referring expressions might be realized, for example, as human-23, human-24 and kill-4 in a given text meaning representation.",
        "Once the system has arrived at these analyses, reference resolution proceeds as it would for any referring expressions, whether or not they were part of an idiom: textual coreferents – recorded as semantic entities in TMR – are sought and, whether or not they are found, the referring expression is anchored in the fact repository.",
        "If we look at what is special about processing the reference in idioms, then, there are only two aspects: (1) ensuring that productive syntactic processes are permitted only if applicable, and (2) ensuring that the correct inventory of referring expressions – understood as semantic structures – is generated.",
        "Let us compare this treatment of idioms to the one proposed by villavicencio et al.",
        "(2004).",
        "They treat the potential variability of idioms using the notion of semantic decomposition.",
        "If an idiom can be paraphrased in a syntactically parallel way, it is decomposable (spill the beans – reveal a secret), even though non-standard meanings need to be assigned to each component.",
        "The fundamental differences between their approach and ours relate to semantic encoding and reference resolution.",
        "For villavi-cencio et al., the semantics of idioms is conveyed by paraphrases with other linguistic elements (spill – reveal, beans – secret).",
        "For us, semantics is formulated using the ontologically grounded metalanguage of OntoSem.",
        "As regards the initial syntactic parse, both approaches seem to offer the same coverage of syntactic variability, and resources could be shared with seemingly minimal work devoted to format conversion.",
        "We have just shown how syntactic processes – specifically, various types of ellipsis – can apply to idioms in a language, and how the lexical encoding of such idioms allows for syntactic variability.",
        "Other idioms, by contrast, are syntactically frozen.",
        "Such idioms are commonly treated as strings with spaces, but this only works if absolutely no modifiers or other entities (e.g., \"ahem\") can intervene.",
        "If intervening material is possible, it is preferable to encode the idiom using separate syntactic constituents.",
        "However, if one records the components individually, the analysis system must understand that diathesis transformations, ellipsis, pronominalization, etc., are not applicable.",
        "In OntoSem we label frozen syntactic constituents using immediate constituents, like NP, rather than grammatical function labels, like subject.",
        "Since transformations apply only to grammatical functions, they become automatically inapplicable if immediate constituents are used.",
        "However, since all constituents are still listed individually, intervening material and free modification are permitted in the usual way, as in He kicked the bloody bucket!",
        "Of course, treating free modifications of non-compositional parts of an idiom or other multi-word expression (MWE) is not trivial, as described in some depth in Mc-Shane et al.",
        "(2008).",
        "To summarize that discussion, our basic approach to treating modifiers within MWEs is to analyze the MWE as indicated in the sem-struc, then attempt to attach the meaning of \"orphan\" modifiers to the meaning of the entire structure using generalized processes for meaning composition.",
        "In the case of He kicked the bloody bucket, the basic meaning will be rendered in the text meaning representation as (die-1 (experiencer human-1)).",
        "The modifier bloody has two senses in our lexicon, semantically described as (relation blood) and (emphasis .7).",
        "We have a rule that prefers the stylistic interpretation in the case of non-compositional idioms.",
        "So the final text meaning representation will be (die-1 (experiencer human-1) (emphasis .7)).",
        "((emphasis .7) indicates a high value for the property emphasis on the abstract scale {0,1}.)",

        "The OntoSem environment does not currently work on Russian, though it has been applied, at least partially, to several languages apart from English in the past – including such different languages as Turkish, Spanish, Korean and Georgian.",
        "The reason for exploring the idiom-reference connection in Russian was to judge how well our approach, which is implemented for and works well in English, holds up cross-linguistically.",
        "Having worked the examples presented in this paper and many others, we are convinced that when the time comes, a Russian OntoSem will be configurable without the need to expand the theory and methodology that support our treatment of idioms, ellipsis and reference overall.",
        "A reasonable question would be, why not evaluate the approach on English, since an English system already exists?",
        "The reason is purely practical: it is far more difficult and expensive to run evaluations of knowledge-based systems that treat complex phenomena than it is to run evaluations of systems that treat less complex phenomena.",
        "That being said, we are just completing a new version of our DEKADE knowledge acquisition and evaluation environment which will make it much easier than before to evaluate the results of text analysis.",
        "We expect regular evaluations to become part of our development work in the near future."
