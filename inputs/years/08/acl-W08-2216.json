        "There has recently been a great deal of work aimed at trying to extract information from substantial texts for tasks such as question answering.",
        "Much of this work has dealt with texts which are reasonably large, but which are known to contain reliable relevant information, e.g. FAQ lists, on-line encyclopaedias, rather than looking at huge unorganised resources such as the web.",
        "We believe, however, that even this work underestimates the complexity and subtlety of language, and hence will inevitably be restricted in what it can cope with.",
        "In particular, everyday use of language involves considerable amounts of reasoning over intensional objects (properties and propositions).",
        "In order to respond appropriately to simple-seeming questions such as 'Is going for a walk good for me?', for instance, you have to be able to talk about event-types, which are intrinsically intensional.",
        "We discuss the issues involved in handling such items, and shows the kind of background knowledge that is required for drawing the appropriate conclusions about them."

        "The work reported here aims to allow users to interact with a health information system via natural language.",

        "(1) My doctor says I am allergic to eggs.",
        "Is it safe for me to eat cake?",
        "Understanding such utterances requires the use of a highly intensional representation language, and responding to them requires a surprising amount of background knowledge.",
        "We will consider below the problems that such everyday utterances bring for formal paraphrases of natural language, and we will look at the kind of background knowledge that is required for producing the right kinds of response.",
        "In order to produce a system that carries out the required inference we need access to an inference engine for carrying out proofs in a representation language with the required expressive power.",
        "The details of the engine we use are beyond the scope of this paper.",
        "(Ramsay, 2001; Ramsay and Field, 2008).",
        "For the purposes of the current paper we will simply show the results that can be obtained by using it.",
        "The work reported here is complementary to work on corpus-based approaches such as textual entailment: approaches that ignore the intensionality of everyday language will inevitably fail to capture important inference patterns, but on the other hand the work reported here cannot deal with large amounts of information provided as free text.",
        "Ideally, the two approaches will be combined.",
        "The aim of the current paper is to provide a reminder of the prevalence of intensionality in everyday language, and to demonstrate that modern theorem proving techniques can cope with this kind of knowledge without introducing undue processing delays."

        "The general idea behind the work reported here is that users will input statements about their health, either spontaneously or in response to prompts from the system, and will ask questions about what they can and should do, and the systemwill provide them with appropriate guidance.",
        "The overall architecture is completely classical:",
        "1.",
        "The user's input is translated into a meaning representation (logical form, LF) in some suitable representation language.",
        "2.",
        "This LF contains a specification of the illocutionary force of the input (is it a statement, or a question, or a command, or .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "?",
        ").",
        "3.",
        "If the utterance is classified as a statement, its propositional content is added to the system's view of the user's beliefs, and if it is classified as a question, the system will attempt to use its background knowledge of the domain to answer it.",
        "We are not currently attempting to make the system do anything in response to a command from the user, since users do not generally issue commands in our chosen domain, but clearly if this did happen then we would want to make the system construct a plan to carry out the required action.",
        "This part of the system's activity requires it be able to access and exploit relevant background knowledge.",
        "This is obvious in the case of questions, but in the given domain it is also important to be able to spot situations where the user's beliefs are incomplete or are in conflict with the system's beliefs, since most people's understanding about medical topics is flawed.",
        "The ability to reason about what has been said, then, is crucial to the construction of appropriate responses.",
        "This architecture is entirely orthodox.",
        "What is unusual about the current work is the emphasis on intensionality, so the first thing to do is examine why we believe that this is such a significant problem.",
        "1.",
        "Doctors and patients make extensive use of generic NPs and bare plurals: 'If you follow this diet you should manage to control them without drugs', 'Do you normally have snacks?",
        "', 'When I started chemotherapy, on the 2nd of August, glycaemia was still rather high'...",
        "Such NPs are not, in fact, all that much more prevalent in this domain than in general language.",
        "Across the BNC, for instance, it turns out that 27% of NPs have 'the' as their determiner, 19% are bare plurals, 29% are bare singulars, 11% have a' or an' as their determiner, and the remainder have a variety of other determiners.",
        "Thus bare plural and generic singular NPs occur about as frequently as 'the' and 'a', and substantially more freqently than 'some', 'all' and 'every' (less than 1% each).",

        "• We allow other entities to play named roles with respect to these events, where we denote that some item X is, for instance, the agent of some event E by writing 0(E, agent,X): using this notation, rather than writing agent (E,X), allows us to quantify over thematic roles, which in turn allows us to state generalisations that would otherwise be awkward.",

        "We also include the surface illocutionary force in the LF, since this is part of the meaning of the utterance and hence it seems sensible to include it in the LF.",
        "In particular, there are interactions between surface illocutionary force and other aspects of the meaning which are hard to capture if you treat them independently.",
        "This is slightly less standard than the other aspects of our LFs, but it does have the advantage that these LFs keep all the information that we can obtain by inspecting the form of the utterance in one place.",
        "A typical example of an LF for a simple sentence is given in Figure 1.",
        "(3) The man loves a woman.",
        "3D : {aspect(C,simplePast,D)}",
        "If you want to reason about utterances in natural language, e.g. in order to answer questions on the basis of things you have been told, then there seems to be no alternative to constructing LFs of the kind in Figure 1, axiomatising the relevant background knowledge, and then invoking your favourite theorem prover.",
        "Shallow semantic analysis simply does not provide the necessary detail, and it is very hard to link textual entailment algorithms (Dagan et al., 2005) to complex domain knowledge.",
        "The critical issue in connecting NLP systems to rich axiomatisations of domain knowledge seems likely to be that existing frameworks for constructing meaning representations are not rich enough, not that they are too rich.",
        "In the remainder of this paper we will explore three specific issues that have arisen in our attempt to use natural language as a means for accessing medical knowledge.",
        "We have beoome sensitised to these issues because of their importance for our application, but we believe that they are actually widespread, and they will need to be solved for any system which links natural language to complex domain knowledge."

        "We have argued that in order to cope properly with even quite straightforward uses of language, you need large amounts of background knowledge, much of which has to be couched in some highly intensional framework, and you need inference engines which can manipulate this knowledge.",
        "In the body of the paper we have shown a number of examples which we believe illustrate this argument, and have looked at the representations and rules that we employ for dealing with these cases.",
        "The natural question that arises at this point is: that's all very well, but can the approach outlined here be extended to cover a more substantial set of cases?",
        "There are two key issues here.",
        "How difficult is it to capture a reasonably substantial body of knowledge within the framework we have outlined, and what will happen to the inference engine when we do?",
        "Writing rules in property theory is very hard work.",
        "Writing rules in property theory which will mesh nicely with logical forms obtained from natural language sentences is extremely hard work.",
        "If we had to hand-code the rules we want directly in property theory (or indeed in any formal language) then the approach discussed here would, clearly, be impossible to extend to cover more than a handful of cases.",
        "Fortunately, however, we have a much easier way of constructing rules.",
        "We have, after all, a mechanism for converting natural language sentences into logical forms.",
        "So if we state the rules we want in natural language we will obtain logical forms of those rules, and furthermore those paraphrases will automatically be couched in terms which mesh nicely with logical forms obtained from other natural language sentences.",

        "XI 3Jevent(J,eat)",
        "Writing rules like (8) is clearly easier than producing formulae like Figure 7 by hand.",
        "Writing down all the knowledge you need in order to cope with a non-trivial domain is still a very substantial task, but doing it in English is at least feasible in a way that doing it directly in a formal language is not.",
        "How will the inference engine cope when confronted with thousands of rules?",
        "Very large parts of everyday knowledge can, in fact, be expressed pretty much as Horn clauses.",
        "Our inference engine converts Horn clauses into (almost) pure Prolog, and there is certainly no problem in using very large sets of Horn clauses converted to this form (a modern Prolog system will cope comfortably with sets of several hundred thousand Horn clauses, and will carry out substantial inference chains involving such sets in small fractions of a second).",
        "The only concern here relates to non-Horn clauses (which do not tend to occur all that frequently in rules explaining the relationships between natural language terms) and intensional rules.",
        "The fact that most intensional rules are guarded has certainly meant that so far we have not encountered any problems when using them, and we are hopeful that this will remain the case.",
        "In any case, there is an alternative question to be answered: what will happen if you don't take the approach outlined here?",
        "All the phenomena we have discussed are widespread-bare plurals, mutual paraphrases, intensional attitudes all occur all over the place.",
        "It is extremely hard to see that systems that rely on surface patterns (either directly, as in textual entailment, or indirectly through shallow parsing/information extraction) can support the kind of reasoning required for getting from 'I have an allergy to eggs.'",
        "to 'It is dangerous for me to eat pancakes', so at some point inference based on background knowledge will have to be invoked.",
        "There seems little alternative to constructing formal paraphrases that capture the subtleties of natural language in all its glory.",
        "If you don't, then you will by definition lose some of the information that was expressed in the text, and that will inevitably mean that you get things wrong.",
        "There is no way round it: either you bite the bullet, construct formal paraphrases that capture the content of the input and use them to carry out inference, or you will get some things wrong."
