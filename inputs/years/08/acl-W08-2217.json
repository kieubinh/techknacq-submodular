        "As the demand for more powerful NLP applications increases, there is also an increasing need to develop algorithms for automated processing of discourse relations and models for deriving the inferences drawn by the reader.",
        "PDTB 2.0 (Prasad et al., 2008), released in January 2008, contains annotations of discourse connectives and their arguments, attribution, and sense labels giving rough semantic descriptions of the connectives.",
        "The availability of such a richly annotated corpus promises to boost our understanding of the structure and meaning of discourse and will facilitate the development of efficient algorithms for identifying discourse connectives and their arguments.",
        "However, in order to be able to derive appropriate inferences associated with discourse relations, we need to develop useful semantic analyses of the meaning of connectives so that they will generate the same range of inferences made by humans.",
        "In this paper we take a first step in that direction, offering a simple formal analysis of concessive relations, thus refining the semantics of the concessive sense labels used in PDTB 2.0.",
        "Our analysis uses basic notions of causality developed in Hobbs (1998, 2005), capitalizing on the distinction between causes and causal complexes and on the semantics of defeasible causality.",
        "Concessive meaning involves the failure of a general defeasible causal relation in this specific instance.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 gives an overview of the PDTB 2.0, focusing on the annotation of the senses of connectives, especially \"concession\".",
        "In Section 3, we present an overview of the framework we are adopting for our formal analysis, namely, Hobbs's logic of causality, and our basic claims about how the semantics of defeasible causality contributes to the semantics of concession.",
        "Section 4 presents the semantic analysis of \"concession\".",
        "In Section 5, we report briefly on the distribution of concessive labels in PDTB 2.0 and conclude in Section 6."

        "The Penn Discourse Treebank provides annotations of the argument structure of discourse connectives, attribution (e.g., 'ownership' of the relation by the writer or other individual), and semantic labels for all the annotated connectives (Prasad et al., 2008).",
        "This annotation of discourse connectives and their arguments draws on a lexical approach to discourse structure (Webber et al., 2003; Webber and Joshi, 2003), viewing discourse connectives as discourse-level predicates that take two abstract objects such as events, states, and propositions (Asher, 1993) as their arguments.",
        "Two major types of discourse connectives are annotated in PDTB: a) explicit connectives including subordinate conjunctions, coordinate conjunctions and adverbials, and b) implicit connectives that are inserted between two adjacent sentences to capture the meaning of the inferred relation when no explicit connective is present.",
        "The PDTB 2.0 is, to date, the largest annotation effort at the discourse level, including approximately 40,000 triples in the form (Connective, Arg1, Arg2).",
        "Arg2 is the second argument in the text in the case of coordinating conjunctions, and is the complement of subordinating conjunctions.",
        "In the case of adverbs, Arg2 is the element which the adverb modifies syntactically.",
        "In cases of ambiguity, sense labels indicate the intended sense in the given context.",
        "In all other cases, sense labels provide semantic descriptions of the relations conveyed by the connectives, both explicit and implicit.",
        "The tagset of senses is organized hierarchically (Miltsakaki et al., 2008).",
        "The top level, or class level, has four tags representing four major semantic classes: \"TEMPORAL\", \"CONTINGENCY\", \"COMPARISON\" and \"EXPANSION\".",
        "For each class, a second level of types is defined to further refine the semantics of the class levels.",
        "For example, \"CONTINGENCY\" has two types \"Cause\" (relating two situations via a direct cause-effect relation) and \"Condition\" (relating a hypothetical scenario with its (possible) consequences).",
        "A third level of subtype specifies the semantic contribution of each argument.",
        "For \"CONTINGENCY\", its \"Cause\" type has two subtypes – \"reason\" (which applies when the connective indicates that the situation specified in Arg2 is interpreted as the cause of the situation specified in Arg1, as often with the connective because) and \"result\" (which is used when the connective indicates that the situation described in Arg2 is interpreted as the result of the situation presented in Arg1).",
        "That is, \"reason\" occurs when Arg2 causes Arg1; \"result\" occurs when Arg1 causes Arg2.",
        "Connectives can also be used to relate arguments pragmatically as in John is in the house because the lights are on or If you 're thirsty, there's beer in the fridge, where the relation involbes the belief in or the telling of the condition rather than the condition itself.",
        "For these rhetorical or pragmatic uses of connectives, a small set of pragmatic sense tags has been defined – specifically, \"Pragmatic Cause\", \"Pragmatic Condition\", \"Pragmatic Contrast\" and \"Pragmatic Concession\".",
        "\"Concession\" is a type of the class-level category \"COMPARISON\".",
        "The class tag \"COMPARISON\" applies when the connective indicates that a discourse relation is established between Arg1 and Arg2 in order to highlight prominent differences between the two situations.",
        "Semantically, the truth of both arguments is independent of the connective or the established relation.",
        "\"COMPARISON\" has two types that further specify its semantics.",
        "In some cases, Arg1 and Arg2 share a predicate or a property and the difference is highlighted with respect to the values assigned to this property.",
        "This interpretation is tagged with the type \"Contrast\".",
        "There are also cases in which the highlighted differences are related to expectations raised by one argument which are then denied by the other.",
        "This intepretation is tagged with the type \"Concession\".",
        "According to the description in the PDTB 2.0 manual, the type \"Concession\" applies when the connective indicates that one of the arguments describes a situation A which normally causes C, while the other asserts (or implies) Alternatively, one argument denotes a fact that triggers a set of potential consequences, while the other denies one or more of them.",
        "Two \"Concession\" subtypes are defined in terms of the argument creating an expectation and the one denying it.",
        "Specifically, when Arg2 creates an expectation that Arg1 denies, it is tagged as \"expectation\", shown in (1.c-d).",
        "When Arg1 creates an expectation that Arg2 denies, it is tagged as \"contra-expectation\", shown in (1.e-f).",

        "Many authors propose such an account of causality, e.g. (Achinstein, 1965; Shoham, 1990; Simon, 1991; Bell, 1999,2003), and Giunchiglia et al.",

Thus, the flipping of the switch and the normal states of the bulb, the wiring, and the power supply would all be in the causal complex for the turning on of the light.",

        "But the light switch could be on or off; neither can be presumed.",
        "Those eventualities that cannot normally be assumed to be true are identified as causes (cf. Kayser and Nouioua, 2008).",

        "It is a consequence of universal instantiation that any property that holds of an eventuality type is true of any partial instance of it.",
        "Hobbs's logical framework is particularly suitable to the study of the semantics of discourse connectives, in that it allows focusing on their meaning while leaving underspecified the details about the eventualities involved.",

        "Some of them relate causality with time, some relate causality with probability, and so on Hobbs (2005).",
