        "Several early studies in large-scale text processing (Liakata and Pulman, 2002; Gildea and Palmer, 2002; Schubert, 2002) showed that having access to a sentence's syntax enabled credible, automated semantic analysis.",
        "These studies suggest that the use of increasingly sophisticated linguistic analysis tools could enable an explosion in available symbolic knowledge.",
        "Nonetheless, much of the subsequent work in extraction has remained averse to the use of the linguistic deep structure of text; this decision is typically justified by a desire to keep the extraction system as computationally lightweight as possible.",
        "The acquisition of background knowledge is not an activity that needs to occur online; we argue that as long as the extractor will finish in a reasonable period of time, the speed of such a system is an issue of secondary importance.",
        "Accuracy and usefulness of knowledge should be of paramount concern, especially as the increase in available computational power makes such \"heavy\" processing less of an issue.",
        "The system explored in this paper is designed for Open Knowledge Extraction: the conversion of arbitrary input sentences into general world knowledge represented in a logical form possibly usable for inference.",

      "text": [
        "Given that the concern here is with open knowledge extraction, the myriad projects that target a few prespecified types of relations occurring in a large corpus are set aside.",
        "Among early efforts, one might count work on deriving selectional preferences (e.g., Zernik (1992); Resnik (1993); Clark and Weir (1999)) or partial predicate-argument structure (e.g., Abney (1996)) as steps in the direction of open knowledge extraction, though typically few of the tuples obtained (often a type of subject plus a verb, or a verb plus a type of object) can be interpreted as complete items of world knowledge.",
        "Another somewhat relevant line of research was initiated by Zelle and Mooney (1996), concerned with learning to map NL database queries into formal DB queries (a kind of semantic interpretation).",
        "This was pursued further, for instance, by Zettlemoyer and Collins (2005) and Wong and Mooney (2007), aimed at learning log-linear models, or (in the latter case) synchronous CF grammars augmented with lambda operators, for mapping English queries to DB queries.",
        "However, this approach requires annotation of texts with logical forms, and extending this approach to general texts would seemingly require a massive corpus of hand-annotated text â€“ and the logical forms would have to cover far more phenomena than are found in DB queries (e.g., attitudes, generalized quantifiers, etc.",
        ").",
        "Another line of relevant work is that on semantic role labelling.",
        "One early example was MindNet (Richardson et al., 1998), which was based on collecting 24 semantic role relations from MRDs such as the American Heritage Dictionary.",
        "More recent representative efforts includes that of Gildea and Jurafsky (2002), Gildea and Palmer (2002), and Punyakanok et al.",
        "(2008).",
        "The relevance of this work comes from the fact that identifying the arguments of the verbs in a sentence is a first step towards forming predications, and these may in many cases correspond to items of world knowledge.",
        "Open Knowledge Extraction through Compositional Language Processing 241",
        "Liakata and Pulman (2002) built a system for recovering Davidsonian predicate-argument structures from the Penn Treebank through the application of a small set of syntactic templates targeting head nodes of verb arguments.",
        "The authors illustrate their results for the sentence \"Apple II owners, for example, had to use their television sets as screens and stored data on audiocassettes\" (along with the Treebank annotations); they obtain the following QLF, where verb stems serve as predicates, and arguments are represented by the head words of the source phrases:",
        "and (store(e2,owner,datum), and on(e2,audiocassette)))",
        "For a test set of 100 Treebank sentences, the authors report recall figures for various aspects of such QLFs ranging from 87% to 96%.",
        "While a QLF like the one above cannot in itself be regarded as world knowledge, one can readily imagine postprocessing steps that could in many cases obtain credible propositions from such QLFs.",
        "How accurate the results would be with machine-parsed sentences is at this point unknown.",
        "In the same year, Schubert (2002) described a project aimed directly at the extraction of general world knowledge from Treebank text, and Schubert and Tong (2003) provided the results of hand-assessment of the resulting propositions.",
        "The Brown corpus yielded about 117,000 distinct simple propositions (somewhat more than 2 per sentence, of variable quality).",
        "Like Liakata and Pulman's approach the method relied on the computation of unscoped logical forms from Treebank trees, but it abstracted propositional information along the way, typically discarding modifiers at deeper levels from LFs at higher levels, and also replacing NPs (including named entities) by their types as far as possible.",
        "Judges found about 2/3 of the output propositions (when automatically verbalized in English) acceptable as general claims about the world.",
        "The next section provides more detail on the extraction system, called KNEXT, employed in this work.",
        "Clark et al.",
        "(2003), citing the 2002 work of Schubert, report undertaking a similar extraction effort for the 2003 Reuters corpus, based on parses produced by the Boeing parser, (see Holmback et al.",
        "(2000)), and obtained 1.1 million subject-verb-object fragments.",
        "Their goal was eventually to employ such tuples as common-sense expectations to guide the interpretation of text and the retrieval of possibly relevant knowledge in question-answering.",
        "This goal, unlike the goal of inferential use of extracted knowledge, does not necessarily require the extracted information to be in the form of logical propositions.",
        "Still, since many of their tuples were in a form that could be quite directly converted into propositional forms similar to those of Schubert, their work indicated the potential for scalability in parser-based approaches to information extraction or knowledge extraction.",
        "A recent project aimed at large-scale, open extraction of tuples of text fragments representing verbal predicates and their arguments is TextRunner (Banko et al., 2007).",
        "This systems does part-of-speech tagging of a corpus, identifies noun phrases with a noun phrase chunker, and then uses tuples of nearby noun phrases within sentences to form apparent relations, using intervening material to represent the relation.",
        "Apparent modifiers such as prepositional phrases after a noun or adverbs are dropped.",
        "Every candidate relational tuple is classified as trustworthy (or not) by a Bayesian classifier, using such features as parts of speech, number of relevant words between the noun phrases, etc.",
        "The Bayesian classifier is obtained through training on a parsed corpus, where a set of heuristic rules determine the trustworthiness of apparent relations between noun phrases in that corpus.",
        "As a preview of an example we will discuss later, here are two relational tuples in the format extracted by TextRunner: (the people) use (force), (the people) use (force) to impose (a government).",
        "No attempt is made to convert text fragments such as \"the people\" or \"use _ to impose\" into logically formal terms or predicates.",
        "Thus much like semantic role-labelling systems, TextRunner is an information extraction system, under the terminology used here; however, it comes closer to knowledge extraction than the former, in that it often strips away much of the modifying information of complex terms (e.g., leaving just a head noun phrase).",
        "KNEXT (Schubert, 2002) was originally designed for application to collections of manually annotated parse trees, such as the Brown corpus.",
        "In order to extract knowledge from larger text collections, the system has been extended for processing arbitrary text through the use of third-party parsers.",
        "In addition, numerous improvements have been made to the semantic interpretation rules, the filtering techniques, and other components of the system.",

        "The ULFs are rendered in Episodic Logic (e.g., (Schubert and Hwang, 2000)), a highly expressive representation allowing for generalized quantifiers, predicate modifiers, predicate and sentence reification operators, and other devices found in NL.",
        "The abstraction process drops modifiers present in lower-level ULFs (e.g., adjectival premodifiers of nominal predicates) in constructing higher-level ULFs (e.g., for clauses).",
