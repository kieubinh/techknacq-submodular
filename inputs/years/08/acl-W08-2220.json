      "text": [
        "Following advances made in computational syntax in the last years, we have recently witnessed progress in computational semantics too.",
        "Thanks to the availability of wide-coverage parsers, most of them implementing statistical approaches with models trained on the Penn Treebank, we now have at our disposal tools that are able to produce formal, semantic representations on the basis of the output of the aforementioned parsers, achieving high coverage.",
        "Computational semantics isn't anymore limited to tedious paper and pencil exercise, nor to implementations of tiny fragments of natural language, and has genuinely matured to a level useful for real applications.",
        "As a direct consequence, the question as to how to measure the quality of semantic representations output by these systems pops up.",
        "This is an important issue for the sake of the field, but difficult to answer.",
        "On the one hand one might think that the quality of semantic representations, because they are more abstract than surface and syntactic representations, should be easy to evaluate.",
        "On the other hand, however, because there are several \"competing\" semantic formalisms, and the depth of analysis is arbitrary, it is hard to define a universal theory-neutral gold standard for semantic representations (see, e.g. Bos, 2008a).",
        "Partly in response to this situation in the field, a \"shared task\" was organised as a special event on the STEP 2008 conference.",
        "The aim of this shared task was primarily to compare semantic representations for texts as output by state-of-the-art NLP systems.",
        "This was seen as a first step for designing evaluation methodologies in computational semantics, with a practical bottom-up strategy: rather than defining theoretical gold standard representations, we look what current systems can actually produce and start working from that."

        "The farm earned about $10,000 on revenue of $450,000 in 2007, and hopes to make a profit of 5 percent on $650,000 in revenue in this, its 10th year, so it can open another operation elsewhere in Philadelphia.",
