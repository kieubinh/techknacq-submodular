        "As our contribution to the 2008 STEP Symposium's \"shared task\" of comparing semantic representations (Bos, 2008), we describe Boeing's NLP system, BLUE (Boeing Language Understanding Engine), and subsequently analyze its performance on the task's shared texts.",
        "BLUE consists of a pipeline of a parser, logical form (LF) generator, an initial logic generator, and subsequent processing modules.",
        "The parser has broad coverage and is domain general.",
        "The logical form generator currently deals with a (reasonably large) subset of linguistic phenomena, including simple sentences, prepositional phrases, compound nouns, ordinal modifiers, proper nouns, some simple types of coordination, adverbs, negation, comparatives, and modals.",
        "The initial logic generator performs a straightforward transformation of the LF to first-order logic syntax.",
        "Subsequent processing modules then perform word sense disambiguation, semantic role labeling, coreference resolution, and some limited metonymic and other transformations.",
        "The overall system currently produces output expressed in one of two target ontologies, namely WordNet and the University of Texas at Austin's Component Library (CLib) (Barker et al., 2001).",
        "In this paper we illustrate the system's use with WordNet's ontology.",
        "The overall system was originally developed for interpreting a controlled language called CPL (Clark et al., 2007), but also often makes reasonable interpretations of more complex, open text sentences, as we illustrate here.",
        "Parsing is performed using SAPIR, a mature, bottom-up, broad coverage chart parser (Harrison and Maxwell, 1986).",
        "The parser's cost function is biased by a database of manually and corpus-derived \"tuples\" (good parse fragments), as well as hand-coded preference rules.",
        "During parsing, the system also generates a logical form (LF), a semi-formal structure between a parse and full logic.",
        "The LF is a simplified and normalized tree structure with logic-type elements, generated by rules parallel to the grammar rules, that contains variables (prefixed by underscores \"_\") and additional expressions for other sentence constituents.",
        "Variables can represent noun phrases, propositions, and even verb phrases (e.g., \"To solve this problem is difficult\").",
        "Some disambiguation decisions are performed at this stage (e.g., structural, part of speech), while others are deferred (e.g., word senses, semantic roles), and there is no explicit quantifier scoping.",
        "Various syntactic properties and relationships are captured in the LF, including: S (sentence), PP (prepositional phrase), NN (noun compound), PN (proper name), PLUR (plural), PLUR-N (numbered plural).",
        "Tense, aspect, and polarity are also recorded in the LF.",
        "For example:",
        "LF for \"An object is thrown with a horizontal speed of 20 m/s from a cliff that is 125 m high.\"",
        "The LF is then used to generate ground logical assertions of the form r(x,y), containing Skolem instances (denoting existentially quantified variables) by applying a set of simple, syntactic rewrite rules recursively to it.",
        "Verbs are reified as individuals, Davidsonian-style.",
        "At this stage of processing, the binary predicates are: subject (syntactic subject), sobject (syntactic object), mod (modifier), all the prepositions, value (for physical quantities), number-of-elements (for numbered plurals), and named (for proper names).",
        "For example, the above LF is translated into \"syntactic logic\" (additional predicates indicating part of speech, tense, aspect, determiners, and polarity are not shown):",
        ";;; \"An object is thrown with a horizontal speed sobject (throw01,object01), \"with\"(throw01,speed01), \"from\"(throw01,cliff01).",
        "While the output of the basic system is in a logic syntax, it is not coherent enough to support inference as it preserves many difficult linguistic phenomena (ambiguity, metonymy, etc.).",
        "Further semantic interpretation involves disambiguation and aligning the interpretation with the target ontology we are using.",
        "In general, this is a complex task and our system only makes limited steps in this direction using five modules: word sense disambiguation (WSD); semantic role labeling (SRL); coreference resolution (including across different parts of speech); metonymy resolution (with respect to the target ontology); and structural transformations.",
        "We describe these modules below.",
        "Word Sense Disambiguation When using WordNet's ontology, each synset in WordNet is a target concept for WSD.",
        "BLUE currently performs naive word sense disambiguation by simply selecting the most common synset for a given word+part-of-speech using context-independent frequency statistics.",
        "When using the Component Library (CLib) ontology, BLUE exploits hand-authored mappings between WordNet synsets and CLib concepts: Given a word, e.g., \"cliff\", BLUE first finds WordNet synsets for the word, then climbs WordNet's taxonomy from those synsets until it finds synsets mapped to CLib concepts, and returns those CLib concepts, again using preference based on context-independent frequency statistics.",
        "Verb nominalizations map to the denominalized verb, thus \"fall\"(n) and \"falling\"(n) both map to synsets for \"fall\"(v).",
        "Semantic Role Labeling With both ontologies, BLUE uses the same relational vocabulary of approximately 100 binary semantic relations, drawn from the relation set used by UT's Component Library.",
        "Semantic role labeling (SRL), for both for verb-noun and noun-noun relationships, is performed using a set of hand-authored SRL rules, e.g., \"from\"(x,y) is labeled as origin(x,y) if x is a movement event and y is an object.",
        "In cases where the rules are not adequate to clearly identify a semantic relation, the relation is left as a syntactic relation.",
        "Coreference Coreference (e.g., \"the ball\") is computed by searching for a previous entity in the discourse with the same word and qualifiers as in the referring noun phrase.",
        "(Coreference using synonyms or types produced more errors than it removed).",
        "Metonymy Often a sentence relates entities in a way inconsistent with the target ontology.",
        "For example, with the Component Library (CLib) ontology, movement properties (e.g., speed, acceleration) are defined as properties of the movement events, rather than of the object moving.",
        "Thus a phrase like \"the initial speed of the ball\" is metony-mous (with respect to CLib) for \"the initial speed of the movement of the ball\".",
        "This module spots and corrects such metonymies using a small set of metonymy resolution rules.",
        "Note that metonymy resolution is ontology-specific, reflecting design decisions about what is and is not an allowable expression in the target ontology.",
        "Structural Transformations Often, the structure of the syntactic and (desired) semantic representations differ, and so some structural transformations are necessary.",
        "For example, in the basic processing, verbs (e.g., \"weigh\") are reified as individuals with semantic roles, e.g., \"weigh\"(w), subject(w,x), sobject(w,y), whereas the target ontology stipulates that some particular verbs denote relations e.g., \"weigh\" corresponds to the CLib relation weight(x,y), not a Weigh event.",
        "(This is indicated in CLib by the relation weigh() being associated with synsets for the verb \"weigh\").",
        "Similarly, nouns associated with relations will be transformed to introduce that relation into the representation, e.g., \"weight\"(y), \"of\"(y,x) will be transformed to weight(x,y).",
        "This Boeing's NLP System and the Challenges Semantic Representation 267 module makes these and other transformations.",
        "The verbs \"be\" and \"have\" are similarly mapped to relations, but with the extra step that the target relation depends on the arguments.",
        "A small set of rules determines the appropriate relation to use."

        "We now discuss BLUE's capabilities further in the context of these shared texts.",

        "Sometimes text snippets have been simplified for clarity.",
        "What constitutes a Semantic Representation?",
        "The notion of a semantic representation can be interpreted in several ways.",
        "At one extreme, a representation which captures all the salient linguistic structure and phenomena could be considered \"semantic\".",
        "Such representations will have structure somewhat similar to the syntactic structure of the original text, and the task of interpreting the inferential consequences of those structures is then left to downstream processing, and considered part of commonsense reasoning rather than \"language understanding\".",
        "At the other extreme, one might require the full logical interpretation of the text to be explicit, in order that the representation be truely \"semantic\", on the grounds that if the representation does not explicitly support inference of valid consequences, the meaning has not been captured.",
        "Various positions exist between these two extremes.",
        "For example, one might represent:",
        "(4.2) \"a vaccine prevents cervical cancer\" a. prevents(vaccine,cervical-cancer); or c. the logic for, approximately, \"for all people given (a specific type of) vaccine, they will not subsequently develop cervical cancer\"",
        "Similarly, one might represent \"typical\" in a. have(turbine,power-rating), value(power-rating, 150kW), typical(power-rating); or b. logic for (say) \"the mode of the power rating of the set of turbines is (approxi-",
        "Clearly the more a representation is syntax-like, the more a downstream reasoning component will need have to do to identify its inferential consequences.",
        "Conversely, the more a representation makes the meaning explicit, the harder it is to generate those representations in the first place as even simple sentences can often have highly complex meanings.",
        "At what point one considers a representation \"semantic\" is matter for debate; what is clear is that there is often a significant journey to make to get from text to valid inferential consequences of that text.",
        "From a pragmatic point of view, like most other language systems BLUE generates representations which are more syntactically structured.",
        "This means that, whether one considers them \"semantic\" or not, considerable additional machinery would typically be needed for performing inference using them.",
        "Some other examples of simple sentences with complex meanings include:",
        "• (6.2) \"selling a range of produce\" meaning, approximately, \"the number of types of produce sold is reasonably large\";",
        "• (6.4) \"research has fluctuated with tax incentives\" meaning, approximately, a qualitative relationship exists between the amount of research and the amount of tax incentives;",
        "• (7.2) \"electricity distribution spread to farms\" appealing to the abstract notion of a spatial region, and meaning, approximately, that the region grows with time.",
        "Even with a more syntactic notion of \"semantic representation\", there are numerous more specific issues which need to be addressed.",
        "Below we identify some which arise in the shared task texts, and comment on our system's ability to handle them.",
        "BLUE currently uses a naive, context-independent approach to WSD.",
        "While the naive guess is often right, there are many cases in the shared texts of unusual senses which BLUE will miss, e.g., (1.3) \"how long [time] does it take\", (2.2) \"led to [inspired the development of] a vaccine\", (6.2) \"turn [generate] a profit\".",
        "An interesting phenomenon is seen with: (6.2) \"Greensgrow [is] a plot of land and is selling its own vegetables\".",
        "which mixes senses of \"Greensgrow\" as a piece of land and an institution in the same sentence, causing challenges for standard WSD.",
        "One might consider \"Greensgrow\" as denoting an institution and thus \"Greensgrow is a plot of land\" as metonymy, or \"Greensgrow\" as a complex concept with various facets.",
        "In either case some complex processing is required.",
        "SRL is itself challenging.",
        "In many cases BLUE has left the relation underspecified (especially noun-noun relations), and has occasionally maked mistakes, e.g.,",

        "(5.1) \"I have problem\" has-part(i01,problem01).",

        "Note that the alternative \"places in Africa and South of the Equator\" would not be inconsistent as these areas do overlap; domain knowledge is thus required to understand the intended semantics.",
        "BLUE does not distribute modifiers across coordinates, and thus misses the distribution (7.1) \"wind-energy technology and applications\" – \"wind-energy technology and wind-energy applications\".",
        "BLUE performs definite reference resolution based on name, e.g., (1.2) \"an object...the object...\", and across part of speech, e.g., verb-noun (1.4) \"falls... the fall...\", and adjective-noun (1.2) \"high... height...\", but not across different names, e.g., (6.3) \"Greenslow...",
        "The farm...\".",

        "The two referents are not mentioned earlier, but are understood by the reader to refer to objects in the described scene.",
        "A system should thus realize that \"The waiter\" is the waiter in the restaurant, and \"the order\" is John's order.",
        "Here the anaphor (\"That\") refers to a proposition rather than an object in the world.",
        "This refers to the set of cancers except those previously mentioned, requiring discourse analysis to fully capture the semantics.",
        "BLUE interprets generics as statements relating individuals, thus requiring further downstream interpretation of those individuals and transformation of the representation (e.g., to universal quantification and conditionals) for correct inference.",
        "In general, generics are complex to interpret; not only are quantifications ambiguous, but also generics typically require substantial unstated information to be filled in for the interpretation to be meaningful.",
        "For example, (2.1) \"Cervical cancer is caused by a virus\"",
        "should ultimately be interpreted as (something like) \"An event involving a virus can create an incidence of cervical cancer\".",
        "An even fuller semantics, requiring more world knowledge, would be that the event is infection of a person and that the cancer incidence is in the same person.",
        "How far one should go to reach this degree of interpretation in a \"semantic representation\" is open to debate.",
        "Adjectives and adverbs can modify the expectation of measurement results on an ensemble, again requiring special representational machinery.",

        "(7.5) \"turbines are commonly rated as\" (6.1) \"the community often lacks it [fresh food]\"",
        "BLUE ignores tense and aspect information (although it extracts it in the intermediate logical form), a gap for complete semantics.",
        "However, BLUE will handle some references to events situated in time and in relation to other events.",

        "(5.4) \"When they killed, they were crouching\" time-at(crouch01,kill01).",

        "We have presented a small catalog of these phenomena, and comments on BLUE's ability to handle them or otherwise.",
        "As discussed, BLUE's output representation is still fairly linguistic in structure, and despite some transformations would often require substantial downstream processing to identify the explicit meaning and inferential consequences of those structures.",
        "Despite this, for cases where the gap between syntax and final logical semantics is small, in particular for the controlled language subset it was originally designed to support, it can generate useful output, and thus constitutes a small step along the way to language understanding."
