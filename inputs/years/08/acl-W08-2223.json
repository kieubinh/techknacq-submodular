        "Texts belonging to closed domains are characterized by the fact that their semantics is controlled or under command of the system; and most importantly, sentences making up the texts are fully parsed without failures.",
        "In practice, these texts are short and sentences are also below a certain threshold, typically less than 25 words.",
        "For longer sentences the system switches from the topdown to the bot-tomup system.",
        "In case of failure it will backoff to the partial system which produces a very lean and shallow semantics with no inference rules.",
        "The small text we will present contains what is called a \"psychological statement\" sentence which contributes an important bias as to the linking of the free pronominal expression contained in the last sentence."

      "text": [
        "GETARUNS, the system for text understanding developed at the University of Venice, is equipped with three main modules: a lower module for parsing where sentence strategies are implemented; a middle module for semantic interpretation and discourse model construction which is cast into Situation Semantics; and a higher module where reasoning and generation takes place.",
        "The system is based on LFG theoretical framework (Bresnan, 2001) and has a highly interconnected modular structure.",
        "The Closed Domain version of the system is a top-down depth-first DCG-based parser written in Prolog Horn Clauses, which uses a strong deterministic policy by means of a lookahead mechanism with a WFST to help recovery when failure is unavoidable due to strong attachment ambiguity.",
        "It is divided up into a pipeline of sequential but independent modules which realize the subdivision of a parsing scheme as proposed in LFG theory where a c-structure is built before the f-structure can be projected by unification into a DAG (Direct Acyclic Graph).",
        "In this sense we try to apply in a given sequence phrase-structure rules as they are ordered in the grammar: whenever a syntactic constituent is successfully built, it is checked for semantic consistency.",
        "In case the governing predicate expects obligatory arguments to be lexically realized they will be searched and checked for uniqueness and coherence as LFG grammaticality principles require.",
        "Syntactic and semantic information is accessed and used as soon as possible: in particular, both categorial and subcategorization information attached to predicates in the lexicon is extracted as soon as the main predicate is processed, be it adjective, noun or verb, and is used to subsequently restrict the number of possible structures to be built.",
        "Adjuncts are computed by semantic compatibility tests on the basis of selectional restrictions of main predicates and adjuncts heads.",
        "The output of grammatical modules is fed then onto the Binding Module (BM) which activates an algorithm for anaphoric binding.",
        "Antecedents for pronouns are ranked according to grammatical function, semantic role, inherent features and their position at f-structure.",
        "Eventually, this information is added into the original f-structure graph and then passed on to the Discourse Module (DM).",
        "The grammar is equipped with a core lexicon containing most frequent 5,000 fully specified inflected word forms where each entry is followed by its lemma and a list of morphological features, organised in the form of attribute-value pairs.",
        "However, morphological analysers for English are also available with big root dictionaries (25,000 for English) which only provide for syntactic subcategorization, though.",
        "In addition to that there are all lexical form provided by a fully revised version of COMLEX, and in order to take into account phrasal and adverbial verbal compound forms, we also use lexical entries made available by UPenn and TAG encoding.",
        "Their grammatical verbal syntactic codes have then been adapted to our formalism and are used to generate a subcategorization schemes with an aspectual and semantic class associated to it – however no restrictions can reasonably be formulated on arguments of predicates.",
        "Semantic inherent features for Out of Vocabulary Words, be they nouns, verbs, adjectives or adverbs, are provided by a fully revised version of WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) – plus EuroWordnet, with a number of additions coming from computer, economics, and advertising semantic fields – in which we used 75 semantic classes similar to those provided by CoreLex (Buitelaar, 1998).",
        "When each sentence s parsed, tense aspect and temporal adjuncts are accessed to build the basic temporal interpretation to be used by the temporal reasoner.",
        "Eventually two important modules are fired: Quantifier Raising and Pronominal Binding.",
        "QR is computed on f-structure which is represented internally as a DAG.",
        "It may introduce a pair of functional components: an operator where the quantifier can be raised, and a pool containing the associated variable where the quantifier is actually placed in the f-structure representation.",
        "This information may then be used by the following higher system to inspect quantifier scope.",
        "Pronominal binding is carried out at first at sentence internal level.",
        "DAGs will be searched for binding domains and antecedents matched to the pronouns if any to produce a list of possible bindings.",
        "Best candidates will then be chosen."

        "GETARUNS has a highly sophisticated linguistically based semantic module which is used to build up the Discourse Model.",
        "Semantic processing is strongly modularized and distributed amongst a number of different submodules which take care of SpatioTemporal Reasoning, Discourse Level Anaphora Resolution, and other subsidiary processes like Topic Hierarchy which cooperate to find the most probable antecedent of coreferring and cospecifying referential expressions when creating semantic individuals.",
        "These are then asserted in the Discourse Model (hence the DM), which is then the sole knowledge representation used to solve nominal coreference.",
        "The system uses two resolution submodules which work in sequence: they constitute independent modules and allow no backtracking.",
        "The first one is fired whenever a free sentence external pronoun is spotted; the second one takes the results of the first submodule and checks for nominal anaphora.",
        "They have access to all data structures contemporarily and pass the resolved pair, anaphor-antecedent to the following modules.",
        "Semantic Mapping is performed in two steps: at first a Logical Form is produced which is a structural mapping fromDAGs onto unscoped well-formed formulas.",
        "These are then turned into situational semantics informational units, infons which may become facts or sits.",

        "The relevance of the sentence is its role in the assignment of the antecedent to the pronominal expressions contained in the following sentence.",
