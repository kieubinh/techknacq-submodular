        "LXGram is a hand-built, general purpose computational grammar for the deep linguistic processing of Portuguese.",
        "It is developed under the grammatical framework of Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar, HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1987,1994; Sag et al., 2003) and uses Minimal Recursion Semantics, MRS (Copestake et al., 2005) for the representation of meaning.",

        "In LXGram, semantic information is encoded following Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS) format for semantic representation (Copestake et al., 2005).",
        "MRS has several properties that makes it an interesting semantic representation format from the point of view of computational semantics.",
        "Notoriously, it allows underspecification of the scope of relevant operators, which permits that a sentence with scope ambiguities can be given a single, underspecified representation.",
        "For some applications, for instance machine translation between closely related languages from the same language family, the underspecified representations may be sufficient and bring the benefit of avoiding possible combinatorial explosion into as many parses as readings.",
        "In a nutshell, the underspecification of scope is achieved by associating every basic relation to a handle (in the feature structure for a relation, the feature LBL encodes this handle) and describing the constraints that hold between these handles (in the feature HCONS, handle constraints).",
        "These constraints can be stated in a way such that and Costa some scope resolution options are allowed while others are discarded.",
        "Nevertheless, there may applications for which it may be important to get fully specified semantic representations.",
        "In this case, MRS permits that the different scope possibilities be computed on demand from the underspecified representation.",
        "Also worth referring in this very brief presentation of the gist of MRS, it is the representation of conjunction with the relative order of conjuncts underspecified, by giving the same handle to the different conjuncts.",
        "This avoids computing associativity and commutativity of conjunction in situations where spurious overgeneration may arise.",
        "Please consult Branco and Costa (2008a) in this volume (pages 31-43) for an example illustrating quantifier scope ambiguities and underspecification.",

        "For instance, we must say that the feature carg always contains a value, for visualization purposes.",
        "This fact sometimes constrains the display of the semantic representations.",
        "It is the reason why the semantics for proper names and for cardinals is more copious than what would seem necessary at first.",

        "The information conveyed by the last two predicates could be simply given by greater-or-equal_rel( j1, 7).",
        "However, for that to display correctly we would have to configure the system to display the second argument of the greater-or-equal_rel relation as a constant.",
        "This will not always be the case: in the semantics for \"22\" that argument is the integer that is the result of summing \"20\" and \"2\" (number expressions receive compositional semantics), represented with the help of the plus_rel relation.",
        "The LKB does not allow one to compute arithmetic expressions.",
        "These few sentences present some interesting problems for the computation of semantic representation in general.",
        "Typically, one is not able to resolve missing nouns, as this sometimes requires access to pragmatic information.",
        "As a consequence, the semantics produced for sentences with a missing noun (see sentence (5)) includes an ellipsis-or-generic_n_1_rel instead of the relation corresponding to that noun.",
        "Also, it is very hard if not impossible to recover missing arguments.",
        "See for instance the semantics for the adjective \"semelhante\" (\"similar\") in sentence (3).",
        "The missing argument is given the type r, instead of the type x of quantified variables, so that we can omit a quantifier for it in the semantics and still be able to ask the system for scoped solutions (the system would complain about free variables if these elements were given the type x).",
        "Finally, it is worth noting that there are some limitations of the semantic representations obtained given that the empirical coverage of the grammar is still in development.",
        "Currently, the grammar does not make yet any distinction between restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses, as we have not focused on the fully-fledged implementation of the semantics of non-restrictive relative clauses yet.",
        "This can be seen in the semantics for the last example, where both relative clauses are semantically combined with their head in the same way."

        "We also tried commenting out some rules that were not necessary to parse these sentences, with the purpose of reducing the search space.",
        "Examples include robustness rules, for parsing strings with no verb.",
        "In the near future, we will be working on a stochastic disambiguation module, which PET supports, in order to constrain the parser's search space and to keep only the best n parses, so that we can avoid the efficiency problems that we are facing at the moment."
