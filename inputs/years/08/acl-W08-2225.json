        "OntoSem, which is the implementation of the theory of Ontological Semantics (Nirenburg and Raskin, 2004), is a text-processing environment that takes as input unrestricted raw text and carries out preprocessing followed by morphological, syntactic, semantic, and discourse analysis, with the results of analysis represented as a formal text-meaning representation (TMR) that can then be used as the basis for various applications.",
        "Text analysis relies on several knowledge resources, briefly described in the subsections below.",
        "The OntoSem ontology is a formal, language-independent, unambiguous model of the world that provides a metalanguage for describing meaning.",
        "It is a multiple-inheritance hierarchical collection of frames that contains richly interconnected descriptions of types of objects, events and properties.",
        "It is a general purposes ontology, containing about 9,000 concepts, that has a number of especially well developed domains that reflect past and ongoing application-specific knowledge acquisition.",
        "Each object and event is described by several dozen properties, some property values being locally specified and others, inherited from ancestors.",
        "Selectional restrictions in the ontology are multivalued, with fillers being introduced by a facet.",
        "The value facet is rigid and is used less in the ontology than in its sister knowledge base of real-world assertions, the fact repository (see Section 1.3).",
        "The facets default (for strongly preferred constraints) and sem (for basic semantic constraints) are abductively overridable.",
        "The relaxable-to facet indicates possible but atypical restrictions, and not blocks the given type of filler.",
        "Event-oriented scripts encode typical sequences of events and the objects that fill their case-roles.",
        "Scripts are used to reason about both language and the world and, in addition to supporting text processing, can support simulation, as in our ongoing Maryland Virtual Patient project (see, e.g. McShane et al., 2007).",
        "The number of concepts in the ontology is far fewer than the number of words or phrases in any language due to the existence of synonyms in language; the possibility of describing lexical items using a combination of ontological and extra-ontological (e.g., temporal) descriptors; the use of a single concept for each scalar attribute that describes all words on that scale (e.g., gorgeous, pretty, ugly); and the decision not to include language-specific concepts in the ontology.",

        "It is the richness of the property-based descriptions that permit the OntoSem ontology to be used for high-end applications like medical simulation and tutoring.",
        "Even though we refer to the OntoSem lexicon as a semantic lexicon, it contains more than just semantic information: it also supports morphological and syntactic analysis and generation.",
        "Semantically, it specifies what concept, concepts, property or properties of concepts defined in the ontology must be instantiated in the TMR to account for the meaning of a given lexical unit of input.",
        "Lexical entries are written in an extended Lexical-Functional Grammar formalism using LISP-compatible format.",
        "The lexical entry – in OntoSem, it is actually called a superentry – can contain descriptions of several lexical senses; we call the latter entries.",

        "6. whether the analyzer creates a semantic and pragmatic context for the input texts, thus modeling human ability to activate relevant knowledge not expressly mentioned in the text;",
        "7. the practical end application(s) that a particular semantic analyzer aims to support.",

        "(2004).)",
        "A prerequisite for our chosen evaluation experiment was filling the lacunae in lexical coverage.",
        "Two points are important to make here: a) we acquired what we consider a complete set of senses for each input word absent from our lexicon, not just the sense that was needed for the text – in other words, this was general-purpose acquisition; b) this was a part of routine ongoing work on resource acquisition and improvement in OntoSem.",
        "The only difference that these input texts made was with respect to the schedule of what to acquire first.",
        "Here are some basic statistics about our lexicon work.",
        "The input texts contained 270 lemmata, of which 36 (13%) were not originally in the OntoSem lexicon.",
        "44 senses were added to the lexicon for the 36 words (these words were predominantly very specific, single-sense ones).",
        "In 12 cases, a sense was added to an existing lexicon entry (bringing the average number of senses for these 12 lemmata to 10.5).",
        "Finally, 5 word senses were added not because of any lacunae in the lexicon but just to make the life of the analyzer more difficult.",
        "In the end, the lexicon contained 1,168 senses for the 270 lemmata (an average of 4.33 senses per word).",
        "Note that OntoSem processes more phenomena than WSD and dependency – aspect, time, speaker attitudes (called modalities in OntoSem), reference resolution and semantic ellipsis, discourse relations, unexpected input, metonymy, etc.",
        "In broad terms, the overall objective of the OntoSem analyzer, when viewed outside of the needs of this evaluation experiment, is to generate a significant amount of machine-tractable knowledge from the text, knowledge that includes not just a minimum of information gleaned from the text but also preference information obtained from the ontological and fact-repository substrate to be used in disambiguation heuristics and applications relying on the human ability to reconstruct meanings not overtly mentioned in the text for the purposes of reasoning and applications like question answering.",
        "For an overview of how TMRs produced by OntoSem can be used in lieu of traditional annotation schemes, see McShane et al.",
        "(2005a).",
        "A standard example of using world knowledge activated in the process of text analysis is being able to infer (abductively) that once \"virus\" has been resolved to be the organism rather than the computer program, then if the word \"operation\" appears further on in the text, it is more probable that it means surgery rather than a computer operation or a military operation.",
        "The meaning extraction process also has a strong filtering ability to reject most of the senses of the words in the input as inappropriate for the particular text.",
        "This ability is not error-proof but the filtering capacity is quite strong even in the current state of the OntoSem analyzer; also note that the ratio of selected senses to those filtered away is a good measure of how much the static resources were tuned to a particular text or domain – the greater the number of senses per word, the less tuning occurred.",
        "OntoSem distinguishes two stages of meaning representation producing, respectively, what is called basic and extended TMRs.",
        "The former covers the parts of the semantic representation that can be derived from the syntactic and lexical-semantic information and contains triggers (called \"meaning procedures\") for a variety of microtheories that require additional heuristics (and usually, as in the case of reference resolution, use general world knowledge from the ontology and fact repository as well as a window of text that is wider than a single sentence; for more on meaning procedures see McShane et al.",

        "Gold standard TMRs form the basis for evaluating the results of automatic semantic analysis.",
        "To serve as useful measures, these TMRs must be created on the basis of the available static knowledge resources (in the case of OntoSem, mainly the lexicon and the ontology) and reflect the maximum of what a system could in principle do with the given resources.",
        "Creating gold standard TMRs is similar to manually annotating texts using the metalanguage of OntoSem.",
        "Text annotation is a difficult and time-consuming (and, therefore, expensive) task.",
        "The deeper the level of annotation, the less reliable the results are.",
        "Even syntactic annotation poses problems and does not yield acceptable kappa scores measuring agreement among annotators (and, of course, agreement among annotators is not a foolproof measure of the quality of an annotation).",
        "The annotation necessary for evaluating OntoSem TMRs is quite deep.",
        "Our experience showed that building gold standard TMRs entirely by hand is a very costly task – it requires highly skilled personnel and involves many searches in the knowledge resources for selecting appropriate TMR components.",
        "In view of the above, we decided on semi-automatic production of gold standard TMRs as the most economical way of producing high-quality annotations.",
        "The process is, briefly, as follows.",
        "OntoSem operation is modularized into stages.",
        "Given an input, OntoSem runs the first stage and presents its results to the human validator/editor.",
        "The latter corrects any mistakes and submits the resulting structure to the next stage of OntoSem.",
        "The process repeats until OntoSem's final stage results are corrected and approved by the human validator, thus yielding a gold standard TMR.",
        "Although \"raw\" TMRs can be cumbersome to read the presentation format shown below – which is automatically generated from raw TMRs – reads rather easily as non-natural languages go.",
        "This demonstrates how our representation is actually quite NL-like, its role being not unlike the English \"possibilistic\" sentences of Schubert (2002).",
        "As concerns writing TMRs, people practically never do it – the most they do is check and, sometimes, correct the output of the automatic analysis system.",
        "The user interfaces supporting the production of gold standard TMRs are incorporated in DEKADE, OntoSem's Development, Evaluation, Knowledge Acquisition and Demonstration Environment.",
        "The editor for preprocessor results is illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "The process of gold standard TMR creation has undergone modifications since the first version of DEKADE was deployed.",
        "In particular, experience showed that people find it difficult to edit the results of syntactic analysis, since it produces a densely populated chart of various options.",
        "So, instead of the syntax editor, we introduced a linking editor (see Figure 2) that helps to establish the correct linking between syntactic arguments and adjuncts on the one hand and semantic case roles and other ontological properties on the other.",
        "We will return to editing syntactic dependency structures once we devise or import an ergonomically appropriate method for this task.",
        "Figure 3 illustrates the editor of basic TMRs.",
        "The semi-automatic methodology of creating gold standard TMRs has proved adequate.",
        "It takes a well-trained person on average less than a minute to correct preprocessing results for an average sentence of 25 words.",
        "Establishing correct linking between syntactic arguments and semantic case roles can take much longer.",
        "Together with the task of validating word sense selection (because of the peculiarities of the DEKADE editors), this task takes on average about 30 minutes per 25-word sentence.",
        "The time for final editing of the basic gold standard TMRs varies depending on how much material is present that does not relate to the \"who did what to whom\" component of meaning.",
        "However, the overall net time needed to create a gold standard TMR for a 25-word sentence is on the order of about 40 minutes.",
        "Our methodology of semi-automatic creation of gold standard TMRs differs from the established rules of the game in the annotation-based evaluation business.",
        "We selected this approach because it a) significantly cuts the time needed for TMR production (we believe that the task would be simply impractical if attempted fully manually – the amount of annotation required being too extensive); b) simplifies the evaluation because it produces the TMR for the one paraphrase that OntoSem will (attempt to) produce automatically.",
        "The main efficiency gain in this semi-automatic production of gold standard TMRs is in using the OntoSem analyzer as a means of quickly retrieving and easily inspecting and selecting the lexical senses for the words in the input."

        "Thus, returning an incorrect result when there are 2 candidates earns a 0 but if there are more than 2 candidates, instead of 0 (as in Score1), we list the score of 1 - (2/n), where n is the number of senses.",

        "We will also work on modifying the relative importance of heuristics from different sources.",
        "In particular, we will work toward reducing the influence of syntactic clues and thereby moving the center of gravity of the analysis process toward semantics proper.",

        "If we estimate the time to create a gold standard basic TMR for a 25-word sentence takes one person-hour, counting the estimated time for acquiring the missing lexicon and ontology information, then it should be possible to create a 100,000-word corpus of gold standard basic TMRs in about two person-years."
