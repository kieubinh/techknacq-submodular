        "Taking into account temporality expressed in texts appears as fundamental, not only in a perspective of global processing of documents, but also in the analysis of the structure of a document.",
        "The analysis of temporality within texts has been studied principally by considering verbal times (e.g. Song and Cohen (1991); Hitzeman et al.",
        "(1995) and temporal adverbials (see below).",
        "Our approach is focused on temporal adverbials – in French – that refer directly to text units concerning common calendar divisions, that we name \"calendar expressions\" (CEs for short).",
        "Several analyses of this kind of expressions has generated a lot of interest, ranging from their automatic recognition and annotation in texts to their analysis in terms of discursive frames (Charolles, 1997; Tannen, 1997), following work of Halliday (1994) which put the emphasis on the importance of the temporal adverbial expressions as modes of discursive organization.",
        "Nowadays, in the field of temporality processing, automatic identification and annotation tasks of CEs are the most developed, mainly because identifying and annotating expressions which contain calendar units are considered – a priori – as trivial tasks.",
        "Those tasks have been particularly explored in three contexts:",
        "1.",
        "Systems which aim to set events on a time scale depending on their duration and according to a hierarchy of unities called granularities (Schilder and Habel, 2001); 2.",
        "Systems for summarizing multi-documents (Barzilay et al., 2001); and 3.",
        "QA systems (Pustejovsky et al., 1993; Harabagiu and Bejan, 2005).",
        "Please note that the proposition of the well-known standard temporal metalanguage named TimeML (Pustejovsky et al., 2003) initially took place in the context of a QA systems worshop (Pustejovsky, 2002), and mainly integrates two schemes of annotations – namely TIDES TIMEX2 (Ferro et al., 2004) and Sheffield STAG (Setzer and Gaizauskas, 2000) – which were essentially put forward from the analysis of CEs.",
        "In this paper, we propose a formal description of CEs in written French texts, by explicitly distinguishing several classes of linguistic markers which must be interpreted as successive operators.",
        "This work is driven in order to propose a set of fine and well-defined annotations which will be used to navigate temporally in an annotated document.",
        "Our approach differs from the preceding ones in two crucial ways:",
        "• Our goal is not to link a CE to an event, neither to fix it on a \"temporal line\", using a set of values relying on ISO 8601 standard format (Mani and Wilson, 2000; Setzer and Gaizauskas, 2000; Filatova and Hovy, 2001); instead our goal is to link CEs between themselves, that is to say to establish their qualitative relative positions (the set of those relations is named \"proper text calendar\");",
        "• We design CE semantics as algebraic expressions.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "In the next section, we introduce an algebra of CEs.",
        "In Section 3 we describe a software application, which exploits functional representation, built with previous way exhibited operators and plugged in the NaviTexte platform, aiming to support text reading.",
        "Finally, conclusions and future research directions are presented in Section 4."

        "We postulate that a CE, say E, used to refer to a calendar area can be described by a succession of operators applied on an argument, named calendar base (CB), say B, that bears a granulariry and a value for anchoring allowing fixing it in the calendar system used and that gives access at the calendar area described by the CE.",
        "Each operator gives a piece of the processing following a specific order: on B is applied a pointing operation, usually expressed by a determinant, whose result is an CE, E1 part of E. On E1 is applied a second kind of operator expressing the useful part of this base (all, the beginning, the middle, the end, a fuzzy area around) given as result a new CE E2 which is part of E and is associated with a piece of the calendar that cuts the time line in three areas (illustrated by Figure 1):",
        "• the Useful portion (U),",
        "• posterior half-line (P).",
        "The useful part can also be obtained either by shifting, like in \"trois semaines plus tard\" (three weeks later), or by zooming, as in \"l'automne de cette année là\" (the autumn of this present year).",
        "A third kind of operator gives access at the area described by the complete CE E: selecting one of the three portioned areas, like in \"jusqu'en avril 2006\" (until April 2006).",
        "The order of operators is the following: a pointing operator OpPointing, followed by one or more focalising or shifting operators OpFocalising/Shifting+ and finally at least one zoning operator OpZoning©.",
        "Some operators can be omitted, usually when they do not provide any new information.",
        "In sum, the representation of CEs has the following generic form: OpZonmg®(OpFocaUsmg/Shifting+(OpPoin-tmg(CB)).",
        "For instance, let us analyse the CE E=\"Avant le début de la fin de l'année 2008\" (before the beginning of the end of the year 2008).",
        "B=\"année 2008\".",
        "Firstly, the operator of pointing, triggered by the identification of \"l' \" (the contraction of \"le\") is applied, given E1=L'année 2008\".",
        "Secondly, two operators of focalising/shifting are applied successively: the first one triggered by \"la fin de\" , provides E2 and the second one, triggered by \"le début de\", provides E2.",
        "Finally an operator of zoning is associated with \"avant\", provided E. Consequently, the CE \"avant le début de la fin de l'année 2008\" is produced as avant (le début de (la fin de(l'(année 2008)))).",
        "The sequence of this CE is depicted and visualized in Figure 2.",
        "Each operator is characterized by its arity (the number of its arguments) and type.",
        "With regard to arity, in this paper we focus on unary operators.",
        "Three types of operators have been defined: pointing, focalising/shifting and zoning.",
        "The pointing operator is trivial (it transforms B into a CE of type E1) but the two others need some refinements.",
        "Focalising/Shifting operators",
        "Focalising/Shifting operators transform a CE of type E1 into a CE of type E2.",
        "Several kinds of focalising/shifting time may be expressed.",
        "For instance, in the expression \"au début de mai 2005\" (at the beginning of may 2005) the focalising/shifting is localised inside the BC (mai 2005), whereas in the expression \"trois semaines avant mai 2005\" (three weeks before may 2005) it is outside the BC.",
        "Consequently, six sub-operators have been identified and are shown Table 1.",
        "It should be noted that ShiftingBeginning and ShiftingAfter operators refers to a family of operators, because for these ones it is necessary to precise two parameters, the granularity and the value of the shifting.",
        "For some reasons of implementation, except for the operator IdShifting, which refers at the identity, all others operators are treated as idempotent.",
        "In other words, we consider as equivalent these two expressions \"au début du début des années 1980\" (at the beginning of the early eighties) and \"au début des années 1980\" (in the early of eighties).",
        "The next version will improve at this point.",
        "Zoning operators",
        "A Zoning operator transforms a CE of type E2, associated to the useful portion U of Figure 1, into the CE E analysed.",
        "A Zoning operator refers to one of the six possible ,Minel,and Schwer Representing and Visualizing Calendar Expressions in Texts 369 zones built from A, P and U: that is A, A+U, U, U+P, P, A+P.",
        "These six kinds of zoning are associated with a set of prepositions, whose prototypes are shown Table 2.",
        "Fuzzy expressions like \"peu avant\" (short before) can double this number.",
        "Table 2 also illustrates the the ZoningAbout operator <U>.",

        "Many applications which exploit temporal expressions in texts, in particular in the area of information extraction, have been implemented (Pazienza, 1999).",
        "Our application is plugged into the textual navigation workstation NaviTexte (Couto, 2006; Couto and Minel, 2007), in order to combine a traditional linear reading with a chronological one.",
        "With this intention, we have undertaken the construction of a computerized aided reading of biographies.",
        "Consequently, we have addressed two issues.",
        "First, identifying temporal expressions and ordering chronologically text segments in which they are included.",
        "Second, building calendar views of the text and navigating through these views.",
        "From the linguistic study presented above, we have defined a set of annotations which are used to automatically annotate biographic texts.",
        "This process is carried out by transducers which put XML annotations through the processed text.",
        "These annotations describe on the one hand, the granularity of CEs, and on the other hand, the kind of identified operator.",
        "For instance, the following XML code illustrates how the temporal expression \"avant le début de la fin de l'année 2008\" (Before the beginning of the end of the year 2008) will be annotated:",
        "<UT Type=\"Expression Calendaire\" Nro=\"7\"> <Annotation Nom=\"Grain\">Annee</Annotation> <Annotation Nom=\"Annee\">2 0 0 8</Annotation> <Annotation Nom=\"RelationCalendrier\">Absolue</Annotation> <Annotation Nom=\"OpTempRÂÔgion1\">Avant</Annotation> <Annotation Nom=\"OpTempDÂOplacement1\">FocalFin</Annotation> <Annotation Nom=\"OpTempDÂOplacement2\">FocalDebut</Annotation> <Chaine>",
        "From these annotations, an automatic ordering relying on values of CEs can be carried out.",
        "A first implementation took only into account disjoined CEs, because they are linearly ordered.",
        "Intersecting CEs, like \"En juin 2007 (...) en été 2007\" (in June 2007 (...) in summer 2007) requires a more powerful formalism.",
        "A formalism relying both on S-Languages (Schwer, 2002b) and granules (Schwer, 2002a) is required to provide a full automatic ordering.",
        "A new kind of view, a calendar one, has been built in the NaviTexte platform.",
        "This view is built from texts which contain CEs annotated as described above.",
        "An example is shown in Figure 3.",
        "Conceptually, a calendar view is a graph coordinated with a two-dimensional grid.",
        "In the left part of the view, lexical chains of various occurrences of CEs in the text are displayed.",
        "By default, those are ordered according to their order of appearance in the text, but it is possible to display a chronological order, by using options offered in the panel located in bottom of the view.",
        "Nodes in the graph represent these lexical chains.",
        "The visual representation of a CE depends of the functional representation computed as described before Figure 2.",
        "A simple CE, with only a pointing operator like in \"l'année 2008\" (the year 2008) is always visualised like a white ellipse.",
        "An operator of focalising/Shifting like \"la fin de\" (the end of) selects an area of the ellipse and blackens it.",
        "Finally, a zoning operator like \"avant\" (before) is visualised by a bold line displaying the area that is referred to.",
        "The plug-in is implemented with the JGaph package and we largely use some of its functionalities, like zooming or the partial layout cache.",
        "We also use html tooltip text in Swing to contextualise a CE in the original text.",
        "For example, in Figure 3, the whole paragraph which contains the CE \"en 1953\" (in 1953) is displayed and the occurrence of a CE is highlighted.",
        "Two kinds of evaluation could be performed on this work: (i) evaluation of automatic recognition and semantic annotation of CEs in text, (ii) evaluation of the calendar view.",
        "The former calls for a classical protocol in NLP, whereas the latter is more complex to carry out.",
        "So far, only recognition has been carried out by Teissedre (2007) who computed recall and precision on three kinds of corpora.",
        "Due to the fact that an annotation is made up of several fields the recall has been computed like this: a score zero when a CE is not identified, a score 1 when the identification is total, and 0.5 when the identification is partial.",
        "Applying these rules, recall is 0.8 and precision is 0.9.",
        "We would like to make two remarks on this result.",
        "First, quantified CEs like \"tous les mardis\" (every Tuesday) or \"un mardi sur deux\" (one Tuesday out of two) and n-aries (n > 3) CEs like \"entre 2008 et 2009 et en juin 2010\" (between 2008 and 2009 and in june 2010) are identified but are not yet taken into account in the semantic annotation process.",
        "Second, syntactic ambiguities like in \"il a dormi deux jours avant Noël\" (he slept two days before Christmas) are not taken into account either.",
        "However in this example, there are two possible syntactic structures.",
        "In the first case, \"avant Noël\" is the CE and the operator is the Regionalisation one; in the second case, \"deux jours avant Noël\" is the CE and the operator is the Shifting one.",
        "Presently, our analysis provides only the second one like in Aunargue et al.",
        "(2001) but we intend to upgrade it in order to provide both analyses.",
        "Evaluation of the calendar view should be studied from a cognitive point of view and is highly dependent on the application.",
