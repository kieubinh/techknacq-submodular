        "Syntactically annotated language resources have long been around, but the greatest obstacle to progress towards systems able to extract semantic information from text is the lack of semantically annotated corpora large enough to be used to train and evaluate semantic interpretation methods.",
        "Recent efforts to create resources to support large evaluation initiatives in the USA such as Automatic Context Extraction (ACE), Translingual Information Detection, Extraction and Summarization (TIDES), and GALE are beginning to change this, but just at a point when the community is beginning to realize that even the 1M word annotated corpora created in substantial efforts such as Prop-Bank (Palmer et al., 2005) and the OntoNotes initiative (Hovy et al., 2006) are likely to be too small.",
        "Unfortunately, the creation of 100M-plus corpora via hand annotation is likely to be prohibitively expensive.",
        "Such a large hand-annotation effort would be even less sensible in the case of semantic annotation tasks such as coreference or wordsense disambiguation, given on the one side the greater difficulty of agreeing on a \"neutral\" theoretical framework, on the other the difficulty of achieving more than moderate agreement on semantic judgments (Poesio and Artstein, 2005).",
        "The ANAWIKI project presents an effort to create high-quality, large-scale anaphorically annotated resources (Poesio et al., 2008) by taking advantage of the collaboration of the Web community, both through cooperative annotation efforts using traditional annotation tools and through the use of game-like interfaces.",
        "This makes ANAWIKI a very ambitious project.",
        "It is not clear to what extend expert annotations can in fact be substituted by those judgements submitted by the general public as part of a game.",
        "If successful, ANAWIKI will actually be more than just an anaphora annotation tool.",
        "We see it as a framework aimed at creating large-scale annotated corpora in general."

        "Large-scale annotation of low-level linguistic information (part-of-speech tags) began with the Brown Corpus, in which very low-tech and time consuming methods were used; but already for the creation of the British National Corpus (BNC), the first 100M-word linguistically annotated corpus, a faster methodology was developed consisting of preliminary annotation with automatic methods followed by partial hand-correction (Burnard, 2000).",
        "Medium and large-scale semantic annotation projects (coreference, wordsense) are a fairly recent innovation in Computational Linguistics (CL).",
        "The semi-automatic annotation methodology cannot yet be used for this type of annotation, as the quality of, for instance, coreference resolvers is not yet high enough on general text.",
        "Collective resource creation on the Web offers a different way to the solution of this problem.",
        "Wikipedia is perhaps the best example of collective resource creation, but it is not an isolated case.",
        "The willingness of Web users to volunteer on the Web extends to projects to create resources for Artificial Intelligence.",
        "One example is the Open Mind Commonsense project, a project to mine commonsense knowledge (Singh, 2002) to which 14,500 participants contributed nearly 700,000 sentences.",

        "Perhaps the best known example of this approach is the ESP game, a project to label images with tags through a competitive game (von Ahn, 2006); 13,500 users played the game, creating 1.3M labels in 3 months.",
        "If we managed to attract 15,000 volunteers, and each of them were to annotate 10 texts of 700 words, we would get a corpus of the size of the BNC.",
        "ANAWIKI builds on the proposals for marking anaphoric information allowing for ambiguity developed in ARRAU (Poesio and Artstein, 2005) and previous projects.",
        "The ARRAU project found that (i) using numerous annotators (up to 20 in some experiments) leads to a much more robust identification of the major interpretation alternatives (although outliers are also frequent); and (ii) the identification of alternative interpretations is much more frequently a case of implicit ambiguity (each annotator identifies only one interpretation, but these are different) than of explicit ambiguity (annotators identifying multiple interpretations).",
        "The ARRAU project also developed methods to analyze collections of such alternative interpretations and to identify outliers via clustering that will be exploited in this project.",

        "Attempts to create hand annotated corpora face the dilemma of either going for the traditional CL approach of high-quality annotation (of limited size) by experts or to involve a large population of non-experts which could result in large-scale corpora of inferior quality.",
        "The ANAWIKI project bridges this gap by combining both approaches to annotate the data: an expert annotation tool and a game interface.",
        "Both tools are essential parts of ANAWIKI.",
        "We briefly describe both, with a particular focus on the game interface.",
        "An expert annotation tool is used to obtain Gold Standard annotations from computational linguists.",

        "The anaphoric annotation of markables within this environment will be very detailed and will serve as a training corpus as well as quality check for the second tool (see below).",

        "A game interface is used to collect annotations from the general Web population.",
        "The game interface integrates with the database of the expert annotation tool but aims to collect large-scale (rather than detailed) anaphoric relations.",
        "Users are simply asked to assign an anaphoric link but are not asked to specify what type (or what features) are present.",
        "Phrase Detectives is a game offering a simple user interface for non-expert users to learn how to annotate text and to make annotation decisions.",
        "The goal of the game is to identify relationships between words and phrases in a short text.",
        "Markables are , and Kruschwitz Addressing the Resource Bottleneck to Create Annotated Texts identified in the text by automatic pre-processing.",
        "There are 2 ways to annotate within the game: by selecting the markable that is the antecedent of the anaphor (Annotation Mode â€“ see Figure 2); or by validating a decision previously submitted by another user (Validation Mode).",
        "One motivation for Validation Mode is that we anticipate it to be twice as fast as Annotation Mode (Chklovski and Gil, 2005).",
        "Users begin the game at the training level and are given a set of annotation tasks created from the Gold Standard.",
        "They are given feedback and guidance when they select an incorrect answer and points when they select the correct answer.",
        "When the user gives enough correct answers they graduate to annotating texts that will be included in the corpus.",
        "Occasionally, a graduated user will be covertly given a Gold Standard text to annotate.",
        "This is the foundation of the user rating system used to judge the quality of the user's annotations.",
        "The game is designed to motivate users to annotate the text correctly by using comparative scoring (awarding points for agreeing with the Gold Standard), and retroactive scoring (awarding points to the previous user if they are agreed with by the current user).",
        "Using leader boards and assigning levels for points has been proven to be an effective motivator, with users often using these as targets (von Ahn, 2006).",

        "This is automatically parsed to extract mark-ables consisting of noun phrases.",
        "The resulting XML format is stored in a relational database that can be used in both the expert annotation tool and the game.",
        "There are a number of challenges remaining in the project.",
        "First of all, the fully automated processing of a substantial (i.e. multi-million) word corpus comprising more than just news articles turned out to be non-trivial both in terms of robustness of the processing tools as well as in terms of linguistic quality.",
        "A second challenge is to recruit enough volunteers to annotate a 100 million word corpus within the timescale of the project.",
        "It is our intention to use social networking sites (including Facebook, Bebo, and MySpace) to attract volunteers to the game and motivate participation by providing widgets (code segments that display the user's score and links to the game) to add to their profile pages.",
        "Finally, the project's aim is to generate a sufficiently large collection of annotations from which semantically annotated corpora can be constructed.",
