        "Providing larger quantities of text that clearly belongs to a given ontological concept is a prerequisite for further steps towards ontology population with relations and instances.",

        "Our goal is to detect the most appropriate Wikipedia article for a given ontology class.",
        "As Wikipedia is a domain-independent resource, it usually contains many more senses for one concept name than does a domain-specific ontology.",
        "Thus, one of the challenges we meet is the need for disambiguation between multiple candidate articles with respect to one specific ontology class.",
        "Therefore, we compare our approach to previous work on sense disambiguation.",
        "Since in our approach, we aim at minimizing the degree of language-and resource dependency, our focus is on the amount of external knowledge used.",
        "One method towards sense disambiguation that has been studied is to use different kinds of text overlap: Ruiz-Casado et al.",
        "(2005) calculate vector similarity between a Wikipedia article and WordNet glosses based on term frequencies.",

        "Since our aim is to acquire concept-related text sources, these methods are not applicable.",

        "This section briefly reviews relevant information about Wikipedia and describes our method for linking ontology classes to Wikipedia articles.",
        "Our algorithm consists of two steps: (i) extracting candidate articles from Wikipedia and (ii) selecting the most appropriate one.",
        "The algorithm is independent of the choice of a specific ontology.",
        "The online encyclopedia Wikipedia currently comprises more than 2,382,000 articles in about 250 languages.",
        "Wikipedia is interesting for our approach because it is semi-structured and articles usually talk about one specific topic.",
        "The structural elements in Wikipedia that we rely on are links between articles, inter-language links, disambiguation and redirect pages.",
        "Inter-language links refer to an article about the same topic in a different language.",
        "Disambiguation pages collect the different senses of a given term.",
        "Redirect pages point to other pages, allowing for spelling variations, abbreviations and synonyms.",
        "The first step of our algorithm is to extract candidate articles for ontology classes.",
        "The method we employ is based on Reiter and Buitelaar (2008).",
        "The algorithm starts with the English label Lc of an ontology class C, and tries to retrieve the article that bears the same title.",
        "Any Wikipedia page P retrieved by this approach falls into one of three categories:",
        "1.",
        "P is an article: The template {{otheruses}} in the article indicates that a disambiguation page exists which lists further candidate articles for C. The disambiguation page is then retrieved and we proceed with step 2.",
        "Otherwise, P is considered to be the only article forC.",
        "2.",
        "P is a disambiguation page: The algorithm extracts all links on P and considers every linked page as a candidate article.",
        "3.",
        "P is a redirect page: The redirect is being followed and the algorithm checks the different cases once again.",
        "We now discuss the features we apply to disambiguate candidate articles retrieved by our candidate extraction method with regard to the respective ontology class.",
        "Some features use structural properties of both Wikipedia and the ontology, others are based on shallow linguistic processing.",
        "Domain relevance",
        "Wikipedia articles can be classified according to their domain relevance by computing the proportion of domain terms they contain.",
        "In this paper, we explore several variants of matching a set of domain terms against the article in question:",

        "Translation distance.",
        "Instances in Wikipedia are usually named entities (NEs).",
        "Thus, the distinction between concepts and instances can, to a great extent, be rephrased as the problem of NE detection.",
        "As our intention is to develop a linking algorithm which is, in principle, language-independent, we decided to rely on the inter-language links provided by Wikipedia.",
        "The basic idea is that NEs are very similar across different languages (at least in languages using the same script), while concepts show a greater variation in their surface forms across different languages.",
        "Thus, for the inter-language links on the article in question that use latin script, we compute the average string similarity in terms of Levenshtein Distance (Levenshtein, 1966) between the title of the page and its translations.",
        "Templates.",
        "Wikipedia offers a number of structural elements that might be useful in order to distinguish instances from concepts.",
        "In particular, the infobox template is used to express structured information about instances of a certain type and some of their properties.",

        "The ontology defines 53 classes and 129 musical properties (e.g. melody) in its namespace, 78 external classes are referenced.",
        "Most of the classes are annotated with comments in natural language.",
        "The MO is connected to several other ontologies (W3C time, timeline, event, FOAF), making it an interesting resource for domain relevant IE tasks and generalisation of the presented techniques to further domains.",
        "The MO is defined in RDF and freely available.",
        "The experiment is divided into two steps: candidate page selection and classification (see Section 3).",
        "For candidate selection we extract Wikipedia pages with titles that are near-string identical to the 53 class labels.",
        "28 of them are disambiguation pages.",
        "From these pages, we extract the links and use them as candidates.",
        "The remaining 25 are directly linked to a single Wikipedia article.",
        "To test our classification features, we divide the overall set of ontology classes in training and test sets of 43 and 10 classes, respectively, that need to be associated with their most appropriate candidate article.",
        "We restrict the linking to one most appropriate article.",
        "For the classification step, we extract the features discussed in Section 3.",
        "Since the candidate set of pages shows a heavily skewed distribution in favour of negative instances, we generate an additional training set by random oversampling (Batista et al., 2004) in order to yield training data with a more uniform distribution of positive and negative instances."

        "The inter-annotator agreement is k = 0.68 (Fleiss' Kappa).",
        "For eight concepts, all three annotators agreed that none of the candidate articles is appropriate and for ten all three agreed on the same article.",

        "The table shows further that the negative instances can be classified reliably using the original or oversampled data set.",
        "However, as we intend to select positive appropriate Wikipedia articles rather than to deselect inappropriate ones, we are particularly interested in good performance for the positive instances.",
        "We observe that this approach identifies positive instances (i.e., appropriate Wikipedia articles) with a reasonable performance when using the oversampled training set.",
        "It is noteworthy that not a single feature performs better than with an f-measure of 0.6 when used alone.",
        "The figures shown in Table 1 are obtained using the combination of all features.",
