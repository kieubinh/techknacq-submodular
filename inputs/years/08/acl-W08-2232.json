        "A lexical chain is a sequence of words such that the meaning of each word from the sequence can be obtained unambiguously from the meaning of the rest of words (Morris and Hirst, 1991; Barzilay and Elhadad, 1999; Harabagiu and Moldovan, 1997; Silber and McCoy, 2002; Stokes, 2004).",
        "The map of all lexical chains of a text provides a representation of the lexical cohesive structure of the text.",
        "Usually a lexical chain is obtained in a bottom-up fashion, by taking each candidate word of a text, and finding an appropriate relation offered by a thesaurus as Rodget (Morris and Hirst, 1991) or WordNet (Barzilay and Elhadad, 1999).",
        "If it is found, the word is inserted with the appropriate sense in the current chain, and the senses of the other words in the chain are updated.",
        "If no relation is found, then a new chain is initiated.",
        "Our method approaches the construction of lexical chains in a reverse order: we first disambiguate the whole text and then construct the lexical chains which cover as much as possible the text.",
        "It is known that in the last years many researchers studied the possibility to globally disambiguate a text.",
        "In Tatar et al.",
        "(2007) is presented CHAD algorithm, a Lesk's type algorithm based on WordNet, that doesn't require syntactic analysis and syntactic parsing.",
        "As usually for a Lesk's type algorithm, it starts from the idea that a word's dictionary definition is a good indicator for the senses of this word and uses the definition in the dictionary directly.",
        "The base of the algorithm is the disambiguation of a triplet of words, using Dice's overlap or Jaccard's measures.",
        "Shortly, CHAD begins with the disambiguation of a triplet w1 w2w3 and then adds to the right the following words to be disambiguated.",
        "Hence it disambiguates at a time a new triplet, where first two words are already associated with the best senses and the disambiguation of the third word depends on the disambiguation of these first two words.",
        "Due to the brevity of definitions in WordNet (WN), the first sense in WN for a word w; (WN 1st sense) must be associated in some cases in a \"forced\" way.",
        "The forced condition represents the situation that any sense of w; is related with the senses of the words w;-2 and w;-1.",
        "Thus the forced condition signals that a lexical chain stops, and, perhaps, a new one begins.",
        "Comparing the precision obtained with CHAD and the precision obtained by the WN 1st sense algorithm for 10 files of Brown corpus (Tatar et al., 2007) we obtained the result: for 7 files the difference was greater or equal to 0.04 (favorable to WN 1st), and for 3 files was lower.",
        "For example, in the worst case (Brown 01 file), the precisions obtained by CHAD are: 0.625 for Dice's measure, 0.627 for Overlap measure, 0.638 for Jaccard's measure while the precision obtained by WN 1st sense is 0.688.",
        "Let us remark that CHAD is used to mark the discontinuity in cohesion, while WN 1 st sense algorithm is unable to do this.",
        "The CHAD algorithm shows what words in a sentence are unrelated as senses with the previously words: these are the words which receive a \"forced\" first WN sense.",
        "Of course, these are regarded differently from the words which receive a \"justified\" first WN sense.",
        "Scoring each sentence of a text by the number of \"forced\" to first WN sense words in this sentence, we will provide a representation of the lexical cohesive structure of the text.",
        "If F is this number, then the valleys (the local minima) in the graph representing the function 1/F will represent the boundaries between lexical chains (see Figure 2).",
        "Lexical chains could serve further as a basis for an algorithm of segmentation.",
        "As our method of determination of lexical chains is linear, the corresponding segmentation is also linear.",
        "The obtained segments could be used effectively in summarization.",
        "In this respect, our method of summarization falls in the discourse-based category.",
        "In contrast with other theories about discourse segmentation, as Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) of Mann and Thompson (1988), attentional/intentional structure of Grosz and Sidner (1986) or parsed RST tree of Marcu (1997), our CTT method (and also, as presented below, our LTT method) supposes a linear segmentation (versus hierarchical segmentation) which results in an advantage from a computational viewpoint."

A method to prove T – H which relies on this definition consists in the verification of the relation: sim(T, H)T < sim(T, H)H. Here sim(T, H)Tand sim(T, H)H are text-to-text similarities introduced in Corley and Mihalcea (2005).",
