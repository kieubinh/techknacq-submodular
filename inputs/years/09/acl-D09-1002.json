        "Semantic role labeling, the task of automatically identifying the semantic roles conveyed by sentential constituents, has recently attracted much attention in the literature.",
        "The ability to express the relations between predicates and their arguments while abstracting over surface syntactic configurations holds promise for many applications that require broad coverage semantic processing.",
        "Examples include information extraction (Surdeanu et al., 2003), question answering (Narayanan and Harabagiu, 2004), machine translation (Boas, 2005), and summarization (Melli et al., 2005).",
        "Much progress in the area of semantic role labeling is due to the creation of resources like FrameNet (Fillmore et al., 2003), which document the surface realization of semantic roles in real world corpora.",
        "Such data is paramount for developing semantic role labelers which are usually based on supervised learning techniques and thus require training on role-annotated data.",

        "For instance, chance evokes the Daring frame, purchased the Com-merceJbuy frame, and injured the Cause-harm frame.",
        "In addition, frames are associated with semantic roles corresponding to salient entities present in the situation evoked by the predicate.",
        "The semantic roles for the frame Daring are Agent and Manner, whereas for Commerce-buy these are Buyer and Goods.",
        "A system trained on large amounts of such hand-annotated sentences typically learns to identify the boundaries of the arguments of the verb predicate (argument identification) and label them with semantic roles (argument classification).",
        "A variety of methods have been developed for semantic role labeling with reasonably good performance (Fi measures in the low 80s on standard test collections for English; we refer the interested reader to the proceedings of the SemEval-2007 shared task (Baker et al., 2007) for an overview of the state-of-the-art).",

        "Lexical items (i.e., predicates evoking existing frames) are missing as well as frames and annotated sentences (their number varies greatly across lexical items).",
        "Considering how the performance of supervised systems degrades on out-of-domain data (Baker et al., 2007), not to mention unseen events, semi-supervised or unsupervised methods seem to offer the primary near-term hope for broad coverage semantic role labeling.",

        "Lhen, faced with an unknown predicate, i.e., a predicate that does not evoke any frame according to the FrameNet database, we must decide (a) which frames it belongs to and (b) how to automatically annotate example sentences containing the predicate.",
        "We solve both problems jointly, using a graph alignment algorithm.",
        "Specifically, we view the task of inferring annotations for new verbs as an instance of a structural matching problem and follow a graph-based formulation for pairwise global network alignment (Klau, 2009).",
        "Labeled and unlabeled sentences are represented as dependency-graphs; we formulate the search for an optimal alignment as an integer linear program where different graph alignments are scored using a function based on semantic and structural similarity.",
        "We evaluate our algorithm in two ways.",

        "This is presumably due to the skewed sense distributions of high frequency verbs, and defaulting to the most likely sense achieves relatively good performance.",
        "Next, we evaluated our method on role labeling, again by comparing the performance of our role labeler on the expanded and original training set.",
        "Since role and frame labeling are interdependent, we count all predicted roles of an incorrectly predicted frame as wrong.",

        "Taken together, our results on frame and role labeling indicate that our method is not very effective for High frequency verbs (which in practice should be still annotated manually).",

        "This paper presents a novel semi-supervised approach for reducing the annotation effort involved in creating resources for semantic role labeling.",
        "Our method acquires training instances for unknown verbs (i.e., verbs that are not evoked by existing FrameNet frames) from an unlabeled corpus.",
        "A key assumption underlying our work is that verbs with similar meanings will have similar argument structures.",
        "Our task then amounts to finding the seen instances that resemble the unseen instances most, and projecting their annotations.",
        "We represent this task as a graph alignment problem, and formalize the search for an optimal alignment as an integer linear program under an objective function that takes semantic and structural similarity into account.",
        "Experimental results show that our method improves frame and role labeling accuracy, especially for Medium and Low frequency verbs.",
        "The overall frame labeling accuracy may seem low.",
        "There are at least two reasons for this.",
        "Firstly, the unknown verb might have a frame for which no manual annotation exists.",
        "And secondly, many errors are due to near-misses, i.e., we assign the unknown verb a wrong frame which is nevertheless very similar to the right one.",
        "In this case, accuracy will not give us any credit.",
        "An obvious direction for future work concerns improving our scoring function.",
        "Pennacchiotti et al.",
        "(2008) show that WordNet-based similarity measures outperform their simpler distributional alternatives.",
        "An interesting question is whether the incorporation of WordNet-based similarity would lead to similar improvements in our case.",
        "Also note that currently our method assigns unknown lexical items to existing frames.",
        "A better alternative would be to decide first whether the unknown item can be classified at all (because it evokes a known frame) or whether it represents a genuinely novel frame for which manual annotation must be provided.",
