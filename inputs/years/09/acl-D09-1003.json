        "Automatic analysis of natural language is still a very hard task to perform for a computer.",
        "Although some successful applications have been developed (see for instance (Chinchor, 1998)), implementing an automatic text analysis system is still a labour and time intensive task.",
        "Many applications would benefit from an intermediate representation of texts, where an automatic analysis is already performed which is sufficiently general to be useful in a wide range of applications.",
        "Syntactic analysis of texts (such as Part-Of-Speech tagging and syntactic parsing) is an example of such a generic analysis, and has proved useful in applications ranging from machine translation (Marcu et al., 2006) to text mining in the biomedical domain (Cohen and Hersh, 2005).",
        "A syntactic parse is however a representation that is very closely tied with the surface-form of natural language, in contrast to Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) which adds a layer of predicate-argument information that generalizes across different syntactic alternations (Palmer et al., 2005).",
        "SRL has received a lot of attention in the research community, and many systems have been developed (see section 2).",
        "Most of these systems rely on a large dataset for training that is manually annotated.",
        "In this paper we investigate whether we can develop a system that achieves state-of-the-art semantic role labeling without relying on a large number of labeled examples.",
        "We aim to do so by employing the Latent Words Language Model that learns latent words from a large unlabeled corpus.",
        "Latent words are words that (unlike observed words) did not occur at a particular position in a text, but given semantic and syntactic constraints from the context could have occurred at that particular position.",
        "In section 2 we revise existing work on SRL and on semi-supervised learning.",
        "Section 3 outlines our supervised classifier for SRL and section 4 discusses the Latent Words Language Model.",

        "As discussed in sections 1 and 3 most SRL systems are trained today on a large set of manually annotated examples.",
        "PropBank for example contains approximately 50000 sentences.",
        "This manual annotation is both time and labour-intensive, and needs to be repeated for new languages or for new domains requiring a different set of roles.",
        "One approach that can help to solve this problem is semi-supervised learning, where a small set of annotated examples is used together with a large set of unlabeled examples when training a SRL model.",
        "Manual inspection of the results of the supervised model discussed in the previous section showed that the main source of errors was incorrect labeling of a word because the word token did not occur, or occurred only a small number of times in the training set.",
        "We hypothesize that knowledge of semantic similar words could overcome this problem by associating words that occurred infrequently in the training set to similar words that occurred more frequently.",
        "Furthermore, we would like to learn these similarities automatically, to be independent of knowledge sources that might not be available for all languages or domains.",
        "The Distributional Hypothesis, supported by theoretical linguists such as Harris (1954), states that words that occur in the same contexts tend to have similar meanings.",
        "This suggests that one can learn the similarity between two words automatically by comparing their relative contexts in a large unlabeled corpus, which was confirmed by different researchers (e.g. (Lin, 1998; McDonald and Ramscar, 2001; Grefenstette, 1994)).",
        "Different methods for computing word similarities have been proposed, differing between methods to represent the context (using dependency relationship or a window of words) and between methods that, given a set of contexts, compute the similarity between different words (ranging from cosine similarity to more complex metrics such as the Jaccard index).",
        "We refer to (Lin, 1998) for a comparison of the different similarity metrics.",
        "In the next section we propose a novel method to learn word similarities, the Latent Words Language Model (LWLM) (Deschacht and Moens, 2009).",
        "This model learns similar words and learns the a distribution over the contexts in which certain types of words occur typically.",
        "The LWLM introduces for a text T = wi...m>n of length N for every observed word Wj at position z a hidden variable ht.",
        "The model is a generative model for natural language, in which the latent variable ht is generated by its context C(hj) and the observed word wt is generated by the latent variable hj.",
        "In the current model we assume that the context is C(hj) = h^h-j where = h^h-x is the two previous words and h|| = hi+\\hi+2 is the two next words.",
        "The observed Wj has a value from the vocabulary V, while the hidden variable hj is unknown, and is modeled as a probability distribution over all words of V. We will see in the next section how this distribution is estimated from a large unlabeled training corpus.",
        "The aim of this model is to estimate, at every position z, a distribution for ht, assigning high probabilities to words that are similar to Wj, given the context of this word C (/?,), and low probabilities to words that are not similar to Wj in this context.",
        "A possible interpretation of this model states that every hidden variable hj models the \"meaning\" for a particular word in a particular context.",
        "In this probabilistic model, when generating a sentence, we generate the meaning of a word (which is an unobserved representation) with a certain probability, and then we generate a certain observation by writing down one of the possible words that express this meaning.",
        "Creating a representation that models the meaning of a word is an interesting (and controversial) topic in its own right, but in this work we make the assumption that the meaning of a particular word can be modeled using other words.",
        "Modeling the meaning of a word with other words is not an unreasonable one, since it is already employed in practice by humans (e.g. by using dictionaries and thesauri) and machines (e.g. relying on a lexical resource such as WordNet) in word sense disambiguation tasks.",
        "As we will further see the LWLM model has three probability distributions: P(wi\\hi), the probability of the observed word Wj given the latent variable hj, Pfijlh'jZl), the probability of the hidden word hj given the previous variables /zy_2 and /zy-i, and P(/z/|hj.|j), the probability of the hidden word hj given the next variables hJ+i and hJ+2.",
        "These distributions need to be learned from a training text Ttrain =<w0...wz> of length Z.",
        "The attentive reader will have noticed the similarity between the proposed model and a standard second-order Hidden Markov Model (HMM) where the hidden state is dependent on the two previous states.",
        "However, we are not able to use the standard Baum-Welch (or forward-backward) algorithm, because the hidden variable ht is modeled as a probability distribution over all words in the vocabulary V. The Baum-Welch algorithm would result in an execution time of 0(\\V\\NG) where \\V\\ is the size of the vocabulary, N is the length of the training text and G is the number of iterations needed to converge.",
        "Since in our dataset the vocabulary size is more than 30K words (see section 3.2), using this algorithm is not possible.",
        "Instead we use techniques of approximate inference, i.e. Gibbs sampling.",
        "Gibbs sampling starts from a random initialization for the hidden variables and then improves the estimates in subsequent iterations.",
        "In preliminary experiments it was found that a pure random initialization results in a very long burn-in-period and a poor performance of the final model.",
        "For this reason we initially set the distributions for the hidden words equal to the distribution of words as given by a standard language model.",
        "We store the initial estimate of the hidden variables in M®rajn =< ho...hz >, where hj generates Wj at every position z. Gibbs sampling is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method that updates the estimates of the hidden variables in a number of iterations.",
        "Mjrajn denotes the estimate of the hidden variables in iteration t. In every iteration a new estimate MfT+/n is generated from the previous estimate MJrajn by selecting a random position j and updating the value of the hidden variable at that position.",
        "The probability distributions PT{wj\\hj), PT(/zy|h^l2) andPT(/zy|h^+) are constructed by collecting the counts from all positions z / j.",
        "The hidden variable hj is dependent on /zy-2, hj-i, hj+i, hj+2 and Wj and we can compute the distribution of possible values for the variable hj as",
        "We set/M/z.l.",
        ": Ih/]) P{h h I) -P(/zy|h^) which can be easily computed given the above distributions.",
        "We select a new value for the hidden variable according to PT(/zy |wy ,hQ_1,hJ+1) and place it at position j in MfT+/n.",
        "The current estimate for all other unobserved words remains the same.",
        "After performing this iteration a large number of times (\\V\\ * 10 in this experiment), the distribution approaches the true maximum likelihood distribution.",
        "Gibbs sampling however samples this distribution, and thus will never reach it exactly.",
        "A number of iterations (\\V\\ * 100) is then performed in which Gibbs sampling oscillates around the correct distribution.",
        "We collect independent samples of this distribution every \\V\\ * 10 iterations, which are then used to construct the final model.",
        "A first evaluation of the quality of the automatically learned latent words is by translation of this model into a sequential language model and by measuring its perplexity on previously unseen texts.",
        "In (Deschacht and Moens, 2009) we perform a number of experiments, comparing different corpora (news texts from Reuters and from Associated Press, and articles from Wikipedia) and n-gram sizes (3-gram and 4-gram).",
        "We also compared the proposed model with two state-of-the-art language models, Interpolated Kneser-Ney smoothing and fullibmpredict (Goodman, 2001), and found that LWLM outperformed both models on all corpora, with a perplexity reduction ranging between 12.40% and 5.87%.",

        "We experimented with different sizes for the training set, ranging from 5% to 100%.",
        "When using a subset of the full training set, we run 10 different experiments with random subsets and average the results.",
        "We see that the LWFeatures method performs better than the other methods across all training sizes.",
        "Furthermore, these improvements are larger for smaller training sets, showing that the approach can be applied successfully in a setting where only a small number of training examples is available.",
        "When comparing the LWFeatures method with the ClusterFeatures method we see that, although the ClusterFeatures method has a similar performance for small training sizes, this performance drops for larger training sizes.",
        "A possible explanation for this result is the use of the clusters employed in the ClusterFeatures method.",
        "By definition the clusters merge many words into one cluster, which might lead to good generalization (more important for small training sizes) but can potentially hurt precision (more important for larger training sizes).",
        "A third observation that can be made from table 1 is that, although both automatic expansion methods (AutomaticExpansionCOS and AutomaticExpansionCOS) outperform the supervised method for the smallest training size, for other sizes of the training set they perform relatively poorly.",
        "An informal inspection showed that for some examples in the training set, little or no correct similar occurrences were found in the unlabeled text.",
        "The algorithm described in section 5 adds the most similar k occurrences to the training set for every annotated example, also for these examples where little or no similar occurrences were found.",
        "Often the automatic alignment fails to generate correct labels for these occurrences and introduces errors in the training set.",
        "In the future we would like to perform experiments that determine dynamically (for instance based on the similarity measure between occurrences) for every annotated example how many training examples to add.",

        "We have presented the Latent Words Language Model and showed how it learns, from unlabeled texts, latent words that capture the meaning of a certain word, depending on the context.",
        "We then experimented with different methods to incorporate the latent words for Semantic Role Labeling, and tested different methods on the PropBank dataset.",
        "Our best performing method showed a significant improvement over the supervised model and over methods previously proposed in the literature.",
        "On the full training set the best method performed 2.33% better than the fully supervised model, which is a 10.91% error reduction.",
        "Using only 5% of the training data the best semi-supervised model still achieved 60.29%, compared to 40.49% by the supervised model, which is an error reduction of 33.27%.",
        "These results demonstrate that the latent words learned by the LWLM help for this complex information extraction task.",
        "Furthermore we have shown that the latent words are simple to incorporate in an existing classifier by adding additional features.",
        "We would like to perform experiments on employing this model in other information extraction tasks, such as Word Sense Disambiguation or Named Entity Recognition.",
        "The current model uses the context in a very straightforward way, i.e. the two words left and right of the current word, but in the future we would like to explore more advanced methods to improve the similarity estimates.",
        "Lin (1998) for example discusses a method where a syntactic parse of the text is performed and the context of a word is modeled using dependency triples.",
        "The other semi-supervised methods proposed here were less successful, although all improved on the supervised model for small training sizes.",
        "In the future we would like to improve the described automatic expansion methods, since we feel that their full potential has not yet been reached.",
        "More specifically we plan to experiment with more advanced methods to decide whether some automatically generated examples should be added to the training set."
