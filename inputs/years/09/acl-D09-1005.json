        "A weighted hypergraph also defines a probability or other weight for each tree, and can be used to represent the hypothesis space considered (for a given input) by a monolingual parser or a tree-based translation system, e.g., tree to string (Quirk et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2006), string to tree (Galley et al., 2006), tree to tree (Eisner, 2003), or string to string with latent tree structures (Chiang, 2007).",

        "For example, we may want to run the Viterbi algorithm to find the most probable derivation tree in the hypergraph, or the k most probable trees.",
        "Semiring-weighted logic programming is a general framework to specify these algorithms (Pereira and Warren, 1983; Shieber et al., 1994; Goodman, 1999; Eisner et al., 2005; Lopez, 2009).",
        "Goodman (1999) describes many useful semirings (e.g., Viterbi, inside, and Viterbi -n-best).",
        "While most of these semirings are used in \"testing\" (i.e., decoding), we are mainly interested in the semirings that are useful for \"training\" (i.e., parameter estimation).",
        "The expectation semiring (Eisner, 2002), originally proposed for finite-state machines, is one such \"training\" semiring, and can be used to compute feature expectations for the E-step of the EM algorithm, or gradients of the likelihood function for gradient descent.",
        "In this paper, we apply the expectation semiring (Eisner, 2002) to a hypergraph (or packed forest) rather than just a lattice.",
        "We then propose a novel second-order expectation semiring, nicknamed the \"variance semiring.\"",
        "The original first-order expectation semiring allows us to efficiently compute a vector of first-order statistics (expectations; first derivatives) on the set of paths in a lattice or the set of trees in a hypergraph.",

        "We use a specific tree-based system called Hiero (Chiang, 2007) as an example, although the discussion is general for any systems that use a hypergraph to represent the hypothesis space.",
        "In Hiero, a synchronous context-free grammar (SCFG) is extracted from automatically word-aligned corpora.",
        "An illustrative grammar rule for Chinese-to-English translation is X (X0 fftXu XlOfX0), where the Chinese word Ô^J means of, and the alignment, encoded via subscripts on the nonterminals, causes the two phrases around Ô^J to be reordered around of in the translation.",
        "Given a source sentence, Hiero uses a CKY parser to generate a hypergraph, encoding many derivation trees along with the translation strings.",
        "Formally, a hypergraph is a pair (V, E), where V is a set of nodes (vertices) and E is a set of hy-peredges, with each hyperedge connecting a set of antecedent nodes to a single consequent node.",
        "In parsing parlance, a node corresponds to an item in the chart (which specifies aligned spans of input and output together with a nonterminal label).",
        "The root node corresponds to the goal item.",
        "A hyperedge represents an SCFG rule that has been \"instantiated\" at a particular position, so that the nonterminals on the right and left sides have been replaced by particular antecedent and consequent items; this corresponds to storage of backpointers in the chart.",

        "Rectangles represent items, where each item is identified by the non-terminal symbol, source span, and left-and right-side language model states.",

        "The hypergraph encodes four different derivation trees that share some of the same items.",
        "By exploiting this sharing, a hypergraph can compactly represent exponentially many trees.",
        "We observe that any finite-state automaton can also be encoded as a hypergraph (in which every hyperedge is an ordinary edge that connects a single antecedent to a consequent).",
        "Thus, the methods of this paper apply directly to the simpler case of hypothesis lattices as well.",
        "We assume a hypergraph HG, which compactly encodes many derivation trees d G D. Given HG, we wish to extract the best derivations – or other aggregate properties of the forest of derivations.",
        "Semiring parsing (Goodman, 1999) is a general framework to describe such algorithms.",
        "To define a particular algorithm, we choose a semiring K and specify a \"weight\" ke e K for each hyperedge e. The desired aggregate result then emerges as the total weight of all derivations in the hypergraph.",
        "For example, to simply count derivations, one can assign every hyperedge weight 1 in the semiring of ordinary integers; then each derivation also has weight 1, and their total weight is the number of derivations.",

        "In general, the total weight is a sum over exponentially many derivations d. But Figure 2 sums over these derivations in time only linear on the size of the hypergraph.",

Moreover, as ß(v) is computed in lines 3-8, that vector is built up (via the <g> and © operations of Table 1) as a linear combination of other dense vectors (the second components of the various ß(u)).",
        "These vector operations can be slow.",
        "A much more efficient approach (usually) is the traditional inside-outside algorithm (Baker, 1979).",
        "Figure 4 generalizes the inside-outside algorithm to work with any expectation semiring Ek,x- We are given a hypergraph HG whose edges have weights (ke,xe) in this semiring (so now ke G K denotes only part of the edge weight, not all of it).",
        "lNSIDE-OUTSIDE(HG, K, X) finds ©(ieD ÇQeed (he, xe), which has the form (k, x).",
        "But, Inside(HG,Ek,x) could accomplish the same thing.",
        "So what makes the inside-outside algorithm more efficient?",
        "It turns out that x can be found quickly as a single linear combination ^e kexe of just the feature vectors xe that appear on individual hyperedges – typically a sum of very sparse vectors !",
        "And the linear coefficients ke, as well as k, are computed entirely within the cheap semiring K. They are based on ß and a values obtained by first running lNSIDE(HG, K) and Outside(HG, K), which use only the ke part of the weights and ignore the more expensive xe.",
        "It is noteworthy that the expectation semiring is not used at all by Figure 4.",
        "Although the return value (k,x) is in the expectation semiring, it is built up not by © and <g> but rather by computing k and x separately.",
        "One might therefore wonder why the expectation semiring and its operations are still needed.",
        "One reason is that the input to Figure 4 consists of hyperedge weights (ke, xe) in the expectation semiring – and these weights may well have been constructed using <g> and ©.",
        "For example, Eisner (2002) uses finite-state operations such as composition, which do combine weights entirely within the expectation semiring before their result is passed to the forward-backward algorithm.",
        "A second reason is that when we work with a second-order expectation semiring in Section 4.4 below, the k, ß, and a values in Figure 4 will turn out to be elements of a first-order expectation semiring, and they must still be constructed by first-order <g> and ©, via calls to Figures 2-3.",
