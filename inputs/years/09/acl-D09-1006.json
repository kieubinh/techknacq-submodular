        "Although performing MERT with a human-based metric seems like a daunting task, we describe a new metric, rypt, which takes human judgments into account, but only requires human input to build a database that can be reused over and over again, hence eliminating the need for human input at tuning time.",

        "Many state-of-the-art machine translation (MT) systems over the past few years (Och and Ney, 2002; Koehn et al., 2003; Chiang, 2007; Koehn et al., 2007; Li et al., 2009) rely on several models to evaluate the \"goodness\" of a given candidate translation in the target language.",
        "The MT system proceeds by searching for the highest-scoring candidate translation, as scored by the different model components, and returns that candidate as the hypothesis translation.",
        "Each of these models need not be a probabilistic model, and instead corresponds to a feature that is a function of a (candidate translation,foreign sentence) pair.",
        "Treated as a log-linear model, we need to assign a weight for each of the features.",
        "Och (2003) shows that setting those weights should take into account the evaluation metric by which the MT system will eventually be judged.",
        "This is achieved by choosing the weights so as to maximize the performance of the MT system on a development set, as measured by that evaluation metric.",
        "The other insight of Och's work is that there exists an efficient algorithm to find such weights.",
        "This process has come to be known as the MERT phase (for Minimum Error Rate Training) in training pipelines of MT systems.",
        "A problem arises if the performance of the system is not judged by an automatic evaluation metric such as bleu or TER, but instead through an evaluation process involving a human.",
        "The GALE evaluation, for instance, judges the quality of systems as measured by human-targeted TER (HTER), which computes the edit distance between the system's output and a version of the output post-edited by a human.",
        "The IWSLT and WMT workshops also have a manual evaluation component, as does the NIST Evaluation, in the form of adequacy and fluency (LDC, 2005).",
        "In theory, one could imagine trying to optimize a metric like HTER during the MERT phase, but that would require the availability of an HTER automatic scorer, which, by definition, does not exist.",
        "If done manually, the scoring of thousands of candidates produced during MERT would literally take weeks, and cost a large sum of money.",
        "For these reasons, researchers resort to optimizing an automatic metric (almost always bleu) as a proxy for human judgment.",
        "As daunting as such a task seems for any human-based metric, we describe a new metric, rypt, that takes human judgment into accout when scoring candidates, but takes advantage of the redundancy in the candidates produced during MERT.",

        "For reliability, we collect 3 judgments per sentence pair comparison, instead of just 1.",
        "The results show that RYPT significantly outperforms bleu when it comes to predicting human preference, with its choice prevailing in 46.1% of judgments vs. 36.0% for bleu, with 17.9% judged to be of equal quality (left half of Table 1).",
        "This advantage is especially true when the judgments are grouped by sentence, and we examine cases of strong agreement among the three annotators (Table 2): whereas Bleu's candidate is strongly preferred in 32 of the candidate pairs (bottom 2 rows), RYPT's candidate is strongly preferred in about double that number: 60 candidate pairs (top 2 rows).",
        "This is quite a remarkable result, given that Bleu, by definition, selects a candidate that has significant overlap with the reference shown to the annotators to aid in their decision-making.",
        "This means that Bleu has an inherent advantage in comparisons where both candidates are more or less of equal quality, since annotators are encouraged (in the instructions) to make a choice even if the two candidates seem of be of equal quality at first glance.",
        "Pressed to make such a choice, the annotator is likely to select the candidate that superficially 'looks' more like the reference to be the 'better' of the two candidates.",
        "That candidate will most likely be the bleu-selected one.",
        "To test this hypothesis, we repeated the experiment without showing the annotators the reference translations, and limited data collection to workers living in Germany, making judgments based only on the source sentences.",
        "(We only collected one judgment per source sentence, since German workers on AMT are in short supply.)",
        "As expected, the difference is even more pronounced: human judges prefer the rypt-selected candidate 45.2% of the time, while Bleu's candidate is preferred only 29.2% of the time, with 25.6% judged to be of equal quality (right half of Table 1).",
        "Our hypothesis is further supported by the fact that most of the gain of the \"equal-quality\" category comes from bleu, which loses 6.8 percentage points, whereas Rypt's share remains largely intact, losing less than a single percentage point.",
        "Recall that we minimize data collection by performing label percolation and by employing a frontier node set selection strategy.",
        "While the results just presented indicate those strategies provide a good approximation of some 'true' rypt score, label percolation was a strategy based primarily on intuition, and choosing maxLen = 4 for frontier set construction was based on examining a limited amount of preliminary data.",
        "Therefore, and in addition to encouraging em-pricial results, we felt a more rigorous quantitative analysis was in order, especially with future, more ambitious annotation projects on the horizon.",
        "To this end, we collected a complete set of judgments for 50 source sentences and their candidates.",
        "That is, we generated a query for each and every node",
        "Table 1: Ranking comparison results.",
        "The left half corresponds to the experiment (open to all workers) where the English reference was shown, whereas the right half corresponds to the experiment (open only to workers living in Germany) where the English reference was not shown.",
        "Table 2: Ranking comparison results, grouped by sentence.",
        "This table corresponds to the left half of Table 1.",
        "3 judgments were collected for each comparison, with the \"aggregate\" for a comparison calculated from these 3 judgments.",
        "For instance, an aggregate of \"RYPT +3\" means all 3 judgments favored RYPT's choice, and \"RYPT +1\" means one more judgment favored RYPT than did BLEU.",
        "in the source parse tree, instead of limiting ourselves to a frontier node set.",
        "(Though we did limit the length of a source segment to be < 7 words.)",
        "This would allow us to judge the validity of label percolation, and under different maxLen values.",
        "Furthermore, we collected multiple judgments for each query in order to minimize the effet of bad/random annotations.",
        "For each of 5580 generated queries, we collected five judgments, for a total of 27,900 judgments.",
        "As before, the annotator would pick one of YES, NO, and NOT SURE.",
        "First, collecting multiple judgments allowed us to investigate inter-annotator agreement.",
        "In 68.9% of the queries, at least 4 of the 5 annotators chose the same label, signifying a high degree of inter-annotator agreement.",
        "This is especially encouraging considering that we identified about 15% of the HITs as being of poor quality, and blocked the respective annotators from doing further HITs.",
        "We then examine the applicability and validity",
        "For a given query, the five collected judgments are from five different annotators, since AMT ensures an annotator is never shown the same HIT twice.",
        "of label percolation.",
        "For each of 7 different values for Algorithm l's maxLen, we ignore all but labels that would be requested under that maxLen value, and percolate the labels up and down the tree.",
        "In Figure 3 we plot the coverage before and after percolation (middle two curves), and observe expansion in coverage across different values of maxLen, peaking at about +33% for maxLen= 4 and 5, with most of the benefit coming from YES percolation (bottom two curves).",
