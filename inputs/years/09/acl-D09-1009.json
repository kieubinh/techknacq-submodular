        "For example, both Haghighi and Klein (2006) and Mann and McCallum (2008) have demonstrated results better than 66.1% on the apartments task described above using only a list of 33 highly discriminative features and the labels they indicate.",
        "However, these methods have only been applied in scenarios in which the user supplies such prior knowledge before learning begins.",

        "The option to skip is important when using feature queries because a user may not know how to label some features.",
        "In each iteration the model is retrained using the train procedure, which takes as input a set of labeled features C and unlabeled data distribution p. For the reasons described in Section 3.3, we advocate using GE for the train procedure.",

        "Features similar to those already labeled are likely to be discriminative, and therefore likely to be labeled (rather than skipped).",

        "It is also not clear how this graph-based training method would generalize to structured output spaces.",
        "Throughout this paper, we have focussed on labeling input features.",

        "The features within each group are sorted according to the active learning metric.",

        "We conduct three types of experiments.",
        "First, a user labels instances selected by information density, and models are trained using ER.",
        "The instance labeling interface allows the user to label tokens quickly by extending the current selection one token at a time and only requiring a single keystroke to label an entire segment.",
        "Second, the user labels features presented one-at-a-time by weighted uncertainty, and models are trained using GE.",
        "To aid the user in understanding the function of the feature quickly, we provide several examples of the feature occurring in context and the model's current predicted label distribution for the feature.",
        "Finally, the user labels features organized using the grid interface described in the previous paragraph.",
        "Weighted uncertainty is used to sort feature queries within each group, and GE is used to train models.",
        "Each iteration of labeling lasts two minutes, and there are five iterations.",
        "Retraining with ER between iterations takes an average of 5 minutes on cora and 3 minutes on apartments.",
        "With GE, the retraining times are on average 6 minutes on cora and 4 minutes on apartments.",
        "Consequently, even when viewed with total time, rather than annotation time, feature active learning is beneficial.",
