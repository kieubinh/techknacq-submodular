        "Because of the importance of protein-protein interaction (PPI) extraction from text, many corpora have been proposed with slightly differing definitions of proteins and PPI.",
        "Since no single corpus is large enough to saturate a machine learning system, it is necessary to learn from multiple different corpora.",
        "In this paper, we propose a solution to this challenge.",
        "We designed a rich feature vector, and we applied a support vector machine modified for corpus weighting (SVM-CW) to complete the task of multiple corpora PPI extraction.",
        "The rich feature vector, made from multiple useful kernels, is used to express the important information for PPI extraction, and the system with our feature vector was shown to be both faster and more accurate than the original kernel-based system, even when using just a single corpus.",
        "SVM-CW learns from one corpus, while using other corpora for support.",
        "SVM-CW is simple, but it is more effective than other methods that have been successfully applied to other NLP tasks earlier.",
        "With the feature vector and SVM-CW, our system achieved the best performance among all state-of-the-art PPI extraction systems reported so far."

        "The performance of an information extraction program is highly dependent on various factors, including text types (abstracts, complete articles, reports, etc.",
        "), exact definitions of the information to be extracted, shared subtopics of the text collections from which information is to be extracted.",
        "Even if two corpora are annotated in terms of the same type of information by two groups, the performance of a program trained by one corpus is unlikely to be reproduced in the other corpus.",
        "On the other hand, from a practical point of view, it is worth while to effectively use multiple existing annotated corpora together, because it is very costly to make new annotations.",
        "One problem with several different corpora is protein-protein interaction (PPI) extraction from text.",
        "While PPIs play a critical role in understanding the working of cells in diverse biological contexts, the manual construction of PPI databases such as BIND, DIP, HPRD, IntAct, and MINT (Mathivanan et al., 2006) is known to be very time-consuming and labor-intensive.",
        "The automatic extraction of PPI from published papers has therefore been a major research topic in Natural Language Processing for Biology (BioNLP).",
        "Among several PPI extraction task settings, the most common is sentence-based, pairwise PPI extraction.",
        "At least four annotated corpora have been provided for this setting: AIMed (Bunescu et al., 2005), HPRD50 (Fundel et al., 2006), IEPA (Ding et al., 2002), and LLL (Nédellec, 2005).",
        "Each of these corpora have been used as the standard corpus for training and testing PPI programs.",
        "Moreover, several corpora are annotated for more types of events than just for PPI.",
        "Such examples include Biolnfer (Pyysalo et al., 2007), and GENIA (Kim et al., 2008a), and they can be reorganized into PPI corpora.",
        "Even though all of these corpora were made for PPI extraction, they were constructed based on different definitions of proteins and PPI, which reflect different biological research interests (Pyysalo et al., 2008).",
        "Research on PPI extraction so far has revealed that the performance on each of the corpora could",

        "benefit from additional examples (Airola et al., 2008).",
        "Learning from multiple annotated corpora could lead to better PPI extraction performance.",
        "Various research paradigms such as inductive transfer learning (ITL) and domain adaptation (DA) have mainly focused on how to effectively use corpora annotated by other groups, by reducing the incompatibilities (Pan and Yang, 2008).",
        "In this paper, we propose the extraction of PPIs from multiple different corpora.",
        "We design a rich feature vector, and as an ITL method, we apply a support vector machine (SVM) modiied for corpus weighting (SVM-CW) (Schweikert et al., 2008), in order to evaluate the use of multiple corpora for the PPI extraction task.",
        "Our rich feature vector is made from multiple useful kernels, each of which is based on multiple parser inputs, proposed by Miwa et al.",
        "(2008).",
        "The system with our feature vector was better than or at least comparable to the state-of-the-art PPI extraction systems on every corpus.",
        "The system is a good starting point to use the multiple corpora.",
        "Using one of the corpora as the target corpus, SVM-CW weights the remaining corpora (we call them the source corpora) with \"goodness\" for training on the target corpus.",
        "While SVM-CW is simple, we show that SVM-CW can improve the performance of the system more effectively and more eficiently than other methods proven to be successful in other NLP tasks earlier.",
        "As a result, SVM-CW with our feature vector is comprised of a PPI system with ive different models, of which each model is superior to the best model in the original PPI extraction task, which used only the single corpus."
