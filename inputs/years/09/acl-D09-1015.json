        "Named entity recognition is the task of finding entities, such as people and organizations, in text.",
        "Frequently, entities are nested within each other, such as Bank of China and University of Washington, both organizations with nested locations.",
        "Nested entities are also common in biomedical data, where different biological entities of interest are often composed of one another.",
        "In the GENIA corpus (Ohta et al., 2002), which is labeled with entity types such as protein and DNA, roughly 17% of entities are embedded within another entity.",
        "In the AnCora corpus of Spanish and Catalan newspaper text (Marti et al., 2007), nearly half of the entities are embedded.",
        "However, work on named entity recognition (NER) has almost entirely ignored nested entities and instead chosen to focus on the outermost entities.",
        "We believe this has largely been for practical, not ideological, reasons.",
        "Most corpus designers have chosen to skirt the issue entirely, and have annotated only the topmost entities.",
        "The widely used CoNLL (Sang and Meulder, 2003), MUC-6, and MUC-7 NER corpora, composed of American and British newswire, are all flatly annotated.",
        "The GENIA corpus contains nested entities, but the JNLPBA 2004 shared task (Collier et al., 2004), which utilized the corpus, removed all embedded entities for the evaluation.",
        "To our knowledge, the only shared task which has included nested entities is the SemEval 2007 Task 9 (Marquez et al., 2007b), which used a subset of the AnCora corpus.",
        "However, in that task all entities corresponded to particular parts of speech or noun phrases in the provided syntactic structure, and no participant directly addressed the nested nature of the data.",
        "Another reason for the lack of focus on nested NER is technological.",
        "The NER task arose in the context of the MUC workshops, as small chunks which could be identified by finite state models or gazetteers.",
        "This then led to the widespread use of sequence models, first hidden Markov models, then conditional Markov models (Borthwick, 1999), and, more recently, linear chain conditional random fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001).",
        "All of these models suffer from an inability to model nested entities.",
        "In this paper we present a novel solution to the problem of nested named entity recognition.",
        "Our model explicitly represents the nested structure, allowing entities to be influenced not just by the labels of the words surrounding them, as in a CRF, but also by the entities contained in them, and in which they are contained.",
        "We represent each sentence as a parse tree, with the words as leaves, and with phrases corresponding to each entity (and a node which joins the entire sentence).",
        "Our trees look just like syntactic constituency trees, such as those in the Perm TreeBank (Marcus et al., 1993),",

        "Early work on the GENIA corpus (Kazama et al., 2002; Tsuruoka and Tsujii, 2003) only worked on the innermost entities.",
        "This was soon followed by several attempts at nested al., 2004; Zhou et al., 2004) which built hidden Markov models over the innermost named entities, and then used a rule-based post-processing step to identify the named entities containing the innermost entities.",
        "Zhou (2006) used a more elaborate model for the innermost entities, but then used the same rule-based post-processing method on the output to identify non-innermost entities.",
        "Gu (2006) focused only on proteins and DNA, by building separate binary SVM classifiers for innermost and outermost entities for those two classes.",
        "Several techniques for nested NER in GENIA where presented in (Alex et al., 2007).",
        "Their first approach was to layer CRFs, using the output of one as the input to the next.",
        "For inside-out layering, the first CRF would identify the innermost entities, the next layer would be over the words and the innermost entities to identify second-level entities, etc.",
        "For outside-in layering the first CRF would identify outermost entities, and then successive CRFs would identify increasingly nested entities.",
        "They also tried a cascaded approach, with separate CRFs for each entity type.",
        "The CRFs would be applied in a specified order, and then each CRF could utilize features derived from the output of previously applied CRFs.",
        "This technique has the problem that it cannot identify nested entities of the same type; this happens frequently in the data, such as the nested proteins at the beginning of the sentence in Figure 1.",
        "They also tried a joint labeling approach, where they trained a single CRF, but the label set was significantly expanded so that a single label would include all of the entities for a particular word.",
        "Their best results where from the cascaded approach.",
        "Byrne (2007) took a different approach, on historical archive text.",
        "She modified the data by concatenating adjacent tokens (up to length six) into potential entities, and then labeled each concatenated string using the C&C tagger (Curran and Clark, 1999).",
        "When labeling a string, the \"previous\" string was the one-token-shorter string containing all but the last token of the current string.",
        "For single tokens the \"previous\" token was the longest concatenation starting one token earlier.",
        "SemEval 2007 Task 9 (Marquez et al., 2007b) included a nested NER component, as well as noun sense disambiguation and semantic role labeling.",
        "However, the parts of speech and syntactic tree were given as part of the input, and named entities were specified as corresponding to noun phrases in the tree, or particular parts of speech.",
        "This restriction substantially changes the task.",

        "Our model also produces part of speech tags, but the test data is not annotated with POS tags, so we cannot show POS tagging results on this dataset.",
        "One difficulty we had with the JNLPBA experiments was with tokenization.",
        "The version of GE-NIA distributed for the shared task is tokenized differently from the original GENIA corpus, but we needed to train on the original corpus as it is the only version with nested entities.",
        "We tried our best to retokenize the original corpus to match the distributed data, but did not have complete success.",
        "It is worth noting that the data is actually tokenized in a manner which allows a small amount of \"cheating.\"",
        "Normally, hyphenated words, such as LPS-induced, are tokenized as one word.",
        "However, if the portion of the word before the hyphen is in an entity, and the part after is not, such as BCR-induced, then the word is split into two tokens: BCR and -induced.",
        "Therefore, when a word starts with a hyphen it is a strong indicator that the prior word and it span the right boundary of an entity.",
        "Because the train and test data for the shared task do not contain nested entities, fewer words are split in this manner than in the original data.",
        "We did not intentionally exploit this fact in our feature design, but it is probable that some of our orthographic features \"learned\" this fact anyway.",
        "This probably harmed our results overall, because some hyphenated words, which straddled boundaries in nested entities and would have been split in the original corpus (and were split in our training data), were not split in the test data, prohibiting our model from properly identifying them.",
        "For this experiment, we retrained our model on the entire, retokenized, GENIA corpus.",
