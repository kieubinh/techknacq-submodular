        "(2003), Bunescu and Mooney (2004)) to extract role fillers for events.",
        "Most IE systems consider only the immediate context surrounding a phrase when deciding whether to extract it.",
        "For tasks such as named entity recognition, immediate context is usually sufficient.",
        "But for more complex tasks, such as event extraction, a larger field of view is often needed to understand how facts tie together.",
        "Most IE systems are designed to identify role fillers that appear as arguments to event verbs or nouns, either explicitly via syntactic relations or implicitly via proximity (e.g., John murdered Tom or the murder of Tom by John).",
        "But many facts are presented in clauses that do not contain event words, requiring discourse relations or deep structural analysis to associate the facts with event roles.",
        "For example, consider the sentences below:",
        "Seven people have died ... and 30 were injured in India after terrorists launched an attack on the Taj Hotel.",
        "...in Mexico City and its surrounding suburbs in a Swine Flu outbreak.",
        "... after a tractor-trailer collided with a bus in Arkansas.",
        "Two bridges were destroyed ...in Baghdad last night in a resurgence of bomb attacks in the capital city.",
        "... and $50 million in damage was caused by a hurricane that hit Miami on Friday.",
        "...to make way for modern, safer bridges that will be constructed early next year.",
        "These examples illustrate a common phenomenon in text where information is not explicitly stated as filling an event role, but readers have no trouble making this inference.",
        "The role fillers above {seven people, two bridges) occur as arguments to verbs that reveal state information (death, destruction) but are not event-specific (i.e., death and destruction can result from a wide variety of incident types).",
        "IE systems often fail to extract these role fillers because these systems do not recognize the immediate context as being relevant to the specific type of event that they are looking for.",
        "We propose a new model for information extraction that incorporates both phrasal and sentential evidence in a unified framework.",

        "Many event extraction systems rely heavily on the local context around words or phrases that are candidates for extraction.",
        "Some systems use extraction patterns (Soderland et al., 1995; Riloff, 1996; Yangarber et al., 2000; Califf and Mooney, 2003), which represent the immediate contexts surrounding candidate extractions.",
        "Similarly, classifier-based approaches (Freitag, 1998; Freitag and Mc-Callum, 2000; Chieu et al., 2003; Bunescu and Mooney, 2004) rely on features in the immediate context of the candidate extractions.",
        "Our work seeks to incorporate additional context into IE.",
        "Indeed, several recent approaches have shown the need for global information to improve IE performance.",
        "Maslennikov and Chua (2007) use discourse trees and local syntactic dependencies in a pattern-based framework to incorporate wider context.",
        "Finkel et al.",
        "(2005) and Ji and Grish-man (2008) incorporate global information by enforcing event role or label consistency over a document or across related documents.",
        "In contrast, our approach simply creates a richer IE model for individual extractions by expanding the \"field of view\" to include the surrounding sentence.",
        "The two components of the unified model presented in this paper are somewhat similar to our previous work (Patwardhan and Riloff, 2007), where we employ a relevant region identification phase prior to pattern-based extraction.",
        "In that work we adopted a pipeline paradigm, where a classifier identifies relevant sentences and only those sentences are fed to the extraction module.",
        "Our unified probabilistic model described in this paper does not draw a hard line between relevant and irrelevant sentences, but gently balances the influence of both local and sentential contexts through probability estimates.",
        "3 A Unified IE Model that Combines Phrasal and Sentential Evidence",
        "We introduce a probabilistic model for event-based IE that balances the influence of two kinds of contextual information.",
        "Our goal is to create a model that has the flexibility to make extraction decisions based upon strong evidence from the local context, or strong evidence from the wider context coupled with a more general local context.",
        "For example, some phrases explicitly refer to an event, so they almost certainly warrant extraction regardless of the wider context (e.g., terrorists launched an attack).",
        "In contrast, some phrases are potentially relevant but too general to warrant extraction on their own (e.g., people died could be the result of different incident types).",
        "If we are confident that the sentence discusses an event of interest, however, then such phrases could be reliably extracted.",
        "Our unified model for IE (glacier) combines two types of contextual information by incorporating it into a probabilistic framework.",
        "To determine whether a noun phrase instance NPi should be extracted as a filler for an event role, Glacier computes the joint probability that NPc (1) appears in an event sentence, and (2) is a legitimate filler for the event role.",
        "Thus, glacier is designed for noun phrase extraction and, mathematically, its decisions are based on the following joint probability:",
        "P(EvSent(SNPt), PlausFillr(NPl)) where SVp, is the sentence containing noun phrase NPi.",
        "This probability estimate is based on contextual features F appearing within SVp, and in the local context of NPi.",
        "Including F in the joint probability, and applying the product rule, we can split our probability into two components:",
        "P(EvSent(SNPt), PlausFillr(NPi)\\F) = P(EvSent(SNPt)\\F) * P(PlausFHlr(NPi)\\EvSent(SNPi),F)",
        "These two probability components, in the expression above, form the basis of the two modules in our IE system - the sentential event recognizer and the plausible role-filler recognizer.",
        "In arriving at a decision to extract a noun phrase, our unified model for IE uses these modules to estimate the two probabilities based on the set of contextual features F. Note that having these two probability components allows the system to gently balance the influence from the sentential and phrasal contexts, without having to make hard decisions about sentence relevance or phrases in isolation.",
        "In this system, the sentential event recognizer is embodied in the probability component P{EvSent{SNPl)\\F).",
        "This is essentially the probability of a sentence describing a relevant event.",
        "Similarly, the plausible role-filler recognizer is embodied by the probability P(PlausFillr(NPi)\\EvSent(SNpt),F).",
        "This component, therefore, estimates the probability that a noun phrase fills a specific event role, assuming that the noun phrase occurs in an event sentence.",
        "Many different techniques could be used to produce these probability estimates.",
        "In the rest of this section, we present the specific models that we used for each of these components.",
        "The plausible role-filler recognizer is similar to most traditional IE systems, where the goal is to determine whether a noun phrase can be a legitimate filler for a specific type of event role based on its local context.",
        "Pattern-based approaches match the context surrounding a phrase using lexico-syntactic patterns or rules.",
        "However, most of these approaches do not produce probability estimates for the extractions.",
        "Classifier-based approaches use machine learning classifiers to make extraction decisions, based on features associated with the local context.",
        "Any classifier that can generate probability estimates, or similar confidence values, could be plugged into our model.",
        "In our work, we use a NaÃ¯ve Bayes classifier as our plausible role-filler recognizer.",
        "The probabilities are computed using a generative NaÃ¯ve Bayes framework, based on local contextual features surrounding a noun phrase.",
        "These clues include lexical matches, semantic features, and syntactic relations, and will be described in more detail in Section 3.3.",
        "The NaÃ¯ve Bayes (NB) plausible role-filler recognizer is defined as follows:",
        "P(PlausFillr(NPi)\\EvSent(SNPi), F) = -P(PlausFillr(NPt)\\EvSent(SNPt)) *",
        "Yl P(fi\\PlausFillr(NPi), EvSent(SNPt))",
        "where F is the set of local contextual features and Z is the normalizing constant.",
        "The prior P(PlausFillr(NPi)\\EvSent(SNPi)) is estimated from the fraction of role fillers in the training data.",
        "The product term in the equation is the likelihood, which makes the simplifying assumption that all of the features in F are independent of one another.",
        "It is important to note that these probabilities are conditioned on the noun phrase NPi appearing in an event sentence.",
        "Most IE systems need to extract several different types of role fillers for each event.",
        "For instance, to extract information about terrorist incidents a system may extract the names of perpetrators, victims, targets, and weapons.",
        "We create a separate IE model for each type of event role.",
        "To construct a unified IE model for an event role, we must specifically create a plausible role-filler recognizer for that event role, but we can use a single sentential event recognizer for all of the role filler types.",
        "The task at hand for the sentential event recognizer is to analyze features in a sentence and estimate the probability that the sentence is discussing a relevant event.",
        "This is very similar to the task performed by text classification systems, with some minor differences.",
        "Firstly, we are dealing with the classification of sentences, as opposed to entire documents.",
        "Secondly, we need to generate a probability estimate of the \"class\", and not just a class label.",
        "Like the plausible role-filler recognizer, here too we employ machine learning classifiers to estimate the desired probabilities.",
        "Since Naive Bayes classifiers estimate class probabilities, we employ such a classifier to create a sentential event recognizer:",
        "^P(EvSent(SNPi)) where Z is the normalizing constant and F is the set of contextual features in the sentence.",
        "Lhe prior P(EvSents(NP,)) is obtained from the ratio of event and non-event sentences in the training data.",
        "The product term in the equation is the likelihood, which makes the simplifying assumption that the features in F are independent of one another.",
        "The features used by the model will be described in Section 3.3.",
        "A known issue with NaÃ¯ve Bayes classifiers is that, even though their classification accuracy is often quite reasonable, their probability estimates are often poor (Domingos and Pazzani, 1996; Zadrozny and Elkan, 2001; Manning et al., 2008).",
        "The problem is that these classifiers tend to overestimate the probability of the predicted class, resulting in a situation where most probability estimates from the classifier tend to be either extremely close to 0.0 or extremely close to 1.0.",
        "We observed this problem in our classifier too, so we decided to explore an additional model to estimate probabilities for the sentential event recognizer.",
        "This second model, based on SVMs, is described next.",
        "Given the all-or-nothing nature of the probability estimates that we observed from the Naive Bayes model, we decided to try using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Vapnik, 1995; Joachims, 1998) classifier as an alternative to Naive Bayes.",
        "One of the issues with doing this is that SVMs are not probabilistic classifiers.",
        "SVMs make classification decisions using on a decision boundary defined by support vectors identified during training.",
        "A decision function is applied to unseen test examples to determine which side of the decision boundary those examples lie.",
        "While the values obtained from the decision function only indicate class assignments for the examples, we used these values to produce confidence scores for our sentential event recognizer.",
        "To produce a confidence score from the SVM classifier, we take the values generated by the decision function for each test instance and normalize them based on the minimum and maximum values produced across all of the test instances.",
        "This normalization process produces values between 0 and 1 that we use as a rough indicator of the confidence in the SVM's classification.",
        "We observed that we could effect a consistent recall/precision trade-off by using these values as thresholds for classification decisions, which suggests that this approach worked reasonably well for our task.",
        "We used a variety of contextual features in both components of our system.",
        "The plausible role-filler recognizer uses the following types of features for each candidate noun phrase NPi : lexical head of NPi, semantic class of NPi's lexical head, named entity tags associated with NPi and lexico-syntactic patterns that represent the local context surrounding NPi.",
        "The feature set is automatically generated from the texts.",
        "Each feature is assigned a binary value for each instance, indicating either the presence or absence of the feature.",
        "The named-entity features are generated by the freely available Stanford NER tagger (Finkel et al., 2005).",
        "We use the pre-trained NER model that comes with the software to identify person, organization and location names.",
        "The syntactic and semantic features are generated by the Sundance/AutoSlog system (Riloff and Phillips, 2004).",
        "We use the Sundance shallow parser to identify lexical heads, and use its semantic dictionaries to assign semantic features to words.",
        "The AutoSlog pattern generator (Riloff, 1996) is used to create the lexico-syntactic pattern features that capture local context around each noun phrase.",
        "Our training sets produce a very large number of features, which initially bogged down our classifiers.",
        "Consequently, we reduced the size of the feature set by discarding all features that appeared four times or less in the training set.",
        "Our sentential event recognizer uses the same contextual features as the plausible role-filler recognizer, except that features are generated for every NP in the sentence.",
        "In addition, it uses three types of sentence-level features: sentence length, bag of words, and verb tense, which are also binary features.",
        "We have two binary sentence length features indicating that the sentence is long (greater than 35 words) or is short (shorter than 5 words).",
        "Additionally, all of the words in each sentence in the training data are generated as bag of words features for the sentential model.",
        "Finally, we generate verb tense features from all verbs appearing in each sentence.",
        "Here too we apply a frequency cutoff and eliminate all features that appear four times or less in the training data."

        "We evaluated the performance of our IE system on two data sets: the MUC-4 terrorism corpus (Sundheim, 1992), and a ProMed disease outbreaks corpus (Phillips and Riloff, 2007; Patwardhan and Riloff, 2007).",
        "The MUC-4 data set is a standard IE benchmark collection of news stories about terrorist events.",
        "It contains 1700 documents divided into 1300 development (DEV) texts, and four test sets of 100 texts each (TST1, TST2, TST3, and TST4).",
        "Unless otherwise stated, our experiments adopted the same training/test split used in previous research: the 1300 DEV texts for training, 200 texts (TST1+TST2) for tuning, and 200 texts (TST3+TST4) as the blind test set.",
        "We evaluated our system on five MUC-4 string roles: perpetrator individuals, perpetrator organizations, physical targets, victims, and weapons.",
        "The ProMed corpus consists of 120 documents obtained from ProMed-mail, a freely accessible global electronic reporting system for outbreaks of diseases.",
        "These 120 documents are paired with corresponding answer key templates.",
        "Unless otherwise noted, all of our experiments on this data set used 5-fold cross validation.",
        "We extracted two types of event roles: diseases and victims.",
        "Unlike some other IE data sets, many of the texts in these collections do not describe a relevant event.",
        "Only about half of the MUC-4 articles describe a specific terrorist incident, and only about 80% of the ProMed articles describe a disease outbreak.",
        "The answer keys for the irrelevant documents are therefore empty.",
        "IE systems are especially susceptible to false hits when they can be given texts that contain no relevant events.",
        "The complete IE task involves the creation of answer key templates, one template per incident (many documents in our data sets describe multiple events).",
        "Our work focuses on accurately extracting the facts from the text and not on template generation per se (e.g., we are not concerned with coreference resolution or which extraction belongs in which template).",
        "Consequently, our experiments evaluate the accuracy of the extractions individually.",
        "We used head noun scoring, where an extraction is considered to be correct if its head noun matches the head noun in the answer key.",
        "We generated three baselines to use as comparisons with our IE system.",
        "As our first baseline, we used AutoSlog-TS (Riloff, 1996), which is a weakly-supervised, pattern-based IE system available as part of the Sundance/AutoSlog software package (Riloff and Phillips, 2004).",
        "Our previous work in event-based IE (Patwardhan and Riloff, 2007) also used a pattern-based approach that applied semantic affinity patterns to relevant regions in text.",
        "We use this system as our second baseline.",
        "As a third baseline, we trained a NaÃ¯ve Bayes IE classifier that is analogous to the plausible role-filler recognizer in our unified IE model, except that this baseline system is not conditioned on the assumption of having an event sentence.",
        "Consequently, this baseline NB classifier is akin to a traditional supervised learning-based IE system that uses only local contextual features to make extraction decisions.",
        "Formally, the baseline NB classifier uses the formula:",
        "P(PlausFillr(NPi)\\F) = ^P(PlausFÃ¼lr(NPi)) * Il P(fi\\PlausFillr(NPi)) where F is the set of local features, P{PlausFillr{NPi)) is the prior probability, and Z is the normalizing constant.",

        "To train the baseline NB system, we identify all instances of each answer key string in the source document and consider every instance a positive training example.",

        "The sentential event recognizer is one of the core contributions of this research, so in this section we evaluate it by itself, before we employ it within the unified framework.",
        "The purpose of the sentential event recognizer is to determine whether a sentence is discussing a domain-relevant event.",
        "For our data sets, the classifier must decide whether a sentence is discussing a terrorist incident (MUC-4) or a disease outbreak (ProMed).",
        "Ideally, we want such a classifier to operate independently from the answer keys and the extraction task per se.",
        "For example, a terrorism IE system could be designed to extract only perpetrators and victims of terrorist events, or it could be designed to extract only targets and locations.",
        "The job of the sentential event recognizer remains the same: to identify sentences that discuss a terrorist event.",
        "How to train and evaluate such a system is a difficult question.",

        "We have argued that the event relevance of a sentence should not be tied to a specific set of event roles.",
        "However, the IE answer keys can be used to identify some sentences that describe an event, because they contain an answer string.",
        "So we can map the answer strings back to sentences in the source documents to automatically generate event sentence annotations.",
        "These annotations will be noisy, though, because an answer string can appear in a non-event sentence, and some event sentences may not contain any answer strings.",
        "The alternative, however, is sentence annotations by humans, which (as we will discuss in Section 4.3.2) is challenging.",

        "Observe that in each of these examples, Glacier correctly extracts the underlined phrases, in spite of the inconclusive evidence in the local contexts around them.",
        "In the last sentence in Figure 2, for example, Glacier correctly makes the inference that the policemen in the bus (which was traveling on the bridge) are likely the victims of the terrorist event.",
        "Thus, we see that our system manages to balance the influence of the two probability components to make extraction decisions that would be impossible to make by relying only on the local phrasal context.",
        "In addition, the sentential event recognizer can also help improve precision by preventing extractions from non-event sentences.",
        "5 Conclusions",
        "We presented a unified model for IE that balances the influence of sentential context with local contextual evidence to improve the performance of event-based IE.",
        "Our experimental results showed that using sentential contexts indeed produced better results on two IE data sets.",
        "Our current model uses supervised learning, so one direction for future work is to adapt the model for weakly supervised learning.",
        "We also plan to incorporate discourse features and investigate even wider contexts to capture broader discourse effects."
