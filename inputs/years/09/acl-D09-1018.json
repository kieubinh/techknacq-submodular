        "Motivated by the need to enable discourse-based opinion analysis, previous research (Asher et al., 2008; Somasundaran et al., 2008) developed discourse schemes and created manually annotated corpora.",
        "However, it was not known whether and how well these linguistic ideas and schemes can be translated into effective computational implementations.",
        "In this paper, we first investigate ways in which an opinion discourse scheme can be computationally modeled, and then how it can be utilized to improve polarity classification.",
        "Specifically, the discourse scheme we use is from Somasundaran et al.",
        "(2008), which was developed to support a global, interdependent polarity interpretation.",
        "To achieve discourse-based global inference, we explore two different frameworks.",
        "The first is a supervised framework that learns interdependent opinion interpretations from training data.",
        "The second is an unsupervised optimization framework which uses constraints to express the ideas of coherent opinion interpretation embodied in the scheme.",
        "For the supervised framework, we use Iterative Collective Classification (ICA), which facilitates machine learning using relational information.",
        "The unsupervised optimization is implemented as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem.",
        "Via our implementations, we aim to empirically test if discourse-based approaches to opinion analysis are useful.",
        "Our results show that both of our implementations achieve significantly better accuracies in polarity classification than classifiers using local information alone.",
        "This confirms the hypothesis that the discourse-based scheme is useful, and also shows that both of our design choices are effective.",
        "We also find that there is a difference in the way ICA and ILP achieve improvements, and a simple hybrid approach, which incorporates the strengths of both, is able to achieve significant overall improvements over both.",
        "Our analyses show that even when our discourse-based methods bootstrap from noisy classifications, they can achieve good improvements.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows: we discuss related work in Section 2 and the discourse scheme in Section 3.",
        "We present our discourse-based implementations in Section 4, experiments in Section 5, discussions in Section 6 and conclusions in Section 7."

        "Interestingly, over all instances (the All condition), HYB also performs significantly better than both ICA (p < 0.001) and ILP (p < 0.01).",

        "This results in an improvement in f-measure for the polar categories (24 points for positive and 16 points for negative).",

        "The improvement of ILP for the All condition, for the polar classes, follows a similar trend for recall (18 to 21 point improvement) and f-measure (9 to 13 point improvement).",
        "In addition to this, the ILP has an overall improvement in precision over Local.",
        "This may seem counterintuitive, as in Table 5, ILP's precision for connected nodes is similar to, or lower than, that of Local.",
        "This is explained by the fact that, while going from connected to overall conditions, Local's polar predictions increase by threefold (565 to 1482), but its correct polar predictions increase by only twofold (430 to 801).",
        "Thus, the ratio of change in the total polar predictions to the correct polar predictions is 3 : 2.",

        "Here, the ratio of change in the total polar predictions to the correct polar predictions is 4 : 3, a smaller ratio.",
        "The contingency table (Table 6) shows how Local and ILP compare against the gold standard annotations.",
        "Notice here, that even though ILP makes more polar guesses as compared to Local, a greater proportion of the ILP guesses are correct.",
