        "The automatic extraction of opinions, emotions, and sentiments in text {subjectivity analysis) to support applications such as product review mining, summarization, question answering, and information extraction is an active area of research in NLP.",
        "Many approaches to opinion, sentiment, and subjectivity analysis rely on lexicons of words that may be used to express subjectivity.",
        "Examples of such words are the following (in bold):",
        "(1) He is a disease to every team he has gone to.",
        "Converting to SMF is a headache.",

        "To tackle this source of error, we define a new task, subjectivity word sense disambiguation (SWSD), which is to automatically determine which word instances in a corpus are being used with subjective senses, and which are being used with objective senses.",
        "We hypothesize that SWSD is more feasible than full word sense disambiguation, because it is more coarse grained - often, the exact sense need not be pinpointed.",

        "The system relies on common machine learning features for word sense disambiguation (WSD).",
        "The performance is substantially above both baseline and the performance of full WSD on the same data, suggesting that the task is feasible, and that subjectivity provides a natural coarsegrained grouping of senses.",
        "The second part demonstrates the promise of SWSD for contextual subjectivity analysis.",
        "First, we show that subjectivity sense ambiguity is highly prevalent in the MPQA opinion-annotated corpus (Wiebe et al., 2005; Wilson, 2008), thus establishing the potential benefit of performing SWSD.",

        "Subjective expressions are words and phrases being used to express mental and emotional states, such as speculations, evaluations, sentiments, and beliefs.",
        "A general covering term for such states is private state (Quirk et al., 1985), an internal state that cannot be directly observed or verified by others.",
        "(Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006) give the following examples:",
        "(3) His alarm grew.",
        "He absorbed the information quickly.",
        "UCC/Disciples leaders roundly condemned the Iranian President's verbal assault on Israel.",
        "What's the catch?",
        "Polarity (also called semantic orientation) is also important to NLP applications.",
        "In review mining, for example, we want to know whether an opinion about a product is positive or negative.",
        "Nonetheless, as argued by (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006; Su and Markert, 2008), there are also motivations for a separate subjective/objective (S/O) classification.",
        "First, expressions may be subjective but not have any particular polarity.",
        "An example given by (Wilson et al., 2005a) is Jerome says the hospital feels no different than a hospital in the states.",
        "An NLP application system may want to find a wide range of private states attributed to a person, such as their motivations, thoughts, and speculations, in addition to their positive and negative sentiments.",
        "Second, benefits for sentiment analysis can be realized by decomposing the problem into S/O (or neutral versus polar) and polarity classification (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Pang and Lee, 2004; Wilson et al., 2005a; Kim and Hovy, 2006).",
        "We will see further evidence of this in Section 4.2.3 in this paper.",
        "The contextual subjectivity analysis experiments in Section 4 include both S/O and polarity classifications.",
        "The data used in those experiments is from the MPQA Corpus (Wiebe et al., 2005; Wilson, 2008), which consists of texts from the world press annotated for subjective expressions.",

        "For SWSD, we need the notions of subjective and objective senses of words in a dictionary.",
        "We adopt the definitions from (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006), who describe the annotation scheme as follows.",
        "Classifying a sense as S means that, when the sense is used in a text or conversation, one expects it to express subjectivity, and also that the phrase or sentence containing it expresses subjectivity.",
        "As noted in (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006), sentences containing objective senses may not be objective.",
        "Thus, objective senses are defined as follows: Classifying a sense as O means that, when the sense is used in a text or conversation, one does not expect it to express subjectivity and, if the phrase or sentence containing it is subjective, the subjectivity is due to something else.",
        "Finally, classifying a sense as B means it covers both subjective and objective usages.",
        "The following subjective examples are given in (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006):",
        "His alarm grew.",
        "alarm, dismay, consternation - (fear resulting from the awareness of danger) => fear, fearfulness, fright - (an emotion experienced in anticipation of some specific pain or danger (usually accompanied by a desire to flee or fight))",

        "In contrast, full contextual interpretation can deviate from a sense's subjectivity label in the dictionary.",
        "As noted above, words used with objective senses may appear in subjective expressions.",

        "Our target words are members of a subjectivity lexicon, because, since they are in such a lexicon, we know they have subjective usages.",
        "Specifically, we use the lexicon of (Wilson et al., 2005b; Wilson, 2008).",
        "The entries have been divided into those that are strongly subjective (strongsubj) and those that are weakly subjective (weaksubj), reflecting their reliability as subjectivity clues.",
        "The sources of the entries in the lexicon are identified in (Wilson, 2008).",
        "In the second part of this paper, we evaluate systems against the MPQA corpus.",
        "Wilson also uses this corpus for her evaluations.",
        "To enable this, entries were added to the lexicon independently from the MPQA corpus (that is, none of the entries were derived using the MPQA corpus).",
        "The training and test data for SWSD consists of word instances in a corpus labeled as S or O, indicating whether they are used with a subjective or objective sense.",
        "Because we do not have data labeled with the S/O coarse-grained senses and we did not want to undertake the annotation effort at this stage, we created an annotated corpus by combining two types of sense annotations: (1) labels of senses within a dictionary as S or O (i.e., subjectivity sense labels), and (2) sense tags of word instances in a corpus (i.e., sense-tagged data).",
        "The subjectivity sense labels are used to collapse the sense labels in the sense-tagged data into the two new senses, S and O.",
        "Our sense-tagged data are the lexical sample corpora (training and test data) from SensevalI (Kilgarriff and Palmer, 2000), Senseval2 (Preiss and Yarowsky, 2001), and Senseval3 (Mihal-cea and Edmonds, 2004).",
        "We selected all of the Senseval words that are also in the subjectivity lexicon, and labeled their dictionary senses as S, O, or B according to the annotation scheme described above in Section 2.",
        "We did this subjectivity sense labeling according to the sense inventory of the underlying corpus (Hector for SensevalI; WordNet1.7 for Senseval2; and WordNet1.7.1 for Senseval3).",
        "Among the words, we found that 11 are not ambiguous - either they have only S or only O senses (in the corresponding sense inventory), or the senses of their instances in the Senseval data are all S or all O.",
        "So as not to inflate our results, we removed those 11 from the data, leaving 39 words.",
        "In addition, we excluded the senses labeled B (a total of 10 senses).",
        "This leaves a total of 372 senses: 9 words (64 senses) from Senseval1, 18 words (201 senses) from Senseval2, and 12 words (107 senses) from Senseval3.",

        "The improvement for SWSD over baseline is especially high for the less skewed set, S1.",
        "This is very encouraging because these words are the more ambiguous words, and thus are the ones that most need SWSD (assuming the S en se val priors are similar to the priors in the corpus).",

        "The positive results provide evidence that SWSD is a feasible variant of WSD, and that the S/O sense groupings are natural ones, since the system is able to learn to distinguish between them with high accuracy.",

        "As mentioned above, our experiments involve only lexicon entries that are covered by the Sense val data, as we did not perform manual sense tagging for this work.",
        "We have hope to expand the system's coverage in the future, as more word-sense tagged data is produced (e.g., Ontonotes (Hovy et al., 2006)).",
        "We also have evidence that a moderate amount of manual annotation would be worth the effort.",
        "For example, let us order the lexicon entries from highest to lowest by frequency in the MPQA corpus.",

        "The top 20 cover 9.4% of all subjective expressions; the top 40 cover 15.4%; and the top 80 cover 29.5%.",
        "Note that SWSD only needs the data annotated with the coarse-grained binary labels, which should be less time consuming to produce than full word sense tags.",
        "We found in Section 3.3 that SWSD is a feasible task and then in Section 4.1 that there is a great deal of subjectivity sense ambiguity in a standard subjectivity-annotated corpus (MPQA).",
        "We now turn to exploiting the results of SWSD to automatically recognize subjectivity and sentiment in the MPQA corpus.",
        "A motivation for using the MPQA data is that many types of classifiers have been evaluated on it, and we can directly test the effect of SWSD on these classifiers.",
        "Note that, for the SWSD experiments, the number of words does not limit the amount of data, as Senseval provides data for each word.",
        "However, the only parts of the MPQA corpus for which SWSD could affect performance is the subset containing instances of the words in the SWSD system's coverage.",
        "Thus, for the classifiers in this section, the data used is the SenMPQA dataset, which consists of the sentences in the MPQA Corpus that contain at least one instance of the 39 keywords.",
        "There are 689 such sentences (containing, in total, 723 instances of the 39 keywords).",
        "Even though this dataset is smaller than the one used above, it gives us enough data to draw conclusions according to McNemar's test for statistical significance.",
        "We first apply SWSD to the rule-based classifier from (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003).",
        "The classifier, which is a sentence-level S/O classifier, has low subjective and objective recall but high subjective and objective precision.",
        "It is useful for creating training data for subsequent processing by applying it to large amounts of unannotated data.",
        "The classifier is a good candidate for directly measuring the effects of SWSD on contextual subjectivity analysis, because it classifies sentences only by looking for the presence of subjectivity keywords.",
        "Performance will improve if false hits can be ignored.",
        "The classifier labels a sentence as S if it contains two or more strongsubj clues.",
        "On the other hand, it considers three conditions to classify a sentence as O: there are no strongsubj clues in the current sentence, there are together at most one strongsubj clue in the previous and next sentence, and there are together at most 2 weaksubj clues in the current, previous, and next sentence.",
        "A sentence that is not labeled S or O is labeled unknown.",
        "The rule-based classifier is made sense aware by making it blind to the target word instances labeled O by the SWSD system, as these represent false hits of subjectivity keywords.",
        "We compare this sense-aware method (SE), with the original classifier (Orb), in order to see if SWSD would improve performance.",
        "We also built another modified rule-based classifier RE to demonstrate the effect of randomly ignoring subjectivity keywords.",
        "RE ignores a keyword instance randomly with a probability of 0.429, the expected value of false hits in the MPQA corpus.",
        "The results are listed in Table 2.",
        "The rule-based classifier looks for the presence of the keywords to find subjective sentences and for the absence of the keywords to find objective sentences.",
        "It is obvious that a variant working on",
        "Acc OP OR OF SP SR SF fewer keyword instances than Orb will always have the same or higher objective recall and the same or lower subjective recall than Orb-That is the case for both SE and RE.",
        "The real benefit we see is in objective precision, which is substantially higher for SE than Orb-For our experiments, OP gives a better idea of the impact of SWSD, because most of the keyword instances SWSD disambiguates are weaksubj clues, and weaksubj keywords figure more prominently in objective classification.",
        "On the other hand, RE has both lower OP and SP than Orb-Note that accuracy for all three systems is low, because all unknown predictions are counted as incorrect.",
        "These findings suggest that SWSD performs well on disambiguating keyword instances in the MPQA corpus, and demonstrates a positive impact of SWSD on sentence-level subjectivity classification.",
        "We now move to more fine-grained expression-level subjectivity classification.",
        "Since sentences often contain multiple subjective expressions, expression-level classification is more informative than sentence-level classification.",
        "The classifier in this section is an implementation of the neutral/polar supervised classifier of (Wilson et al., 2005a) (using the same features), except that the classes are S/O rather than neutral/polar.",
        "These classifiers label instances of lexicon entries.",
        "The gold standard is defined on the MPQA Corpus as follows: If an instance is in a subjective expression, it is contextually S. If the instance is in an objective expression, it is contextually O.",
        "We evaluate the system on the 723 clue instances in the SenMPQA dataset.",
        "We incorporate SWSD information into the contextual subjectivity classifier in a straightforward fashion: outputs are modified according to simple, intuitive rules.",
        "Our strategy is defined by the relation between sense subjectivity and contextual subjectivity and involves two rules, Rl and R2.",
        "We know that a keyword instance used with a S sense must be in a subjective expression.",
        "Rl is to simply trust SWSD: If the contextual classifier labels an instance as O, but SWSD determines that it has an S sense, then Rl flips the contextual classifier's label to S.",
        "Things are not as simple in the case of O senses, since they may appear in both subjective and objective expressions.",
        "We will state R2, and then explain it: If the contextual classifier labels an instance as S, but (1) SWSD determines that it has an O sense, (2) the contextual classifier's confidence is low, and (3) there is no other subjective keyword in the same expression, then R2 flips the contextual classifier's label to O.",
        "First, consider confidence: though a keyword with an O sense may appear in either subjective or objective expressions, it is more likely to appear in an objective expression.",
        "We assume that this is reflected to some extent in the contextual classifier's confidence.",
        "Second, if a keyword with an O sense appears in a subjective expression, then the subjectivity is not due to that keyword but rather due to something else.",
        "Thus, the presence of another lexicon entry \"explains away\" the presence of the O sense in the subjective expression, and we do not want SWSD to overrule the contextual classifier.",
        "Only when the contextual classifier isn't certain and only when there isn't another keyword does R2 flip the label to O.",
        "Our definition of low confidence is in terms of the label weights assigned by BoosTexter (Schapire and Singer, 2000), which is the underlying machine learning algorithm of the classifier.",
        "We use the difference between the largest label weight and the second largest label weight as a measure of confidence, as suggested in the BoosTexter documentation.",
        "The threshold we use is 0.0008.",
        "We apply the contextual classifier and the SWSD system to the data, and compare the performance of the original system (Os/0) and three sense-aware variants: one using only Rl, one using only R2, and one using both (R1R2).",
        "The results are in Table 3.",
        "The Rl variant shows an improvement of 2.3 points in accuracy (a 9.4% error reduction).",
        "The R2 variant shows an improvement of 3.6 points in accuracy (a 14.6% error reduction).",
        "Applying both rules (R1R2) gives an improvement of 5.9 percentage points in accuracy (a 24% error reduction).",
        "In our case, a paired t-test is not appropriate to measure statistical significance, as we are not doing multiple runs.",
        "Thus, we apply McNemar's test, which is a non-parametric method for algorithms that can be executed only once, meaning training once and testing once (Dietterich, 1998).",
        "For Rl, the improvement in accuracy is statistically significant at the p < .05 level.",
        "For R2 and R1R2, the improvement in accuracy is statistically significant at the p < .01 level.",
        "Moreover, in all cases, we see improvement in both objective and subjective F-measure.",
        "We now apply SWSD to contextual polarity classification (positive/negative/neutral), in the hope that avoiding false hits of subjectivity keywords will also lead to performance improvement in contextual sentiment analysis.",
        "We use an implementation of the classifier of (Wilson et al., 2005a).",
        "This classifier labels instances of lexicon entries.",
        "The gold standard is defined on the MPQA Corpus as follows: If an instance is in a positive subjective expression, it is contextually positive (Ps); if in a negative subjective expression, it is contextually negative (Ng); and if it is in an objective expression or a neutral subjective expression, then it is contextually N(eutral).",
        "As above, we evaluate the system on the keyword instances in the SenMPQA dataset.",
        "Wilson et al.",
        "use a two step approach.",
        "The first step classifies keyword instances as being in a polar (positive or negative) or a neutral context.",
        "The first step is performed by the neutral/polar classifier mentioned above in Section 4.2.2.",
        "The second step decides the contextual polarity (positive or negative) of the instances classified as polar in the first step, and is performed by a separate classifier.",
        "To make a sense-aware version of the system, we use rules to change some of the answers of the neutral/polar classifier.",
        "Unfortunately, we cannot simply trust SWSD when it labels a keyword as an S sense, because an S sense might be in a N(eutral) expression (since there are neutral subjective expressions).",
        "But, an S sense is more likely to appear in a P(olar) expression.",
        "Thus, we consider confidence (rule R3): If the contextual classifier labels an instance as N, but SWSD determines it has an S sense and the contextual classifier's confidence is low, then R3 flips the contextual classifier's label to P.",
        "Rule R4 is analogous to R2 in the previous section: If the contextual classifier labels an instance as P, but (1) SWSD determines that it has an O sense, (2) the contextual classifier's confidence is low, and (3) there is no other subjective keyword in the same expression, then R2 flips the contextual classifier's label to N.",
        "We compare the performance of the original neutral/polar classifier (O^/p) and sense-aware variants using R3 and R4.",
        "The results are in Table 4.",
        "This time, the table does not include a combined method, because only R4 improves performance.",
        "This is consistent with the finding in (Wilson et al., 2005a) that most errors are caused by subjectivity keywords with non-neutral prior polarity appearing in phrases with neutral contextual polarity.",
        "R4 targets these cases.",
        "It is promising to see that SWSD provides enough information to fix some of them.",
        "There is a 2.6 point improvement in accuracy (a 12.4% error reduction).",
        "The improvement in accuracy is statistically significant at the p < .01 level with McNemar's test.",
