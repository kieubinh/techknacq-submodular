        "Lexical dependencies modeled in standard phrase-based SMT are rather local.",
        "Even though the decision about the best translation is made on sentence level, phrase models and word lexicons usually do not take context beyond the phrase boundaries into account.",
        "This is especially problematic since the average source phrase length used during decoding is small.",
        "When translating Chinese to English, e.g., it is typically close to only two words.",
        "The target language model is the only model that uses lexical context across phrase boundaries.",
        "It is a very important feature in the log-linear setup of today's phrase-based decoders.",
        "However, its context is typically limited to three to six words and it is not informed about the source sentence.",
        "In the presented models, we explicitly take advantage of sentence-level dependencies including the source side and make non-local predictions for the target words.",
        "This is an important aspect when translating from languages like German and Chinese where long-distance dependencies are common.",
        "In Chinese, for example, tenses are often encoded by indicator words and particles whose position is relatively free in the sentence.",
        "In German, prefixes of verbs can be moved over long distances towards the end of the sentence.",
        "In this work, we propose two models that can be categorized as extensions of standard word lexicons: A discriminative word lexicon that uses global, i.e. sentence-level source information to predict the target words using a statistical classifier and a trigger-based lexicon model that extends the well-known IBM model 1 (Brown et al., 1993) with a second trigger, allowing for a more finegrained lexical choice of target words.",
        "The log-linear framework of the discriminative word lexicon offers a high degree of flexibility in the selection of features.",
        "Other sources of information such as syntax or morphology can be easily integrated.",
        "The trigger-based lexicon model, or simply triplet model since it is based on word triplets, is not trained discriminatively but uses the classical maximum likelihood approach (MLE) instead.",
        "We train the triplets iteratively on a training corpus using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.",
        "We will present how both models allow for a representation of topic-related sentence-level information which puts them close to word sense disambiguation (WSD) approaches.",
        "As will be shown later, the experiments indicate that these models help to ensure translation of content words that are often omitted by the baseline system.",
        "This is a common problem in Chinese-English translation.",
        "Furthermore, the models are often capable to produce a better lexical choice of content words.",

        "Several word lexicon models have emerged in the context of multilingual natural language processing.",
        "Some of them were used as a machine translation system or as a part of one such system.",
        "There are three major types of models: Heuristic models as in (Melamed, 2000), generative models as the IBM models (Brown et al., 1993) and discriminative models (Varea et al., 2001; Bangalore et al., 2006).",
        "Similar to this work, the authors of (Varea et al., 2001) try to incorporate a maximum entropy lexicon model into an SMT system.",
        "They use the words and word classes from the local context as features and show improvements with n-best rescoring.",
        "The models in this paper are also related to word sense disambiguation (WSD).",
        "For example, (Chan et al., 2007) trained a discriminative model for WSD using local but also across-sentence un-igram collocations of words in order to refine phrase pair selection dynamically by incorporating scores from the WSD classifier.",
        "They showed improvements in translation quality in a hierarchical phrase-based translation system.",
        "Another WSD approach incorporating context-dependent phrasal translation lexicons is given in (Carpuat and Wu, 2007) and has been evaluated on several translation tasks.",
        "Our model differs from the latter in three ways.",
        "First, our approach models word selection of the target sentence based on global sentence-level features of the source sentence.",
        "Second, instead of disambiguating phrase senses as in (Carpuat and Wu, 2007), we model word selection independently of the phrases used in the MT models.",
        "Finally, the training is done in a different way as will be presented in Sections 3.1.1 and 3.2.1.",
        "Recently, full translation models using discriminative training criteria emerged as well.",
        "They are designed to generate a translation for a given source sentence and not only score or disambiguate hypotheses given by a translation system.",
        "In (Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2007), the model can predict 1-to-many translations with gaps and uses words, morphologic and syntactic features from the local context.",
        "The authors of (Venkatapathy and Bangalore, 2007) propose three different models.",
        "The first one is a global lexical selection model which includes all words of the source sentence as features, regardless of their position.",
        "Using these features, the system predicts the words that should be included in the target sentence.",
        "Sentence structure is then reconstructed using permutations of the generated bag of target words.",
        "We will also use this type of features in our model.",
        "One of the simplest models in the context of lexical triggers is the IBM model 1 (Brown et al., 1993) which captures lexical dependencies between source and target words.",
        "It can be seen as a lexicon containing correspondents of translations of source and target words in a very broad sense since the pairs are trained on the full sentence level.",
        "The trigger-based lexicon model used in this work follows the training procedure introduced in (Hasan et al., 2008) and is integrated directly in the decoder instead of being applied in n-best list reranking.",
        "The model is very close to the IBM model 1 and can be seen as an extension of it by taking another word into the conditioning part, i.e. the triggering items.",
        "Thus, instead of p(f\\e), it models p(f\\e, e').",
        "Furthermore, since the second trigger can come from any part of the sentence, there is a link to long-range monolingual triggers as presented in (Tillmann and Ney, 1997) where a trigger language model was trained using the EM algorithm and helped to reduce perplexities and word error rates in a speech recognition experiment.",
        "In (Rosenfeld, 1996), another approach was chosen to model monolingual triggers using a maximum-entropy based framework.",
        "Again, this adapted LM could improve speech recognition performance significantly.",
        "A comparison of a variant of the trigger-based lexicon model applied in decoding and n-best list reranking can be found in (Hasan and Ney, 2009).",
        "In order to reduce the number of overall triplets, the authors use the word alignments for fixing the first trigger to the aligned target word.",
        "In general, this constraint performs slightly worse than the unconstrained variant used in this work, but allows for faster training and decoding."

        "Discriminative models have been shown to outperform generative models on many natural language processing tasks.",
        "For machine translation, however, the adaptation of these methods is difficult due to the large space of possible translations and the size of the training data that has to be used to achieve significant improvements.",
        "In this section, we propose a discriminative word lexicon model that follows (Bangalore et al., 2007) and integrate it into the standard phrase-based machine translation approach.",
        "The core of our model is a classifier that predicts target words, given the words of the source sentence.",
        "The structure of source as well as target sentence is neglected in this model.",
        "We do not make any assumptions about the location of the words in the sentence.",

        "We model the probability of the set of target words in a sentence e given the set of source words f. For each word in the target vocabulary, we can calculate a probability for being or not being included in the set.",

        ":",
        "Subsequently, we will call this model discriminative word lexicon (DWL).",
        "Modeling the lexicon on sets and not on sequences has two reasons.",
        "Phrase-based MT along with n-gram language models is strong at predicting sequences but only uses information from a local context.",
        "By using global features and predicting words in a non-local fashion, we can augment the strong local decisions from the phrase-based systems with sentence-level information.",
        "For practical reasons, translating from a set to a set simplifies the parallelization of the training procedure.",
        "The classifiers for the target words can be trained separately as explained in the following section.",
        "Common classification tasks have a relatively small number of classes.",
        "In our case, the number of classes is the size of the target vocabulary.",
        "For large translation tasks, this is in the range of a hundred thousand classes.",
        "It is far from what conventional out-of-the-box classifiers can handle.",
        "The discriminative word lexicon model has the convenient property that we can train a separate model for each target word making parallelization straightforward.",
        "Discussions about possible classifiers and the choice of regularization can be found in (Bangalore et al., 2007).",
        "We used the freely available MegaM Toolkit for training, which implements the L-BFGS method (Byrd et al., 1995).",
        "Regularization is done using Gaussian priors.",
        "We performed 100 iterations of the training algorithm for each word in the target vocabulary.",
        "This results in a large number of classifiers to be trained.",
        "For the Arabic-English data (cf.",
        "Section 4), the training took an average of 38 seconds per word.",
        "No feature cutoff was used.",
        "In search, we compute the model probabilities as an additional model in the log-linear model combination of the phrase-based translation approach.",
        "To reduce the memory footprint and startup time of the decoding process, we reduced the number of",
        "!http://www.es.utah.edu/~hal/megam/",
        "parameters by keeping only large values A/ e since smaller values tend to have less effect on the overall probability.",
        "In experiments we determined that we could safely reduce the size of the final model by a factor of ten without losing predictive power.",
        "In search, we compute the model probabilities as an additional model in the log-linear combination.",
        "When scoring hypotheses from the phrase-based system, we see the translation hypothesis as the set of target words that are predicted.",
        "Words from the target vocabulary which are not included in the hypothesis are not part of the set.",
        "During the search process, however, we also have to score incomplete hypotheses where we do not know which words will not be included.",
        "This problem is circumvented by rewriting Eq.",

        "The first product is constant given a source sentence and therefore does not affect the search.",
        "Using the model assumption from Eq.",

        "Experiments showed that using only the first factor of Eq.",
        "1 is sufficient to obtain good results.",
        "In comparison with the translation model from (Bangalore et al., 2007) where a threshold on the probability is used to determine which words are included in the target sentence, our approach relies on the phrase model to generate translation candidates.",
        "This has several advantages: The length of the translation is determined by the phrase model.",
        "Words occurring multiple times in the translation do not have to be explicitly modeled.",
        "In (Bangalore et al., 2007), repeated target words are treated as distinct classes.",
        "The main advantage of the integration being done in a way as presented here is that the phrase model and the discriminative word lexicon model are complementary in the way they model the translation.",
        "While the phrase model is good in predicting translations in a local context, the discriminative word lexicon model is able to predict global aspects of the sentence like tense or vocabulary changes in questions.",
        "While the phrase model is closely tied to the structure of word and phrase alignments, the discriminative word lexicon model completely disregards the structure in source and target sentences.",
        "The triplets of the trigger-based lexicon model, i.e. p(e\\f, /'), are composed of two words in the source language triggering one target language word.",
        "We chose this inverse direction since it can be integrated directly into the decoder and, thus, does not rely on a two-pass approach using reranking, as it is the case for (Hasan et al., 2008).",
        "The triggers can originate from words of the whole source sentence, also crossing phrase boundaries of the conventional bilingual phrase pairs.",
        "The model is symmetric though, meaning that the order of the triggers is not relevant, i.e. (/,/' – > e) = (/',/ – > e).",
        "Nevertheless, the model is able to capture long-distance effects such as verb splits or adjustments to lexical choice of the target word given the topic-triggers of the source sentence.",
        "In training, we determine the probability of a target sentence e{ given the source sentence f( within the model by where /o denotes the empty word and, thus, for fj = e, allows for modeling the conventional (inverse) IBM model 1 lexical probabilities as well.",
        "Since the second trigger ff always starts right of the current first trigger, the model is symmetric and does not need to look at all trigger pairs.",
        "Eq.",
        "4 is used in the iterative EM training on all sentence pairs of the training data which is described in more detail in the following.",
        "For training the trigger-based lexicon model, we apply the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977).",
        "The goal is to maximize the log-likelihood Ft„p of this model for a given bilingual training corpus {(/j™, e{n)}^ consisting of N sentence pairs:",
        "where In and Jn are the lengths of the nth target and source sentence, respectively.",
        "An auxiliary function Q(ß; ß) is defined based on FtriP where ß is the updated estimate within an iteration which is to be derived from the current estimate ß.",
        "Here, ß stands for the entire set of model parameters, i.e. the set of all {a(e\\f, /')} with the constraint Ee a(el/'/') = 1 The accumulators a(-) are therefore iteratively trained on the training data by using the current estimate, i.e. deriving the expected value (E-step), and maximizing their likelihood afterwards to reestimate the distribution.",
        "Thus, the perplexity of the training data is reduced in each iteration.",
        "In search, we can apply this model directly when scoring bilingual phrase pairs.",

        "where i moves over all target words in the phrase ë, the second sum selects all source sentence words including the empty word, and j' > j incorporates the rest of the source sentence right of the first trigger.",
        "We take negative log-probabilities and normalize to obtain the final score (representing costs) for the given phrase pair.",
        "Note that in search, we can only use this direction, p(e\\f, /'), since the whole source sentence is available for triggering effects whereas not all target words have been generated so far, as it would be necessary for the standard direction, p(f\\e,e').",
        "Due to the enormous number of triplets, we trained the model on a subset of the overall training data.",
        "The subcorpus, mainly consisting of newswire articles, contained 1.4M sentence pairs with 32.3M running words on the English side.",
        "We trained two versions of the triplet lexicon, one using 4 EM iterations and another one that was trained for 10 EM iterations.",
        "Due to trimming of triplets with small probabilities after each iteration, the version based on 10 iterations was slightly smaller, having 164 million triplets but also performed slightly worse.",
        "Thus, for the experiments, we used the version based on 4 iterations which contained 291 million triplets.",
