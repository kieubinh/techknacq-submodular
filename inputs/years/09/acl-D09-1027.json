        "When m = %n, the extracted keyphrases are noisy with many single-word phrases.",
        "As the cluster number increases, more exemplar terms are identified from these clusters, and more keyphrases will be extracted from the document based on exemplar terms.",
        "If we set the cluster number torn = n, all terms will be selected as exemplar terms.",
        "In this extreme case, all noun groups will be extracted as keyphrases, which is obviously not proper for keyphrase extraction.",
        "Thus, it is important for this method to appropriately specify the cluster number.",
        "In the experiments, we also notice that frequent word list is important for keyphrase extraction.",
        "Without the list for filtering, the best Fl-measure will decrease by about 5 percent to 40%.",
        "However, the solution of using frequent word list is somewhat too simple, and in future work, we plan to investigate a better combination of clustering-based method with traditional methods using term frequency as the criteria."
