        "Some textual geographical information can be found in web sites of transport companies, tourist sites and repositories such as Wikipedia.",
        "Such sites usually utilize structured information such as machine-readable meta-data, tables, schedule forms or lists, which are relatively convenient for processing.",
        "However, automatic utilization of such information is limited.",
        "Even on these sites, only a small fraction of the available geographical information is stored in a well-structured and freely accessible form.",
        "With the growth of the web, information can be frequently found in 'ordinary' web pages such as forums, travelogues or news.",
        "In such sites, information is usually noisy, unstructured and present in the form of free text.",
        "This type of information can be addressed by lexical patterns.",
        "Patterns were shown to be very useful in all sorts of lexical acquisition tasks, giving high precision results at relatively low computational costs (Pantel et al., 2004).",
        "Pattern-driven search engine queries allow to access such information and gather the required data very efficiently (Davidov et al., 2007).",
        "In this paper we present a framework that given a few seed locations as a specification of a region, discovers additional locations (including alternate location names) and map-like travel paths through this region labeled by transport type labels.",
        "The type of output produced by our framework here differs from that in previous pattern-based studies.",
        "Unlike mainstream pattern-based web mining, it does not target some specific two-slot relationship and attempts to extract word tuples for this relationship.",
        "Instead, it discovers geographical networks of transport or access connections.",
        "Such networks are not unstructured sets of word pairs, but a structured graph with labeled edges.",
        "Our algorithm utilizes variations of the basic predefined pattern \"[Transport] from Location 1 to Location2\" which allows location names and connections to be captured starting from the given seed location set.",

        "In this paper we utilize a pattern-based lexical acquisition framework for the discovery of geographical information.",
        "Due to the importance of lexical databases for many NLP tasks, substantial research has been done on direct or indirect automated acquisition of concepts (sets of terms sharing a significant aspect of their meaning) and concept relationships in the form of graphs connecting concepts or terms inside concepts into usually hierarchical or bipartite networks.",
        "In the case of geo-mining, concepts can include sets of alternative names for some place, or sets of all locations of the same type (e.g., all countries).",
        "Geographical relationships can include nearness of two locations and entity-location relationships such as institute-address, capital-country, tourist site-city etc.",
        "The major differences between relationship acquisition frameworks come from the types and annotation requirements of the supplied input and the basic algorithmic approach used to process this input.",
        "A first major algorithmic approach is to represent word contexts as vectors in some space and use distributional measures and automatic clustering in that space.",
        "Curran (2002) and Lin (1998) use syntactic features in the vector definition.",
        "Caraballo (1999) uses conjunction and appositive annotations in the vector represen-tation.While efforts have been made for improving the computational complexity of these methods (Gorman and Curran, 2006), they remain data and computation intensive.",
        "The second major algorithmic approach is to use lexico-syntactic patterns, which have been shown to produce more accurate results than feature vectors at a lower computational cost on large corpora (Pantel et al., 2004).",
        "Most related work deals with discovery of hypernymy (Hearst, 1992; Pantel and Lin, 2002) and synonymy (Widdows and Dorow, 2002; Davidov and Rappoport, 2006).",
        "Some studies deal with the discovery of more specific relation sub-types, including inter-verb relations (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004) and semantic relations between nominals (Davidov and Rappoport, 2008).",
        "Extensive frameworks were proposed for iterative discovery of pre-specified (e.g., (Riloff and Jones, 1999)) and unspecified (e.g., (Agichtein and Gravano, 2000)) relation types.",
        "Some concepts and relationships examined by seed-based discovery methods were of a geographical nature.",
        "For example, (Etzioni et al., 2004) discovered a set of countries and (Davidov et al., 2007) discovered diverse country relationships, including location relationships between a country and its capital and a country and its rivers.",
        "As noted in Section 1, the type of output that we produce here is not an unstructured collection of word pairs but a labeled network.",
        "As such, our task here is much more complex.",
        "Our study is related to geographical information retrieval (GIR) systems.",
        "However, our problem is very far from classic GIR problem settings.",
        "In GIR, the goal is to classify or retrieve possibly multilingual documents in response to queries in the form 'theme, spatial relationship, location', e.g., 'mountains near New York' (Purves et al., 2006).",
        "Our goal, in contrast, is not document retrieval, but the generation of a structured information resource, a labeled location graph.",
        "Spatial relationships used in natural language tend to be qualitative and descriptive rather than quantitative.",
        "The concept of Naive Geography, which reflects the way people think and write about geographical space, is described in (Egen-hofer and Shariff, 1995).",
        "Later in (Egenhofer and Shariff, 1998) they proposed a way to convert coordinate-based relationships between spatial entities to natural language using terms as 'crosses', 'goes through' or 'runs into'.",
        "Such terms can be potentially used in patterns to extract geographical information from text.",
        "In this paper we start from a different pattern, 'from ... to', which helps in discovering transport or connectedness relationships between places, e.g., 'bus from X to Y' and 'road from X to Y'.",
        "The majority of geographical data mining frameworks utilize structured data such as available gazetteers and Wikipedia metadata.",
        "Several other studies utilize semi-structured data like Wikipedia links (Overell and Ruger, 2007) or substructures in web pages, including addresses and phone numbers (Borges et al., 2007).",
        "The recent Schockaert et al.",
        "( 2008) framework for extraction of topological relationships from the web has some similarities to our study.",
        "In both cases the algorithm produces map-like structures using the web.",
        "However, there are significant differences.",
        "They utilize relatively structured address data on web pages and rely on the order of named entities in address data for extracting containment relationships.",
        "They also use co-appearances in addresses (e.g., 'Rl / R2' and 'RI k R2' as in \"Newport & Gabalfa, Cardiff\") to deduce location boundaries.",
        "This allows them to get high precision data for modern and heavily populated regions like Cardiff, where the majority of offices have available well-formatted web pages.",
        "However, in less populated regions (a major target for tourist information requests), this strategy could be problematic since a major information source about these places would be not local web sites (in which local addresses are likely to be found) but foreign visitor sites, web forums and news.",
        "We rely on free text available in all types of web pages, which allows us to capture unstructured information which contains a significant portion of the web-available geographical knowledge.",
        "Our goals are also different from Schockaert et al.",
        "( 2008), since we focus on obtaining information based on paths and transport between locations, while in their work the goal is to find a network representing nearness of places rather than their connectivity by means of transport or walking.",
        "Nevertheless, in one of our evaluation settings we targeted the area of Cardiff as in (Schockaert et al., 2008).",
        "This allowed us to make an indirect comparison of a relevant part of our results to previous work, achieving state-of-the-art performance."

        "We first use a predefined pattern for recursive extraction of the first set of entities.",
        "Then we discover additional patterns from co-appearing location pairs and use them to get more terms.",
        "Next, we label and merge the obtained location pairs.",
        "Finally, we construct and refine the obtained graph.",
        "In order to obtain the first set of location connections, we use derivatives of the basic pattern 'from X to Y'.",
        "Using Yahoo!",
        "BOSS, we have utilized the API's ability to search for phrases with wildcards.",
        "Given a location name L we start the search with patterns \"from * to L\", \"from * * to L\".",
        "These are Yahoo!",
        "BOSS queries where enclosing words in \"\" means searching for an exact phrase and '*' means a wildcard for exactly one arbitrary word.",
        "This pattern serves a few goals beyond the discovery of connectedness.",
        "Thus putting '*'s inside the pattern rather than using \"from L to\" allowed us to avoid arbitrary truncation of multiword expressions as in 'from Moscow to St. Petersburg' and reduced the probability of capturing unrelated sentence parts like 'from Moscow to cover deficit'.",
        "Location names are usually ambiguous and this type of web queries can lead to a significant amount of noise or location mix.",
        "There are two types of ambiguity.",
        "First, as in 'from Billericay to Stock....', stock can be a location or a verb.",
        "We filter most such cases by allowing only capitalized location names.",
        "Besides, such an ambiguity is rarely captured by 'from * to L' patterns.",
        "The second type is location ambiguity.",
        "Thus 'Moscow' refers to at least 5 location names including farms in Africa and Australia and a locality in Ireland.",
        "In order to reduce mixing of locations we use the following simple disambiguation technique.",
        "Before performing \"from...to\" queries, we downloaded up to 100 web pages pointed by each possible pair from the given seed locations, generating from a location pair Li,L2 a conjunctive query \"L\\ * L2\".",
        "Then we extracted the most informative terms using a simple probabilistic metric:",
        "P(w\\Query Corpus) P(w\\GeneralCorpus) ' comparing word distribution in the downloaded Query Corpus to a large general purpose offline Generale or pus.",

        "query-specific disambiguating words.",
        "Then we added to all queries the same most frequent word (DW) out of the ten words with highest ranks.",
        "Thus for the seed set {Moscow, St. Petersburg}, an example of a query is <\"from * to Moscow\" Russia>.",
        "We retrieved all search engine snippets for each of these initial queries.",
        "If we succeeded to get more than 50 snippets, we did not download the complete documents.",
        "In case where only a handful of snippets were obtained, the algorithm downloaded up to 25 documents pointed by these snippets in an attempt to get more pattern instances.",
        "In the majority of tested cases, snippets provide enough information for our task, and this information was not significantly extended by downloading the whole documents.",
        "Once we retrieve snippets we identify terms appearing in the snippets in wildcard slots.",
        "For example, if the query is <\"from * to Moscow\" Russia> and we encounter a snippet \"...from Vladivostok to Moscow...\", we add 'Vladivostok' to our set of seeds.",
        "We then continue the search in a breadth first search setting, stopping the search on three conditions: (1) runaway detected - the total frequency of newly obtained terms through some term's patterns is greater than the total frequency of previously discovered terms+seeds.",
        "In this case we stop exploration through the problematic term and continue exploration through other terms; (2) we reached a predefined maximal depth D; (3) no new terms discovered.",
        "At the end of this stage we get the extended set of terms using the set of snippets where these terms co-appear in patterns.",
        "In order to get more data, we enhance the pattern set both by discovery of new useful secondary patterns and by narrowing existing patterns.",
        "After obtaining the new pattern set we repeat the extraction stage described in Section 3.2.",
        "Adding secondary patterns.",
        "As in a number of previous studies, we improve our results discovering additional patterns from the obtained term set.",
        "The algorithm selects a subset of up to 50 discovered (ii, t2) term pairs appearing in 'from t\\ to Â£2' patterns and performs the set of additional queries of the form <\"ti * t2\" DW>.",
        "We then extract from the obtained snippets the patterns of the form 'Prefix t\\ Infix t2 Postfix', where Prefix and Postfix should contain either a punctuation symbol or 1-3 words.",
        "Prefix/Postfix should also be bounded from left/right by a punctuation or one of the 50 most frequent words in the language (based on word counts in the offline general corpus).",
        "Infix should contain 1-3 words with the possible addition of punctuation symbols.",
        "We examine patterns and select useful ones according to the following ranking scheme, based on how well each pattern captures named entities.",
        "For each discovered pattern we scan the obtained snippets and offline general corpus for instances where this pattern connects one of the original or discovered location terms to some other term.",
        "Let T be the set of all one to three word terms in the language, c T the set of discovered terms, Tc c T the set of all capitalized terms and Pat(ti,t2) indicates one or more co-appearances of ii and t2 in pattern Pat in the retrieved snippets or offline general corpus.",

        "In other words, we rank patterns according to the percentage of capitalized words connected by this pattern.",
        "We sort patterns by rank and select the top 20% patterns.",
        "Once we have discovered a new pattern set, we repeat the term extraction in Section 3.2.",
        "We do this only once and not reiterate this loop in order to avoid potential runaway problems.",
        "Obtained secondary patterns include different from/to templates \"to X from Y by bus\"; time/distance combinations \"X N km bus Y\", \"X (bus, N min) Y\" or patterns in different languages with English location/transport names.",
        "Narrowing existing patterns.",
        "When available data volume is high, we would like to take advantage of more data by utilizing more specific pattern sets.",
        "Since Yahoo!",
        "allows to obtain only the first IK snippets, in case we get more than 10K hits, we extend our queries by adding the most common term sequences appearing before or after the pattern.",
        "Thus if for the query \"from * to Moscow\" we got more than 10K hits and among the snippets we see bus from X to Moscow...' we create an extended pattern 'bus from * to Moscow' and use the term extraction in Section 3.2 to get additional terms.",
        "Unlike the extraction of secondary patterns, this narrowing process can be repeated recursively as long as a query brings more than 10K results.",
        "At the end of the discovery stage we get an extended set of patterns and a list of search engine snippets discovered using these patterns.",
        "Each snippet which captures terms t\\,t2 in either primary 'from ii to t2 or secondary patterns represents a potential connection between entities.",
        "Using an observed property of the primary pattern, we select as a label a term or set of terms appearing directly before 'from' and delimited with some high frequency word or punctuation.",
        "For example, labels for snippets based on 'from...to' patterns and containing 'the road from...', 'got a bus from', 'a TransSiberian train from...' would be road, bus and TransSiberian train.",
        "Once we acquire labels for the primary patterns, we also attempt to find labels in snippets obtained for secondary patterns discovered as described in Section 3.3.",
        "We first locate some already labeled pairs in secondary patterns' snippets where we can see both label and the labeled term pair.",
        "Then, based on the label's position in this snippet, we define a label slot position for this type of snippet.",
        "Suppose that during the labeling of primary pattern snippets we assigned the label 'bus' to the pair (Novgorod, Moscow) and during the pattern extension stage the algorithm discovered a pattern Pnew = 'ride to t2 from ii,' with a corresponding snippet '... getting bus ride to Moscow from Novgorod...'.",
        "Then using the labeled pair our algorithm defines the label slot in such a snippet type: 'getting [label] ride to t2 from ii'.",
        "Once a label slot is defined, all other pairs captured by Pnew can be successfully labeled.",
        "Some labels may denote the same type of connection.",
        "Also, large sets of connections can share the same set of transport types.",
        "In this case it is desired to assign a single label for a shared set of transports.",
        "We do this by a simple merging technique.",
        "Let C\\,C2 be sets of pairs assigned to labels Li,L2.",
        "We merge two labels if one of the following conditions holds:",
        "Thus, either one group is nearly included in the other or each group shares nearly half with the other group.",
        "We apply this rule only once and do not iterate recursively.",
        "At this stage we also dismiss weakly populated labels, keeping the 10 most populated labels.",
        "Now once we have merged and assigned the labels we create a pattern graph for each label and attempt to clean the graph of noise and unnecessary edges.",
        "Our graph definition follows (Wid-dows and Dorow, 2002).",
        "In our pattern graph for label L, nodes represent terms and directed edges represent co-appearance of two terms in some pattern in snippet labeled by L. We do not add unlabeled snippets to the graph.",
        "Now we use a set of techniques to reduce noise and unnecessary edges.",
        "One of the main problems with the pattern-based graph is transitivity of connections.",
        "Thus if location A is connected to B and B to C, we frequently acquire a \"shortcut\" edge connecting A to C. Such an edge diminishes our ability to create a clear and meaningful spatial graph.",
        "In order to reduce such edges we employ the following two strategies.",
        "First, neighboring places frequently form fully connected subgraphs.",
        "We would like to simplify such cliques to reduce the amount of transitive connections.",
        "If three overlapping sets of nodes {Ax... An_2},{A2 ... Ara_i},{A3 ...An} form three different cliques, then we remove all edges between A\\ and the nodes in the third clique and between An and the nodes in the first clique.",
        "Second, in paths obtained by directional patterns, it is common that if there is a path A\\ â > A2 â  â  â  â > An where A\\ and An are some major 'key' locations, then each of the nodes A2... An-\\ tend to be connected both to A\\ and to An while intermediate nodes are usually connected only to their close neighbors.",
        "We would like to eliminate such transitive edges leaving only the inter-neighbor connections.",
        "We define as key nodes in a graph, nodes whose degree is more than 1.5 times the average graph degree.",
        "Then we eliminate the transitive connections: if A\\ is a key node and A\\ is connected to each of the nodes A2...An-i, and Vi G {2 ... n â 1}, Ai is connected to Ai+\\, then we remove the connection of A\\ to all nodes As ... An_i , leaving A\\ only connected to A2.",
        "Finally we remove potential noise which accidentally connects remote graph parts.",
        "If some edge discovered through a single pattern instance connects distant (distance>3) parts of the graph we remove it.",
        "Additionally, we would like to merge common name alternations and misspellings of places.",
        "We merge two nodes A and B into one node if either (1) A, B have exactly the same edges, and their edge count is greater than 2; or (2) edges of A are subset of B's edges and the string edit distance between A and B is less than a third of min(StringLength(A), StringLength(B))."

        "Automated acquisition of spatial data can significantly help many NLP tasks, e.g., question answering.",
        "We would also like to incorporate some patterns based on (Egenhofer and Shariff, 1998), such as 'crosses', 'goes through' or 'runs into', which may allow automated acquisition of complex spatial relationships.",
