        "Many applications in the context of natural language processing or information retrieval have proved to convey significant improvement by exploiting lexical databases with high-quality annotation such as FrameNet (Fillmore et al., 2003) and WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "Nevertheless, the practical use of similar resources is often biased by their limited coverage because manual annotation is time-consuming and requires a relevant financial effort.",
        "For this reason, some research activities have focused on the automatic enrichment of such resources with annotated information in (near) manual quality.",
        "The main strategy proposed was the mapping between resources in order to reciprocally enrich different lexical databases by linking their information layers.",
        "This has proved to be useful in several tasks, from verb classification (Chow and Webster, 2007) to semantic role labeling (Giuglea and Moschitti, 2006), open text semantic parsing (Shi and Mihalcea, 2004) and textual entailment (Burchardt and Frank, 2006).",
        "In this work, we focus on the automatic enrichment of the FrameNet database for English and we propose a new framework to extend this procedure to new languages.",
        "While similar works in the past have mainly proposed to automatically extend the FrameNet database by mapping frames and Word-Net synsets (Shi and Mihalcea (2005), lohans-son and Nugues (2007), and Tonelli and Pighin (2009)), we present an explorative approach that for the first time exploits Wikipedia to this purpose.",
        "In particular, given a lexical unit I belonging to a frame F, we devise a strategy to link I to the Wikipedia article that best captures the sense of I in F. This is basically a word disambiguation (WSD) problem (Erk, 2004) and to this purpose we employ a state-of-the-art WSD system (Gliozzo et al., 2005).",
        "The mapping between (F,l) pairs and Wikipedia pages could then be exploited for three further sub tasks: (a) automatically extract from Wikipedia all sentences pointing to the Wikipage mapped with (F, I) and assign them to F; (b) automatically expand the lexical units sets in the English FrameNet by exploiting the redirecting and linking strategy of Wikipedia; and (c) since Wikipedia is available in 260 languages, use the English Wikipedia article linked to (F, I) as a bridge to carry out sentence and lexical unit retrieval in other languages.",
        "The set of automatically collected data would represent the starting point for the creation of FrameNet in new languages.",
        "In fact, having a repository of sentences extracted from Wikipedia which have already been divided by sense would significantly speed up the annotation process.",
        "In this way, the annotators would not need to extract all sentences in a corpus containing I and classify them by sense.",
        "Instead, they should simply validate the given sentences and assign the correct frame elements.",

        "In Section 5 we describe the dataset used in the first experiment and report evaluation results of the mapping between (F, I) pairs and Wikipedia senses.",
        "In Section 6 we describe an application of the mapping, i.e. the automatic enrichment of English FrameNet.",

        "Specifically, they addressed these issues: (i) independently modeling domain and syntagmatic aspects of sense distinction to improve feature representativeness; and (ii) exploiting external knowledge acquired from unlabeled data, with the purpose of drastically reducing the amount of labeled training data.",
        "The first direction is based on the linguistic assumption that syntagmatic and domain (associative) relations are crucial for representing sense distictions, but they are originated by different phenomena.",
        "Regarding the second direction, it is possible to obtain a more accurate prediction by taking into account unlabeled data relevant for the learning problem (Chapelle et al., 2006).",
        "On the other hand, kernel methods are theoretically well founded in statistical learning theory and shown good empirical results in many applications (Shawe-Taylor and Cristianini, 2004).",

        "They first embed the input data in a suitable feature space, and then use a linear algorithm (e.g., support vector machines) to discover nonlinear patterns in the input space.",
        "The kernel function is the only task-specific component of the learning algorithm.",
        "Thus, to develop a WSD system, one only needs to define appropriate kernel functions to represent the domain and syntagmatic aspects of sense distinction and to exploit the properties of kernel functions in order to define a composite kernel that combines and extends individual kernels.",
        "The WSD system described in the following consists of a composite kernel (Section 4.3) that combines the domain and syntagmatic kernels.",
        "The former (Section 4.1) models the domain aspects of sense distinction, the latter (Section 4.2) represents the syntagmatic aspects of sense distinction.",

        "In the context of kernel methods, domain information can be exploited by defining a kernel function that estimates the domain similarity between the contexts of the word to be disambiguated.",
        "The simplest method to estimate the domain similarity between two texts is to compute the cosine similarity of their vector representations in the vector space model (VSM).",
        "The VSM is a fc-dimensional space Rfc, in which the text i, is represented by a vector tj, where the ith component is the term frequency of the term Wi in tj.",

        "For instance, despite the fact that the sentences \"he is affected by AIDS\" and \"HIV is a virus\" express concepts closely related, their similarity is zero in the VSM because they have no words in common (they are represented by orthogonal vectors).",

SVD decomposes the term-by-document matrix T into three matrixes T ~ VSk/UT, where V and U are orthogonal matrices (i.e., VTV = I and UTU = I) whose columns are the eigenvectors of TTT and TTT respectively, and Sk/ is the diagonal k x k matrix containing the highest k!",

        "This value is higher that the mapping accuracy between (F, I) and Wikipages reported in Section 5.2.",
        "In fact, we noticed that even if the Wikipage assigned to (F, I) is not the article that best corresponds to the meaning of I in F, some sentences pointing to it may be appropriate to express I.",
        "As we already mentioned in Section 5.2, the different granularity of the information encoded by frames and Wikipages impacts on the output quality.",
        "For example, conversions in Cause.change has a causative meaning, while it implies a personal process in un-dergo_change.",
        "The mapping, instead, links (Cause_change - conversions) to the Religious-conversion page, and all the sentences collected point to religious conversion, regardless of their causative form or not.",
        "Another characteristic of this approach is that we can acquire new lexical units regardless of their part-of-speech, even if we start from nominal lexical units.",
        "This proves that we do not need to apply the initial mapping to verbal or adjectival LUs to obtain new data for all parts of speech.",
        "For example, we linked (Medi-cal_specialties - gynaecology.n) to the Gynaecology Wikipage.",
        "Consequently, we could include the adjective gynaecologic, pointing to the Gynaecology page, into the Medical_specialties frame for sentences like \"Fellowship training in a gynaecologic subspeciality can range from one to four years\".",
        "However, this advantage can also turn into a weakness, because gynaecologist is also redirected to the Gynaecology page, but it belongs to Medical_professionals and should not be included into medical_specialties.",
        "For the 20 (F, I) pairs considered in the given sentences, it was possible also to retrieve 8 lexical units that are not present in FrameNet, for example billy-club for the weapon frame.",
        "Exploiting redirections and anchoring strategies, our induction method can account for orthographical variations, for example it acquires both memorize and memorise.",
        "On the other hand, also misspelled words may be collected, for instance gynaecolo-gial instead of gynaecological."

        "This makes the resource particularly suitable to corpus-based (semi) automatic creation of FrameNet for new languages, because the descriptive part can be preserved and the language-dependent layer can be populated with new instances in other languages (Crespo and Buitelaar, 2008).",

        "Anyhow, the approach can be exploited in principle for every language available in Wikipedia.",
        "Similarly to the data extraction process described in Section 6, we consider for every (F,l) pair in English the linked Wikipedia sense s, in English as well.",

        "So, according to the FrameNet standard, 60 sentences are more than enough to represent the meaning of a lexical unit in a frame.",

        "We report 69% accuracy, which is 9% lower than for English.",

        "Besides, the different quality of the two resources can also depend on the smaller number of users that edit and check the Italian articles.",

        "In the next research step, we plan to carry out an extended evaluation process in order to compute inter-annotator agreement and eventually point out validation problems.",
