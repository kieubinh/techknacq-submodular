        "Data annotated with linguistically interesting labels is used in a wide variety of contexts.",
        "Computational linguists generally use annotated data as training and evaluation material for natural language processing systems; corpus linguists use it to test hypotheses about language; documentary linguists create interlinear glossed texts to preserve examples of endangered languages and hypotheses about the grammars of those languages.",
        "Regardless of the context, creating annotated data is costly in terms of time and/or money.",
        "Since both time and money are undeniably in limited supply, there is a widely shared desire to reduce this cost.",
        "Reducing cost involves strategies that do more with fewer human-annotated labels and/or reduce the per-label cost.",
        "An example of the former is active learning, which focuses annotation effort on data points selected by the learner(s) for their expected utility in developing a more accurate model (Settles, 2009).",
        "Examples of the latter include providing suggestions from a machine labeler and using extremely cheap human labelers, e.g. with the Amazon Mechanical Turk (Snow et al., 2008).",
        "Different techniques may be more or less applicable depending on the language being annotated, the kind of labels which are desired (tags, syntactic structures, etc.",
        "), and the desired use of the annotated data (e.g., for training models, testing linguistic hypotheses, or preserving a language).",
        "This paper discusses experiments that measure the effectiveness of machine-aided annotation for language documentation using both active learning simulation experiments and annotation experiments which involve actual documentary linguists interacting with machine example selection and label suggestion.",
        "Specifically, we deal with the task of labeling morphemes of the Mayan language Uspanteko with fine-grained parts-of-speech.",
        "We also run active learning simulation experiments for part-of-speech tagging for Danish, Dutch, English, Swedish, and Uspanteko to show the validity of our models and methods in a standard setting.",
        "For Uspanteko, we provide results from annotation experiments in which annotation cost is measured in terms of the actual annotation time required while varying three factors: (1) example selection, (2) machine label suggestions, and (3) annotator expertise.",
        "Our findings indicate that there is considerable promise for reducing the cost of producing IGT, but they also demonstrate considerable variation due to the interaction of these factors.",
        "This suggests different prescriptions for appropriate strategies in different contexts.",
        "Most clearly, the worst performing strategy – by far – is that used in nearly all documentary work: sequential annotation without automation.",

        "Finally, we confirm the importance of using actual annotation time to measure annotation cost: a unit-cost assumption – even at a finegrained level – can dramatically misrepresent the actual effectiveness of different strategies."

        "IGT is generally created following transcription and translation of recorded speech, with the annotations often being provided by trained annotators with varying levels of expertise.",
        "The result is generally a small amount of IGT annotated data and a greater amount of unannotated data.",

        "This is often the only option since corpora typically do not retain annotation time, but it is likely to exaggerate the annotation cost reductions achieved.",

        "Baldridge and Osborne (2008) correlate a unit cost in terms of discriminants (decisions made by annotators about valid parses) to annotation time.",
        "This is a better approximation than unit costs where such a relationship cannot be established.",
        "However, it is based on a static measurement of annotation time, and clearly the time taken to annotate an example is not a function of the example alone.",
        "Annotation time is actually dynamic in that it is dependent on how many and what kinds of examples have already been annotated.",
        "An \"informative\" example is likely to take longer to annotate if selected early than it would after the annotator has seen many other examples.",
        "Thus, it is important to measure annotation time embedded in the context of a particular annotation experiment with the sample selection/labeling strategies of interest.",
        "In our annotation experiments, we measure the exact time taken to annotate each example by each annotator and use this as the cost metric, inspired by Ngai and Yarowsky (2000).",

        "One such measure is the percentage error reduction (PER), measured over a discrete set of points on the first 20% of the points on the learning curve (Melville and Mooney, 2004).We use a new related measure, which we call the overall percentage error reduction (OPER), that uses the entire area under the curves given by fitted nonlinear regression models rather than averaging over a subset of data points.",

        "Model parameters were determined with nls in R (Ritz and Streibig, 2008).",
        "With the fitted regression models, it is straightforward to calculate the area under the curve between a start cost Cj and end cost Cj by taking the integral from a to Cj.",

        "The non-expert with rand-ds caught up to and surpassed the unaided expert in about six hours total annotation time, and he caught up to her unc-ns curve after 35 hours.",
        "This is encouraging since often language documentation projects have participants with a wide range of expertise levels, and these results suggest that assistance from machine learning, if done properly, may increase the effectiveness of participants with less language-specific expertise.",
        "We are also encouraged, with respect to the effectiveness of active learning, that the expert's best performance is obtained with uncertainty-based selection.",
        "Within annotator comparisons.",
        "Figure 3 shows both actual measurements and the fitted nonlinear regression curves used to compute OPER.",
        "Figure 3a, the expert without suggestions, exhibits typical active learning behavior similar to that seen in the simulation experiments.",
        "Figure 3b,",
        "Figure 3: Sample measurements and fitted nonlinear regression curves for (a) the expert and (b) the non-expert.",
        "Note that the scale is consistent for comparability.",
        "The dashed vertical lines indicate 12,500 seconds (about 35 hours), which is the upper limit used in computing OPER values for Table 4.",
        "the non-expert with suggestions, shows that in the ds conditions the non-expert was less effective with une.",
        "This is not unexpected: uncertainty selects harder examples that will either take longer to annotate or are easier to get wrong, especially if the annotator trusts the classifier and especially on examples the classifier is uncertain about.",
        "Nonetheless, in all ds cases, the non-expert performs better than with seq-ns.",
        "OPER.",
        "Table 4 provides OPER values from time 0 to 12,500 seconds (about 35 hours), the minimum amount of annotation time logged in any one of the twelve experiments.",
        "The table mixes three types of comparison: (1) the boxed values on the diagonal give OPER for the expert versus the non-expert given the same selection and suggestion conditions; (2) the upper (right) triangle gives OPER for the expert versus herself for different conditions; and (3) the lower (left) triangle is the non-expert versus himself.",
        "For example: (1) the expert obtained an 11.52 OPER versus the non-expert when both used rand-ns; (2) the expert obtained a 10.52 OPER by using rand-ds rather than seq-ns; and (3) the non-expert obtained a 5.93 OPER over rand-ns by using rand-ds.",
        "A number of patterns emerge.",
        "Quite unsurpris-",
        "seq-ns rand-ns unc-ns seq-ds rand-ds unc-ds",
        "Table 4: Overall percentage error reduction (OPER) comparisons, with timing cost.",
        "See explanation of table in the OPER subsection.",
        "ingly, the values on the diagonal show that the expert is more effective than the non-expert in all conditions.",
        "Also, every other condition is more effective than seq-ns for both annotators (first row for the expert, first column for the non-expert), unc-ns and rand-ds are particularly effective for the non-expert, giving OPERs of 19.20 and 18.59 over seq-ns, respectively.",
        "These reductions, bigger than the expert's reductions of 14.17 and 10.52 for the same conditions, considerably reduce the large gap in seq-ns effectiveness between the two annotators (see Figure 2b).",
        "The expert actually gains very little from ds for both rand and une: adding suggestions gave OPERs of just 1.83 and .39, respectively.",
        "In contrast, the non-expert obtains an improvement of 5.93 OPER when suggestions are used with rand, but performs worse when used with une (-9.91 OPER).",
        "Even more striking: the non-expert's unc-ds is worse than rand-ns (-2.62 OPER), a completely model-free setting.",
        "These variations demonstrate the importance of modeling annotator fallibility and sensitivity to cost, as well as characteristics of the annotation task itself, if learner-guided selection and suggestion are to be used (Donmez and Carbonell, 2008; Arora et al., 2009).",
        "Annotator accuracy.",
        "Another factor which must be considered when annotation is done by human annotators (rather than being simulated) is the accuracy of the humans' labels.",
        "Table 5 shows the overall accuracy of the annotators' labels for each condition (after 56 rounds) as measured against the original OKMA annotations.",
        "Unsurprisingly, une selection picks examples that are more difficult to annotate: accuracy for both annotators suffers in both unc-ns and unc-ds.",
        "It may seem surprising that the non-expert's accuracies are generally higher than the expert's.",
        "The main reason for this is that the non-expert took nearly twice as long to annotate his examples, so each one was done with more care.",
        "However, this difference also highlights challenges that arise when we bring active learning into non-simulated annotation contexts.",
        "The typical assumption is that gold standard labeled data represents a true, fixed target, against which annotator or machine-predicted labels should be measured.",
        "In language documentation, though, the analysis of the language is continually evolving, and analysis and annotation each inform the other.",
        "In fact, the expert recognized (in the morphological segmentation) several linguistic phenomena for which the analysis has changed since the original OKMA annotations were done.",
        "As she changed her analyses, her labels diverged from those of the original corpus – another reason for her \"lower\" accuracy.",
        "This is to say that the ground truth of the current OKMA annotations we had to work with can be viewed as one (valid) stage in the iterative reanalysis process that language documentation is.",
        "Error analysis.",
        "Preliminary analysis of 'errors' made by the annotators supports the idea that the results seen in Table 5 are heavily influenced by changes in the expert's analysis of the language.",
        "Some duplicate clause annotation occurred for each annotator, because each of the twelve annotator-selection-suggestion conditions drew from the same global set of unlabeled examples.",
        "This duplication allows us to measure the consistency of each annotator on labeling such duplicate clauses.",
        "Table 6 shows the percentage of morphemes labeled consistently by each annotator.",
        "Numbers for the expert appear in the top (right) triangle, and for the non-expert in the bottom (left) triangle.",
        "Overall intra-annotator consistency is much higher for the expert (88.38%) than for the non-expert (81.64%), suggesting that the expert maintained a more consistent mental model of the language, but one which disagrees in some areas with the original annotations.",
        "Another key error source comes from differences in use of one individual label: the annotators could assign a label that does not appear in the original corpus.",
        "This is yet another issue that does not – in fact, cannot – arise in simulated active learning.",
        "The label ESP was introduced for labeling Spanish loans or insertions (such as the discourse marker entonces) which do not have a clear function in Uspanteko grammar.",
        "Such tokens are inconsistently labeled in the original corpus, usually with catch-all categories like particle or adverb.",
        "The annotators felt that the best analysis was to mark the tokens as of Spanish origin.",
        "The expert annotator used the ESP label for 2086 of 24129 tokens (8.65%) versus 221 of 22819 tokens (0.97%) for the non-expert.",
        "Any such token labeled with ESP is scored as incorrect when compared to the OKMA standard, so this label alone accounts for more than 7% of the expert annotator's total error.",
        "Finally, Table 7 presents inter-annotator agreement measured as percent agreement on morphemes in clauses labeled by both annotators.",
        "Note that in general agreement seems to be lowest for clauses duplicated in une conditions, supporting the expected result that uncertainty-based selection does indeed select clauses that are more difficult for human annotators to label.",

        "Through actual annotation experiments that control for several factors, we have evaluated the potential of incorporating active learning and label suggestions to speed up morpheme glossing in a realistic language documentation context.",
        "Some configurations of learner-guided example selection and machine label suggestions perform far better than the standard strategy of sequential selection without suggestions.",
        "However, the effectiveness of any given strategy depends on annotator expertise.",
        "The impact of differences between annotators directly bears on the point made by Donmez and Carbonell (2008) that if cost reductions are to be reliably obtained with active learning techniques, annotators' fallibility, unreliability, and sensitivity to cost must be modeled.",
        "Our results suggest some possible prescriptions for tuning techniques according to annotator expertise.",
        "However, even if we can estimate a relative level of expertise, following such broad prescriptions is unlikely to be more robust than an approach which adapts selection and suggestion to the individual annotator, perhaps working within an annotation group.",
        "Indeed, it seems that dealing with variation in annotators/oracles may be more important than devising better selection strategies.",
        "The difference in performance due to expertise suggests that using multiple annotators to check relative annotation rate and accuracy of different annotators could be a key ingredient in any actually deployed active learning system.",
        "This could provide for better modeling of individual annotators as part of an annotation group they can be compared against, allowing the system, for example, to throttle active selection if an annotator appears to be too slow or inaccurate.",
        "Another major issue we highlight is the uncertainty around the question of whether active learning works in practical applications.",
        "Respondents to the survey of Tomanek and Olsson (2009) indicated that this uncertainty – will active learning work?",
        "what methods or techniques will work best? – is one of the reasons active learning is not widely used in actual annotation.",
        "In addition, creating the necessary software infrastructure to build an active learning enabled annotation system – a system which must interface robustly between data, annotator, and machine classifier, yet still be easy to use – is a substantial hurdle.",
        "It seems unlikely that there will be much uptake until a) consistent, large cost reductions can be shown in actual annotation studies, and b) appropriate, tunable, widely-available software exists."
