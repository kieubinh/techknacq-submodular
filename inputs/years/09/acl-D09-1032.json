        "The most commonly used evaluation method for summarization during system development and for reporting results in publications is the automatic evaluation metric ROUGE (Lin, 2004; Lin and Hovy, 2003).",
        "ROUGE compares system summaries against one or more model summaries by computing n-gram word overlaps between the two.",
        "The wide adoption of such automatic measures is understandable because they are convenient and greatly reduce the complexity of evaluations.",
        "ROUGE scores also correlate well with manual evaluations of content based on comparison with a single model summary, as used in the early editions of the Document Understanding Conferences (Over et al., 2007).",
        "In our work, we take the idea of automatic evaluation to an extreme and explore the feasibility of developing a fully automatic evaluation method for content selection that does not make use of human model summaries at all.",
        "To this end, we show that evaluating summaries by comparing them with the input obtains good correlations with manual evaluations for both query focused and update summarization tasks.",
        "Our results have important implications for future development of summarization systems and their evaluation.",
        "High correlations between system ranking produced with the fully automatic method and manual evaluations show that the new evaluation measures can be used during system development when human model summaries are not available.",
        "Our results provide validation of several features that can be optimized in the development of new summarization systems when the objective is to improve content selection on average, over a collection of test inputs.",
        "However, none of the features is consistently predictive of good summary content for individual inputs.",
        "We find that content selection performance on standard test collections can be approximated well by the proposed fully automatic method.",
        "This result greatly underlines the need to require linguistic quality evaluations alongside content selection ones in future evaluations and research."

        "Our best features can therefore be used to evaluate the content selection performance of systems in a new domain where model summaries are unavailable.",
        "However, like all other content evaluation metrics, our features must be accompanied by judgements of linguistic quality to obtain wholesome indicators of summary quality and system performance.",

        "Observations from our input-based evaluation also have important implications for the design of novel summarization tasks.",
        "We find that high correlations with manual evaluations are obtained by comparing query-focused summaries with the entire input and making no use of the query at all.",
        "Similarly in the update summarization task, the best predictions of content for update summaries were obtained using only the update input.",
        "The uncertain role of background inputs and queries expose possible problems with the task designs.",
