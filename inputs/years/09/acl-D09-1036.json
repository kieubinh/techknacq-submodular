        "One focus in the study of discourse is to identify and label the relations between textual units (clauses, sentences, or paragraphs).",
        "Such research can enable downstream natural language processing (NLP) such as summarization, question answering, and textual entailment.",
        "For example, recognizing causal relations can assist in answering why questions.",
        "Detecting contrast and restatements is useful for paraphrasing and summarization systems.",
        "While different discourse frameworks have been proposed from different perspectives (Mann and Thompson, 1988; Hobbs, 1990; Lascarides and Asher, 1993; Knott and Sanders, 1998; Webber, 2004), most admit these basic types of discourse relationships between textual units.",
        "When there is a discourse connective (e.g., because) between two text spans, it is often easy to recognize the relation between the spans, as most connectives are unambiguous (Miltsakaki et al., 2005; Pitler et al., 2008).",
        "On the other hand, it is difficult to recognize the discourse relations when there are no explicit textual cues.",
        "We term these cases explicit and implicit relations, respectively.",
        "While the recognition of discourse structure has been studied in the context of explicit relations (Marcu, 1998) in the past, little published work has yet attempted to recognize implicit discourse relations between text spans.",
        "Detecting implicit relations is a critical step in forming a discourse understanding of text, as many text spans do not mark their discourse relations with explicit cues.",
        "Recently, the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) has been released, which features discourse level annotation on both explicit and implicit relations.",
        "It provides a valuable linguistic resource towards understanding discourse relations and a common platform for researchers to develop discourse-centric systems.",
        "With the recent release of the second version of this corpus (Prasad et al., 2008), which provides a cleaner and more thorough implicit relation annotation, there is an opportunity to address this area of work.",
        "In this paper, we provide classification of implicit discourse relations on the second version of the PDTB.",
        "The features we used include contextual modeling of relation dependencies, features extracted from constituent parse trees and dependency parse trees, and word pair features.",
        "We show an accuracy of 40.2%, which is a significant improvement of 14.1% over the majority baseline.",
        "After reviewing related work, we first give an overview of the Penn Discourse Treebank.",
        "We then describe our classification methodology, followed by experimental results.",

        "In addition, the data set of (Pitler et al., 2009) includes EntRel and Alt Lex, which are relations in which an implicit connective cannot be inserted between adjacent sentences, whereas ours excludes EntRel and AltLex.",
        "6 Discussion: Why are implicit discourse relations difficult to recognize?",
        "In the above experiments, we have shown that by using the four feature classes, we are able to increase the classification accuracy from 26.1% of the majority baseline to 40.2%.",
        "Although we feel a 14.1 absolute percentage improvement is a solid result, an accuracy of 40% does not allow downstream NLP applications to trust the output of such a classification system.",
        "To understand the difficulties of the task more deeply, we analyzed individual training and validation data pairs, from which we were able to generalize four challenges to automated implicit discourse relation recognition.",
        "We hope that this discussion may motivate future work on implicit discourse relation recognition.",
        "Ambiguity.",
        "There is ambiguity among the relations.",
        "For example, we notice that a lot of Contrast relations are mistakenly classified as Conjunction.",
        "When we analyzed these relations, we observed that Contrast and Conjunction in the PDTB annotation are very similar to each other in terms of words, syntax, and semantics, as Examples 5 and 6 show.",
        "In both examples, the same antonymous verb pair is used (fell and rose), different subjects are mentioned in Argl and Arg2 (net and revenue in the first example, and net and sales in the second), and these subjects are all compared to like items from the previous year.",
        "Moreover, the implicit discourse connective given by the annotators is while in both cases, which is an ambiguous connective as shown in (Miltsakaki et al., 2005).",
        "(5) Argl: In the third quarter, AMR said, net fell to $137 million, or $2.16 a share, from $150.3 million, or $2.50 a share.",
        "Arg2: [while] Revenue rose 17% to $2.73 billion from $2.33 billion a year earlier.",
        "(6) Argl: Dow's third-quarter net fell to $589 million, or $3.29 a share, from $632 million, or $3.36 a share, a year ago.",
        "Arg2: [while] Sales in the latest quarter rose 2% to $4.25 billion from $4.15 billion a year earlier.",
        "Relation ambiguity may be ameliorated if an instance is analyzed in context.",
        "However, according to the PDTB annotation guidelines, if the annotators could not disambiguate between two relation types, or if they felt both equally reflect their understanding of the relation between the arguments, they could annotate two types to the relation.",
        "In the whole PDTB corpus, about 5.4% of the explicit relations and 2.2% of the implicit relations are annotated with two relation types.",
        "Example 7 is such a case where the implicit connective meanwhile may be interpreted as expressing a Conjunction or Contrast relation.",
        "(7) Argl: Sales surged 40% to 250.17 billion yen from 178.61 billion.",
        "Arg2: [meanwhile] Net income rose 11% to 29.62 billion yen from 26.68 billion.",
        "Inference.",
        "Sometimes inference and a knowledge base are required to resolve the relation type.",
        "In Example 8, to understand that Arg2 is a restatement of Argl, we need a semantic mechanism to show that either the semantics of Argl infers that of Arg2 or the other way around.",
        "In the below example, / had calls all night long infers / was woken up every hour semantically, as shown in: receive-call(I) A duration(alLnight) => wokenjup(I) A duration(everyJiour).",
        "(8) Argl: \"I had calls all night long from the",
        "States,\" he said.",
        "In fact, most relation types can be represented using formal semantics (PDTB-Group, 2007), as shown in Table 7, where |-Arc/11 and | Arg2\\ represent the semantics extracted from Argl and Arg2, respectively.",
        "This kind of formal semantic reasoning requires a robust knowledge base, which is still beyond our current technology.",
        "still are working, Boeing said.",
        "Table 7: Some examples of relation types with their semantic representations, as taken from (PDTB-Group, 2007).",
        "Context.",
        "PDTB annotators adopted the Minimality Principle in argument selection, according to which they only included in the argument the minimal span of text that is sufficient for the interpretation of the relation.",
        "While the context is not necessary to interpret the relation, it is usually necessary to understand the meaning of the arguments.",
        "Without an analysis of the context, Argl and Arg2 may seem unconnected, as the following example shows, where the meaning of Argl is mostly derived from its previous context (i.e., West German... technical reactions).",
        "(9) Prev.",
        "Context: West German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann said, \"In my view, the stock market will stabilize relatively quickly.",
        "There may be one or other psychological or technical reactions, Argl: but they aren't based on fundamentals.",
        "Arg2: [in short] The economy of West Germany and the EC European Community is highly stable.\"",
        "Sometimes the range of the context may easily extend to the whole text, which would require a system to possess a robust context modeling mechanism.",
        "In Example 10, in order to realize the causal relation between Arg2 and Argl, we possibly need to read the whole article and understand what was happening: the machinist union was having a strike and the strike prevented most of its union members from working.",
        "Arg2: [because] Under Kansas right-to-work laws, contracts cannot require workers to be union members.",
        "World Knowledge.",
        "Sometimes even context modeling is not enough.",
        "We may also need world knowledge to understand the arguments and hence to interpret the relation.",
        "In the following example, from the previous sentence of Argl, it is reported that \"the Senate voted to send a delegation of congressional staffers to Poland to assist its legislature\", and this delegation is viewed as a \"gift\" in Argl.",
        "It is suggested in Arg2 that the Poles might view the delegation as a \"Trojan Horse\".",
        "Here we need world knowledge to understand that \"Trojan Horse\" is usually applied as a metaphor for a person or thing that appears innocent but has harmful intent, and hence understand that Arg2 poses a contrasting view of the delegation as Argl does.",
        "(11) Argl: Senator Pete Domenici calls this effort \"the first gift of democracy\".",
        "Arg2: [but] The Poles might do better to view it as a Trojan Horse.",
        "These four classes of difficulties - ambiguity between relations, inference, contextual modeling, and world knowledge - show that implicit discourse relation classification needs deeper semantic representations, more robust system design, and access to more external knowledge.",
        "These obstacles may not be restricted to recognizing implicit relations, but are also applicable to other related discourse-centric tasks."
