      "text": [
        "Many recent advances in statistical machine translation (SMT) are a result of the incorporation of syntactic knowledge into the translation process (Marcu et al., 2006; Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006).",
        "This has been facilitated by the use of synchronous grammars to model translation as a generative process over pairs of strings in two languages.",
        "Such models are particularly attractive for translating between languages with divergent word orders, such as Chinese and English, where syntax-inspired translation rules can succinctly describe the requisite reordering operations.",
        "In contrast, standard phrase-based models (Koehn et al., 2003) assume a mostly monotone mapping between source and target, and therefore cannot adequately model these phenomena.",
        "Currently the most successful paradigm for the use of synchronous grammars in translation is that of string-to-tree transduction (Galley et al., 2004; Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006; Galley et al., 2006; Marcu et al., 2006).",
        "In this case a grammar is extracted from a parallel corpus, with strings on its source side and syntax trees on its target side, which is then used to translate novel sentences by performing inference over the space of target syntax trees licensed by the grammar.",
        "To date grammar-based translation models have relied on heuristics to extract a grammar from a word-aligned parallel corpus.",
        "These heuristics are extensions of those developed for phrase-based models (Koehn et al., 2003), and involve symmetrising two directional word alignments followed by a projection step which uses the alignments to find a mapping between source words and nodes in the target parse trees (Galley et al., 2004).",
        "However, such approaches leave much to be desired.",
        "Word-alignments rarely factorise cleanly with parse trees (i.e., alignment points cross constituent structures), resulting in large and implausible translation rules which generalise poorly to unseen data (Fossum et al., 2008).",
        "The principal reason for employing a grammar based formalism is to induce rules which capture long-range reorderings between source and target.",
        "However if the grammar itself is extracted using word-alignments induced with models that are unable to capture such reorderings, it is unlikely that the grammar will live up to expectations.",
        "In this work we draw on recent advances in Bayesian modelling of grammar induction (lohn-son et al., 2007; Cohn et al., 2009) to propose a non-parametric model of synchronous tree substitution grammar (STSG), continuing a recent trend in SMT to seek principled probabilistic formulations for heuristic translation models (Zhang et al., 2008; DeNero et al., 2008; Blunsom et al., 2009b; Blunsom et al., 2009a).",
        "This model leverages a hierarchical Bayesian prior to induce a compact translation grammar directly from a parsed parallel corpus, unconstrained by word-alignments.",

      "text": [
        "Current tree-to-string translation models are a form of Synchronous Tree Substitution Grammar (STSG; Eisner (2003)).",
        "Formally, a STSG is a 5-tuple, G = (T,T',N,S,R), where T and V are sets of terminal symbols in the target and source languages respectively, N is a set of nonterminal symbols, S e N is the distinguished root non-terminal and R is a set of productions (a.k.a.",
        "rules).",
        "Each production is a tuple comprising an elementary tree and a string, the former referring to a tree fragment of depth > 1 where each internal node is labelled with a non-terminal and each leaf is labelled with either a terminal or a non-terminal.",
        "The string part of the rule describes the lexical component of the rule in the source language and includes a special variable for each frontier non-terminal in the elementary tree.",
        "These variables describe the reordering and form the recursion sites in the generative process of creating tree and string pairs with the grammar.",
        "For example, the rule rewrites a noun-phrase (NP) as a NP and prepositional phrase (PP) headed by 'of in the target language.",
        "The rule generates the token 't£j' in the source and reverses the order of the two child noun-phrases, indicated by the numbering of the variables in the string part.",
        "A derivation creates a (tree, string) pair by starting with the root non-terminal and an empty string, then choosing a rule to rewrite (substitute) the nonterminal and expand the string.",
        "This process repeats by rewriting all frontier non-terminals until there are none remaining.",
        "A Probabilistic STSG assigns a probability to each rule in the grammar.",
        "The probability of a derivation is the product of the probabilities of its component rules, and the probability of a (tree, string) pair is the sum of the probabilities over all its derivations.",
        "Grammar based SMT models almost exclusively follow the same two-stage approach to grammar induction developed for phrase-based methods (Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "In this approach they induce a finite-state grammar with phrase-pairs as rules by taking a sentence aligned parallel corpus and 1) predicting word alignments before 2) extracting transduction rules that are 'consistent' with the word aligned data.",
        "Although empirically effective, this two stage approach is less than ideal due to the disconnect between the word-based models used for alignment and the phrase-based translation model.",
        "This is problematic as the word-based model cannot recognise phrase-based phenomena.",
        "Moreover, it raises the problem of identifying and weighting the rules from the word alignment.",
        "The same criticisms levied at the phrase-based models apply equally to the two-stage technique used for synchronous grammar induction (Galley et al., 2004; Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006; Galley et al., 2006; Marcu et al., 2006).",
        "Namely that the word alignment models typically do not use any syntax and therefore will not be able to model, e.g., consistent syntactic reordering effects, or the impact of the syntactic category on phrase translations.",
        "The identification and estimation of grammar rules from word aligned data is also non-trivial.",
        "Galley et al.",
        "(2004) describe an algorithm for inducing a string-to-tree grammar using a parallel corpus with syntax trees on target side.",
        "Their method projects the source strings onto nodes of the target tree using the word alignment, and then extracts the minimal transduction rules as well as rules composed of adjacent minimal units.",
        "The production weights are estimated either by heuristic counting (Koehn et al., 2003) or using the EM algorithm.",
        "Both estimation techniques are flawed.",
        "The heuristic method is inconsistent in the limit (lohnson, 2002) while EM is degenerate, placing disproportionate probability mass on the largest rules in order to describe the data with as few a rules as possible (DeNero et al., 2006).",
        "With no limit on rule size this method will learn a single rule for every training instance, and therefore will not generalise to unseen sentences.",
        "These problems can be ameliorated by imposing limits on rule size or early stopping of EM training, however neither of these techniques addresses the underlying problems.",
        "In contrast, our model is trained in a single step, i.e., the alignment model is the translation model.",
        "This allows syntax to directly inform the alignments.",
        "We infer a grammar without resorting to word alignment constraints or limits on rule size.",
        "The model uses a prior to bias towards a compact grammar with small rules, thus solving the degeneracy problem."

        "Our training data comprises parallel target trees and source strings and our aim is to induce a STSG that best describes this data.",
        "This is achieved by inferring a distribution over the derivations for each training instance, where the set of derivations collectively specify the grammar.",
        "In the following, we denote the source trees as t, target strings s, and derivations r which are sequences of grammar rules, r.",
        "As described in section 2.1, previous methods for estimating a STSG have suffered from degeneracy.",
        "A principled way to correct for such degenerated behaviour is to use a prior over rules which biases towards small rules.",
        "This matches our intuition: we expect good translation rules to be small, with few internal nodes, frontier non-terminals and terminal strings.",
        "However, we recognise that on occasion larger rules will be necessary; we allow such rules when there is sufficient support in the data.",
        "We model the grammar as a set of distributions, Gc, over the productions for each non-terminal symbol, c. We adopt a non-parametric Bayesian approach by treating each Gc as a random variable with a Dirichlet process (DP) prior, where Po(-\\c) (the base distribution) is a distribution over the infinite space of trees rooted with c, and ac (the concentration parameter) controls the model's tendency towards either reusing existing rules or creating novel ones as each training instance is encountered (and consequently, the tendency to infer larger or smaller grammars).",
        "We discuss the base distribution in more detail below.",
        "Rather than representing the distribution Gc explicitly, we integrate over all possible values of Gc.",
        "This leads to the following predictive distribution for the rule ri given the previously observed rules where n~% is the number number of times r% has been used to rewrite c in r~\\ and n~% = J2r R(r)=cnr% ls the total count of rewriting c (here R(r) is the root non-terminal of r).",
        "The distribution is exchangeable, meaning that all permutations of the input sequence are assigned the same probability.",
        "This allows us to treat any item as being the last, which is fundamental for efficient Gibbs sampling.",
        "Henceforth we adopt the notation r~ and n~ to refer to the rules and counts for the whole data set excluding the current rules under consideration, irrespective of their location in the corpus.",
        "The base distribution, Pq, assigns a prior probability to an infinite number of rules, where each rule is an (elementary tree, source string) pair denoted r = (e, w).",
        "While there are a myriad of possible distributions, we developed a very simple one.",
        "We decompose the probability into two factors, the probability of the target elementary tree and the probability of the source string, where c = R(r).",
        "The tree probability, P(e\\c) in (3), is modelled using generative process whereby the root category c is expanded into a sequence of child nonterminals, then each of these are either expanded or left as-is.",
        "This process continues until there are no unprocessed children.",
        "The number of child nodes for each expansion is drawn from a geometric prior with parameter pcniid> except in the case of pre-terminals where the number of children is always one.",
        "The binary expansion decisions are drawn from a Bernoulli prior with parameter Pexpand> and non-terminals and terminals are drawn uniformly from N and T respectively.",
        "For example, the source side of rule (1) was generated as follows: 1) the NP was rewritten as two children; 2) an NP; and 4) a PP; 5) the NP child was not expanded; 6) the PP child was expanded; 7) as an IN; and 8) a NP; 9) the IN was expanded to the terminal 'of ; and 10) the final NP was not expanded.",
        "Each of these steps is a draw from the relevant distribution, and the total probability is the product of the probabilities for each step.",

        "Each node is annotated with their span in the target string (aligned nodes are shaded).",
        "The dotted edges show the implied alignments.",
        "Preterminals are displayed with their child terminal in the leaf nodes.",
        "The second factor in (3) is P(w|e), the probability of the source string (a sequence of source terminals and variables).",
        "We assume that the elementary tree is generated first, and condition the string probability on I = F(e), its number of frontier nodes (i.e., variables).",
        "The string is then created by choosing a number of terminals from a geometric prior with parameter pterm then drawing each terminal from a uniform distribution over T. Finally each of the I variables are inserted into the string one at a time using a uniform distribution over the possible placements.",
        "For the example rule in (1) the generative process corresponds to 1) deciding to create one terminal; 2) with value Ö^J; 3) inserting the first variable after the terminal; and 4) inserting the second variable before the terminal.",
        "Again, the probability of the string is simply the product of the probabilities for each step.",
        "Together both the factors in the base distribution penalise large trees with many nodes and long strings with many terminals and variables.",

        "In order to test the translation performance of the grammars induced by our model and the GHKM method we report bleu (Papineni et al., 2002) scores on sentences of up to twenty words in length from the MT03 NIST evaluation.",
        "We built a synchronous beam search decoder to find the maximum scoring derivation, based on the CYK+ chart parsing algorithm and the cube-pruning method of Chiang (2007).",
        "Parse edges for all constituents spanning a given chart cell were cube-pruned together using a beam of width 1000, and only edges from the top ten constituents in each cell were retained.",
        "No artificial glue-rules or rule span limits were employed.",
        "The parameters of the translation system were trained to maximize Bleu on the MT02 test set (Och, 2003).",
        "Decoding took roughly 10s per sentence for both grammars, using a 8-core 2.6Ghz Intel Xeon machine.",
        "Table 6 shows the Bleu scores for the baseline using the GHKM rule induction algorithm, and our non-parametric Bayesian grammar induction method.",
        "We see a small increase in generalisation performance from our model.",
        "Our previous analysis (Section 5.1) of the grammars produced by the two approaches showed our method produced better lexicalised rules than those induced by the GHKM algorithm.",
        "Galley et al.",
        "(2006) noted that the GHKM algorithm often over generalised and proposed combining minimal rules to form composed rules as a solution.",
        "Although composing rules was effective at improving bleu scores, the result was a massive expansion in the size of the grammar.",
        "By learning the appropriate level of lexicalisation we believe that our inference algorithm is having a similar effect as composing rules (Galley et al., 2006), however the resulting grammar remains compact, a significant advantage of our approach."

        "In this paper we have presented a method for inducing a tree-to-string grammar which removes the need for various heuristics and constraints from models of word alignment.",
        "Instead the model is capable of directly inferring a grammar in one step, using the syntactic fragments that it has learnt to better align the source and target data.",
        "Using a prior which favours sparse distributions and simpler rules, we demonstrate that the model finds a more parsimonious grammar than the heuristic technique.",
        "Moreover, this grammar results in improved translations on a standard evaluation set.",
        "We expect that various extensions to the model would improve its performance.",
        "One avenue is to develop a more sophisticated prior over rules, e.g., one that recognises common types of rule via the shape of the tree and ordering pattern in the target.",
        "A second avenue is to develop better means of inference under the grammar, in order to ensure faster mixing and a means to escape from local optima.",
        "Finally, we wish to develop a method for decoding under the full Bayesian model, instead of the current beam search.",
        "With these extensions we expect that our model of grammar induction has the potential to greatly improve translation output."
