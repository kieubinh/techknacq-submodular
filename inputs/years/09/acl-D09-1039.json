        "The Data-Oriented Translation (DOT) (Poutsma, 2000) model is a tree-structured translation model, in which linked subtree fragments extracted from a parsed bitext are composed to cover a source-language sentence to be translated.",
        "Each linked fragment pair consists of a source-language side and a target-language side, similar to (Wu, 1997).",
        "Translating a new sentence involves composing the linked fragments into derivations so that a new source-language sentence is covered by the source tree fragments of the linked pairs, where the yields of the target-side derivations are the candidate translations.",
        "Derivations are scored according to their likelihood, and the translation is selected from the derivation pair with the highest score.",
        "However, we have no reason to believe that maximizing likelihood is the best way to maximize translation accuracy - likelihood and accuracy do not necessarily correlate well.",
        "We can frame the problem as a search problem, where we are searching a space of derivations for the one that yields the highest scoring translation.",
        "By putting weights on the derivations in the search space, we wish to point the decoder in the direction of the optimal translation.",
        "Since we want the decoder to find the translation with the highest evaluation score, we would want to score the derivations with weights that correlate well with the particular evaluation measure in mind.",
        "Much of the work in the MT literature has focused on the scoring of translation decisions made.",
        "(Yamada and Knight, 2001) follow (Brown et al., 1993) in using the noisy channel model, by decomposing the translation decisions modeled by the translation model into different types, and inducing probability distributions via maximum likelihood estimation over each decision type.",
        "This model is then decoded as described in (Yamada and Knight, 2002).",
        "This type of approach is also followed in (Galley et al., 2006).",
        "There has been some previous work on accuracy-driven training techniques for SMT, such as MERT (Och, 2003) and the Simplex Armijo Downhill method (Zhao and Chen, 2009), which tune the parameters in a linear combination of various phrase scores according to a held-out tuning set.",
        "While this does tune the relative weights of the scores to maximize the accuracy of candidates in the tuning set, the scores themselves in the linear combination are not necessarily correlated with the accuracy of the translation.",
        "Tillmann and Zhang (2006) present a procedure to directly optimize the global scoring function used by a phrase-based decoder on the accuracy of the translations.",
        "Similarly to MERT, Tillmann and Zhang estimate the parameters of a weight vector on a linear combination of (binary) features using a global objective function correlated with BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002).",

        "As described in previous work (Poutsma, 2000; Hearne and Way, 2003), DOT scores translations according to the probabilities of the derivations, which are in turn computed from the relative frequencies of linked tree fragments in a parallel treebank.",
        "Linked fragment pairs are conditionally independent, so the score of a derivation is the product of the probabilities of all the linked fragments used.",
        "To find the probability of a translation, DOT marginalizes over the scores of all derivations yielding the translation.",
        "From a parallel treebank aligned at the sub-sentential level, we extract all possible linked fragment pairs by first selecting all linked pairs of nodes in the treebank to be the roots of a new subtree pair, and then selecting a (possibly empty) set of linked node pairs that are descendants of the newly selected fragment roots and deleting all subtree pairs dominated by these nodes.",
        "Leaves of fragments can either be terminals, or non-terminal frontier nodes where we can compose other fragments (cf. (Eisner, 2003)).",
        "We give example DOT fragment pairs in Figure 1.",
        "Given two subtree pairs (si,t\\) and («2,£2), we can compose them using the DOT composition operator o if the leftmost non-terminal frontier node of si is equal to the root node of S2, and the leftmost non-terminal frontier node of S\\'s linked counterpart in t\\ is equal to the root node of t2- The resulting tree pair consists of a copy of s i where S2 has been inserted at the leftmost frontier node, and a copy of t\\ where £2 has been inserted at the node linked to s\\'s leftmost frontier node (Hearne and Way, 2003).",
        "In Figure 1, fragment pair (a) is a fragment with two open substitution sites.",
        "If we compose this fragment pair with fragment pair (b), the source side composition must take place on the leftmost non-terminal frontier node (the leftmost NP).",
        "On the target side we compose on the frontier linked to the leftmost source side non-terminal frontier.",
        "The result is fragment pair (c).",
        "If we now compose the resulting fragment pair with fragment pair (d), we obtain a fragment pair with no open substitution sites whose source-side yield is John likes Mary and whose target-side yield is Mary plaît à John.",
        "Note that there are two different derivations using the fragment pairs in Figure 1 that result in the same fragment pair, namely (a) o (b) o (d), and (c) o (d).",
        "For a given linked fragment pair (ds,dt), the probability assigned to it is where \\(ds,dt)\\ is the number of times the fragment pair (ds, dt) is found in the bitext, and r(d) is the root nonterminal of d. Essentially, the probability assigned to the fragment pair is the relative frequency of the fragment pair to the pair of nonterminals that root the fragments.",
        "Then, with the assumption that DOT fragments are conditionally independent, the probability of a derivation is",
        "In the original DOT formulation, DOT disambiguated translations according to their probabilities.",
        "Since a translation can have many possible derivations, to obtain the probability of a translation it is necessary to marginalize over the distinct derivations yielding a translation.",
        "The probability of a translation wt of a source sentence ws, is and the translation is chosen so as to maximize (4):",
        "Hearne and Way (2006) examined alternative disambiguation strategies.",
        "They found that rather than disambiguating on the translation probability, the translation quality would improve by disambiguating on the derivation probability, as in (5):",
        "Wt = argmaxP(d)",
        "Our analysis suggest that this is because many derivations with very low probabilities generate the same, poor translation.",
        "When applying Equation (3) to marginalize over those derivations, the resulting score is higher for the poor translation than a better translation with fewer derivations but where the derivations had higher likelihood.",
        "Using the DOT model directly is difficult the number of fragments extracted from a parallel treebank is exponential in the size of the treebank.",
        "Therefore we use the Goodman reduction of DOT (Hearne, 2005) to create an isomorphic PCFG representation of the DOT model that is linear in the size of the treebank.",
        "The idea behind the Goodman reduction is that rather than storing fragments in the grammar and translating via composition, we simultaneously build up the fragments using the PCFG reduction and compose them together.",
        "To perform the reduction, we first relabel the two linked nodes (X, Y) with the new label X=Y.",
        "We then label each node in the parallel treebank with a unique Goodman index.",
        "Each binary-branching node and its two children can be internal or root/frontier.",
        "We add rules to the grammar reflecting the role that each node can take, keeping unaligned nodes as fragment-internal nodes.",
        "So in the case where a node and both of its children are aligned, we commit 8 rules into the grammar, as follows:",
        "A category label which ends in a '+' symbol followed by a Goodman index is fragment-internal and all other nodes are either fragment roots or",
        "likes Mary",
        "J I N=NB Mary frontier nodes.",
        "A fragment pair, then, is a pair of subtrees in which the root does not have an index, all internal nodes have indices, and all the leaves are either terminals or un-indexed nodes.",
        "We give an example Goodman reduction in Figure 2.",
        "While we store the source grammar and the target grammar separately, we also keep track of the correspondence between source and target Goodman indices and can easily identify the alignments according to the Goodman indices.",
        "Probabilities for the PCFG rules are computed monolingually as in the standard Goodman reduction for DOP (Goodman, 1996).",
        "In decoding with the Goodman reduction, we first find the «-best parses on the source side, and for each source fragment, we construct the £-best fragments on the target side.",
        "We finally compute the bilingual derivation probabilities by multiplying the source and target derivation probabilities by the target fragment relative frequencies conditioned on the source fragment.",
        "There are a few problems with a likelihood-based scoring scheme.",
        "First, it is not clear that if a fragment is more likely to be seen in training data then it is more likely to be used in a correct translation of an unseen sentence.",
        "In our analysis of the candidate translations of the DOT system, we observed that frequently, the highest-likelihood candidate translation output by the system was not the highest-accuracy candidate inferred.",

        "In this work, we only consider f\\(d), an accuracy-based score, although in future work we will consider a wide variety of features in the scoring function, including combinations of the different scoring schemes described below, binary lexical features, binary source-side syntactic features, and local target side features.",
        "The score of a derivation is now given by (8):",
        "In order to disambiguate between candidate translations, we follow (Hearne and Way, 2006) by using Equation (5).",
        "In all our approaches, we rescore fragments according to their contribution to the accuracy of a translation.",
        "We would like to give fragments that contribute to good translations relatively high scores, and give fragments that contribute to bad translations relatively low scores, so that during decoding fragments that are known to contribute to good translations would be chosen over those that are known to contribute to bad translations.",
        "Furthermore, we would like to score each fragment in a derivation independently, since bad translations may contain good fragments, and vice-versa.",
        "In practice, it is infeasible to rescore only those fragments seen during the rescoring process, due to the Goodman reduction for DOT.",
        "If we were to properly rescore each fragment, a new rule would need to be added to the grammar for each rule appearing in the fragment.",
        "Since the number of fragments is exponential, this would lead to a substantial increase in grammar size.",
        "Instead, we rescore the individual rules in the fragments, by evenly dividing the total amount of scoring mass among the rules of the particular fragment, and then assigning them the average of the rule scores over all fragments in which they appear.",
        "That is for each rule r in a fragment / consisting of c/ (r) rules with score ö(f), the score of the rule is given as:",
        "This has the further advantage that we are allowing fragments that were unseen during tuning to be rescored according to previously seen fragment substructures.",
        "To implement this scheme, we select a set of oracle translations for each sentence in the tuning data by evaluating all the candidate translations against the gold standard translation using the F-score (Turian et al., 2003), and selecting those with the highest Fi-measure, with exponent 1.",
        "We use GTM, rather than BLEU, because BLEU is not known to work well on a per-sentence level (Lavie et al., 2004) as needed for oracle selection.",
        "We then compare all the target-side fragments inferred in the translation process for each candidate translation against the fragments that yielded the oracles.",
        "There are two relevant parts of the fragments - the internal yields (i.e. the terminal leaves of the fragment) and the substitution sites (i.e. the frontiers where other fragments attach).",

        "To compare these trees using our distance metric, we first compute the first argument of the min function in Equation (10), directly comparing the structure of each immediate subtree.",
        "We then compute the second argument, obtaining the cost of performing an inversion, and finally compute the remaining arguments, assessing the cost of allowing each tree to be a direct subtree of the other.",
        "The result of this computation is 1, representing the inversion operation required to transform tree (a) into tree (b).",
        "If we compare trees (a) and (c) in Figure 3, we obtain a value of 2, given that the minimum operations required to transform tree (a) into tree (c) are inserting an additional subtree at the top level and then substituting the subtree rooted by C for the subtree rooted by F. If we compare tree (b) with tree (c) then the distance is 3, since we are now required to also replace the subtree rooted by C by the one rooted by B.",
        "Since it is not efficient to compute the differences directly, we utilize common substructures and derive a dynamic programming implementation of the recursion.",
        "We compare each fragment against the set of oracle fragments for the same source span, and select the lowest cost as the score, assigning the candidate the negative difference be-",
        "In the structured fragment rescoring scheme, the scores that the fragments are assigned are the un-normalized edit distances between the two fragments.",
        "It may be better to normalize the fragment scores, rather than using the minimum number of tree transformations to convert one fragment into the other.",
        "We would expect that when comparing larger fragments, on average there would be more transformations needed to change one into the other than when comparing small fragments.",
        "However in the previous scheme, small fragments would have higher scores than large fragments, since fewer differences would be observed.",
        "The normalized score is given in (13):",
        "Essentially, we are normalizing the edit distance by the maximum edit distance possible, namely the size of the largest fragment of the two being compared.",

        "We note that the BLEU scores for both the baseline and the experiments are low.",
        "This is to be expected, because the grammar is extracted from a very small bitext especially when the heterogeneity of the Europarl corpus is considered.",
        "In our analysis, only 32.5 percent of the test sentences had a complete source-side parse, meaning that a lot of structural information is lost contributing to arbitrary target-side ordering.",
        "In these experiments we did not use an additional language model.",
        "DOT (and many other syntax-based SMT systems) essentially have the target language model encoded within the translation model, since the inferences derived during translations link source structures to target structures, so in principle, no additional language model should be necessary.",
        "Furthermore, we only evaluate against a single reference, which also contributes to the lowering of absolute scores.",
        "To provide a sanity check against a state-of-the-art system, we trained the Moses phrase-based MT system (Koehn et al., 2007) using our training corpus, using no language model and using uniform feature weights, to provide a fair comparison against our baseline.",
        "We used this system to decode our development test set, and as a result we obtained a BLEU score of 10.72, which is comparable to the score obtained by our baseline on the same set.",
        "When we scale up to tuning on 40,000 sentences we see an improvement in BLEU scores as well, as shown in Table 3.",
        "When tuning on 40K sentences, we observe an increase of 1.81 BLEU points on the best-performing system, which is a 20.6% improvement over the baseline.",
        "We note that rescoring on 20K sentences rescores approximately 275,000 rules out of 655,000 in the grammar, whereas rescoring on 40K sentences rescores approximately 280,000.",
        "To analyze the benefits of the rescored grammar, we set aside a separate development set that we decoded with the grammar trained on 40K sentences.",
        "The results are presented in Table 4.",
        "The analysis is presented in Section 6.",
        "Interestingly, there is a large difference between the normalized and unnormalized versions of the SFR scoring scheme.",
        "Our analysis suggests that the differences are mostly due to numerical issues, namely the difference in magnitude between the NSFR scores and the likelihood scores in the linear combination, and the default value assigned when the NSFR score was zero.",
        "In ongoing work, we are working to address these issues.",
        "For most configurations the difference between SFR and FSR was not statistically significant at p = 0.05.",
        "Our analysis indicated that surface differences tended to co-occur with structural differences.",
        "We hypothesize that as we scale up to larger and more ambiguous grammars, the system will infer more derivations with the same yields, rendering a larger difference between the quality of the two scoring mechanisms."

        "The results presented above indicate that augmenting the scoring mechanism with an accuracy-based measure is a promising direction for translation quality improvement.",
        "It gives us a statistically significant improvement over the baseline, and our analysis has indicated that the system is indeed making better decisions, moving us a step closer towards the goal of making translation decisions based on the hypothesis of the resulting translation's accuracy.",
        "Now that we have demonstrated that translation quality can be improved by incorporating a measure of fragment quality into the scoring scheme, our immediate next step is to optimize our system so that we can scale up to significantly larger training and tuning sets, and determine whether the improvements we have noted carry over when the likelihood is computed from more data.",
        "Afterwards, we will implement a training scheme to maximize an accuracy-based objective function, for instance, by minimizing the difference between the scores of the highest-scoring derivation and the oracle derivations, in effect maximizing the score of the highest-scoring translation.",
        "The rescoring method presented in this paper need not be limited to DOT.",
        "Fragments can be thought of as analogous to phrases in Phrase-Based SMT systems - we could implement a similar rescoring system for phrase-based systems, where we generate several candidate translations for source sentences in a tuning set, and score each phrase used against the phrases used in a set of oracles.",
        "More broadly, we could potentially take any statistical MT system, and compare the features of all candidates generated against those of oracle translations, and score those that are closer to the oracle higher than those further away.",
        "Finally, by explicitly framing the translation problem as a search problem, where we are divorcing the inferences in the search space (i.e. the model) from the path we take to find the optimal inference according to some criterion (i.e. the scoring scheme), we can remove some of the variability when comparing two models or scoring mechanisms (Lopez, 2009)."
