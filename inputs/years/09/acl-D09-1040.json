        "For example, according to Callison-Burch et al.",
        "(2006), a SMT system with a training corpus of 10,000 words learned only 10% of the vocabulary; the same system learned about 30% with a training corpus of 100,000 words; and even with a large training corpus of nearly 10,000,000 words it only reached about 90% coverage of the source vocabulary.",
        "Coverage of higher order n-gram levels is even harder.",
        "This problem plays a major part in reducing machine translation quality, as reflected by both automatic measures such as Bleu (Papineni et al., 2002) and human judgment tests.",
        "Improving translation coverage accurately is therefore important for SMT systems.",
        "The first solution that might come to mind is to use larger parallel training corpora.",
        "However, current state-of-the-art SMT systems cannot learn from non-aligned corpora, while sentence-aligned parallel corpora (bitexts) are a limited resource (See Section 2 for discussion of automatically-compiled bitexts).",
        "Another direction might be to make use of non-parallel corpora for training.",
        "However, this requires developing techniques to extract alignments or translations from them, and in a sufficiently fast, memory-efficient, and scalable manner.",
        "One approach that can, in principle, better exploit both alignments from bitexts and make use of non-parallel corpora is the distributional collocational approach, e.g., as used by Fung and Yee (1998) and Rapp (1999).",
        "However, the systems described there are not easily scalable, and require pre-computation of a very large collocation counts matrix.",
        "Related attempts propose generating bitexts from comparable and \"quasi-comparable\" bilingual texts by iteratively bootstrapping documents, sentences, and words (Fung and Cheung, 2004), or by using a maximum entropy classifier (Munteanu and Marcu, 2005).",
        "Alignment accuracy remains a challenge for them.",
        "Recent work has proposed augmenting the training data with paraphrases generated by pivoting through other languages (Callison-Burch et al., 2006; Madnani et al., 2007).",

        "(2006), who also translate source-side paraphrases of the OOV phrases.",

        "A major disadvantage of their approach is that it relies on the availability of parallel corpora in other languages.",
        "While this works for English and many European languages, it is far less likely to help when translating from other source languages, for which bitexts are scarce or non-existent.",
        "Also, the pivoting approach is inherently noisy (in both the paraphrase candidates' correct sense, and their translational likelihood), and it is likely to fare poorly with out-of-domain translation.",
        "One advantage of the bitext-dependent pivoting approach is the use of the additional human knowledge that is encapsulated in the parallel sentence alignment.",
        "However, we argue that the ability to use much larger resources for paraphrasing should trump the human knowledge advantage.",
        "More recently, Callison-Burch (2008) has improved performance of this pivoting technique by imposing syntactic constraints on the paraphrases.",
        "The limitation of such an approach is the reliance on a good parser (in addition to reliance on bitexts), but a good parser is not available in all languages, especially not in resource-poor languages.",
        "Another approach using a pivoting technique augments the human reference translation with paraphrases, creating additional translation \"references\" (Madnani et al., 2007).",
        "Both approaches have shown gains in BLEU score.",
        "Barzilay and McKeown (2001) extract paraphrases from a monolingual parallel corpus, containing multiple translations of the same source.",
        "In addition to the parallel corpus usage limitations described above, this technique is further limited by the small size of such materials, which are even scarcer than the resources in the pivoting case.",
        "Dolan et al.",
        "(2004) explore generating paraphrases by edit-distance and headlines of time-and topic-clustered news articles; they do not address the OOV problem directly, as their focus is sentence-level paraphrases; although they use a standard SMT measure, alignment error rate (AER), they only report results of the alignment quality, and not of an end-to-end SMT system.",
        "Much of the previous research largely focused on morphological analysis in order to reduce type sparseness; Callison-Burch et al.",
        "(2006) list some of the influential work in that direction.",
        "Work that relies on the distributional hypothesis using bilingual comparable corpora (without the need for bitexts), typically uses a seed lexicon for \"bridging\" source language phrases with their target languages paraphrases (Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1999; Diab and Finch, 2000).",
        "This approach is sometimes viewed as, or combined with, an information retrieval (IR) approach, and normalizes strength-of-association measures (see Section 3) with IR-related measures such as TF/IDF (Fung and Yee, 1998).",
        "To date, reported implementations suffer from scalability issues, as they pre-compute and hold in memory a huge collocation matrix; we know of no report of using this approach in an end-to-end SMT system.",
        "Another approach aiming to reduce OOV rate concentrates on increasing parallel training set size without using more dedicated human translation (Resnik and Smith, 2003; Oard et al., 2003)."

        "We use here flat collocations in a 6-token sliding window.",
        "Beside simple cooccurrence counts within sliding windows, other SoA measures include functions based on TF/IDF (Fung and Yee, 1998), mutual information (PMI) (Lin, 1998), conditional probabilities (Schuetze and Pedersen, 1997), chi-square test, and the log-likelihood ratio (Dunning, 1993).",

        "Our proposed method has the advantage of not relying on bitexts in order to generate the paraphrases, and therefore gives access to large amounts of monolingual training data, for which creating bitexts of equivalent size is generally unfeasible.",
        "We haven't trained our system on nearly as large a corpus as it can handle, and indeed we see this as a natural next step.",
        "Results support the assumption that a larger monolingual paraphrase training set yields better paraphrases: our S2E l-4grams model performed significantly better than baseline when using wmt09+aquis for paraphrasing, but when only using wmt09, the model had a smaller advantage that did not reach significance.",
        "However, for the S2E lgrams model, there was a slight decrease in performance when switching paraphrasing corpus from wmt09+aquis to wmt09+aquis+afp.",
        "This effect might be due to the genre or unbalanced content of the additional corpus, or perhaps it is the case that in this corpus size, paraphrases of higher-level ngrams benefitted from the additional text much more than paraphrases of unigrams did.",
        "The two rightmost columns in Table 5 show that although Spanish monolingual paraphrases for the unigram baile improve when using the larger corpus, (e.g., danza and un balie become the third and fourth top candidates, pushing much worse candidates far down the list), the two top paraphrase candidates remained unchanged.",
        "However, for the 4gram a favor del informe, antonymous candidates, which are bad and misleading for translation, are pushed down from the top first and third spots by synonymous, better candidates.",
        "Table 3 contains additional examples of good and bad top paraphrase candidates, also in English.",
        "Paraphrases of phrases seem to be of lower quality than those of unigrams, as can be seen at the bottom of the table.",
        "These results also show that our method is especially useful in settings involving low-density languages or special domains: The smaller subset models, emulating a resource-poor language situation, show higher gains than larger models (which are supersets of the smaller subset models), when augmented with paraphrases derived from the same paraphrase training set.",
        "This was validated in two very different language pairs: English to Chinese, and Spanish to English.",
        "We believe that larger monolingual training sets for paraphrasing can help languages with richer resources, and we intend to explore this too.",

        "Pivoting techniques (translating back and forth) rely on limited resources (bitexts), and are subject to shifts in meaning due to their inherent double translation step.",
        "In contrast, large monolingual resources are relatively easy to collect, and our system involves only a single translation/paraphrasing step per target phrase.",
        "Table 5 also shows an exemplar comparison with the pivoting paraphrases used in Callison-Burch etal.",
        "(2006).",
        "It seems that the pivoting paraphrases might suffer more from having frequent function words as top candidates, which might be a by-product of their alignment \"promiscuity\".",
        "However, the top antonymous candidate problem seems to mainly plague the monolingual distributional paraphrases (but improves with larger corpora).",
        "See also Table 6.",
        "The paraphrase quality remains an issue with this method (as with all other paraphrasing methods).",
        "Some possible ways of improving it, besides using larger corpora, are: using syntactic information (Callison-Burch, 2008), using semantic knowledge such as thesaurus or WordNet to perform word sense disambiguation (WSD) (Resnik, 1999; Mohammad and Hirst, 2006), improving the similarity measure, and refining the similarity threshold.",
        "We would like to explore ways of incorporating syntactic knowledge that do not sacrifice coverage as much as in Callison-Burch (2008); incorporating semantic knowledge to disambiguate phrasal senses; using context to help sense disambiguation (Erk and Padö, 2008); and optimizing the similarity threshold for use in SMT, for example on a held-out dataset: too high a threshold reduces coverage, while too low a threshold results in bad paraphrases and translation.",
        "The method presented here is quite general, and therefore different similarity measures, including other corpus-based ones, can be plugged in to generate paraphrases.",
        "We are looking into using DPs with word-sense disambiguation: Since it has been shown that similarity is often judged by the semantic distance of the closest senses of the two target words (Mohammad and Hirst, 2006), and that paraphrases generated this way are likely to be of higher quality (Marton et al., 2009), hence it is also likely that the overall performance of an SMT system using them will also improve further.",
        "One potential advantage of using bitexts for paraphrase generation is the usage of implicit human knowledge, i.e., sentence alignments.",
        "The concern that not using this knowledge would turn out detrimental to the performance of SMT systems augmented by paraphrases as described here was largely put to rest, as our method improved the tested subset SMT systems' quality."
