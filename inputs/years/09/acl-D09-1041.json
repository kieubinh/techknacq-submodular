        "While there are a few notable exceptions (Hori and Furui, 2004; Yamagata et al., 2006), it would be safe to say that much of prior research on sentence compression has been focusing on what we might call 'model-intensive approaches,' where the goal is to mimic human created compressions as faithfully as possible, using probabilistic and/or machine learning techniques (Knight and Marcu, 2002; Riezler et al., 2003; Turner and Charniak, 2005; McDonald, 2006; Clarke and Lapata, 2006; Cohn and Lapata, 2007; Cohn and Lapata, 2008; Cohn and Lapata, 2009).",
        "Because of this, the question has never been raised as to whether a model free approach – where the goal is not to model what humans would produce as compression, but to provide compressions just as useful as those created by human – will offer a viable alternative to model intensive approaches.",
        "This is the question we take on in this paper.",
        "!One caveat would be in order.",
        "By model free approach, we mean a particular approach which does not furnish any parameters or weights that one can train on human created compressions.",
        "An approach is said to be model-intensive if it does.",
        "So as far as the present paper is concerned, we might do equally well with a mention of 'model free' ('model-intensive') replaced with 'unsupervised' ('supervised'), or 'non-trainable' ('trainable').",
        "An immediate benefit of the model-free approach is that we could free ourselves from the drudgery of collecting gold standard data from humans, which is costly and time-consuming.",
        "Another benefit is intellectual; it opens up an alternative avenue to addressing the problem of sentence compression hitherto under-explored.",
        "Also breaking from the tradition of previous research on sentence compression, we explore the use of naturally occurring data from the Internet as the gold standard.",
        "The present work builds on and takes further an approach called 'Generic Sentence Trimmer' (GST) (Nomoto, 2008), demonstrating along the way that it could be adapted for English with relative ease.",
        "(GST was originally intended for Japanese.)",
        "In addition, to get a perspective on where we stand with this approach, we will look at how it fares against a state-of-the-art model intensive approach known as 'Tree-to-Tree Transducer' (T3) (Cohn, 2008), on the corpus we created."

        "For the convenience's sake, we refer to the generation component as 'GST/g' and the ranking part as 'GST/r.'",
        "The approach is motivated largely by the desire to make compressed sentences linguistically fluent, and what it does is to retain much of the syntax of the source sentence as it is, in compression, which stands in contrast to Filippova and Strube (2007) and Filippova and Strube (2008), who while working with dependency structure (as we do), took the issue to be something that can be addressed by selecting and reordering constituents that are deemed relevant.",

        "We begin by locating terminal nodes, i.e., those which have no incoming edges, depicted as filled circles in Figure 1.",
        "Next we find a dependency (singly linked) path from each terminal node to the root (labeled e).",
        "This would give us three paths p\\ = a-c-d-e, p2 = b-c-d-e, and Ps = h-g-f-e (represented by dashed arrows in Figure 1).",

        "As a way of doing this systematically, we put TDPs in a trellis format as in Figure 2, each file representing a TDP, and look for a path across the trellis, which we call 'POT' It is easy to see that traveling across the trellis (while keeping record of nodes visited), gives you a particular way in which to combine TDPs: thus in Figure 2, we have three POTs, c-b-f, a-c-h, and a-b-f, giving rise to bcdef, acdefgh, and abcdef, respectively (where '&' denotes a starting node, '%' an ending node, and '#' an empty string).",

      "text": [
        "It is interesting and worthwhile to ask what caused T3, heavily clad in ideas from the recent machine learning literature, to fail on NYT-RSS, as opposed to the 'CLwritten' and 'CLspoken' corpora on which T3 reportedly prevailed compared to other approaches (Cohn and Lapata, 2009).",
        "The CLwritten corpus comes from written sources in the British National Corpus and the American News Text corpus; the CLspoken corpus comes from transcribed broadcast news stories (cf. Table 7).",
        "We argue that there are some important differences between the NYT-RSS corpus and the CLwritten/CLspoken corpora that may have led to T3's poor record with the former corpus.",
        "The CLwritten and CLspoken corpora were created with a specific purpose in mind: namely to assess the compression-by-deletion approach.",
        "So their authors had a very good reason to limit gold standard compressions to those that can be arrived at only through deletion; annotators were carefully instructed to create compression by deleting words from the source sentence in a way that preserves the gist of the original sentence.",
        "By contrast, NYT-RSS consists of naturally occurring compressions sampled from live feeds on the Internet, where relations between compression and its source sentence are often not as straightforward.",
        "For instance, to arrive at a compression in NYT-RSS in Table 7 involves replacing race with her plans to unseat senator Hillary Rodam Clinton, which is obviously beyond what is possible with the deletion based approach.",
        "In CLwritten and CLspoken, on the other hand, compressions are constructed out of parts that appear in verbatim in the original sentence, as Table 7 shows: thus one may get to the compressions by simply crossing off words from the original sentence.",
        "To see whether there is any significant difference among NYT-RSS, CLwritten and CLspoken, we examined how well gold standard compressions are aligned with source sentences on each of the corpora, using SWA.",
        "Table 9 shows what we found.",
        "Parenthetical numbers represent how many pairs of compression and source are found in each corpus.",
        "A larger score means a tighter alignment between gold standard compression and its source sentence: we find in Table 9 that CLspoken has a source sentence more closely aligned with its compression than CLwritten, whose alignments are more closely tied than NYT-RSS's.",
        "Figure 4 (found in the previous page) shows how SWA alignment scores are distributed over each of the corpora.",
        "CLwritten and CLspoken have peaks at around 0, with an almost entire mass of scores concentrating in an area close to or above 0.",
        "This means that for the most of the cases in either CLwritten or CLspoken, compression is very similar in form to its source.",
        "In contrast, NYT-RSS has a heavy concentration of scores in a stretch between 5 and -10, indicating that for the most of time, the overlap between compression and its source is rather modest compared to CLwritten and CLspoken.",
        "So why does T3 fails on NYT-RSS?",
        "Because NYT-RSS contains lots of alignments that are only weakly related: in order for T3 to perform well, the training corpus should be made as free of spurious data as possible, so that most of the alignments are rated over and around 0 by SWA.",
        "Our concern is that such data may not happen naturally, as the density distribution of NYT-RSS shows, where the majority of alignments are found far below 0, which could raise some questions about the robustness of T3."

      "text": [
        "This paper introduced the model free approach, GST/g, which works by creating compressions only in reference to dependency structure, and looked at how it compares with a model intensive approach T3 on the data gathered from the Internet.",
        "It was found that the latter approach appears to crucially rely on the way the corpus is constructed in order for it to work, which may mean a huge compromise.",
        "Interestingly enough, GST/g came out a winner on the particular corpus we used, even outperforming its CRFs harnessed version, GST/g+r in representativeness.",
        "This suggests that we might gain more by improving fluency of GST/g than by focusing on its representativeness, which in any case came close to that of human at 70% compression level.",
        "The future work should also look at how the present approach fares on CLwritten and CLspoken, for which T3 was found to be effective."
