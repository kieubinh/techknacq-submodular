        "The goal of summarisation is to take an information source, extract content from it, and present the most important content in a condensed form (Mani, 2001).",
        "The field of automatic summarisation (Mani, 2001 ; Spärck Jones, 2007) aims to create tools that address various summarisation tasks with minimal human intervention.",
        "Extractive approaches to automatic summarisation create representations of the source document that are generally based on an easily identified text subunit such as sentences or paragraphs.",
        "These representations are then used to identify representative or otherwise important snippets of text to place in the summary.",
        "Following Spärck Jones (2007), summarisation systems can be characterised with respect to their approach to three main sub-tasks: 1) interpretation, 2) transformation and 3) generation.",
        "The input consists of the source document (or a collection of source documents in the case of multi-document summarisation).",
        "The first step (interpretation) creates a representation of the source document by performing some level of interpretation.",
        "A simple approach here represents sentences by their tokens (i.e., as an unordered bag-of-words).",
        "The next step (transformation) is the compaction step where the source representation is converted into the summary representation, e.g. by identifying sentences whose words are most representative of the full text.",
        "Finally, in the last step (generation), the output summary is created.",
        "In the case of sentence extraction, this includes various operations to maximise coherence such as ensuring that entity references are comprehensible and arranging the sentences in a sensible order.",
        "The current work investigates several representations of source documents.",
        "In particular, an approach from the literature based on atomic events (Filatova and Hatzivassiloglou, 2004) is compared to a novel approach based on generic relation extraction (GRE), which aims to build systems for relation identification and characterisation that can be transferred across domains and tasks without modification of model parameters (Hachey, 2009).",
        "The various representations are substituted in the interpretation phase of a multi-document summarisation task and used as the basis for extracting sentences to be placed in the summary.",

        "In seminal work on automatic summarisation, Luhn (1958) introduces a representation based on content words.",
        "These are defined as nonfunction words from the source document that are neither too frequent nor too infrequent.",

        "©2009 ACL and AFNLP",
        "tracts sentences with the highest combined content scores to form the summary.",
        "Subsequent work adapted the tf*idf weighting scheme, where term frequency (tf) is combined with inverse document frequency (idf), an inverse measure of term occurrence across documents that serves to down-weight common words (Spärck Jones, 1972).",
        "In modern work, tf*idf representations are often used as simple but non-trivial baselines.",
        "The problem is that these shallow features often break down where underlying linguistic content needs to be compared rather than just surface structure.",
        "The use of representations based on information extraction (IE) has been suggested as one approach to capturing deeper semantic information.",
        "This is based on the notion that IE definitions of types for entities, relations and events provide a level of abstraction that is appropriate for automatic summarisation.",
        "Several approaches in the literature have explored the use of IE-based representations for extractive summarisation: McK-eown et al.",
        "(1998) incorporate patient characteristic templates for matching potential treatments to specific patients in a medical summarisation system; White and Cardie (2002) incorporate a bootstrapped IE system based on Autoslog (Riloff, 1996) for filling event templates; and Harabagiu and Maiorano (2002) incorporate a hybrid approach that uses conventional supervised IE techniques for known topics and a more general approach based on WordNet for unknown topics.The problem with these systems is that they all use supervised approaches to IE that require that the IE templates be known in advance and additionally require significant investment in writing extraction rules or in annotating data for training.",
        "Where more general techniques are used, they still require domain-specific resources, e.g. White and Cardie (2002) bootstrapping approach still requires that the extraction templates be known in advance and Harabagiu and Maiorano (2002) approach depends on the WordNet lexical database, for which coverage is not guaranteed for arbitrary domains.",
        "Filatova and Hatzivassiloglou (2004) introduce methods using more general IE representations that are not based on supervised learning.",
        "Given a named entity recogniser, the representation is automatically derived and consists of <Ent, Connector, Ent> event triples, where connectors are verbs or action nouns that occur in between the two NEs.",
        "Thus, the approach aims to perform a generic IE task that the authors refer to as atomic event extraction.",
        "This representation is shown to outperform a tf*idf baseline on a multi-document summarisation task.",
        "As we will see in Section 4.3 below, Filatova and Hatzivassiloglou's approach has three main shortcomings.",
        "First, it focuses exclusively on simple atomic events (i.e., entity mention pairs with an intervening verbal connector), meaning that it will not be able to address tasks where relations are at least as important as events (e.g., biographical summarisation).",
        "Second, it relies on exact matching between connectors, which is not capable of capturing latent semantic similarities (e.g., between 'work for' and 'employed by').",
        "Third, its performance is subject to the coverage of WordNet, which is used to identify action nouns.",
        "Generic relation extraction (GRE) aims to build systems that can be transferred across domains and tasks without modification of model parameters (Hachey, 2009).",
        "For relation identification (i.e., extraction of relation forming entity mention pairs), this is achieved by using general rule-based approaches and, for relation characterisation (i.e., assignment of types to relation mentions), this is achieved by using unsupervised machine learning.",
        "Hachey (2009) introduces a GRE approach that addresses the shortcomings of the atomic event approach mentioned above.",
        "First, it models a type of IE that includes relations.",
        "Second, it uses a connector model based on latent Dirichlet allocation (Blei et al., 2003), which provides a mechanism for capturing latent semantic similarities between connectors.",
        "Third, it does not rely on domain-specific resource like WordNet.",
        "The GRE models used here do rely on dependency parsing.",
        "However, they still generalise across formal domains as the relation identification and characterisation systems, developed on news data, achieve comparable performance when applied directly to a relation extraction task in the biomedical domain (see Hachey (2009) for details).",
        "Furthermore, grammatical relations obtained from dependency parsing provide a means for constraining relation identification and supplying more linguistically meaningful features for relation characterisation.",

        "This outputs a topic distribution for each entity mention pair that corresponds to the type of relation that is described.",
        "This representation 1) models a type of generic IE that includes relations, 2) uses a connector model that abstracts away from surface-level event descriptors used by Filatova and Hatzivassiloglou (2004) and 3) does not rely on domain-specific resources like WordNet.",
        "For the purpose of comparison, relation triples are weighted in the same way as event triples using Equations 3 and 4 above.",
        "However, the connector pair weighting is modified to use the distribution over topics given by the LDA output.Relation triples generated for the example sentence in Figure 3 include <ORG_amoco, rd94, LOC_denver> and <ORG_amoco, rd505, LOC_denver>, where the connectors (i.e., rd94 and rd50 5) are identifiers that index particular topics from the LDA output.",

        "Figure 4 contains results for a correlation analysis comparing the various representations.",
        "This also includes a comparison to the human upper bound (HU), computed by leave-one-out cross validation.",
        "Cells in the matrix contain the correlations values measured across document set Rouge -SU4 scores using Spearman's p rank correlation coefficient (rs).",
        "Here, high values mean that two representations tend to perform well on the same document sets such that an ordering of document sets by Rouge scores is similar for the representations being compared.",
        "In the figure, correlation strength is represented by shading where light-toned squares indicate strong correlation (and the darkest squares indicate weak negative correlation).",
        "For example, the upper left cell contains rs between the TF and EV representations.",
        "The four squares correspond to rs values of -0.085, 0.199, 0.245 and 0.267 respectively for summaries of 50, 100, 200 and 400 words.",
        "The analysis illustrates a number of interesting points.",
        "First, it demonstrates that none of the representations correlate highly with the human upper bound, meaning that the automatic systems do not necessarily do well on the document sets that may be considered easier as measured by human agreement using Rouge.",
        "This suggests that task difficulty does not need to be considered as a possible underlying cause of correlation between the automatic systems.",
        "The analysis also illustrates that there is no clear and consistent relationship between summary length and correlation values.",
        "Some cells suggest that correlation may have a monotonie linear relationship increasing with length (e.g., TF*EV) while others seem to suggest inverse linear (e.g., TF*RL), quadratic (e.g., EV*HU) and invariant (e.g., EV*EE) relationships with length.",
        "Looking at correlation between automatic systems (i.e., TF, EV, RL, EE and ER), correlation values closer to zero suggest that the systems do well on different document sets and that a combined system might therefore be better.",
        "By this reasoning, the largest gains would come from combining TF with any other representation.",
