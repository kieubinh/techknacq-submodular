        "Both corpora are explained in more detail in the following section.",
        "The relationship between the two inventories (PropBank semantic roles and TPP preposition senses) is not a simple one-to-one mapping, as we can see from the following examples:",

        "In the first and third example, the semantic roles are the same, but the preposition senses are different, i.e., sense 1 and sense 5 (\"inclusion or involvement\").",

        "This section gives an introduction to preposition sense disambiguation and semantic role labeling of prepositional phrases.",
        "The task of word sense disambiguation is to find the correct meaning of a word, given its context.",
        "Most prior research on word sense disambiguation has focused on disambiguating the senses of nouns, verbs, and adjectives, but not on prepositions.",
        "Word sense disambiguation can be framed as a classification task.",
        "For each preposition, a classifier is trained on a corpus of training examples annotated with preposition senses, and tested on a set of unseen test examples.",
        "To perform WSD for prepositions, it is necessary to first find a set of suitable sense classes.",
        "We adopt the sense inventory from the Preposition Project (TPP) (Litkowski and Hargraves, 2005) that was also used in the SemEval 2007 preposition WSD task (Litkowski and Hargraves, 2007).",
        "TPP is an attempt to create a comprehensive lexical database of English prepositions that is suitable for use in computational linguistics research.",
        "For each of the over 300 prepositions and phrasal prepositions, the database contains a set of sense definitions, which are based on the Oxford Dictionary of English.",
        "Every preposition has a set of fine-grained senses, which are grouped together into a smaller number of coarse-grained senses.",
        "In our experiments, we only focus on coarse-grained senses since better inter-annotator agreement can be achieved on coarse-grained senses, which also results in higher accuracy of the trained WSD classifier.",
        "The task of semantic role labeling in the context of PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) is to label tree nodes with semantic roles in a syntactic parse tree.",
        "The PropBank corpus adds a semantic layer to parse trees from the Wall Street lournal section of the Penn Treebank II corpus (Marcus et al., 1993).",
        "There are two classes of semantic roles: core arguments and adjunctive arguments.",
        "Core arguments are verb sense specific, i.e., their meaning is defined relative to a specific verb sense.",
        "They are labeled with consecutive numbers ArgO, ArgI, etc.",
        "ArgO usually denotes the Agent and ArgI the Theme of the event.",
        "Besides the core arguments, a verb can have a number of adjunctive arguments that express more general properties like time, location, or manner.",
        "They are labeled as Argm plus a functional tag, e.g., loc for locative or tmp for temporal modifiers.",
        "Prepositional phrases can appear as adjunctive arguments or core arguments.",
        "The standard approach to semantic role labeling is to divide the task into two sequential sub-tasks: identification and classification.",
        "During the identification phase, the system separates the nodes that fill some semantic roles from the rest.",
        "During the classification phase, the system assigns the exact semantic roles for all nodes that are identified as arguments.",
        "In this paper, we focus on the classification phase.",
        "That is, we assume that prepositional phrases that are semantic arguments have been identified correctly and concentrate on the task of determining the semantic role of prepositional phrases.",
        "The reason is that argument identification mostly relies on syntactic features, like the path from the constituent to the predicate (Pradhan et al., 2005).",
        "Consider, for example, the phrase in the dark in the sentence: \"We are in the dark\", he said.",
        "The phrase is clearly not an argument to the verb say.",
        "But if we alter the syntactic structure of the sentence appropriately (while the sense of the preposition in remains unchanged), the same phrase suddenly becomes an adjunctive argument: In the dark, he said \"We are\".",
        "On the other hand, we can easily find examples, where in has a different sense, but the phrase always fills some semantic role:",
        "• In a separate manner, he said ...",
        "• In 1998, he said ...",
        "• In Washington, he said ...",
        "This illustrates that the preposition sense is independent of whether the PP is an argument or not.",
        "Thus, a joint learning model for argument identification and preposition sense is unlikely to perform better than the independent models."
