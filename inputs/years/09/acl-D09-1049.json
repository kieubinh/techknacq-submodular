        "Such MWEs can be characterized as being non-compositional: the meaning of the expression does not transparently follow from the meaning of the words that comprise it.",
        "Much of the work on MWEs in NLP has been in MWE extraction - the discovery of new",
        "MWEs from a corpus, using statistical and other methods.",
        "Identification of known MWEs in text has received less attention, but is necessary for many NLP applications, for example in machine translation.",
        "The current work deals with the MWE identification task: deciding if a sentence contains a use of a known expression.",
        "MWE identification is not as simple as may initially appear, as will be shown by the performance of two rule-based baselines in our experiments.",
        "One source of difficulty is variations in expressions' usage in text.",
        "Although MWEs generally show less variation than single words, they show enough that it cannot be ignored.",
        "In a study on V+NP idioms, Riehemann (2001) found that the idioms' canonical form accounted for 75% of their appearances in a corpus.",
        "Additionally, expressions differ considerably in the types of variations they allow, which include passivization, nominalization and addition of modifying words (Moon, 1998).",
        "A second source of difficulty is that expressions consisting of very frequent words will often co-occur in sentences in a non-MWE usage and in similar but distinct expressions.",
        "MWE identification can be modeled as a two step process.",
        "Given a sentence and a known expression, step (1) is to decide if the sentence contains a potential use of the expression.",
        "This is a relatively simple step based on the appearance in the sentence of the words comprising the MWE.",
        "Step (2) is to decide if the potential use is indeed non-compositional.",

        "Only (d) contains a non-compositional use of hit the road.",
        "The task we address in this paper is to identify whether or not we are in case (d), for a given expression in a given sentence.",
        "To date, most work in MWE identification has focused on manually encoding rules that identify expressions in text.",
        "The encodings, usually consisting of regular expressions and syntactic structures, are intended to contain all the necessary information for processing the MWE in text.",
        "Being manual, this is time-consuming work and requires expert knowledge of individual expressions.",
        "In terms of the above model, such encodings handle both MWE identification steps.",
        "A second approach is to use machine learning methods to learn an expression's behavior from a corpus.",
        "Studies taking this approach have focused on distinguishing between compositional and non-compositional uses of an expression (cases (c) and (d) above).",
        "As will be detailed in Section 2, existing methods are tailored to an expression's type, and experiment with a single MWE pattern.",
        "In addition, the training and test sets they used did not contain non-expression uses as in case (b), which can be quite common in practice.",
        "Our approach is more general.",
        "Given a set of sentences with potential MWE uses, we use sentence surface features to create a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for each expression.",
        "The classifier is binary and differentiates between non-compositional uses of the expression ((d) above) on the one hand, and compositional and non-expression uses ((b) and (c)) on the other.",
        "The experiments and results presented below focus on verbal MWEs, since verbal MWEs are quite common in language use and have also been investigated in related MWE research (e.g., (Cook et al., 2007)).",

        "The approach to handling MWEs in early systems was to employ a list of expressions, each with a quasi regular expression that encodes morpho-syntactic variations.",
        "One example is Leech et al.",
        "(1994) who used this method for automatic part-of-speech tagging for the BNC.",
        "Another is a formalism called IDAREX (IDioms And Regular Expressions) (Breidt et al., 1996).",
        "More recent research emphasizes the integration of MWE lexical entries into existing single word lexicons and grammar systems (Villavicen-cio et al., 2004; Alegria et al., 2004).",
        "There is also an attempt to take advantage of regularities in morpho-syntactic properties across MWE groups, which allows encoding the behavior of the group instead of individual expressions (Villavicencio et al., 2004; Grégoire, 2007).",
        "Fellbaum (1998) discusses some difficulties in representing idioms, which are largely figurative in meaning, in Word-Net.",
        "More recent work (Fellbaum et al., 2006) focuses on German VP idioms.",
        "As already mentioned, one issue with lexical encoding is that it is done manually, making lexicons difficult to create, maintain and extend.",
        "The use of regularities among different types of MWEs is one way of reducing the amount of work required.",
        "A second issue is that implementations tend to ignore the likelihood and even the possibility of compositional and other interpretations of expressions in text, which can be common for some expressions.",
        "For example, in an MWE identification study, Hashimoto et al.",
        "(2006) built an identification system using hand crafted rules for some 100 Japanese idioms.",
        "The results showed near perfect performance on expressions without compositional/non-compositional ambiguity but significantly poorer performance on expressions with ambiguity.",
        "Katz and Giesbrecht (2006) used a supervised learning method to distinguish between compositional and non-compositional uses of an expression (in German text) by using contextual information in the form of Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) vectors.",
        "LSA vectors of compositional and non-compositional meaning were built from a training set of example sentences and then a nearest neighbor algorithm was applied on the LSA vector of one tested MWE.",
        "The technique was tested more thoroughly in Cook et al.",
        "(2007).",
        "Cook et al.",
        "(2007) devised two unsupervised methods to distinguish between compositional (literal) and non-compositional (idiomatic) tokens of verb-object expressions.",
        "The first method is based on an expression's canonical form.",
        "In a previous study (Fazly and Stevenson, 2006), the authors came up with a dozen possible syntactic forms for verb-object pairs (based on passivization, determiner, and object pluralization) and used a corpus-based statistical measure to determine the canonical form(s).",
        "The method classifies new tokens as idiomatic if they use a canonical form, and literal otherwise.",
        "The second method uses context as well as form.",
        "Co-occurrence vectors representing the idiomatic and literal meaning of each expression were computed based on corpus data.",
        "Idiomatic-meaning vectors were based on examples matching the expressions' canonical form.",
        "Literal meaning vectors were based on examples that did not match the canonical form.",
        "New tokens were classified as literal/idiomatic based on their (cooccurrence) vector's cosine similarity to the idiomatic and literal vectors.",
        "(Sporleder and Li, 2009) also attempted to distinguish compositional from non-compositional uses of expressions in text.",
        "Their assumption was that if an expression is used literally, but not idiomatically, its component words will be related semantically to several words in the surrounding discourse.",
        "For example, when the expression 'play with fire' is used literally, words such as 'smoke, 'burn', 'fire department', and 'alarm' tend to also be used nearby; when it is used idiomatically, they aren't (indeed, other words, e.g., 'danger' or 'risk' appear nearby but they are not close semantically to 'play' or to 'fire').",
        "This property was used to distinguish literal and non-literal instances by measuring the semantic relatedness of an expression's component words to nearby words in the text.",
        "If one or more of the expression's components were sufficiently related to enough nearby words, forming a 'lexical chain', the usage was classified as literal.",
        "Otherwise it was idiomatic.",
        "Two classifiers based on lexical chains were devised.",
        "These were compared with a supervised method that trains a classifier for each expression based on surrounding context.",
        "The results showed that the supervised classifier method did much better (90% F-score on literal uses) than the lexical chain classifier methods (60% F-score).",
        "In the above studies the focus is on the compositional/non-compositional expression distinction.",
        "The sentence data used contains examples of either one or the other.",
        "In (Sporleder and Li, 2009) the experimental data included only sentences in which the expressions were in canonical form (allowing for verb inflection).",
        "In (Cook et al., 2007) a syntactic parser was used to collect sentences containing the MWEs in the active and passive voice using heuristics.",
        "Thus, examples such as the following (from the BNC) would not be included in their sample:",
        "1. take a chance: 'While he still had a chance of being near Maisie, he would take it'.",
        "2. face the consequences: '... she did not have to face, it appears, the possible serious or even fatal consequences of her decision'.",
        "3. make a distinction: 'Logically, the distinction between the two aspects of the theory can and should be made'.",
        "4. break the ice: 'The ice, if not broken, was beginning to soften a little'.",
        "5. settle a score: 'Morrissey had another score to settle'.",
        "This means that their experiments have not included all types of sentences that might be encountered in practice when attempting MWE identification.",
        "Specifically, they would miss many examples in which the MWE words are present but are not used as an expression (case (b) in Section 1).",
        "Moreover, their heuristics are tailored to the Verb-Direct Object MWE type.",
        "Different heuristics would need to be employed for different MWE types.",
        "In our approach there is no preprocessing stage requiring type-specific knowledge.",
        "Specifically, the above examples are used as training sentences in our experiments.",
        "There exists an extensive body of research on MWE extraction (see Wermter and Hahn (2004) for a review), where the only input is a corpus, and the output is a list of MWEs found in it.",
        "Most methods collect MWE candidates from the corpus, score them according to some association measure between their components, and accept candidates with scores passing some threshold.",
        "The focus of research has been on developing association measures, including statistical, information-theoretic and linguistically motivated measures (e.g., Juste-son and Katz (1995), Wermter and Hahn (2006), and Deane (2005))."
