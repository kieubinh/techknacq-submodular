        "Translation of multiword expressions (MWEs), such as compound words, phrases, collocations and idioms, is important for many NLP tasks, including the techniques are helpful for dictionary compilation, cross language information retrieval, second language learning, and machine translation.",
        "(Smadja et al., 1996; Gao et al., 2002; Wu and Zhou, 2003).",
        "However, extracting exact translations of MWEs is still an open problem, possibly because the senses of many MWEs are not compositional (Yamamoto and Matsumoto, 2000), i.e., their translations are not compositions of the translations of individual words.",
        "For example, the Chinese idiom SâfM^fSshould be translated as \"turn a blind eye,\" which has no direct relation with respect to the translation of each constituent (i.e., \"to sit\", \"to see\" and \"to ignore\") at the word level.",
        "Previous SMT systems (e.g., Brown et al., 1993) used a word-based translation model which assumes that a sentence can be translated into other languages by translating each word into one or more words in the target language.",
        "Since many concepts are expressed by idiomatic multiword expressions instead of single words, and different languages may realize the same concept using different numbers of words (Ma et al., 2007; Wu, 1997), word alignment based methods, which are highly dependent on the probability information at the lexical level, are not well suited for this type of translation.",
        "To address the above problem, some methods have been proposed for extending word alignments to phrase alignments.",
        "For example, Och et al.",
        "(1999) proposed the so-called grow-diag-final heuristic method for extending word alignments to phrase alignments.",
        "The method is widely used and has achieved good results for phrase-based statistical machine translation.",

        "Instead of using heuristic rules, Ma et al.",
        "(2008) showed that syntactic information, e.g., phrase or dependency structures, is useful in extending the word-level alignment.",
        "However, the above methods still depend on word-based alignment models, so they are not well suited to extracting the translation equivalences of semantically opaque MWEs due to the lack of word level relations between the translational correspondences.",
        "Moreover, the aligned phrases are not precise enough to be used in many NLP applications like dictionary compilation, which require high quality translations.",
        "Association-based methods, e.g., the Dice coefficient, are widely used to extract translations of MWEs.",
        "(Kupiec, 1993; Smadja et al., 1996; Kitamura and Matsumoto, 1996; Yama-moto and Matsumoto, 2000; Melamed, 2001).",
        "The advantage of such methods is that association relations are established at the phrase level instead of the lexical level, so they have the potential to resolve the above-mentioned translation problem.",
        "However, when applying association-based methods, we have to consider the following complications.",

        "We propose an association measure called the normalized correlation frequency, which ranks the association strength of target words with the source MWE.",
        "For ease of explanation, we use the following notations: let f=/1f2,...fm and e=e1,e2,...,en be a pair of parallel Chinese and English sentences; and let w=t1,t2,.,tr be the Chinese source MWE.",
        "Hence, w is a subsequence of f.",
        "When counting the word frequency, each word in the target corpus normally contributes a frequency count of one.",
        "However, since we are interested in the word counts that correlate to w, we adopt the concept of the translation model proposed by Brown et al. (1993).",
        "Each word e in a sentence e might be generated by some words, denoted as r, in the source sentence f. If r is non-empty the relation between r and w should fit one of the following cases:",
        "1) All words in r belong to w, i.e., r tz w, so we say that e is only generated by w.",
        "2) No words in r belong to w, i.e., r tz f - w , so we say that e is only generated by context words.",
        "3) Some words in r belong to w, while others are context words.",
        "Intuitively, In Cases 1 and 2, the correlation count of an instance e should be 1 and 0 respectively.",
        "In Case 3, the normalized count of e is the expected frequency generated by w divided by the expected frequency generated by f. With that in mind, we define the weighted correlation count, wcc, as follows:",
        "where A is a very small smoothing factor in case e is not generated by any word in f. The probability p(e i f) is the word translation probability trained by IBM Model 1 on the whole parallel corpus.",
        "The rationale behind the weighted correlation count, wcc, is that if e is part of the translation of w, then its association with w should be stronger than other words in the context.",
        "Hence its wcc should be closer to 1.",
        "Otherwise, the association is weaker and the wcc should be closer to 0.",
        "Once the weighted correlation counts wcc is computed for each word in FC, we compute the normalized correlation frequency for each word e as the total sum of the wcc(e; e, f, w) of all w in bilingual sentences (e, f) in FC.",
        "The normalized correlation frequency (ncf) is defined as follows:",
        "ncf (e; w) = ^ wcc(e; e(i ), fw) .",

        "To illustrate the effectiveness ncf, we also display candidate words of the term with their Dice values in Tables 3.",
        "As shown in the tables, noise words such as justify, meaning and unfair are ranked lower using ncf than using Dice, while correct candidates, such as out, take and remark are ranked higher.",

        "After determining the candidate words, candidate translations of w can be generated by marking the candidate words in each sentence of FC.",

        "At the same time, the weakly associated function words, which we fail to select in the candidate word selection stage, should be recovered.",

        "In this instance, quoted is a false positive; therefore, the marked word sequence m \"quoted taken out of context\" is not the correct translation.",

        "However, the process may also trigger the side effect of the common subsequence problem described in Section 1.",
        "Since all candidates compete for the best translations by comparing their association strength with w, the common subsequences will have an advantage.",
        "To resolve the common subsequence effect problem, we evaluate each candidate translation, including its subsequences, by a concept similar to the normalized correlation frequency.",
        "As mentioned in Section 1, the Dice coefficient tends to select the common subsequences of some candidates because they have higher frequencies.",
        "To avoid this problem, we use the normalized correlation frequency to filter out false common subsequences from the candidate translation list.",
        "Here, we also use the weighted correlation count wcc to weight the frequency count of a candidate translation.",

        "Then, if a subsequence t is generated by removing a word e from m, the weighted count of the subsequence is reduced by multiplying the complement probability of e generated by w. Note that the weighted correlation count wcc is the probability of the word e generated by w. After all wc(t; e, f, m, w) in each sentence of the FC have been computed, the weighted frequency for a sequence t can be determined by summing the weighted frequencies over FC as follows:",

        "To demonstrate the usefulness of extracted MWE translations to existing statistical machine translation systems, we use the XML markup scheme provided by the Moses decoder, which allows the specification of translations for parts of a sentence.",
        "The procedure for this experiment consists of three steps: (1) the extracted MWE translations are added to the test set with the XML markup scheme, (2) after which the data is input to the Moses decoder to complete the translation task, (3) the results are evaluated using the BLEU metric (Papineni et al., 2002).",

        "Since the goal of this experiment is not focus on extraction of MWEs, simple methods are applied to extract MWEs from the training data: (1) we collect all continuous bigrams from Chinese sentences in the training data and then simply filter out the bigrams by mutual information (MI) with a threshold, (2) we also extract all idioms from Chinese sentences of the training data by collecting all 4-syllables words from the training data and filtering out obvious non-idioms, such as determinative-measure words and temporal words by their part-of-speeches, because most Chinese idioms are 4-syllables words.",
