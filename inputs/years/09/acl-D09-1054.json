        "Three types of relation should be considered for context and answer extraction: (a) relations between successive sentences (e.g., context sentence S2 occurs immediately before question sentence S3); (b) relations between context sentences and answer sentences (e.g., context S4 presents the phrase Causeway Bay linking to answer which is absent from question S6); and (c) relations between multiple labels for one sentence (e.g., one question sentence is unlikely to be the answer to another question although one sentence can serve as contexts for more than one questions).",
        "Our proposed graphical representation improves the modeling of the three types of sentence relation (Section 2.2).",
        "Certain interactions exist among questions.",

        "Our proposed graphical representation can naturally model the interactions.",

        "Specifically, we utilize two special properties of thread structure to reduce the inference (time) cost.",
        "First, context sentences and question sentences usually occur in the same post while answer sentences can only occur in the following posts.",
        "With this properties, we can greatly reduce context (or answer) candidate sets of a question, which results in a significant decrease in inference cost (Section 3).",
        "Second, context candidate set is usually much smaller than the number of sentences in a thread.",
        "This property enables our proposal to have an exact and efficient inference (Section 4.1).",
        "Moreover, an approximate inference algorithm is also given (Section 4.2).",
        "Loss function.",
        "In practice, different application settings usually imply different requirements for system performance.",
        "For example, we expect a higher recall for the purpose of archiving questions but a higher precision for the purpose of retrieving questions.",
        "A flexible framework should be able to cope with various requirements.",

        "We calculated the standard precision (P), recall (R) and Fi-score (Fi) for both tasks (context extraction and answer extraction).",
        "All the experimental results were obtained through 5-fold cross validation.",
        "We employed binary SVMs (B-SVM), multiclass SVMs (M-SVM), and C4.5 (Quinlan, 1993) as our baseline methods:",
        "B-SVM.",
        "We trained two binary SVMs for context extraction (context vs. non-context) and answer extraction (answer vs. non-answer), respectively.",
        "We used the feature mapping 4>qi{xj) defined in Equation (1) while training the binary SVM models.",
        "M-SVM.",
        "We extended the binary SVMs by training multiclass SVMs for three category labels {context, answer, plain).",
        "C4.5.",
        "This decision tree algorithm solved the same classification problem as binary SVMs and made use of the same set of features.",
        "We demonstrate in Table 3 that our approach can make use of the three types of relation among sentences well to boost the performance.",
        "In Table 3, S-SVM represents the structural SVMs only using the node features \\I>n(x, y).",
        "The suffixes H, C, and V denote the models using horizontal sequential edges, complete skip-chain edges and vertical label groups, respectively.",
        "The suffixes C* and V* denote the models using incomplete skip-chain edges and vertical sequential edges proposed in (Ding et al., 2008), as shown in Figures 2(a) and 2(c).",
        "All the structural SVMs were trained using basic loss function A5 in Equation (3).",
        "From Table 3, we can observe the following advantages of our approaches.",
        "Overall improvement.",
        "Our structural approach steadily improves the extraction as more types of relation (corresponding to more types of edge) are included.",
        "The best results obtained by using the three types of relation together improve the baseline methods binary SVMs by about 6% and 20% in terms of Fi values for context extraction and answer extraction, respectively.",
        "The usefulness of relations.",
        "The relations encoded by horizontal sequential edges and label groups are useful for both context extraction and answer extraction.",
        "The relation encoded by complete skip-chain edges is useful for answer extraction.",
        "The complete skip-chain edges not only avoid preprocessing but also boost the performance when compared with the preprocessed skip-chain edges.",
        "The label groups improve the vertical sequential edges.",
        "Interactions among questions.",
        "The interactions encoded by label groups are especially useful.",
        "We conducted significance tests (sign test) on the experimental results.",
        "The test result shows that S-SVM-HCV outperforms all the other methods without vertical edges statistically significantly (p-value < 0.01).",
        "Our proposed graphical representation in Figure 2(d) eases us to model the complex interactions.",
        "In comparison, the 2D model in Figure 2(c) used in previous work (Ding et al., 2008) can only model the interaction between adjacent questions.",
        "We report in Table 4 the comparison between structural SVMs using different loss functions.",
        "Note that Ap prefers precision and A^ prefers recall.",
        "From Table 4, we can observe that the experimental results also exhibit this kind of system preference.",
        "Moreover, we further demonstrate the capability of the loss function Ap in Figure 4.",
        "The curves are achieved by varying the ratio between two parameters cp/cr in Equation (4).",
        "The curves confirm our intuition: when log(cp/cr) becomes larger, the precisions increase but the recalls decrease and vice versa.",
