        "Clickthrough logs record user click behaviors, which are a critical source for improving search relevance (Bilenko and White, 2008; Radlinski et al., 2007; Agichtein and Zheng, 2006; Lu et al.",
        "2006).",
        "Previous work (Agichtein et al., 2006) demonstrated that clickthrough features (e.g., IsNextClicked and IsPreviousClicked) can lead to substantial improvements in relevance.",
        "Such features summarize query-specific user interactions on a search engine.",
        "One commonly used clickthrough feature is generated based on the following observation: if a URL receives a large number of first and last clicks across many user sessions, then it indicates that this URL might be a strongly preferred destination of a query.",
        "For example, when a user searches for \"yahoo\", they tend to only click on the URL www.yahoo.com rather than other alternatives.",
        "This results in www.yahoo.com being the first and last clicked URL for the query.",
        "We refer to such behavior as being navigational clicks (NavClicks).",
        "Features that use exact query and URL string matches (e.g., NavClick, IsNextClicked and IsPrevious-Clicked) are referred to as exact match features (ExactM) for the remainder of this paper.",
        "The coverage of ExactM features is sparse, especially for long queries and new URLs.",
        "Many long queries are either unique or very low frequency.",
        "Hence, the improvements from ExactM features are limited to the more popular queries.",
        "In addition, ExactM features tend to be weighted heavily in the ranking of results when they are available.",
        "This introduces a bias where the ranking models tend to strongly favor older URLs over new URLs even when the latter otherwise appear to be more relevant.",
        "By inspecting the clickthrough logs, we observed that unseen query-url pairs are often composed of informative previously observed subsequences.",
        "Specifically, we saw that query n-grams can be correlated with sequences of URL n-grams.",
        "For example, we find that there are interesting regularities across queries and URLs, such as queries containing \"form\" tending to lead to clicks on URLs containing \"pdf\".",
        "This strongly motivates the adoption of an approach similar to the Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique of using n-grams to deal with unseen words.",
        "For example, part-of-speech tagging (Brants, 2000) and parsing (Klein and Manning, 2003) both require dealing with unknown words.",

        "This section describes the detailed methodology used in generating the query-url n-gram features.",
        "Our features require association scores to be previously calculated, and, hence, we first introduce a data mining approach that is used to build an association dictionary in Section 2.1.",
        "Then, we present the procedure used to generate the query-url n-gram features that use the dictionary in Section 2.2.",
        "Figure 1: Steps to build a query-url n-gram dictionary",
        "The steps involved in building the dictionary are shown in Figure 1.",
        "We first collect seed query-url pairs from clickthrough data based on Nav-Clicks.",
        "The queries and URLs from the collected pairs are tokenized and converted into a collection of paired query-url n-grams.",
        "For each pair, we calculate the mutual information of the query n-gram and its corresponding URL n-gram.",
        "For our experiment, we collect a total of more than 15M seed pairs and 0.5B query-url n-gram pairs using six months of query log data.",
        "The details are described in the following sections.",
        "We identify the seed list based on characteristic user click behavior.",
        "Given a query, we select the URL with the most NavClicks as compared to other URLs returned.",
        "During data collection, the rank positions of the top 5 URLs were shuffled to avoid the position bias.",
        "We aggregate NavClicks for a URL occurring in these positions in order to both obtain more click data and to avoid the position bias issue discussed in Dupret and Piwowarski (2008) and Craswell et al.",
        "(2008).",
        "For example, in Figure 1, the numbers of Nav-Clicks for the top three URLs are shown.",
        "The URL www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040.pdf receives the largest number of NavClicks, and, therefore, it is used to create the query-url pair:",
        "We segment the seed pairs to n-gram pairs in order to increase the coverage beyond that of ExactM click features.",
        "Within NLP, n-grams are typically extracted such that words that are adjacent in the original sequence are also adjacent in the extracted n-grams.",
        "Furthermore, we attempt to achieve additional generalization by using skip n-grams (Lin and Och, 2004).",
        "This means we not only extract n-grams for adjacent terms but also for sequences that leave out intermediate terms.",
        "This is motivated by the observation that the semantics of user queries is often preserved even when some intermediate terms are removed.",
        "The details of the segmentation methods are described below.",
        "Prior to query segmentation, we normalize raw queries by replacing punctuations with spaces.",
        "Queries are then segmented into a sequence of space delimited tokens.",
        "From these, we extract all possible query n-grams and skip n-grams for n smaller than or equal to three (i.e., all unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams).",
        "For example, given the sequence \"irs 1040 form\" the adjacent bigrams would be \"irs 1040\" and \"1040 form\".",
        "With skip n-grams we also extract \"irs form\" as shown in Table 1.",
        "We do not use n-grams longer than 3 in order to avoid problems with overfitting.",
        "We will refer to this segmentation method as Affix Segmentation.",
        "Table 1: An Example of Affix Segmentation",
        "As shown in Table 2, after the queries are segmented, URLs are categorized into four groups: domain, URL language, URL region and URL path.",
        "In general, a URL is delimited by punctuation characters such as \"?",
        "\", \"/\", and \"=\".",
        "Table 2: An Example of URL Segmentation",
        "The domain group includes one domain token, for example, irs.gov.",
        "Although domains could be divided into multiple n-grams, we treat them as a single unit, with the exception of encoded language and region information.",
        "The language and region groups are based on the language or region part of the URL n-grams such as the suffixes \".en\" and \".de\".",
        "The language and region of a URL n-gram are identified by a table lookup method.",
        "The table is created based on the information available at en.wikipedia.org/ wiki/List of ISO 639-1 codes and en.wikipedia.",
        "org/wiki/ISO 3166.",
        "When there is no clear language or region URL n-gram, we use English (en) as the default language and United States (us) as the default region.",
        "After query and URL n-grams are extracted, we calculate mutual information (Gale and Church, 1991) to determine the degree of association between the n-grams.",
        "The definition of query-url n-gram mutual information (MI) is given in Equation 1.",
        "Here q corresponds to a query n-gram and u corresponds to a URL n-gram.",
        "Freq (q) is the count of q in the seed list normalized by the total number of q. Freq (u) is the count of u normalized by the total number of u. Freq (q, u) is the count of q and u that co-occurred in a full query-url pair normalized by the total number of q and u.",
        "A pair will be assigned to a MI score of zero if the items occur together no more than expected by chance, under the assumption that the two items are statistically independent.",
        "When a pair occurs more than is expected by chance, the MI score is positive.",
        "On the other hand, if a pair occurs together less than is expected by chance, the mutual information score is negative.",
        "In order to increase the confidence of the MI scores, we remove all n-grams with less than 3 occurrences in the seed list, and assign a zero MI score for any pairs involving these n-grams.",
        "No smoothing is applied.",
        "This scoring scheme fits well with the association properties we would like to have for our query-url n-gram click features.",
        "If a query n-gram cues for a certain URL through one of its n-grams, the feature will take on a positive value.",
        "Similarly, if a query n-gram cues against a certain URL, the feature will take on a negative value.",
        "By examining our dictionary, we observed a number of pairs that are interesting from a relevance ranking perspective.",
        "To illustrate, we present four examples of n-gram pairs and intuitively explore the nature of the n-gram associations in the dictionary.",

        "First, let's examine the association between query n-grams and URL n-grams for the queries \"iphone\" and \"iphone plan\".",
        "Notice that the query unigram \"iphone\" is strongly associated with apple.com, but negatively associated with amazon.com.",
        "This can be explained by the fact that \"iphone\" as a product is not only developed by Apple but also strongly associated with the Apple brand.",
        "In contrast, while Amazon.com sells iphones, it also sells a large variety of other products, thus is not regarded as a very authoritative source of information about the \"iphone\".",
        "However, by adding additional context, the most preferred URL according to MI can change.",
        "The two examples in the bottom of Table 3 illustrate the URL preferences for the query bigram \"iphone plan\".",
        "While apple.com is still a strongly preferred destination, there is a much stronger preference for att.com.",
