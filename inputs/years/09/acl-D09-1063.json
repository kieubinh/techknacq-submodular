        "Sentiment analysis involves determining the opinions and private states (beliefs, emotions, speculations, and so on) of the speaker (Wiebe, 1994).",
        "It has received significant attention in recent years due to increasing online opinion content and applications in tasks such as automatic product recommendation systems (Tatemura, 2000; Terveen et al., 1997), question answering (Somasundaran et al., 2007; Lita et al., 2005), and summarizing multiple view points (Seki et al., 2004) and opinions (Mohammad et al., 2008a).",
        "A crucial sub-problem is to determine whether positive or negative sentiment is expressed.",
        "Automatic methods for this often make use of lexicons of words tagged with positive and negative semantic orientation (Turney, 2002; Wilson et al., 2005; Pang and Lee, 2008).",
        "A word is said to have a positive semantic orientation (SO) (or polarity) if it is often used to convey favorable sentiment or evaluation of the topic under discussion.",
        "Some example words that have positive semantic orientation are excellent, happy, honest, and so on.",
        "Similarly, a word is said to have negative semantic orientation if it is often used to convey unfavorable sentiment or evaluation of the target.",
        "Examples include poor, sad, and dishonest.",
        "Certain semantic orientation lexicons have been manually compiled for English – the most notable being the General Inquirer (GI) (Stone et al., 1966).",
        "However, the GI lexicon has orientation labels for only about 3,600 entries.",
        "The Pittsburgh subjectivity lexicon (PSL) (Wilson et al., 2005), which draws from the General Inquirer and other sources, also has semantic orientation labels, but only for about 8,000 words.",
        "Automatic approaches to creating a semantic orientation lexicon and, more generally, approaches for word-level sentiment annotation can be grouped into two kinds: (1) those that rely on manually created lexical resources – most of which use WordNet (Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004; Hu and Liu, 2004; Kamps et al., 2004; Taka-mura et al., 2005; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006; An-",

        "Many of these lexicons, such as SentiWordNet (SWN) (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006) were created using supervised classifiers and significant manual annotation, whereas others such as the Turney and Littman lexicon (TLL) (2003) were created from very large corpora (more than 100 billion words).",
        "In contrast, we propose a computationally inexpensive method to compile a high-coverage semantic orientation lexicon without the use of any text corpora or manually annotated semantic orientation labels.",
        "Both of these resources may be used, if available, to further improve results.",
        "The lexicon has about twenty times the number of entries in the GI lexicon, and it includes entries for both individual words and common multiword expressions.",
        "The method makes use of a Roget-like thesaurus and a handful of antonym-generating affix patterns.",
        "Whereas thesauri have long been used to estimate semantic distance (lar-masz and Szpakowicz, 2003; Mohammad and Hirst, 2006), the closest thesaurus-based work on sentiment analysis is by Aman and Szpakowicz (2007) on detecting emotions such as happiness, sadness, and anger.",
        "We evaluated our thesaurus-based algorithm both intrinsically and extrinsically and show that the semantic orientation lexicon it generates has significantly more correct entries than the state-of-the-art high-coverage lexicon SentiWordNet, and that it has a significantly higher coverage than the General Inquirer and Turney-Littman lexicons.",
        "In Section 2 we examine related work.",
        "Section 3 presents our algorithm for creating semantic orientation lexicons.",
        "We describe intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation experiments in Section 4, followed by a discussion of the results in Section 5.",

        "Good visualizations are not only effective in presenting information to the user, but also help us better understand our algorithm.",

        "(About 66.8% of MSOL(ASL) words are positive, whereas only 33.2% are negative.)",
        "This suggests that there are many more near-synonyms of positive words than near-synonyms of negative ones, and so there are many more forms for expressing positive sentiments than forms for expressing negative sentiment.",
        "Some of the errors in MSOL were due to non-antonymous instantiations of the affix patterns.",
        "For example, immigrate is not antonymous to migrate.",
        "Other errors occur because occasionally the words in the same thesaurus paragraph have differing semantic orientations.",
        "For example, one paragraph has the words slender and slim (which, many will agree, are positive) as well as the words wiry and lanky (which many will deem negative).",
        "Both these kinds of errors can be mitigated using a complementary source of information, such as cooccurrence with other known positive and negative words (the Turney-Littman method).",
        "Theoretically, a much larger Turney-Littman lexicon can be created even though it may be computationally intensive when working with 100 billion words.",
        "However, MSOL and TLL are created from different sources of information – MSOL from overtly marked words and a thesaurus, and TLL from co-occurrence information.",
        "Therefore, a combination of the two approaches is expected to produce an even more accurate semantic orientation lexicon, even with a modest-sized corpus at its disposal.",
        "This is especially attractive for low resource languages.",

        "In recent years, there have been substantial developments in the field of information visualization, and it is becoming increasingly clear that good visualizations can not only convey information quickly, but are also an important tool for gaining insight into an algorithm, detecting systematic errors, and understanding the task.",
        "In this section, we present some preliminary visualizations that are helping us understand our approach beyond the evaluations described above.",
        "As discussed in Section 3.1.1, the affix seeds set connects the thesaurus words with opposite semantic orientation.",
        "Usually these pairs of words occur in different thesaurus categories, but this is not necessary.",
        "We can think of these connections as relationships of contrast in meaning and semantic orientation, not just between the two words but also between the two categories.",
        "To better aid our understanding of the automatically determined category relationships we visualized this network using the Fruchterman-Reingold force-directed graph layout algorithm (Fruchterman and Reingold, 1991) and the NodeXL network analysis tool (Smith et al., 2009).",

        "Further inspection revealed that these categories have a large number of words within them.",

        "The lexicon has about twenty times as many entries as in the General Inquirer and the Turney-Littman lexicons, and includes entries for both individual words and common multi-word expressions.",
        "Experiments show that it has significantly more correct entries than SentiWordNet.",
        "The approach is complementary to that of Turney and Littman (2003) and a combination of this approach with co-occurrence statistics (even if drawn from a modest sized corpus) is expected to yield an even better lexicon.",
        "Visualization of the thesaurus categories as per the semantic orientations assigned to them by our algorithm reveals that affix patterns produce a strongly connected graph and that indeed there are many long chains of positive and negative categories.",
        "Furthermore, the key categories of this graph (the ones with high centrality and closeness) are strongly evaluative in nature, and most of them tend to have negative semantic orientation.",
