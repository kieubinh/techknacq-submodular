        "As the two technologies are complementary in many ways, an interesting research topic is how to combine the strengths of the two methods.",
        "Many research efforts have been made to address this issue, which can be summarized into two ideas.",
        "One is to add syntax into phrase-based model while another one is to enhance syntax-based model to handle non-syntactic phrases.",
        "In this paper, we bring forward the first idea by studying the issue of how to utilize structured syntactic features for phrase reordering in a phrase-based SMT system with BTG (Bracketing Transduction Grammar) constraints (Wu, 1997).",
        "Word and phrase reordering is a crucial component in a SMT system.",
        "In syntax-based method, word reordering is implicitly addressed by translation rules, thus the performance is subject to parsing errors to a large extent (zhang et al., 2007a) and the impact of syntax on reordering is difficult to single out (Li et al., 2007).",
        "In phrase-based method, local word reordering can be effectively captured by phrase pairs directly while local phrase reordering is explicitly modeled by phrase reordering model and distortion model.",
        "Recently, many phrase reordering methods have been proposed, ranging from simple distance-based distortion model (Koehn et al., 2003; Och",
        "Zens et al., 2004), lexicalized reordering model (Tillmann, 2004; Kumar and Byrne, 2005), to hierarchical phrase-based model (Chiang, 2005; Setiawan et al., 2007) and classifier-based reordering model with linear features (Zens and Ney, 2006; Xiong et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2007a; Xiong et al., 2008).",
        "However, one of the major limitations of these advances is the structured syntactic knowledge, which is important to global reordering (Li et al., 2007; Elming, 2008), has not been well exploited.",
        "This makes the phrase-based method particularly weak in handling global phrase reordering.",
        "From machine learning viewpoint (Vapnik, 1995), it is computationally infeasible to explicitly generate features involving structured information in many NLP applicaProceedings of the 2009 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 698-707, Singapore, 6-7 August 2009.",
        "©2009 ACL and AFNLP tions.",
        "For example, one cannot enumerate efficiently all the sub-tree features for a full parse tree.",
        "This would be the reason why structured features are not fully utilized in previous statistical feature-based phrase reordering model.",
        "Thanks to the nice property of kernel-based machine learning method that can implicitly explore (structured) features in a high dimensional feature space (Vapnik, 1995), in this paper we propose using convolution tree kernel (Haussler, structured syntactic knowledge for phrase reordering and further combine the tree kernel with other diverse linear features into a composite kernel to strengthen the model's predictive ability.",
        "Indeed, using tree kernel methods to mine structured knowledge has shown success in some NLP applications like parsing (Collins and Duffy,",
        "Zhang et al., 2007b), relation extraction (Zhang et al., 2006), pronoun resolution (Yang et al., 2006) and question classification (Zhang and Lee, 2003).",
        "However, to our knowledge, such technique still remains unexplored for phrase reordering.",
        "In this paper, we look into the phrase reordering problem in two aspects: 1) how to model and optimize structured features, and 2) how to combine the structured features with other linear features and further integrate them into the loglinear model-based translation framework.",
        "Our study shows that: 1) the structured syntactic features are very useful and 2) our kernel-based model can well explore diverse knowledge, including previously-used linear features and the structured syntactic features, for phrase reordering.",
        "Our model displays one advantage over the previous work that it is able to utilize the structured syntactic features without the need for extensive feature engineering in decoding a parse tree into a set of linear syntactic features.",
        "To have a more insightful evaluation, we design three experiments with three different evaluation metrics.",
        "Experimental results on the NIST MT-2005 Chinese-English translation tasks show that our method statistically significantly outperforms the baseline methods in term of the three different evaluation metrics.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",

        "LM score is certainly a strong evidence for modeling word orders and lexical selection.",
        "Although it is already used as a standalone feature in the log-linear model, we also would like to explicitly re-optimize it together with other reordering features in our reordering model.",
        "3.4 Tree Kernel, Composite Kernel and Integrating into our Reordering Model",
        "As discussed before, we use convolution tree kernel to capture the structured syntactic feature implicitly by directly computing similarity between the parse-tree representations of two reordering instances with explicitly enumerating all the features one by one.",
        "In convolution tree kernel (Collins and Duffy, 2001), a parse tree T is implicitly represented by a vector of integer counts of each sub-tree type (regardless of its ancestors):",
        "where # subtree(T) is the occurrence number of the ith sub-tree type (subtree^) in T. Since the number of different sub-trees is exponential with the parse tree size, it is computationally infeasible to directly use the feature vector ^(T) .",
        "To solve this computational issue, Collins and Duffy (2001) proposed the following parse tree kernel to calculate the dot product between the above high dimensional vectors implicitly.",
        "where N1 and N2 are the sets of nodes in trees T1 and T2, respectively, and Isubtree.",
        "(n) is a function that is 1 iff the subtree occurs with root at node n and zero otherwise, and A(n^ n2) is the number of the common subtrees rooted at n1 and n2, i.e.,",
        "A(n, n2 ) can be further computed efficiently by the following recursive rules: Rule 1: if the productions (CFG rules) at n1 and",
        "n2 are different, A(n1, n2) = 0; Rule 2: else if both n1 and n2 are pre-terminals the jth child of node n andl(0<2<1) is the decay factor in order to make the kernel value less variable with respect to the subtree sizes.",
        "In addition, the recursive Rule 3 holds because given two nodes with the same children, one can construct common sub-trees using these children and common sub-trees of further offspring.",
        "The time complexity for computing this kernel is O(| N1 | • | N2 |) and in practice in near to linear computational time without the need of enumerating all subtree features.",
        "In our study, the linear feature-based similarity is simply calculated using dot-product.",
        "We then define the following composite kernel to combine the structured features-based and the linear features-based similarities:",
        "where Kt is the tree kernel over the structured features and K is the linear kernel (dot-product) over the linear features.",
        "The composite kernel Kc is a linear combination of the two individual kernels, where the coefficient a is set to its default value 0.3 as that in Moschitti (2004)'s implementation.",
        "The kernels return the similarities between two reordering instances based on their features used.",
        "Our basic assumption is, the more similar the two reordering instances of x1 and x2are, the more chance they share the same order.",
        "Now let us see how to integrate the kernel functions into SVM.",
        "The linear classifier learned by SVM is formulized as:",
        "f(x) = sgn(Z, y,a,x^ x, + b) (4)where ai is the weight of a support vector xi (i.e., a support reordering instance xt = {y4,^}in our study), yi is its class label (1: straight or 1: inverted in our study) and b is the intercept of the hyperplane.",
        "An input reordering instance x is classified as positive (negative) if f (x) >0 ( f ( x)<0).",
        "Based on the linear classifier, a kernelized SVM can be easily implemented by simply replacing the dot product x * xi in Eq (4) with a kernel function K(x, xi ) .",
        "Thus, the kernelized SVM classifier is formulated as: f ( x ) = sgn(Z iyiaiK ( x, xx ) + b) (5) reordering model (implemented by the kerne-lized SVM) can be formulized as follows:",
        "A reordering instance x is classified as straight (or inverted) if psvm(o\\x) >0 (or psvm(o\\x) < 0 ).",
        "Eq (6) and Eq (2) show the difference between our kernalized SVM-based reordering model and the MaxEnt-based reordering model.",
        "The main difference between them lies in that our model is able to utilize structured syntactic features by kernalized SVM while the previous work can only use lexicalized word features by MaxEnt-based classifier.",
        "Finally, because the return value of Psvm(°\\x) is a distance function rather than a probability, we use a sigmoid function to convert Psvm(°\\x) to a posterior probability as shown using the following to functions and apply it as one feature to the log-linear model in the decoding.",
