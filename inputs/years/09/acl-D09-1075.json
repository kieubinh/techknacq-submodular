        "Tokenizing a parallel corpus is usually the first step of training a statistical machine translation system.",
        "With languages such as Chinese, which has no spaces in its writing system, the main challenge is to segment sentences into appropriate tokens.",
        "With languages such as Korean and Hungarian, although the writing systems of both languages incorporate spaces between \"words\", the granularity is too coarse compared with languages such as English.",
        "A single word in these languages is composed of several morphemes, which often correspond to separate words in English.",
        "These languages also form compound nouns more freely.",
        "Ideally, we want to find segmentations for source and target languages that create a one-to-one mapping of words.",
        "However, this is not always straightforward for two major reasons.",
        "First, what the optimal tokenization for machine translation should be is not always clear.",
        "Zhang et al. (2008b) and Chang et al. (2008) show that getting the tokenization of one of the languages in the corpus close to a gold standard does not necessarily help with building better machine translation systems.",
        "Second, even statistical methods require hand-annotated training data, which means that in resource-poor languages, good tokenization is hard to achieve.",
        "In this paper, we explore unsupervised methods for tokenization, with the goal of automatically finding an appropriate tokenization for machine translation.",
        "We compare methods that have access to parallel corpora to methods that are trained solely using data from the source language.",
        "Unsupervised monolingual segmentation has been studied as a model of language acquisition (Goldwater et al., 2006), and as model of learning morphology in European languages (Goldsmith, 2001).",
        "Unsupervised segmentation using bilingual data has been attempted for finding new translation pairs (Kikui and Yamamoto, 2002), and for finding good segmentation for Chinese in machine translation using Gibbs sampling (Xu et al., 2008).",
        "In this paper, further investigate the use of bilingual information to find tokenizations tailored for machine translation.",
        "We find a benefit not only for segmentation of languages with no space in the writing system (such as Chinese), but also for the smaller-scale tokenization problem of normalizing between languages that include more or less information in a \"word\" as defined by the writing system, using Korean-English for our experiments.",
        "Here too, we find a benefit from using bilingual information, with unsupervised segmentation rivaling and in some cases surpassing supervised segmentation.",
        "On the modeling side, we use dynamic programming-based variational Bayes, making Gibbs sampling unnecessary.",
        "We also develop and compare various factors in the model to control the length of the tokens learned, and find a benefit from adjusting these parameters directly to optimize the end-to-end translation quality."

        "For relatively isolating languages such as English and Chinese, a word generally equals a single token, which is usually a clearly identifiable unit.",
        "English, especially, incorporates spaces between words in its writing system, which makes tokenization in English usually trivial.",
        "The Chinese writing system does not have spaces between words, but there is less ambiguity where word boundaries lie in a given sentence compared to more agglutinative languages.",
        "In languages such as Hungarian, Japanese, and Korean, what constitutes an optimal token boundary is more ambiguous.",
        "While two tokens are usually considered two separate words in English, this may be not be the case in agglutinative languages.",
        "Although what is considered a single morphological unit is different from language to language, if someone were given a task to align words between two languages, it is desirable to have one-to-one token mapping between two languages in order to have the optimal problem space.",
        "For machine translation, one token should not necessarily correspond to one morphological unit, but rather should reflect the morphological units and writing system of the other language involved in translation.",
        "For example, consider a Korean \"word\" meok-eoss-da, which means ate.",
        "It is written as a single word in Korean but consists of three morphemes eat-past-indicative.",
        "If one uses morphological analysis as the basis for Korean tokenization, meok-eoss-da would be split into three tokens, which is not desirable if we are translating Korean to English, since English does not have these morphological counterparts.",
        "However, a Hungarian word szekrényemben, which means in my closet, consists of three morphemes closet-my-inessive that are distinct words in English.",
        "In this case, we do want our tokenizer to split this \"word\" into three morphemes szekrény em ben.",
        "In this paper, we use segmentation and tokenization interchangeably as blanket terms to cover the two different problems we have presented here.",
        "The problem of segmenting Chinese sentences into words and the problem of segmenting Korean or Hungarian \"words\" into tokens of right granularity are different in their nature.",
        "However, our models presented in section 3 handle the both problems."

        "We use IBM Model 1 (Brown et al., 1993) for the word alignment model.",

This can be addressed by applying dynamic programing over the sequence s. We compute the posterior probability of a word beginning at position i, ending at position j, and being generated by English word k:",
        "where / = the word formed by concatenating characters i through j, and a is a variable indicating which English position generated /.",

        "Our model can be compared to a hidden Markov model in the following way: a target word generates a source token which spans a zeroth order Markov chain of characters in source sentence, where a \"transition\" represents a segmentation and a \"emission\" represents an alignment.",

        "Our rationale for this model is that if a span of characters f = Ci... Cj is an independent token, it will occur often enough in different contexts that such a span of characters will have higher probability than other spans of characters that are not meaningful.",
        "For the rest of the paper, this model will be referred to as the monolingual model.",
        "Since the monolingual tokenization only uses information from a monolingual corpus, tokenizing new data is not a problem.",
        "However, with the bilingual model, we are learning P(f | e).",

        "Lastly, F-scores of Chinese segmentations compared against the gold standard shows higher segmentation accuracy does not necessarily lead to higher BLEU score.",
        "F-scores presented in Table 1 are not directly comparable for all different experiments because the test data (Chinese Treebank) is used in training for some of the supervised segmenters, but these numbers do show how close unsupervised segmentations are to the gold standard.",
        "It is interesting to note that our highest unsupervised segmentation result does make use of bilingual information.",
        "Sample tokenization results for Korean-English experiments are presented in Figure 3.",
        "We observe that different configurations produce different tokenizations, and the bilingual model produced generally better tokenizations for translation compared to the monolingual models or the supervised tokenizer.",
        "In this example, the tokenization obtained from the supervised tokenizer, although morphologically correct, is too fine-grained for the purpose of translation to English.",
        "For example, it correctly tokenized the attributive suffix i n however, this is not desirable since English has no such counterpart.",
        "Both variations of the monolingual tokenization have errors such as incorrectly not segmenting à^i gyeol-gwa-reul, which is a compound of a noun and a case marker, into à gyeol-gwaureul as the bilingual model was able to do.",
        "We have shown that unsupervised tokenization for machine translation is feasible and can outperform rule-based methods that rely on lexical analysis, or supervised statistical segmentations.",
        "The approach can be applied both to morphological analysis of Korean and the segmentation of sentences into words for Chinese, which may at first glace appear to be quite different problems.",
        "We have only shown how our methods can be applied to one language of the pair, where one language is generally isolating and the other is generally synthetic.",
        "However, our methods could be extended to tokenization for both languages by iterating between languages.",
        "We also used the most simple word-alignment model, but more complex word alignment models could be incorporated into our bilingual model."
