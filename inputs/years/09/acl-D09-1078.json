        "Statistical language models are potentially useful for any language technology task that produces natural-language text as a final (or intermediate) output.",
        "In particular, they are extensively used in speech recognition and machine translation.",
        "Despite the criticism that they ignore the structure of natural language, simple N-gram models, which estimate the probability of each word in a text string based on the N – 1 preceding words, remain the most widely-used type of model.",
        "Until the late 1990s, N-gram language models of order higher than trigrams were seldom used.",
        "This was due, at least in part, to the fact the amounts of training data available did not produce significantly better results from higher-order models.",
        "Since that time, however, increasingly large amounts of language model training data have become available ranging from approximately one billion words (the Gigaword corpora from the Linguistic Data Consortium) to trillions of words (Brants et al., 2007).",
        "With these larger resources, the use of language models based on 5-grams to 7-grams is becoming increasingly common.",
        "The problem we address here is that, even when relatively modest amounts of training data are used, high-order N-gram language models estimated by standard techniques can be impractically large.",
        "Hence, we investigate ways of building high-order N-gram language models without dramatically increasing model size.",
        "This is, of course, the same goal behind much previous work on language model pruning, including that of Seymore and Rosenfeld (1996), Stolcke (1998), and Goodman and Gao (2000).",
        "We take a novel approach, however, which we refer to as significance-based N-gram selection.",
        "We reject a higher-order estimate of the probability of a particular word in a particular context whenever the distribution of observations for the higher-order estimate provides no evidence that the higher-order estimate is better than our backoff estimate.",
        "Perhaps our most surprising result is that significance-based N-gram selection not only reduces language model size, but it also improves perplexity when applied to a number of widely-used smoothing methods, including Katz backoff and several variants of absolute discounting.",
        "In contrast, experiments applying previous pruning methods to Katz backoff (Seymore and Rosen-feld, 1996; Stolcke, 1998) and absolute discounting (Goodman and Gao, 2000) always found the lowest perplexity model to be the unpruned model.",
        "We tested significance-based selection on only one smoothing method without obtaining improved perplexity: modified Kneser-Ney (KN)",

        "This is unfortunate, because modified KN smoothing generally seems to have the lowest perplexity of any known smoothing method for N-gram language models; in our tests it had a lower perplexity than any of the other models, with or without significance-based N-gram selection.",
        "However, when we compared modified KN smoothing to our best results applying N-gram selection to other smoothing methods for multiple N-gram orders, two of our models outperformed modified KN in terms of perplexity for a given model size.",
        "Of course, the trade-off between perplexity and model size for modified KN can also be improved by pruning.",
        "So, in a final set of experiments we found the best combinations we could for pruned modified KN models, and we did the same for our best model using significance-based selection.",
        "The best pruning method for the latter turned out to be a novel modification of weighted-difference pruning (Seymore and Rosenfeld, 1996) that was especially convenient to compute given our method for performing significance-based N-gram selection.",
        "The final result is that our best model using significance-based selection and modified weighted difference pruning always had a better size/perplexity trade-off than pruned modified KN, with up to about 8% perplexity reduction for a given model size."

        "The idea of using a statistical test to decide whether to use a higher-or lower-order estimate of an N-gram probablity is not new.",
        "It was perhaps first proposed by Ron, et al.",
        "(1996), who suggested using a threshold on relative entropy (Kullback-Liebler divergence) as an appropriate test to decide whether to extend the context used to predict the next token in a sequence.",
        "Stolcke (1998) used the same metric in his work on language model pruning, and he also pointed out that weighted difference pruning is, in fact, an approximation of relative entropy pruning.",
        "However, while relative entropy pruning is based on a statistical test, it is not a significance test.",
        "The difference in probability represented by a certain relative entropy value can be statistically significant when measured on a large corpus, but not significant when measured on a small corpus.",
        "The primary test we use to choose between higher-or lower-order estimates of an N-gram probablity is inspired by an insight of Jedynak and Khudanpur (2005).",
        "They note that, given a set of y observations of a multinomial distribution, the observed counts will have the highest proba-bilty of any possible set of y observations for the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) model derived from the relative frequencies of those observations.",
        "In general, however, the MLE model will not be the only model for which this set of observations is the most probable set of y observations.",
        "Jedynak and Khudanpur call the set of such models the maximum likelihood set (MLS) for the observations.",
        "Jedynak and Khudanpur argue that the observations alone do not support choosing the MLE over other members of the MLS.",
        "The MLE may assign the observations a higher probability than other members of the MLS, but that may be an accident of what outcomes are possible given the number of observations.",
        "If we flip a coin 9 times and get 5 heads, is there any reason to believe that the probability of heads is closer to the MLE 5/9 than it is to 5/10?",
        "No, because 5/9 is as close as we can come to 5/10, given 9 observations.",
        "We apply this insight to the problem of N-gram selection as follows: For each word wnin a context w\\...wn-\\ with a backoff estimate for the probability of that word in that context ßp(wn\\w2-■ -Wn-i), we do not include an explicit estimate of p{wn\\wi...wn-\\) in our model, if the backoff estimate is within the MLS of the counts for w\\...wn and w\\...wn-\\.",
        "This requires finding the MLS of a set of observations only for binomial distributions (rather than the general multinomial distributions studied by Jedynak and Khudanpur), which has a very simple solution:",
        "where x is the count ïor w\\...wn, y is the count for w\\...wn-\\, and p is a possible backoff probabilty estimate for p(wn\\w\\...wn-i).",
        "In this case, the MLS is the set of binomial distributions that have x successes as their mode given y trials, which is well-known to be specified by this formula.",
        "We describe this method as \"significance-based\" because we can consider our criterion as a significance test in which we take the backoff probability estimate as the null hypothesis for the estimate in the higher-order model, and we set the rejection threshold to the lowest possible value; we reject the null hypothesis (the backoff probability) if there are any outcomes for the given number of trials that are more likely, according to the null hypothesis, than the one we observed.",
        "We make a few refinements to this basic idea.",
        "First, we never add an explicit higher-order estimate to our model, if the next lower-order estimate is not explicitly stored in the model.",
        "This enables us to keep only the next lower-order model available while performing N-gram selection.",
        "Next, we observe that in some cases the higher-order estimate for p(wn\\wi...wn-\\) may not fall within the MLS for the observed counts, due to smoothing.",
        "In this case, we prefer the backoff probability estimate if it lies within the MLS or between the smoothed higher-order estimate and the MLS.",
        "Otherwise, we would reject the backoff estimate for being outside the MLS, only to replace it with a higher-order estimate even farther outside the MLS.",
        "Finally, we note that the backoff probability estimate for an N-gram not observed in the training data sometimes falls outside the corresponding MLS, which in the 0-count case simplifies to",
        "When this happens, we include an explicit higher-order estimate p{wn\\wi...wn-\\) = l/(y + 1), which is the upper limit of the MLS.",
        "This is similar to Rosenfeld and Huang's (1993) \"confidence interval capping\" method for reducing unreasonably high backoff estimates for unobserved N-grams.",
        "In order to apply this treatment of 0-count N-grams, we sort the explicitly-stored N-grams for each backoff context by decreasing probability.",
        "For each higher-order context, to find the 0-count N-grams subject to the l/(y + 1) limit, we traverse the sorted list of explicitly-stored N-grams for its backoff context.",
        "When we encounter an N-gram whose extension to the higher-order context was not observed in the training data, we give it an explicit probability of l/(y +1), if its weighted backoff probability is greater than that.",
        "We stop the traversal as soon as we encounter an N-gram for the backoff context that has a weighted backoff probability less than or equal to 1/(y+1), which in practice means we actually examine only a small number of backoff probabilities for each context."

        "The approach described above is very attractive from a theoretical perspective, but it has one practical complication.",
        "To decide which N-grams for each context to explicitly include in the higher-order model, we need to know the backoff weight for the context, but we cannot compute the backoff weight until we know exactly which higher-order N-grams are included in the model.",
        "We address this problem by iteratively solving for a backoff weight that yields a normalized probability distribution.",
        "For each context, we guess an initial value for the backoff weight and keep track of the sum of the probabilités resulting from applying our N-gram selection method with that backoff weight.",
        "If the sum is greater than 1.0, by more than a convergence threshold, we reduce the estimated backoff weight and iterate.",
        "If the sum is less than 1.0, by more than the threshold, we increase the estimated weight and iterate.",
        "It is easy to see that, for all standard smoothing methods, the function from backoff weights to probability sums is piecewise linear.",
        "Within a region where no decision changes about which N-grams to include in the model, the probability sum is a linear function of the backoff weight.",
        "At values of the backoff weight where the set of selected N-grams changes, the function can be dis-continous.",
        "With a little more effort, one can see that the linear segments overlap with respect to the probability sum in such a way that there will always be one or more values of the backoff weight that make the probability sum equal 1.0, with one specific exception.",
        "The exception arises because of the capping of backoff probabilités for unobserved N-grams.",
        "It is possible for there to be a context for which all observed N-grams are included in the higher-order model, the probabilities for all unobserved N-grams are either capped at l/(y + 1) or effectively 0 due to arithmetic underflow, and the probability sum is less than 1.0.",
        "For some smoothing methods, the probability sum cannot be increased in this situation by increasing the backoff weight.",
        "We check for this situation, and if it arises, we increase the cap on the 0-count probability just enough to make the probability sum equal 1.0.",
        "That exception aside, we iteratively find backoff weights as follows: For an initial estimate of the backoff weight for a context, we compute what the backoff weight would be for the base smoothing method without N-gram selection.",
        "If that value is less than 1.0, we use it as our initial estimate, otherwise we use 1.0, which annec-dotally seems to produce better models than initial estimates greater than 1.0, in situations where there are multiple solutions.",
        "If the first iteration of N-gram selection produces a probability sum less than 1.0, we repeatedly double the estimated backoff weight until we obtain a sum greater than or equal to 1.0, or we encounter the special situation previously described.",
        "If the initial probability sum is greater than 1.0, we repeatedly halve the estimated backoff weight until we obtain a sum less than or equal to 1.0.",
        "Once we have values for the backoff weight that produce probability sums on both sides of 1.0, we have a solution bracketed, and we can use standard numerical search techniques to find that solution.",
        "At every subsequent iteration, we try a value for the backoff weight between the largest value we have tried that produces a sum less than 1.0 and the smallest value we have tried that produces a sum greater than 1.0.",
        "We stop when the difference between these values of the backoff weight is less than a convergence threshold.",
        "We use a combination of simple techniques to choose the next value of the backoff weight to try.",
        "The primary technique we use is called the \"false position method\", which basically solves the linear equation defined by the two current bracketing values and corresponding probability sums.",
        "The advantage of this method is that, if our bracketing points lie on the same linear segment of our function, we obtain a solution in one step.",
        "The disadvantage of the method is that it sometimes approaches the solution by a long sequence of tiny steps from the same side.",
        "We try to detect the latter situation by keeping track of the number of consecutive iterations that make a step in the same direction.",
        "If this number reaches 10, we take the next step by the bisection method, which simply tries the value of the backoff weight halfway between our two current bracketing values.",

        "The concept of significance-based N-gram selection to produce smaller models could be extended by relaxing our criterion for using backoff distributions in place of explicit higher-order probability estimates, but true significance tests at more relaxed thresholds that are accurate for small counts are expensive to compute; so we resort to more conventional language model pruning methods.",
        "In our experiments, we tried four methods for additional pruning: simple count cutoffs, relative entropy pruning (REP) (Stolcke, 1998), and two modified versions of Seymore and Rosenfeld's (1996) weighted-difference pruning (WDP).",
        "In the notation we have been using, Seymore and Rosenfeld's WDP criterion for using a backoff estimate, in place of an explicit higher-order estimate, is that the quantity be less than a pruning threshold, where K is the Good-Turing-discounted training set count for w\\...wn, and ßu is the backoff weight for the un-pruned model.",

        "The second modification to WDP is that we use the absolute value of the difference of the log probabilities.",
        "By using the signed difference of the log probabilities, Seymore and Rosenfeld will always prune a higher-order probability estimate if it is less than the backoff estimate.",

        "We do this because, if the backoff weight is changed significantly by pruning, backoff estimates that meet the pruning criterion with the old backoff weight may no longer meet the criterion with the new backoff weight, and vice versa.",
        "Since the new backoff weight is the one that will be used in the pruned model, that seems to be the one that should be used to make pruning decisions.",
        "Our second variant of modified WDP is like the first, but it estimates p{w\\...wn) simply by dividing Seymore and Rosenfeld's discounted N-gram count K by the total number of highest-order N-grams in the training corpus.",

        "This allows the interpolation weights to be set independently of the discounts D, with the backoff weights being adjusted to normalize the resulting distributions.",
        "The motivation for this is to let the D parameters correct for potential overestimation of the probabilities for observed N-grams, while the ö parameter (which determines the a and ß interpolation parameters) somewhat independently corrects for quantization errors caused by the fact that only certain probabilities can be derived from integer observed counts, even after discounting, ö is interprétable as the estimated mean quantization error for each distinct count for a given context.",
        "We tested two variants of the new method, (6) one in which the D parameters and the ö parameter are set by fixed criteria, and (7) one in which a single value for all D parameters and the value of the ö parameter are optimized on held-out data.",

        "We believe this is due to the fact that the latter two methods both estimate the joint probabilities by chaining the lower-order conditional probabilities from the fully-smoothed model, which in the case of KN smoothing are designed specifically to cover N-grams that have not been observed, and are poor estimates for the probabilities of lower-order Ngrams that do occcur in the training data.",
        "Finally, we compared the new smoothing method with N-gram selection and modified WDP with fully-smoothed joint probabilities against modified KN smoothing with count cutoffs, using combinations of pruning parameter values and N-gram order that yielded the best size/perplexity trade-offs.",
        "The results are shown in Figure 6.",
        "At all model sizes within the range of these experiments, the new method with significance-based N-gram selection and modified WDP had lower perplexity than modifed KN with count cutoffs – up to about 8% lower at greater pruning levels.",
        "This experiment also suggests that the size/perplexity trade-off is easier to optimize for our new combination of smoothing, N-gram selection, and modified WDP, than for KN smoothing with count cut-offs.",
        "Table 2 shows the perplexity (PP), maximum N-gram length (N), count cutoff (CC), and N-gram lengths to which the count cutoffs are applied (n >) for the points on the curve for pruned KN in Figure 6.",
        "Although some tendencies are discernable, it seems clear that a significant part of the space of combinations of N, CC, and \"n >\" parameter values must be searched to find the best points for trading off perplexity against model size.",

        "We have shown that significance-based N-gram selection can simultaneously reduce both model with N-gram selection and modified WDP size and perplexity when applied to a number of language model smoothing methods, including the widely-used Katz backoff and absolute discounting methods.",
        "We are not aware of any other technique that does this.",
        "We also found that, when combined with a new smoothing method and a novel variant of weighted difference pruning, our N-gram selection method outperformed modified Kneser-Ney smoothing – using the best form of pruning we found for that approach – with respect to the trade-off between model size and model quality.",
        "As our next steps, first, we need to verify that the results obtained on a moderate-sized training corpus are repeatable on much larger corpora.",
        "Second, we plan to extend this work to incorporate language model size reduction by word clustering, which has been shown by Goodman and Gao (2000) to produce additional gains when combined with previous methods of language model pruning.",
