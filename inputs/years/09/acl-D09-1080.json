        "Since speakers repairing their speech once are often under a higher cognitive load and thus more likely to make more serious speech errors (in other words, there is a higher probability of making an error given that an error has already been made (Bard et al., 2001)).",

        "We use the binary result of whether or not each SU is parsable by the HPSG ERG as binary indicator functions in our models.",
        "There has been some work on producing partial parses for utterances for which a full HPSG analysis is not deemed possible by the grammar (Zhang et al., 2007).",
        "This work has shown early promise for identifying coherent substrings within error-ful SUs given subjective analysis; as this technology progresses, HPSG may offer informative sub-sentential features for word-level error analysis as well.",
        "Feature #3 (Rules): Mark unseen phrase rule expansions.",
        "Phrase-based parses are composed of a recursive sequence of non-terminal (NT) rule expansions, such as those detailed for the example parse shown in Figure 3.",
        "These rules are learned from training data such as the Switchboard treebank, where telephone conversation transcripts were manually parsed.",
        "In many statistical parsers, new structures are generated based on the relative frequencies of such rules in the training treebank, conditioned on the terminal words and some local context, and the most probable parse (roughly the joint probability of its rule expansions) is selected.",
        "Because parsers are often required to produce output for words and contexts never seen in the training corpus, smoothing is required.",
        "The Charniak (1999) parser accomplishes this in part through a Markov grammar which works top-down, expanding rules to the left and right of an expansion head M of a given rule.",
        "The nonterminal (NT) M is first predicted from the parent P, then - in order - L\\ through Lm (stopping symbol '#') and R\\ through Rn (again '#'), as shown in Equation 1.",
        "In this manner, it is possible to produce rules never before seen in the training treebank.",
        "While this may be required for parsing grammatical sentences with rare elements, this SU-level error prediction feature indicates whether the automatic parse for a given SU includes an expansion never seen in the training treebank.",
        "If an expansion rule in the one-best parse was not seen in training (here meaning in the SWBD treebank after EDITED nodes have been removed), the implication is that new rule generation is an indicator of a speaker error within a SU.",
        "Feature #4 (C-comm): Mark unseen rule c-commanding NTs.",
        "In X' theory (Chomsky, 1970), lexical categories such as nouns and verbs are often modified by a specifier (such as the DT \"a\" modifying the NN \"lot\" in the NP3 phrase in Figure 3 or an auxiliary verb for a verb in a verb phrase (VBZ for VP 3) and a complement (such as the object of a verb NP3 for VBG in the phrase VP3).",
        "In each of these cases, an NT tree node A has the following relationship with a second NT P:",
        "• Neither does node A dominate P nor node P dominate A, (i.e., neither is directly above the other in the parse tree), and",
        "• Node A immediately precedes P in the tree (precedence is represented graphically in left-to-right order in the tree).",
        "Given these relationships, we say that A locally c-commands P and its descendants.",
        "We further extend this definition to say that, if node A is the only child of node A (a unary expansion) and A locally c-commands P, then A locally c-commands P (so both [SBAR S] and [S NP2 VP2] are c-commanded by VBP).",
        "See Figure 3 for other examples of non-terminal nodes in c-commanding relationships, and the phrase expansion rule they c-command.",
        "The c-command relationship is fundamental in syntactic theory, and has uses such as predicting the scope of pronoun antecedents.",
        "In this case, however, we use it to describe two nodes which are in a specifier-category relationship or a category-complement relationship (e.g., subject-verb and verb-object, respectively).",
        "This is valuable to us because it takes advantage of a weakness of statistical parsers: the context used to condition the probability of a given rule expansion generally does not reach beyond dominance relationships, and thus parsers rarely penalize for the juxtaposition of A c-commanding P and its children as",

        "long as they have previously seen NT type A preceding NT type P. Thus, we can use the children of a parent node P as a way to enrich a NT type P and make it more informative.",
        "For example, in Figure 3, the rule [S – > NP2VP2] is routinely seen in the manual parses of the SWBD treebank, as is [VPi VBP SBAR].",
        "However, it is highly unusual for VBP to immediately precede SBAR or S when this rule expands to NP2 VP2.",
        "So, not only does SBAR/S complement VBP, but a very specific type of [SBAR/S – > NP VP] is the complement of VBP.",
        "This conditional infrequency serves as an indication of deeper structural errors.",
        "Given these category relationship observations, we include in our maximum entropy model a feature indicating whether a given parse includes a c-command relationship not seen in training data.",
        "Feature #5 (Length): Threshold sentences based on length.",
        "Empirical observation indicates that long sentences are more likely to contain speaker errors, while very short sentences tend to be backchannel acknowledgments like \"yeah\" or \"I know\" which are not considered errorful.",
        "Oviatt (1995) quantifies this, determining that the disfluency rate in human-computer dialog increases roughly linearly with the number of words in an utterance.",
        "The length-based feature value for each sentence therefore is defined to be the number of word tokens in that sentence.",
        "Feature #6 (Backchannel): Bias backchannel acknowledgements as non-errors A backchannel acknowledgement is a short sentence-like unit (SU) which is produced to indicate that the speaker is still paying attention to the other speaker, without requesting attention or adding new content to the dialog.",

        "While the former possibility seems more likely, both causes should be investigated in future work.",
        "The F-score gain in NC identification from 42.5 to 54.6 came primarily from a gain in precision (in the original model, many non-errorful SUs were mistakenly determined to include errors).",

        "This work was an extension of the results in FHJ, which showed that automatically determining which utterances contain errors before attempting to identify and delete fillers and reparanda has the potential to increase accuracy significantly.",

        "Six features -JC04, HPSG, unseen rules, unseen c-command relationships, utterance length, and backchannel acknowledgement composition - were considered.",
        "The combined model achieved a precision of 93.0, a recall of 75.3, and an Fi-score of 83.3.",
        "We then, in Section 4, cascaded the sentence-level error identification system output into the FHJ word-level error identification and simple cleanup system.",
        "This combination lead to non-copy error identification with an Fi-score of 54.6, up from 47.5 in the experiments conducted on all data instead of data identified to be errorful, while maintaining accuracy for rough copy errors and increasing filler detection accuracy as well.",
        "Though the data setup is slightly different, the true errors are common across both sets of SUs and thus the results are comparable.",
        "This work demonstrates that automatically selecting a subset of SUs upon which to implement reconstruction improves the accuracy of non-copy (restart fragment) reparanda identification and cleaning, though less improvement results from doing the same for rough copy identification."
