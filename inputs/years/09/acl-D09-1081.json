        "Semantic distance is a measure of the closeness in meaning of two concepts.",
        "People are consistent judges of semantic distance.",
        "For example, we can easily tell that the concepts of \"exercise\" and \"jog\" are closer in meaning than \"exercise\" and \"theater\".",
        "Studies asking native speakers of a language to rank word pairs in order of semantic distance confirm this – average inter-annotator correlation on ranking word pairs in order of semantic distance has been repeatedly shown to be around 0.9 (Rubenstein and Goodenough, 1965; Resnik, 1999).",
        "A number of natural language tasks such as machine translation (Lopez, 2008) and word sense disambiguation (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2003; McCarthy, 2006), can be framed as semantic distance problems.",
        "Thus, developing automatic measures that are in-line with human notions of semantic distance has received much attention.",
        "These automatic approaches to semantic distance rely on manually created lexical resources such as WordNet, large amounts of text corpora, or both.",
        "WordNet-based information content measures have been successful (Hirst and Budanitsky, 2005), but there are significant limitations on their applicability.",
        "They can be applied only if a Word-Net exists for the language of interest (which is not the case for the \"low-density\" languages); and even if there is a WordNet, a number of domain-specific terms may not be encoded in it.",
        "On the other hand, corpus-based distributional measures of semantic distance, such as cosine and askew divergence (Dagan et al., 1999), rely on raw text alone (Weeds et al., 2004; Mohammad, 2008).",
        "However, when used to rank word pairs in order of semantic distance or correct real-word spelling errors, they have been shown to perform poorly (Weeds et al., 2004; Mohammad and Hirst, 2006).",
        "Mohammad and Hirst (2006) and Patwardhan and Pedersen (2006) argued that word sense ambiguity is a key reason for the poor performance of traditional distributional measures, and they proposed hybrid approaches that are distributional in nature, but also make use of information in lexical resources such as published thesauri and WordNet.",
        "However, both these approaches can be applied to estimate the semantic distance between two terms only if both terms exist in the lexical resource they rely on.",
        "We know lexical resources tend to have limited vocabulary and a large number of domain-",
        "Proceedings of the 2009 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 775-783, Singapore, 6-7 August 2009.",

        "specific terms are usually not included.",
        "It should also be noted that similarity values from different distance measures are not comparable (even after normalization to the same scale), that is, a similarity score of .75 as per one distance measure does not correspond to the same semantic distance as a similarity score of .75 from another distance measure.",
        "Thus if one uses two independent distance measures, in this case: one resource-reliant and one only corpus-dependent, then these two measures are not comparable (and hence cannot be used in tandem), even if both rely – partially or entirely – on distributional corpus statistics.",
        "We propose a hybrid semantic distance method that inherently combines the elements of a resource-reliant measure and a strictly corpus-dependent measure by imposing resource-reliant soft constraints on the corpus-dependent model.",
        "We choose the Mohammad and Hirst (2006) method as the resource-reliant method and not one of the WordNet-based measures because, unlike the WordNet-based measures, the Mohammad and Hirst method is distributional in nature and so lends itself immediately for combination with traditional distributional similarity measures.",
        "Our new hybrid method combines concept-word co-occurrence information (the Mohammad and Hirst distributional profiles of thesaurus concepts (DPC)) with word-word co-occurrence information, to generate word-sense-biased distributional profiles.",
        "The \"pure\" corpus-based distributional profile (a.k.a.",
        "co-occurrence vector, or word association vector), for some target word u, is biased with soft constraints towards each of the concepts c that list u in the thesaurus, to create a distributional profile that is specific to u in the sense that is most related to the other words listed under c.",
        "Thus, this method can make more finegrained distinctions than the Mohammad and Hirst method, and yet uses word sense information.Our proposed method falls back gracefully to rely only on word-word co-occurrence information if any of the target terms is not listed in the lexical resource.",
        "Experiments on the word-pair ranking task",
        "!A11 we can infer is that if wi and W2 have a similarity score of .75 and wz and w± have a score of .5 by the same distance measure, then w\\-W2 are closer in meaning than",
        "on three different datasets show that the our proposed hybrid measure outperforms all other comparable distance measures.",
        "Mohammad and Hirst (2007) show that their method can be used to compute semantic distance in a resource poor language L\\ by combining its text with a thesaurus in a resource-rich language L2 using an L1-L2 bilingual lexicon to create cross-lingual distributional profiles of concepts, that is, L2 word co-occurrence profiles of L\\ thesaurus concepts.",
        "Since our method makes use of the Mohammad and Hirst DPCs, it can just as well make use of their cross-lingual DPCs, to compute semantic distance in a resource-poor language, just as they did.",

      "text": [
        "Strictly speaking, semantic distance/closeness is a property of lexical units – a combination of the surface form and word sense.",
        "Two terms are considered to be semantically close if there is a lexical semantic relation between them.",
        "Such a relation may be a classical relation such as hyper-nymy, troponymy, meronymy, and antonymy, or it may be what have been called an ad-hoc non-classical relation, such as cause-and-effect (Morris and Hirst, 2004).",
        "If the closeness in meaning is due to certain specific classical relations such as hypernymy and troponymy, then the terms are said to be semantically similar.",
        "Semantic relatedness is the term used to describe the more general form of semantic closeness caused by any semantic relation (Hirst and Budanitsky, 2005).",
        "So the nouns liquid and water are both semantically similar and semantically related, whereas the nouns boat and rudder are semantically related, but not similar.",
        "The next three subsections describe three kinds of automatic distance measures: (1) lexical-resource-based measures that rely on a manually created resource such as WordNet; (2) corpus-based measures that rely only on co-occurrence statistics from large corpora; and (3) hybrid measures that are distributional in nature, and that also exploit the information in a lexical resource.",
        "WordNet is a manually-created hierarchical network of nodes (taxonomy), where each node in the network represents a fine-grained concept or word sense.",
        "An edge between two nodes represents a lexical semantic relation such as hy-pernymy and troponymy.",
        "WordNet-based measures consider two terms to be close if they occur close to each other in the network (connected by only a few arcs), if their definitions share many terms (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2003; Patwardhan and Pedersen, 2006), or if they share a lot of information (Lin, 1998; Resnik, 1999).",
        "The length of each arc/link (distance between nodes) can be assumed a unit length, or can be computed from corpus statistics.",
        "Within WordNet, the is-a hierarchy is much more well-developed than that of other lexical semantic relations.",
        "So, not surprisingly, the best WordNet-based measures are those that rely only on the is-a hierarchy.",
        "Therefore, they are good at measuring semantic similarity (e.g., doctor-physician), but not semantic relatedness (e.g., doctor-scalpel).",
        "Further, the measures can only be used in languages that have a (sufficiently developed) WordNet.",
        "WordNet sense information has been criticized to be too fine grained (Agirre and Lopez de Lacalle Lekuona, 2003; Navigli, 2006).",
        "See Hirst and Budanitsky (2005) for a comprehensive survey of WordNet-based measures.",
        "Strictly corpus-based measures of distributional similarity rely on the hypothesis that words that occur in similar context tend to be semantically close (Firth, 1957; Harris, 1940).",
        "The set of contexts of each target word u is represented by its distributional profile (DP) – the set of words that tend to co-occur with u within a certain distance, along with numeric scores signifying this co-occurrence tendency with u.",
        "Then measures such as cosine or askew divergence are used to determine how close the DPs of the two target words are.",
        "See Section 3 for more details and related work.",
        "These measures are very appealing because they rely simply on raw text, but, as described earlier, when used to rank word pairs in order of semantic distance, or to correct real-word spelling errors, they perform poorly, compared to the WordNet-based measures.",
        "See Weeds et al.",
        "(2004), Mohammad (2008), and Curran (2004) for detailed surveys of distributional measures.",
        "As Mohammad and Hirst (2006) point out, the DP of a word u conflates information about the potentially many senses of u.",
        "For example, consider the following.",
        "The noun bank has two senses \"river bank\" and \"financial institution\".",
        "Assume that bank, when used in the \"financial institution\" sense, co-occurred with the noun money 100 times in a corpus.",
        "Similarly, assume that bank, when used in the \"river bank\" sense, co-occurred with the noun boat 80 times.",
        "So the DP of bank will have co-occurrence information with money as well as boat:",
        "DPW(bank):",
        "money,100; boat,S0; bond,10)\\fish,ll\\ ...",
        "Assume that the DP of the word ATM is:",
        "money,120; boatfi; bond,90;fish,0; ...",
        "Thus the distributional distance of bank with ATM will be some sort of an average of the semantic distance between the \"financial institution\" and \"ATM\" senses and the semantic distance between the \"river bank\" and \"ATM\" senses.",
        "However, in various natural language tasks, we need the semantic distance between the intended senses of bank and ATM, which often also tends to be the semantic distance between their closest senses.",
        "Both Mohammad and Hirst (2006) and Patwardhan and Pedersen (2006) proposed measures that are not only distributional in nature but also rely on a lexical resource to exploit the manually encoded information therein as well as to overcome the sense-conflation problem (described in section 2.2).",
        "Since we essentially combine the Mohammad and Hirst method with a \"pure\" word-based distributional measure to create our hybrid approach, we briefly describe their method here.",
        "Mohammad and Hirst (2006) generate separate distributional profiles for the different senses of a word, without using any sense-annotated data.",
        "They use the categories in a Roget-style thesaurus (Macquaries (Bernard, 1986)) as coarse senses or concepts.",
        "There are about 1000 categories in a thesaurus, and each category has on average 120 closely related words.",
        "A word may be found in more than one category if it has multiple meaning.",
        "They use a simple unsupervised algorithm to determine the vector of words that tend to co-occur with each concept and the corresponding strength of association (a measure of how strong the tendency to co-occur is).",
        "The target word u will be assigned one DPC for each of the concepts that list u.",
        "Below are example DPCs of the two concepts pertaining to bank:",
        "money,,5; boat,S63; bond,0;fish,94S; ...",
        "The distance between two words u,v is determined by calculating the closeness of each of the DPCs of u to each of DPCs of v, and the closest DPC-pair distance is chosen.",
        "Mohammad and Hirst (2006) show that their approach performs better than other strictly corpus-based approaches that they experimented with.",
        "However, all those experiments were on word-pairs that were listed in the thesaurus.",
        "Their approach is not applicable otherwise.",
        "In Sections 3 and 4 we show how cosine-log-likelihood-ratio (or any comparable distributional measure) can be combined with the Mohammad and Hirst DPCs to form a hybrid approach that is not limited to the vocabulary of a lexical resource.",
        "Erk and Padó (2008) proposed a way of representing a word sense in context by biasing the target word's DP according to the context surrounding a target (specific) occurrence of the target word.",
        "They use dependency relations and selectional preferences of the target word and combine multiple DPs of words appearing in the context of the target occurrence, in a manner so as to give more weight to words co-occurring with both the target word and the target occurrence's context words.",
        "The advantage of this approach is that it does not rely on a thesaurus or Word-Net.",
        "Its disadvantage is that it relies on dependency relations and selectional preferences information, and that the context information it uses in order to determine the word sense is quite limited (only the words surrounding a single occurrence of the and hence the representation of that sense might not be sufficiently accurate.",
        "Their approach effectively assumes that each occurrence of a word has a unique sense."

        "The hybrid methods proposed in this paper obtained higher accuracies than all other methods on the RG-65 testset (all of whose words were in the published thesaurus), and on the RD-00 testset, and their performance was at least respectable on the WS-353 testset (many of whose words were not in the published thesaurus).",
        "This is in contrast to the concept-distance methods which suffer greatly when the target words are not in the lexical resource (here, the thesaurus) they rely on, even though these methods can make use of cooccurrence information of words not in the thesaurus with concepts from the thesaurus.",
        "Amongst the two hybrid methods proposed, the sense-filtered-counts method performed better using the smaller bootstrapped concept-word cooccurrence matrix whereas the sense-proportional method performed better using the larger concept-word co-occurrence matrix.",
        "We believe this is because the bootstrapping method proposed in Mohammad and Hirst (2006) has the effect of resetting to 0 the small co-occurrence counts.",
        "The noise from these small co-occurrence counts affects the sense-filtered-counts method more adversely (since any non-zero value will cause the inclusion of the corresponding collocate's full cooccurrence count) and so the bootstrapped matrix is more suitable for this method.",
        "The results also show that the cosine of log-likelihood ratios method mostly performs better than cosine of conditional probabilities and the pmi methods on the noun sets.",
        "This further supports the claim by Dunning (1993) that log-likelihood ratio is much less sensitive than pmi to low counts.",
        "Interestingly, on the verb set, the pmi methods, and especially hybrid*-prop-cos-pmi, did extremely well.",
        "Further investigation is needed in order to determine if pmi is indeed more suitable for verb semantic similarity, and why."

      "text": [
        "Traditional distributional similarity conflates cooccurrence information pertaining to the many senses of the target words.",
        "Mohammad and Hirst (2006) show how distributional measures can be used to compute distance between very coarse word senses or concepts (thesaurus categories), and even obtain better results than traditional distributional similarity.",
        "However, their method requires that the target words be listed in the thesaurus, which is often not the case for domain-specific terms and named entities.",
        "In this paper, we proposed hybrid methods (hybrid-sense-filtered-counts and hybrid-sense-proportional-counts) that combine word-word co-occurrence information (traditional distributional similarity) with word-concept cooccurrence information (Mohammad and Hirst, 2006), with soft constraints in such a manner that the method makes use of information encoded in the thesaurus when available, and degrades gracefully if the target word is not listed in the thesaurus.",
        "Our method generates word-sense-biased distributional profiles (DPs) from non-annotated corpus-based word-based DPs and coarser-grained aggregated thesaurus-based \"concept DPs\" (DPCs).",
        "We showed that the hybrid method correlates with human judgments of semantic distance in most cases better than any of the other methods we replicated.",
        "We are now interested in improving semantic distance measures for verb-verb, adjective-adjective, and cross-part-of-speech pairs, by exploiting specific information pertaining to these parts of speech in lexical resources in addition to purely co-occurrence information."
