        "Measuring the semantic similarity between two texts is an important problem that has many useful applications in both NLP and IR communities.",
        "For example, Lin (1998) defined a similarity measure for automatic thesaurus creation from a corpus.",
        "Mihalcea et al.",
        "(2006) developed several corpus-based and knowledge-based word similarity measures and applied them to a paraphrase recognition task.",
        "In the domain of web search, different methods of measuring similarity between short text segments have recently been proposed for solving problems like query suggestion and alternation (Jones et al., 2006; Sahami and Heilman, 2006; Metzler et al., 2007; Yih and Meek, 2007).",
        "Among these similarity measures proposed in various applications, the vector-based methods are arguably the most widely used.",
        "In this approach, the text being compared with is first represented by a term vector, where each term is associated with a weight that indicates its importance.",
        "The similarity function could be cosine (i.e., the inner product of two normalized unit term vectors, or equivalently a linear kernel), or other kernel functions such as the Gaussian kernel.",
        "There are essentially two main factors that decide the quality of a vector-based similarity measure.",
        "One is the vector operation that takes as input the term vectors and computes the final similarity score (e.g., cosine).",
        "The other is how these term vectors are constructed, including the term selection process and how the weights are determined.",
        "For instance, a TFIDF scheme for measuring document similarity may follow the bag-of-words strategy to include all the words in the document when constructing the term vectors.",
        "The weight of each term is simply the product of its term frequency (i.e., the number of occurrences in the document) and inverse document frequency (i.e., the number of documents in a collection that contain this term).",
        "Despite its simplicity and reasonable performance, such approach suffers from several weaknesses.",
        "For instance, the similarity measure is not domain-dependent and cannot be easily adjusted to better fit the final objective, such as being a metric value used for clustering or providing better ranking results.",
        "Researchers often need to experiment with variants of TFIDF formulas and different term selection strategies (e.g., removing stop-words or stemming) to achieve acceptable performance (Manning et al., 2008).",
        "In addition, when more information is available, such as the position of a term in the document or whether a term is part of an anchor text, incorporating it in the similarity measure in a principled manner may not be easy.",

        "©2009 ACL and AFNLP",
        "In this paper, we propose a general ferm-weighting learning framework, Tweak, that learns the term-weighting function for the vector-based similarity measures.",
        "Instead of using a fixed formula to decide the weight of each term, Tweak uses a parametric function of features of each term, where the model parameters are learned from labeled data.",
        "Although the weight of each term conceptually represents its importance with respect to the document, tuning the model parameters to optimize for such objectives may not be the best strategy due to two reasons.",
        "While the label of whether a pair of texts is similar is not difficult to collect from human annotators, the label of whether a term in a document is important is often very ambiguous and hard to decide.",
        "Even if such annotation issue can be resolved, aligning the term weights with the true importance of each term may not necessarily lead to our real objective - deriving a better similarity measure for the target application.",
        "Therefore, our learning framework, Tweak, assumes that we are given only the labels of the pairs of texts being compared, such as whether the two texts are considered similar by human subjects.",
        "Tweak is flexible in choosing various loss functions that are close to the true objectives, while still maintaining the simplicity of the vector-based similarity measures.",
        "For example, a system that implements the TFIDF cosine measure can easily replace the original term-weighting scores with the ones output by Tweak without changing other portions of the algorithm.",
        "Tweak is also novel compared to other existing learning methods for similarity measures.",
        "For instance, we do not learn the scores of all the terms in the vocabulary directly, which is one of the methods proposed by Bilenko and Mooney (2003).",
        "Because the vocabulary size is typically large in the text domain (e.g., all possible words in English), learning directly the term-weighting scores may suffer from the data sparsity issue and cannot generalize well in practice.",
        "Instead, we focus on learning the model parameters for features that each term may have, which results in a much smaller feature space.",
        "Tweak also differs from the model combination approach proposed by Yih and Meek (2007), where the output scores of different similarity measures are combined via a learned linear",
        "'As argued in (Sheng et al., 2008), low-cost labels may nowadays be provided by outsourcing systems such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk or online ESP games.",
        "function.",
        "In contrast, Tweak effectively learns a new similarity measure by tuning the term-weighting function and can potentially be complementary to the model combination approach.",
        "As will be demonstrated in our experiments, in applications such as judging the relevance of different query suggestions and determining whether a paid-search ad is related to the user query, Tweak can incorporate various kinds of term-document information and learn a term-weighting function that significantly outperforms the traditional TFIDF scheme in several evaluation metrics, when using the same vector operation (i.e., cosine) and the same set of terms.",

        "Sec.",
        "2 first gives a high-level view of our term-weighting learning framework.",
        "We then formally define our model and present the loss functions that can be optimized for in Sec. 3.",

        "As for the vector operation function fsim, we use the same cosine function (Eq.",
        "1).",

        "However, other smooth functions can certainly be used.",
        "The choice of loss function for training model parameters depends on the true objective in the target application.",

        "In this setting, we assume that the learning algorithm is given a set of document pairs.",
        "Each of them is associated with a label that indicates whether these two documents are similar (e.g., a binary label where 1 means similar and 0 otherwise) or the degree of similarity (e.g., a real-valued label ranges from 0 to 1), considered by the human subjects.",

        "The exact value of the similarity measure, in this case, is not crucial.",
        "For these applications, it is more important if the model parameters can better predict the pairwise preference.",

        "A product keyword recommendation system needs to determine whether the given product name and the suggested keyword is related.",
        "Because the length of the text segment is typically short, ranging from a single word to a dozen words, naively applying methods based on word overlapping such as the Jaccard coefficient leads to poor results (Sahami and Heilman, 2006; Yih and Meek, 2007).",
        "To overcome this difficulty, Sahami and Heilman (2006) proposes a Web-kernel function, which first expands the short text segment by issuing it to a search engine as the query, and then collectes the snippets of the top results to construct a pseudo-document.",

        "Our term-weighting learning framework can be analogous to the \"Siamese\" architecture for learning jointly two neural networks that share the same set of model weights (Bromley et al., 1993).",
        "For instance, a term vector can be viewed as a very large single-layer neural network, where each term in the vocabulary is a node that takes as input the features and outputs the learned term-weighting score.",
        "Previous applications of this learning machine are typically problems in image processing or computer vision.",
        "For example, Chopra et al.",
        "(2005) designed an algorithm to learn a similarity metric for face veriication, which is based on the difference between two vectors.",
        "In our earlier experiments (not reported in this paper) of using vector difference instead of cosine, we did not observe positive outcomes.",
        "We hypothesize that because the length of the term vector in our problem can be extremely large (i.e., the size of the vocabulary), a similarity measure based on vector difference can easily be affected by terms that do not occur in both documents, even when the co-occurred terms have very large weights.",
        "Learning similarity measures for text has also been proposed by several researchers.",
        "For instance, Bilenko and Mooney (2003) applied SVMs to directly learn the weights of co-occurred words in two text records, which are then used for measuring similarity for duplicate detection.",
        "Although this approach worked moderately well in the database domain, it may not be suitable to handle general text similarity problems for two reasons.",
        "First, the vocabulary size is typically large, which results in a very high dimensional feature space for the learning problem.",
        "It is very likely that some rarely used and yet important terms occur in the testing documents but not in the training data.",
        "The weights of those terms may not be reliable or even be learned.",
        "Second, this learning approach can only learn the importance of the terms from the labels of whether two texts are considered similar, how to incorporate the basic information of these terms such as the position or query log frequency is not clear.",
        "An alternative learning approach is to combine multiple similarity measures with learned coefi-cients (Yih and Meek, 2007), or to apply the technique of kernel alignment (Cristianini et al., 2002) to combining a set of kernel functions for tuning a more appropriate kernel based on labeled data.",
        "This type of approaches can be viewed as constructing an ensemble of different existing similarity measures without modifying the term weighting function, and may not generate mathematically equivalent similarity functions as derived by Tweak.",
        "Although learning in this approach is usually very fast due to the model form and the small number of parameters to learn, its improvement is limited by the quality of the individual similarity measures.",
        "In spite of the fundamental difference between our approach and this combination method, it is worth noticing that these two approaches are in fact complementary to each other.",
        "Having a newly learned term-weighting function effectively provides a new similarity measure and therefore can be combined with other measures."

      "text": [
        "In this paper, we presented a novel term-weighting learning framework, Tweak, for improving similarity measures based on term vectors.",
        "Given the labels of text pairs for training, our method learns the model parameters to calculate the score ofeach term, optimizing the desired loss function that is suitable for the target application.",
        "As we demonstrated in the experiments, Tweak with different features and training settings signiicantly outperforms the traditional TFIDF term-weighting scheme.",
        "Tweak also enjoys several advantages compared to existing methods.",
        "From an engineering perspective, adopting the new term-weighting scores produced by our model is straightforward.",
        "If a similarity measure has been implemented, the algorithm need not be changed - only the term vectors need to be updated.",
        "From the learning perspective, additional information regarding each term with respect to the document can now be incorporated easily via feature functions.",
        "Weights (i.e., model parameters) of these features are learned in a principled way instead of being adjusted manually.",
        "Finally, Tweak is potentially complementary to other methods for improving the similarity measure, such as model combination of various types of similarity measures (Yih and Meek, 2007) or different term vector construction methods such as Latent Semantic Analysis (Deerwester et al., 1990).",
        "In the future, we plan to explore more vector operations other than the inner-product (i.e., cosine) as well as different functional forms of the term-weighting function (e.g. log-linear instead of linear).",
        "Designing new loss functions to better it the true objectives in various target applications and studying the quality of a similarity measure based on both term-weighting learning and model combination are also on our agenda.",
        "In terms ofappli-cations, we would like to apply Tweak in other problems such as paraphrase recognition and near-duplicate detection."
