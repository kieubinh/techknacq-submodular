        "We can then make additional inferences on the new specimen using the properties known for the existing category.",

        "Accurate measurement of semantic similarity between lexical units such as words or phrases is important for numerous tasks in natural language processing such as word sense disambiguation (Resnik, 1995), synonym extraction (Lin, 1998a), and automatic thesauri generation (Curran, 2002).",
        "In information retrieval, similar or related words are used to expand user queries to improve recall (Sahami and Heilman, 2006).",
        "Semantic similarity is a context dependent and dynamic phenomenon.",
        "New words are constantly being created and existing words are assigned with new senses on the Web.",
        "To decide whether two words are semantically similar, it is important to know the semantic relations that hold between the words.",
        "For example, the words horse and cow can be considered semantically similar because both horses and cows are useful animals in agriculture.",
        "Similarly, a horse and a car can be considered semantically similar because cars, and historically horses, are used for transportation.",
        "Semantic relations such as X and Y are used in agriculture, or X and Y are used for transportation, exist between two words X and Y in these examples.",
        "We use bold-italics, X, to denote the slot of a word X in a lexical pattern.",
        "We propose a relational model to compute the semantic similarity between two words.",
        "First, using snippets retrieved from a web search engine, we present an automatic lexical pattern extraction algorithm to represent the semantic relations that exist between two words.",
        "For example, given two words ostrich and bird, we extract X is aY,X is a large Y, and X is a flightless Y from the Web.",
        "Using a set of semantically related words as training data, we evaluate the confidence of a lexical pattern as an indicator of semantic similarity.",
        "For example, the pattern X is a Y is a better indicator of semantic similarity between X and Y than the pattern X and Y. Consequently, we would like to emphasize the former pattern by assigning it a higher confidence score.",
        "It is noteworthy that all lexical patterns are not independent - multiple lexical patterns can express the same semantic relation.",
        "For example, the pattern X is a large Y subsumes the more general pattern X is a Y and they both indicate a hypernymic relationship between X and Y.",
        "By clustering the semantically related patterns into groups, we can both overcome the data sparseness problem, and reduce the number of parameters during training.",
        "To identify semantically related patterns, we use a sequential pattern clustering algorithm that is based on the distributional hypothesis (Harris, 1954).",
        "We represent two words by a feature vector defined over the clusters of patterns.",
        "Finally, the semantic similarity is computed as the Mahalanobis distance between points corresponding to the feature vectors.",

        "Following these previous approaches, we represent R(a, b) as a set of lexical patterns.",
        "Moreover, we denote the frequency of a lexical pattern r for a word pair (a, b) by f(r, a, b).",

        "Here, Wi is the weight associated with the lexical pattern n and can be determined using training data.",

        "First, the number of weight parameters Wi is equal to the number of lexical patterns.",
        "Typically two words can co-occur in numerous patterns.",
        "Consequently, we end up with a large number of parameters in the model.",
        "Complex models with a large number of parameters are difficult to train because they tend to overfit to the training data.",

        "The proposed relational model of semantic similarity differs from feature models of similarity, such as the contrast model (Tversky, 1977), in that it is defined over the set of semantic relations that exist between two words instead of the set of features for each word.",
        "Specifically, in contrast model, the similarity S(a,b) between two objects a and b is defined in terms of the features common to a and b, A n B, the features that are distinctive to a, A – B, and the features that are distinctive to b, B – A.",
        "The contrast model is formalized in the following equation,",

        "The parameters L, g, G and N are set experimentally, as explained later in Section 6.",
        "It is noteworthy that the proposed pattern extraction algorithm considers all the words in a snippet, and is not limited to extracting patterns only from the mid-fix (i.e., the portion of text in a snippet that appears between the queried words).",
        "Moreover, the consideration of gaps enables us to capture relations between distant words in a snippet.",

        "By pruning the search space, we can speed up the pattern generation process.",
        "However, none of these modifications affect the accuracy of the proposed semantic similarity measure because the modified version of the prefixspan algorithm still generates the exact set of patterns that we would obtain if we used the original prefixspan algorithm (i.e. without pruning) and subsequently remove patterns that violate the above mentioned constraints.",

        "We use the YahooBOSS API and download 1000 snippets for each of those word pairs.",
        "Experimentally, we set the values for the parameters in the pattern extraction algorithm (Section 3.1): L = 5, g = 2, G = 4, and extract 5, 238, 637 unique patterns.",
        "However, only 1,680,914 of those patterns occur more than twice.",
        "Low frequency patterns often contain misspellings and are not suitable for training.",
        "Therefore, we selected patterns that occur at least 10 times in the snippet collection.",
        "Moreover, we remove very long patterns (ca.",

        "The final set contains 140, 691 unique lexical patterns.",

        "Here, ß{q) is the total frequency of a pattern, and it is given by Equation 5.",
        "Because we perform a hard clustering on patterns, a pattern can belong to only one cluster (i.e. Wij = 0 for pi Cj).",

        "We select the 6 that maximizes the average similarity score between those synonymous word pairs.",
        "Formally, the optimal value of 6, 9 is given by the following Equation,",
        "Here, W is the set of synonymous word pairs (a, b), \\W\\ is the total number of synonymous word pairs (i.e. 2000 in our experiments), and sim(a, b) is given by Equation 3.",
        "Because the averages are taken over 2000 word pairs this procedure gives a reliable estimate for 6.",
        "Moreover, this method does not require negative training instances such as, non-synonymous word pairs, which are difficult to create manually.",
        "Average similarity scores for various 6 values are shown in Figure 2.",
        "From Figure 2, we see that initially average similarity increases when 6 is increased.",
        "This is because clustering of semantically related patterns reduces the sparseness in feature vectors.",
        "Average similarity is stable within a range of 6 values between 0.5 and 0.7.",
        "However, increasing 6 beyond 0.7 results in a rapid drop of average similarity.",
        "To explain this behavior consider Figure 3 where we plot the sparsity of the set of clusters (i.e. the ratio between singletons to total clusters) against threshold 6.",
        "As seen from Figure 3, high 6 values result in a high percentage of singletons because only highly similar patterns will form clusters.",
        "Consequently, feature vectors for different word pairs do not have many features in common.",
        "The maximum average similarity score of 1.303 is obtained with 6 = 0.7, corresponding to 17,015 total clusters out of which 12, 476 are singletons with exactly one pattern (sparsity = 0.733).",
        "For the remainder of the experiments in this paper we set 6 to this optimal value and use the corresponding set of clusters to compute semantic similarity by Equation 3.",
        "Similarity scores computed using Equation 3 can be greater than 1 (see Figure 2) because of the terms corresponding to the non-diagonal elements in A.",
        "We do not normalize the similarity scores to [0,1] range in our experiments because the evaluation metrics we use are insensitive to linear transformations of similarity scores."

        "The improvement of the proposed method is statistically significant (confidence interval [0.73,0.93]) against all the similarity measures compared in Table 1 except against the SVM approach.",
        "From Table 1 we see that measures that use contextual information from snippets (e.g. SH, CODC, SVM, and proposed) outperform the ones that use only cooccurrence statistics (e.g. Jaccard, overlap, Dice, PMI, and NGD) such as page-counts.",
        "This is because similarity measures that use contextual information are better equipped to compute the similarity between polysemous words.",
        "Although both SVM and proposed methods use lexical patterns, unlike the proposed method, the SVM method does not consider the relatedness between patterns.",
        "The superior performance of the proposed method is attributable to its consideration of relatedness of patterns.",
        "Table 2 summarizes the previously proposed WordNet-based semantic similarity measures.",
        "Despite the fact that the proposed method does not use manually compiled resources such as Word-Net for computing similarity, its performance is comparable to similarity measures that use Word-Net.",

        "Likewise with the Miller-Charles ratings, we measure the correlation between the similarity scores produced by the proposed method for word pairs in the WordSimilarity-353 dataset and the human ratings.",
        "A higher Spearman correlation coefficient (value=0.504, confidence interval [0.422,0.578]) indicates a better agreement with the human notion of semantic similarity.",

        "Because the proposed method use snippets retrieved from a web search engine, it is capable of extracting expressive lexical patterns that can explicitly state the relationship between two entities.",
        "If we must compare n objects using a feature model of similarity, then we only need to define features for each of those n objects.",
        "However, in the proposed relational model we must define relations between all pairs of objects.",
