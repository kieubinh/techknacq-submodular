        "Statistical parsers are now obtaining Parseval scores of over 90% on the WSJ section of the Penn Treebank (Bod, 2003; Petrov and Klein, 2007; Huang, 2008; Carreras et al., 2008).",
        "McClosky et al.",
        "(2006) report an F-score of 92.1% using self-training applied to the reranker of Charniak and Johnson (2005).",
        "Such scores, in isolation, may suggest that statistical parsing is close to becoming a solved problem, and that further incremental improvements will lead to parsers becoming as accurate as pos taggers.",
        "A single score in isolation can be misleading, however, for a number of reasons.",
        "First, the single score is an aggregate over a highly skewed distribution of all constituent types; evaluations which look at individual constituent or dependency types show that the accuracies on some, semantically important, constructions, such as coordination and PP-attachment, are much lower (Collins, 1999).",
        "Second, it is well known that the accuracy of parsers trained on the Penn Treebank degrades when they are applied to different genres and domains (Gildea, 2001).",
        "Finally, some researchers have argued that the Parseval metrics (Black et al., 1991) are too forgiving with respect to certain errors and that an evaluation based on syntactic dependencies, for which scores are typically lower, is a better test of parser performance (Lin, 1995; Carroll et al., 1998).",
        "In this paper we focus on the first issue, that the performance of parsers on some constructions is much lower than the overall score.",
        "The constructions that we focus on are various unbounded dependency constructions.",
        "These are interesting for parser evaluation for the following reasons: one, they provide a strong test of the parser's knowledge of the grammar of the language, since many instances of unbounded dependencies are difficult to recover using shallow techniques in which the grammar is only superficially represented; and two, recovering these dependencies is necessary to completely represent the underlying predicate-argument structure of a sentence, useful for applications such as Question Answering and Information Extraction.",
        "To give an example of the sorts of constructions we are considering, and the (in)ability of parsers to recover the corresponding unbounded dependencies, none of the parsers that we have tested were able to recover the dependencies shown in bold from the following sentences:",

        "First, we present the first set of results for the recovery of a variety of unbounded dependencies, for a range of existing parsers.",
        "Second, we describe the creation of a publicly available unbounded dependency test suite, and give statistics summarising properties of these dependencies in naturally occurring text.",
        "Third, we demonstrate that performing the evaluation is surprisingly difficult, because of different conventions across the parsers as to how the underlying grammar is represented.",
        "Fourth, we show that current parsing technology is very poor at representing some important elements of the argument structure of sentences, and argue for a more focused construction-based parser evaluation as a complement to existing grammatical relation-based evaluations.",
        "We also perform an error-analysis for one of the more successful parsers.",

        "In fact, some of the recommendations for improvement on this corpus, such as the need for a better parsing model to make better attachment decisions, are parser independent.",
        "The poor performance of RASP on this corpus is clearly related to a lack of subcategorisation information, since this is crucial for recovering extracted arguments.",
        "For Stanford, incorporating the trace information from the PTB into the statistical model in some way is likely to help.",

        "We categorised the errors made by the c&c parser on the development data for each construction.",
        "We chose the c&c parser for the analysis because it was one of the top performers and we have more knowledge of its workings than those of Enju.",
        "The c&c parser first uses a supertagger to assign a small number of CCG lexical categories (essentially subcategorisation frames) to each word in the sentence.",
        "These categories are then combined using a set of combinatory rules to build a CCG derivation.",
        "The parser uses a log-linear probability model to select the highest-scoring derivation (Clark and Curran, 2007).",
        "In general, errors in dependency recovery may occur if the correct lexical category is not assigned by the supertagger for one or more of the words in a sentence, or if an incorrect derivation is chosen by the parsing model.",
        "For unbounded dependency recovery, one source of errors (labeled type 1 in Table 5) is the wrong lexical category being assigned to the word (normally a verb or preposition) governing the extraction site.",
        "In these testaments that I would submit here, if submit is assigned a category for an intransitive rather than transitive verb, the verb-object relation will not be recovered.",
        "Table 5: Error analysis for c&c. Errs is the total number of errors for a construction, Tot is the number of dependencies of that type in the development data.",
        "There are a number of reasons why the wrong category may be assigned.",
        "First, the lexicon may not contain enough information about possible categories for the word (la), or the necessary category may not exist in the parser's grammar at all (lb).",
        "Even if the grammar contains the correct category and the lexicon makes it available, the parsing model may not choose it (lc).",
        "Finally, a POS-tagging error on the word may mislead the parser into assigning the wrong category (Id).",
        "A second source of errors (type 2) is attachment decisions that the parser makes independently of the unbounded dependency.",
        "In Morgan ... carried in several buckets of water from the spring which he poured into the copper boiler, the parser assigns the correct categories for the relative pronoun and verb, but chooses spring rather than buckets as the head of the relativized NP (i.e. the object of pour).",
        "Most attachment errors involve prepositional phrases (PPs) and coordination, which have long been known to be areas where parsers need improvement.",
        "Finally, errors in unbounded dependency recovery may be due to complex errors in the surrounding parse context (type 3).",
        "We will not comment more on these cases since they do not tell us much about unbounded dependencies in particular.",
        "Table 5 shows the distribution of error types across constructions for the c&c parser.",
        "Subject relative clauses, for example, did not have any errors of type 1, because a verb with an extracted subject does not require a special lexical category.",
        "Most of the errors here are of type 2.",
        "For example, in a series of pipes and a pressure-measuring chamber which record the rise and fall of the water surface, the parser attaches the relative clause to chamber but not to series.",

        "In the first carefree, dreamless sleep that she had known, the transitive category is available for known, but not selected by the model.",
        "The majority of the errors made by the parser are due to insufficient grammar coverage or weakness in the parsing model due to sparsity of head dependency data, the same fundamental problems that have dogged automatic parsing since its inception.",
        "Hence one view of statistical parsing is that it has allowed us to solve the easy problems, but we are still no closer to a general solution for the recovery of the \"difficult\" dependencies.",
        "One possibility is to create more training data targeting these constructions - effectively \"active learning by construction\" - in the way that Rimell and Clark (2008) were able to build a question parser.",

        "Unbounded dependencies are rare events, out in the Zipfian \"long tail\".",
        "They will always constitute a fraction of a percent of the overall total of head-dependencies in any corpus, a proportion too small to make a significant impact on global measures of parser accuracy, when expressive parsers are compared to those that merely approximate human grammar using finite-state or context-free covers.",
        "This will remain the case even when such measures are based on dependencies, rather than on parse trees.",
        "Nevertheless, unbounded dependencies remain highly significant in a much more important sense.",
        "They support the constructions that are central to those applications of parsing technology for which precision is as important as recall, such as open-domain question-answering.",
        "As low-power approximate parsing methods improve (as they must if they are ever to be usable at all for such tasks), we predict that the impact of the constructions we examine here will become evident.",
        "No matter how infrequent object questions like \"What do frogs eat?\"",
        "are, if they are answered as if they were subject questions (\"Herons\"), users will rightly reject any excuse in terms of the overall statistical distribution of related bags of words.",
        "Whether such improvements in parsers come from the availability of more human-labeled data, or from a breakthrough in unsupervised machine learning, we predict an imminent \"Uncanny Valley\" in parsing applications, due to the inability of parsers to recover certain semantically important dependencies, of the kind familiar from humanoid robotics and photorealistic animation.",
        "In such applications, the closer the superficial resemblance to human behavior gets, the more disturbing subtle departures become, and the more they induce mistrust and revulsion in the user."

        "In this paper we have demonstrated that current parsing technology is poor at recovering some of the unbounded dependencies which are crucial for fully representing the underlying predicate-argument structure of a sentence.",
        "We have also argued that correct recovery of such dependencies will become more important as parsing technology improves, despite the relatively low frequency of occurrence of the corresponding grammatical constructions.",
        "We also see this more focused parser evaluation methodology – in this case construction-focused – as a way of improving parsing technology, as an alternative to the exclusive focus on incremental improvements in overall accuracy measures such as Parseval."
