        "We connect two scenarios in structured learning: adapting a parser trained on one corpus to another annotation style, and projecting syntactic annotations from one language to another.",
        "We propose quasi-synchronous grammar (QG) features for these structured learning tasks.",
        "That is, we score a aligned pair of source and target trees based on local features of the trees and the alignment.",
        "Our quasi-synchronous model assigns positive probability to any alignment of any trees, in contrast to a synchronous grammar, which would insist on some form of structural parallelism.",
        "In monolingual dependency parser adaptation, we achieve high accuracy in translating among multiple annotation styles for the same sentence.",
        "On the more difficult problem of cross-lingual parser projection, we learn a dependency parser for a target language by using bilingual text, an English parser, and automatic word alignments.",
        "Our experiments show that unsupervised QG projection improves on parses trained using only high-precision projected annotations and far outperforms, by more than 35% absolute dependency accuracy, learning an unsupervised parser from raw target-language text alone.",
        "When a few target-language parse trees are available, projection gives a boost equivalent to doubling the number of target-language trees.",
        "The first author would like to thank the Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval at UMass Amherst.",
        "We would also like to thank Noah Smith and Rebecca Hwa for helpful discussions and the anonymous reviewers for their suggestions for improving the paper."

        "Say that we wish to output parses in the Prague style and so have annotated a small target corpus – e.g., 100 sentences – with those conventions.",
        "A parser trained on those hundred sentences will achieve mediocre dependency accuracy (the proportion of words that attach to their correct parent).",
        "But what if we also had a large number of trees in the CoNLL style (the source corpus)?",
        "Ideally they should help train our parser.",
        "But unfortunately, a parser that learned to produce perfect CoNLL-style trees would, for example, get both links \"wrong\" when its coordination constructions were evaluated against a Prague-style gold standard (Figure 1).",
        "If it were just a matter of this one construction, the obvious solution would be to write a few rules by hand to transform the large source training corpus into the target style.",
        "Suppose, however, that there were many more ways that our corpora differed.",
        "Then we would like to learn a statistical model to transform one style of tree into another.",
        "We may not possess hand-annotated training data for this tree-to-tree transformation task.",
        "That would require the two corpora to annotate some of the same sentences in different styles.",
        "But fortunately, we can automatically obtain a noisy form of the necessary paired-tree training data.",
        "A parser trained on the source corpus can parse the sentences in our target corpus, yielding trees (or more generally, probability distributions over trees) in the source style.",
        "We will then learn a tree transformation model relating these noisy source trees to our known trees in the target style.",

        "One option would be to leverage unannotated text (McClosky et al., 2006; Smith and Eisner, 2007).",

        "So we could jointly model the parses t', t and the alignment a between them, with a model of the form p(t, a, t' \\ w, «/).",
        "Such a joint model captures how t, a, t' mutually constrain each other, so that even partial knowledge of some of these three variables can help us to recover the others when training or decoding on bilingual text.",
        "This idea underlies a number of recent papers on syntax-based alignment (using t and t' to better recover a), grammar induction from bitext (using a to better recover t and t'), parser projection (using t' and a to better recover t), as well as full joint parsing (Smith and Smith, 2004; Burkett and Klein, 2008).",
        "In this paper, we condition on the 1-best source tree t'.",

        "So far, this is very similar to the monolingual parser adaptation scenario, but there are a few key differences.",

        "Given word alignments, we could simply try to project dependency links in the source tree onto the target text.",
        "A link-by-link projection, however, could result in invalid trees on the target side, with cycles or disconnected words.",

        "Full inference takes 0(n) time or worse (depending on the grammar formalism).",
        "Yet synchronous models only consider a limited hypothesis space: e.g., parses must be projective, and alignments must decompose according to the recursive parse structure.",
        "(For example, two nodes can be aligned only if their respective parents are also aligned.)",
        "The synchronous model's probability mass function is also restricted to decompose in this way, so it makes certain conditional independence assumptions; put another way, it can evaluate only certain properties of the triple (t, a, t').",
        "We instead model (i, a, t') as an arbitrary graph that includes dependency links among the words of each sentence as well as arbitrary alignment links between the words of the two sentences.",
        "This permits non-synchronous and many-to-many alignments.",
        "The only hard constraint we impose is that the dependency links within each sentence must constitute a valid monolingual parse – a directed projective spanning tree.",
        "Given the two sentences w,w', our probability distribution over possible graphs considers local features of the parses, the alignment, and both jointly.",
        "Thus, we learn what local syntactic configurations tend to occur in each language and how they correspond across languages.",

        "All models, for instance, have a feature template that considers the parts of speech of a potential parent-child relation.",

        "If x' = y', i.e. x and y align to the same word, the same-word feature fires.",

        "These alignment classes are called configurations (Smith and Eisner, 2006a, and following).",
        "When training is conditioned on the target words (see §3 and §6 below), we conjoin these configuration features with the part of speech and coarse part of speech of one or both of the source and target words, i.e. the feature template has from one to four tags.",
        "In conditional training, the exponentiated scores s are normalized by a constant: Z = ^texp[s(i,i',a, w,w')].",

        "In the \"gold\" conditions, where the target parser starts with perfect source trees, accuracy approaches 100%; in the realistic \"parse\" conditions, where the target-domain parser gets noisy source-domain parses, the improvements are quite significant but approach a lower ceiling imposed by the performance of the source parser.",
        "The adaptation problem in this section is a simple proof of concept of the QG approach; however, more complex and realistic adaptation problems exist.",
        "Monolingual adaptation is perhaps most obviously useful when the source parser is a black-box or rule-based system or is trained on unavailable data.",

        "First, we consider the problem of parser projection when there are zero target-language trees available.",
        "As in much other work on unsupervised parsing, we try to learn a generative model that can predict target-language sentences.",
        "Our novel contribution is to condition the probabilities of the generative actions on the dependency parse of a source-language translation.",
        "Thus, our generative model is a quasi-synchronous grammar, exactly as in (Smith and Eisner, 2006a).",
        "When training on target sentences w, therefore, we tune the model parameters to maximize not J2tP(t> w) as m ordinary EM, but rather ^tp(t,w,a I t',w').",
        "We hope that this conditional EM training will drive the model to posit appropriate syntactic relationships in the latent variable t, because – thanks to the structure of the QG model – that is the easiest way for it to exploit the extra information in t', w' to help predict w. At test time, t', w' are not made available, so we just use the trained model to find argmaxtp(i | w), backing off from the conditioning on t',w' and summing over a.",
        "Below, we present the specific generative model (§5.1) and some details of training (§5.2).",
        "We will then compare three approaches (§5.3):",
        "§5.3.2 a straight EM baseline (which does not condition on t', w' at all)",
        "§5.3.3 a \"hard\" projection baseline (which naively projects t', w' to derive direct supervision in the target language)",
        "§5.3.4 our conditional EM approach above (which makes t', w' available to the learner for \"soft\" indirect supervision via QG)",
        "Our base models of target-language syntax are generative dependency models that have achieved state-of-the art results in unsupervised dependency structure induction.",
        "The simplest version, called Dependency Model with Valence (dmv), has been used in isolation and in combination with other models (Klein and Manning, 2004; Smith and Eisner, 2006b).",
        "The dmv generates the right children, and then independently the left children, for each node in the dependency tree.",
        "Nodes correspond to words, which are represented by their part-of-speech tags.",
        "At each step of generation, the dmv stochastically chooses whether to stop generating, conditioned on the currently generating head; whether it is generating to the right or left; and whether it has yet generated any children on that side.",
        "If it chooses to continue, it then stochastically generates the tag of a new child, conditioned on the head.",
        "The parameters of the model are thus of the form p(stop I head, dir, adj) (1) p(child I head, dir) (2) where head and child are part-of-speech tags, dir G {left, right}, and adj, stop e {true, false}.",
        "root is stipulated to generate a single right child.",
        "Bilingual configurations that condition on t', w' (§2) are incorporated into the generative process as in Smith and Eisner (2006a).",
        "When the model is generating a new child for word x, aligned to x', it first chooses a configuration and then chooses a source word y' in that configuration.",
        "The child y is then generated, conditioned on its parent x, most recent sibling a, and its source analogue y'.",
        "As in previous work on grammar induction, we learn the dmv from part-of-speech-tagged target-language text.",
        "We use expectation maximization (EM) to maximize the likelihood of the data.",
        "Since the likelihood function is nonconvex in the unsupervised case, our choice of initial parameters can have a significant effect on the outcome.",
        "Although we could also try many random starting points, the initializer in Klein and Manning (2004) performs quite well.",
        "The base dependency parser generates the right dependents of a head separately from the left dependents, which allows 0(n) dynamic programming for an n-word target sentence.",
        "Since the QG annotates nonterminals of the grammar with single nodes of t', and we consider two nodes of t' when evaluating the above dependency configurations, QG parsing runs in 0(nm) for an m-word source sentence.",
        "If, however, we restrict candidate senses for a target child c to come from links in an IBM Model 4 Viterbi alignment, we achieve 0(nk), where k is the maximum number of possible words aligned to a given target language word.",
        "In practice, k ^ m, and parsing is not appreciably slower than in the monolingual setting.",
        "If all configurations were equiprobable, the source sentence would provide no information to the target.",
        "In our QG experiments, therefore, we started with a bias towards direct parent-child links and a very small probability for breakages of locality.",
        "The values of other configuration parameters seem, experimentally, less important for insuring accurate learning.",
        "Our experiments compare learning on target language text to learning on parallel text.",
        "In the latter case, we compare learning from high-precision one-to-one alignments alone, to learning from all alignments using a QG.",
        "Our development and test data were drawn from the German TIGER and Spanish Cast3LB treebanks as converted to projective dependencies for the CoNLL 2007 Shared Task (Brants et al., 2002; Civit Torruella and Marti Antonfn, 2002).",
        "Our training data were subsets of the 2006 Statistical Machine Translation Workshop Shared Task, in particular from the German-English and Spanish-English Europarl parallel corpora (Koehn, 2002).",
        "The Shared Task provided pre-built automatic GIZA++ word alignments, which we used to facilitate replicability.",
        "Since these word alignments do not contain posterior probabilities or null links, nor do they distinguish which links are in the IBM Model intersection, we treated all links as equally likely when learning the QG.",
        "Target language words unaligned to any source language words were the only nodes allowed to align to NULL in QG derivations.",
        "We parsed the English side of the bitext with the projective dependency parser described by McDonald et al.",
        "(2005) trained on the Penn Treebank §§2-20.",
        "Much previous work on unsupervised grammar induction has used gold-standard part-of-speech tags (Smith and Eisner, 2006b; Klein and Manning, 2004; Klein and Manning, 2002).",
        "While there are no gold-standard tags for the Europarl bitext, we did train a conditional Markov model tagger on a few thousand tagged sentences.",
        "This is the only supervised data we used in the target.",
        "We created versions of each training corpus with the first thousand, ten thousand, and hundred thousand sentence pairs, each a prefix of the next.",
        "Since the target-language-only baseline converged much more slowly, we used a version of the corpora with sentences 15 target words or fewer.",
        "Using the target side of the bitext as training data, we initialized our model parameters as described in §5.2 and ran EM.",
        "We checked convergence on a development set and measured unlabeled dependency accuracy on held-out test data.",
        "We compare performance to simple attach-right and attach left baselines (Table 3).",
        "For mostly head-final German, the \"modify next\" baseline is better; for mostly head-initial Spanish, \"modify previous\" wins.",
        "Even after several hundred iterations, performance was slightly, but not significantly better than the baseline for German.",
        "EM training did not beat the baseline for Spanish.",
        "The simplest approach to using the high-precision one-to-one word alignments is labeled \"hard projection\" in the table.",
        "We filtered the training corpus to find sentences where enough links were projected to completely determine a target language tree.",
        "Of course, we needed to filter more than 1000 sentences of bitext to output 1000 training sentences in this way.",
        "We simply perform supervised training with this subset, which is still quite noisy (§4), and performance quickly plateaus.",
        "Still, this method substantially improves over the baselines and unsupervised EM.",
        "Restricting ourselves to fully projected trees seems a waste of information.",
        "We can also simply take all one-to-one projected links, impute expected counts for the remaining dependencies with EM, and update our models.",
        "This approach (\"hard projection with EM\"), however, performed worse than using only the fully projected trees.",
        "In fact, only the first iteration of EM with this method made any improvement; afterwards, EM degraded accuracy further from the numbers in Table 3.",
        "The quasi-synchronous model used all of the alignments in re-estimating its parameters and performed significantly better than hard projection.",
        "Unlike EM on the target language alone, the QG's performance does not depend on a clever initializer for initial model weights – all parameters of the generative model except for the QG configuration features were initialized to zero.",
        "Setting the prior to prefer direct correspondence provides the necessary bias to initialize learning.",
        "Error analysis showed that certain types of dependencies eluded the QG's ability to learn from bitext.",
        "The Spanish treebank treats some verbal complements as the heads of main verbs and auxiliary verbs as the children of participles; the QG, following the English, learned the opposite dependency direction.",
        "Spanish treebank conventions for punctuation were also a common source of errors.",
        "In both German and Spanish, coordinations (a common bugbear for dependency grammars) were often mishandled: both treebanks attach the later coordinands and any conjunctions to the first coordinand; the reverse is true in English.",
        "Finally, in both German and Spanish, preposition attachments often led to errors, which is not surprising given the unlexicalized target-language grammars.",
        "Rather than trying to adjudicate which dependencies are \"mere\" annotation conventions, it would be useful to test learned dependency models on some extrinsic task such as relation extraction or machine translation."
