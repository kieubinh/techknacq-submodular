        "Lhere is an extensive research literature on building high quality parsers for English (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000; Charniak and Johnson, 2005; Petrov et al., 2006), however, models for parsing other languages are less well developed.",
        "Lake Chinese for example; there have been several attempts to develop accurate parsers for Chinese (Bikel and Chiang, 2000; Levy and Manning, 2003; Petrov and Klein, 2007), but the state-of-the-art performance, around 83% F measure on Penn Chinese Lreebank (achieved by the Berkeley parser (Petrov and Klein, 2007)) falls far short of performance on English (~90-92%).",
        "As pointed out in (Levy and Manning, 2003), there are many linguistic differences between Chinese and English, as well as structural differences between their corresponding treebanks, and some of these make it a harder task to parse Chinese.",
        "Additionally, the fact that the available treebanked Chinese materials are more limited than for English also increases the challenge of building high quality Chinese parsers.",
        "Many of these differences would also tend to apply to other less well investigated languages.",
        "In this paper, we focus on English and Chinese because the former is a language for which extensive parsing research has been conducted while the latter is a language that has been less extensively studied.",
        "We adapt and improve the Berkeley parser, which learns PCFG grammars with latent annotations, and show through comparative studies that this parser significantly outperforms Charniak's parser, which was initially developed for English and subsequently ported to Chinese.",
        "We focus on answering two questions: how well does a parser perform across languages and how much does it benefit from self-training?",
        "Lhe first question is of special interest when choosing a parser that is designed for one language and adapting it to another less studied language.",
        "We improve the PCFG-LA parser by adding a language-independent method for handling rare words and adapt it to another language, Chinese, by creating a method to better model Chinese unknown words.",
        "Our results show that the PCFG-LA parser performs significantly better than Charniak's parser on Chinese, and is also somewhat more accurate on English, although both parsers have high accuracy.",
        "Lhe second question is important because labeled training data is often quite limited, especially for less well investigated languages, while unlabeled data is ubiquitous.",
        "Early investigations on self-training for parsing have had mixed results.",
        "Charniak (1997) reported no improvements from self-training a PCFG parser on the standard WSJ training set.",

        "It is worth noting that their attempts at self-training Charniak's lexicalized parser directly resulted in no improvement.",
        "There are other successful semi-supervised training approaches for dependency parsing, such as (Koo et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2008), and it would be interesting to investigate how they could be applied to constituency parsing.",
        "We show in this paper, for the first time, that self-training is able to significantly improve the performance of the PCFG-LA parser, a single generative parser, on both small and large amounts of labeled training data, for both English and Chinese.",
        "With self-training, a fraction of the WSI or CTB6 treebank training data is sufficient to train a PCFG-LA parser that is able to achieve or even beat the accuracies obtained using a single parser trained on the entire treebank without self-training.",
        "We conjecture based on our comparison of the PCFG-LA parser to Charniak's parser that the addition of self-training data helps the former parser learn more fine-grained latent annotations without over-fitting.",

        "Lhe Berkeley parser (Petrov et al., 2006; Petrov and Klein, 2007) is an efficient and effective parser that introduces latent annotations (Matsuzaki et al., 2005) to refine syntactic categories to learn better PCFG grammars.",
        "In the example parse tree in Figure 1(a), each syntactic category is split into multiple latent subcategories, and accordingly the original parse tree is decomposed into many parse trees with latent annotations.",
        "Figure 1(b) depicts one of such trees.",
        "Lhe grammar and lexical rules are split accordingly, e.g., NP^PRP is split into different NP-i^PRP-j rules.",
        "Lhe expansion probabilities of these split rules are the parameters of a PCFG-LA grammar.",

        "Figure 1 : (a) original treebank tree, (b) after latent annotation.",
        "Lhe objective of training is to learn a grammar with latent annotations that maximizes the likelihood of the training trees, i.e., the sum of the likelihood of all parse trees with latent annotations.",
        "Since the latent annotations are not available in the treebank, a variant of the EM algorithm is utilized to learn the rule probabilities for them.",
        "Lhe Berkeley parser employs a hierarchical split-merge method that gradually increases the number of latent annotations and adaptively allocates them to different treebank categories to best model the training data.",
        "In this paper, we call a grammar trained after n split-merge steps an nth order grammar.",
        "Lhe order of a grammar is a step (not continuous) function of the number of latent annotations because the split-merge algorithm first splits each latent annotation into two and then merges some of the splits back based on their ability to increase training likelihood.",
        "For this paper, we implemented our own version of Berkeley parser.",
        "Updates include better handling of rare words across languages, as well as unknown Chinese words.",
        "Lhe parser is able to process difficult sentences robustly using adaptive beam expansion.",
        "Lhe training algorithm was updated to support a wide range of self-training experiments (e.g., posterior-weighted unlabeled data, introducing self-training in later iterations) and to make use of multiple processors to parallelize EM training.",
        "Lhe parallelization is crucial for training a model with large volumes of data in a reasonable amount of time.",
        "We next describe the language-independent method to handle rare words, which is important for training better PCFG-LA grammars especially when the training data is limited in size, and our unknown Chinese word handling method, highlighting the importance of utilizing language-specific features to enhance parsing performance.",
        "As we will see later, both of these methods significantly improve parsing performance.",
        "Whereas rule expansions are frequently observed in the treebank, word-tag co-occurrences are sparser and more likely to suffer from over-fitting.",
        "Although the lexicon smoothing method in the Berkeley parser is able to make the word emission probabilities of different latent states of a POS tag more alike, the EM training algorithm still strongly discriminates among word identities.",
        "Suppose word tag pairs (wi,t) and (w2,t) both appear the same number of times in the training data.",
        "In a PCFG grammar without latent annotations, the probabilities of emitting these two words given tag t would be the same, i.e., p(w\\\\t) = p(w2\\t).",
        "After introducing latent annotation x to tag t, the emission probabilities of these two words given a latent state tx may no longer be the same because p{w\\\\tx) and p{w2\\tx) are two independent parameters that the EM algorithm optimizes on.",
        "It is beneficial to learn subcategories of POS tags to model different types of words, especially for frequent words; however, it is not desirable to strongly discriminate among rare words because it could distract the model from learning about common phenomena.",
        "Lo handle this problem, the probability of a latent state tx generating a rare word w is forced to be proportional to the emission probability of word w given the surface tag t. Lhis is achieved by mapping all words with frequency less than threshold A to the unk symbol, and for each latent state tx of a POS tag t, accumulating the word tag statistics of these rare words to cr (tx, unk) = J2wc(w)<\\ cfe> w)> and then redistributing them among the rare words to estimate their emission probabilities:",
        "The parallel version is able to train our largest grammar on a 8-core machine within a week, while the non-parallel version is not able to finish even after 3 weeks.",
        "The value of A is tuned on the development set.",
        "Lhe Berkeley parser utilizes statistics associated with rare words (e.g., suffix, capitalization) to estimate the emission probabilities of unknown words at decoding time.",
        "Lhis is adequate for for English, however, only a limited number of classes of unknown words, such as digits and dates, are handled for Chinese.",
        "In this paper, we develop a character-based unknown word model inspired by (Huang et al., 2007) that reflects the fact that characters in any position (prefix, infix, or suffix) can be predictive of the part-of-speech (POS) type for Chinese words.",
        "In our model, the word emission probability, p(w\\tx), of an unknown word w given the latent state tx of POS tag t is estimated by the geometric average of the emission probability of the characters in the word:",
        "where n = \\{ck G w\\P{ck\\t) / 0}|.",
        "Characters not seen in the training data are ignored in the computation of the geometric average.",

        "Our hypothesis is that combining automatically labeled parses with treebank trees will help the EM training of the PCFG-LA parser to make more informed decisions about latent annotations and thus generate more effective grammars.",
        "In this section, we discuss how self-training is applied to train a PCFG-LA parser.",
        "Lhere are several ways to automatically label the data.",
        "A fairly standard method is to parse the unlabeled sentences with a parser trained on labeled training data, and then combine the resulting parses with the treebank training data to retrain the parser.",
        "Lhis is the approach we chose for self-training.",
        "An alternative approach is to run EM directly on the labeled treebank trees and the unlabeled sentences, without explicit parse trees for the unlabeled sentences.",
        "However, because the brackets would need to be determined for the unlabeled sentences together with the latent annotations, this would increase the running time from linear in the number of expansion rules to cubic in the length of the sentence.",
        "Another important decision is how to weight the gold standard and automatically labeled data when training a new parser model.",
        "Errors in the automatically labeled data could limit the accuracy of the self-trained model, especially when there is a much greater quantity of automatically labeled data than the gold standard training data.",
        "To balance the gold standard and automatically labeled data, one could duplicate the treebank data to match the size of the automatically labeled data; however, the training of the PCFG-LA parser would result in redundant applications of EM computations over the same data, increasing the cost of training.",
        "Instead we weight the posterior probabilities computed for the gold and automatically labeled data, so that they contribute equally to the resulting grammar.",
        "Our preliminary experiments show that balanced weighting is effective, especially for Chinese (about 0.4% absolute improvement) where the automatic parse trees have a relatively lower accuracy.",
        "The training procedure of the PCFG-LA parser gradually introduces more latent annotations during each split-merge stage, and the self-labeled data can be introduced at any of these stages.",
        "Introduction of the self-labeled data in later stages, after some important annotations are learned from the treebank, could result in more effective learning.",
        "We have found that a middle stage introduction (after 3 split-merge iterations) of the automatically labeled data has an effect similar to balancing the weights of the gold and automatically labeled trees, possibly due to the fact that both methods place greater trust in the former than the latter.",
        "In this study, we introduce the automatically labeled data at the outset and weight it equally with the gold treebank training data in order to focus our experiments to support a deeper analysis."

      "text": [
        "In this section, we perform a series of analyses, focusing on English (refer to Figure 3), to investigate why the PCFG-LA parser benefits more from additional data, most particularly automatically labeled data, when compared to Charniak's parser.",
        "Similar analyses have been done for Chinese with similar results (refer to Figure 4).",
        "Charniak's parser is a lexicalized PCFG parser that models lexicalized dependencies explicitly observable in the training data and relies on smoothing to avoid over-fitting.",
        "Although it is able to benefit from more training data because of broader lexicon and rule coverage and more robust estimation of parameters, its ability to benefit from the additional data is limited in the sense that it is not able to generate additional predictive features that are supported by this data.",
        "As shown in figure 3(a), the parsing accuracy of Charniak's parser on the test set improves as the amount of labeled training data increases; however, the training accuracy degrades as more data is added.",
        "Note that the training accuracy of Charniak's parser also decreases after the addition of self-training data.",
        "This is expected for models like Charniak's parser with fixed model parameters; it is harder to model more data with greater diversity.",
        "The addition of self-labeled data helps on the test set initially but it provides little gain when the labeled training data becomes relatively large.",
        "In contrast, the PCFG-LA grammar is able to model the training data with different granularities.",
        "Fewer latent annotations are employed when the training set is small.",
        "As the size of the training data increases, it is able to allocate more latent annotations to better model the data.",
        "As shown in Figure 3 (b), for a fixed amount (20%) of labeled training data, the accuracy of the model on training data continues to improve as the number of latent annotation increases.",
        "Although it is important to limit the number of latent annotations to avoid over-fitting, the ability to model training data accurately given sufficient latent annotations is desirable when more training data is available.",
        "When trained on the labeled data (20%) alone, the 5-th order grammar achieves its optimal generalization performance (based on the development set) and begins to degrade afterwords.",
        "With the addition of self-training data, the 5-th order grammar achieves an even greater accuracy on the test set and its performance continues to increase when moving to the 6-th or even 7-th order grammar.",
        "Figure 3 (c) plots the training and test curves of the English PCFG-LA parser with varying amounts of labeled training data, with and without self-training.",
        "Lhis figure differs substantially from Figure 3 (a).",
        "First, as mentioned earlier, the PCFG-LA parser benefits much more from self-training than Charniak's parser with moderate to large amounts of labeled training data.",
        "Second, in contrast to Charniak's parser for which training accuracy degrades consistently as the amount of labeled training data increases, the training accuracy of the PCFG-LA parser sometimes improves when trained on more labeled training data (e.g., the best model (at order 6) trained on 40% labeled training data alone has a higher training accuracy than the best model (at order 5) trained on 20% labeled training data).",
        "Lhird, the addition of self-labeled data supports more accurate PCFG-LA grammars with higher orders than those trained without self-training, as evidenced by scores on both the training and test data.",
        "Lhis suggests that the self-trained grammars are able to utilize more latent annotations to learn deeper dependencies.",

        "Figure 5: Lhe relative reduction of bracketing errors for different span lengths, evaluated on the test set.",
        "Lhe baseline model is the PCFG-LA parser trained on 20% of the WSJ training data.",
        "Lhe +Unlabeled curve corresponds to the parser trained with the additional automatically labeled data and the +Labeled curve corresponds to the parser trained with additional 20% labeled training data.",
        "Lhe counts of the brackets are computed on the gold reference.",
        "Span length '0' is designated for the effect on preterminal POS tags to differentiate it from the non-terminal brackets spanning only one word.",
        "Figure 5 compares the effect of additional treebank labeled and automatically labeled data on the relative reduction of bracketing errors for different span lengths.",
        "It is clear from the figure that the improvement in parsing accuracy from self-training is the result of better bracketing across all span lengths.",
        "However, even though the automatically labeled training data provides more improvement than the additional treebank labeled data in terms of parsing accuracy, this data is less effective at improving tagging accuracy than the additional treebank labeled training data.",
        "So, how could self-training improve rule estimation when training the PCFG-LA parser with more latent annotations?",
        "One possibility is that the automatically labeled data smooths the parameter estimates in the EM algorithm, enabling effective training of models with more parameters to learn deeper dependencies.",
        "Let p(a â > b\\e,t) be the posterior probability of expanding subcategories a to b given the event e, which is a rule expansion on a treebank parse tree t. Ã] and Tu are the sets of gold and automatically labeled parse trees, respectively.",
        "Lhe update of the rule expansion probability p(a â > b) in self-training (with weighting parameter a) can be expressed as:",
        "teTi eet teTu eet",
        "Since the unlabeled data is parsed by a lower order grammar (with fewer latent annotations), the expected counts from the automatically labeled data can be thought of as counts from a lower-order grammar that smooth the higher-order (with more latent annotations) grammar.",
        "We observe that many of the rule parameters of the grammar trained on WSJ training data alone have zero probabilities (rules with extremely low probabilities are also filtered to zero), as was also pointed out in (Petrov et al., 2006).",
        "On the one hand, this is what we want because the grammar should learn to avoid impossible rule expansions.",
        "On the other hand, this might also be a sign of over-fitting of the labeled training data.",
        "As shown in Figure 3 (b), the grammar obtained with the addition of automatically labeled data contains many more non-zero rules, and its performance continues to improve with more latent annotations.",
        "Similar patterns also appear when using self-training for other amounts of labeled training data.",
        "As is partially reflected by the zero probability rules, the addition of the automatically labeled data enables the exploration of a broader parameter space with less danger of over-fitting the data.",
        "Also note that the benefit of the automatically labeled data is less clear in the early training stages (i.e., when there are fewer latent annotations), as can be seen in Figure 3 (b).",
        "Lhis is probably because there is a small number of free parameters and the treebank data is sufficiently large for robust parameter estimation.",
        "We also trained models using only the automatically labeled data without combining it with human-labeled training data, but they were no more accurate than those trained on the human-labeled training data alone without self-training."

      "text": [
        "In this paper, we showed that PCFG-LA parsers can be more effectively applied to languages where parsing is less well developed and that they are able to benefit more from self-training than lexicalized generative parsers.",
        "We show for the first time that self-training is able to significantly improve the performance of a PCFG-LA parser, a single generative parser, on both small and large amounts of labeled training data.",
        "We conjecture based on our analysis that the EM training algorithm is able to exploit the information available in both gold and automatically labeled data with more complex grammars while being less affected by over-fitting.",
        "Better results would be expected by combining the PCFG-LA parser with discriminative reranking approaches (Charniak and Johnson, 2005 ; Huang, 2008) for self training.",
        "Self-training should also benefit other discriminatively trained parsers with latent annotations (Petrov and Klein, 2008), although training would be much slower compared to using generative models, as in our case.",
        "In future work, we plan to scale up the training process with more unlabeled training data (e.g., gigaword) and investigate automatic selection of materials that are most suitable for self-training.",
        "We also plan to investigate domain adaptation and apply the model to other languages with modest treebank resources.",
        "Finally, it is also important to explore other ways to exploit the use of unlabeled data."
