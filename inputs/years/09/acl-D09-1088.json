        "Parsing technology has come a long way since Charniak (1996) demonstrated that a simple treebank PCFG performs better than any other parser (with Fi 75 accuracy) on parsing the WSJ Perm treebank (Marcus et al., 1993).",
        "Treebank Grammars (Scha, 1990; Charniak, 1996) trained on large corpora nowadays present the best available means to parse natural language text.",
        "The performance curve for parsing the WSJ was a steep one at first, as the incorporation of notions such as head, distance, subcategorization (Charniak, 1997; Collins, 1999) brought about a dramatic increase in parsing accuracy to the level of Fi 88.",
        "Discriminative approaches, Data-Oriented Parsing ('all-subtrees') approaches, and self-training techniques brought further improvements, and recent results are starting to level off at around Fi92.1 (McClosky et al., 2008).",
        "As the interest of the NLP community grows to encompass more languages, we observe efforts towards adapting an English parser for parsing other languages (e.g., (Collins et al., 1999)), or towards designing a language-independent framework based on principles underlying the models for parsing English (Bikel, 2002).",
        "The performance curve for parsing other languages with these models looks rather different.",
        "A case in point is Modern Standard Arabic.",
        "Since the initial effort of (Bikel, 2002) to parse the Arabic treebank (Maamouri et al., 2004), which yielded Fi75 accuracy, four years and successive revisions have led to no more than Fi79 (Maamouri et al., 2008).",
        "This pattern from Arabic is not peculiar.",
        "The level of state-of-the-art results for other languages still lags behind those for English, even after putting considerable effort into the adaptation.Given that these languages are inherently different from English and from one another, it appears that we cannot avoid a question concerning the adequacy of the models used to parse them.",
        "That is, given the properties of a language, which modeling strategy would be appropriate for parsing it?",
        "Until recently, there has been practically no computationally affordable alternative to the Head-Driven (HD) approach in the development of phrase-structure based statistical parsing models.",
        "Recently, we proposed the Relational-Realizational (RR) approach that rests upon different premises (Tsarfaty and Sima'an, 2008).",
        "The question of how the RR model fares against the HD models that have so far been predominantly used has never been tackled.",
        "Yet, it is precisely such a comparison that can shed new light on the question of adequacy we posed above.",
        "Empirically quantifying the effects of different modeling choices has been addressed for English by, e.g., (Johnson, 1998; Klein and Manning, 2003), and for German by, e.g., (Dubey, 2004;",

        "This comparison is intended to provide a first answer to the question of parser adequacy in the face of word-order freedom.",
        "Our two empirical results are unequivocal.",
        "Firstly, RR models significantly outperform HD models (about 2 points absolute improvement in Fi) in parsing the Modern Hebrew treebank.",
        "In particular, RR models show better performance in identifying the constituents for which syntactic positions are relatively free.",
        "Secondly, we show a novel variation of the HD model, incorporating the Relational notions of the RR model, on the hypothesis that this might bridge the gap.",
        "The RR model remains superior.",
        "Our post-experimental analysis shows that HD modeling is inherently problematic for parsing a language with freer word-order because of the hard-wiring of notions such as left, right and distance from the head.",

        "The native representation of clause-level categories in the Treebank employs flat structures.",
        "This choice was made due to the lack of empirical evidence in Hebrew for grouping freely positioned syntactic elements to form a constituent.",
        "In order to compensate for the ambiguity in the interpretation of flat structures, additional information such as morphological marking and grammatical function labels is added to the phrase-structure trees.",
        "The simplest way to encode grammatical functions information on top of the phrase-structure representation in the treebank is by decorating non-terminal nodes with morphological or functional features, similarly to the rich representation format of syntactic categories in GPSG.",
        "This is the approach taken by the annotators of the Hebrew treebank in which information about morphological marking appears at multiple levels of constituency (Guthmann et al., 2009), and functional features (such as subject, object, etc.)",
        "decorate phrase-level constituent labels (Sima'an et al., 2001).",
        "The S-level representation of our example sentences (3a)-(3b) then would be as we depict in figure 1, which can be read off as feature-rich",
        "PCFG productions.",
        "We refer to this approach as the State-Splits (SP) approach, which serves as the baseline for the rest of our investigation.",
        "Following the linguistic wisdom that the internal organization of syntactic constituents revolves around their heads, Head-Driven (HD) models have been proposed by (Magerman, 1995; Charniak, 1997; Collins, 1999).",
        "In a generative HD model, the head daughter is generated first, conditioned on properties of the mother node.",
        "Then, sisters of the head daughter are generated conditioned on the head, typically by left and right generation processes.",
        "Overall, HD processes have the modeling advantage that they capture structurally-marked positions that characterize the argument structure of the sentence.",
        "The simplest possible process uses unigram probabilities, but (Klein and Manning, 2003) show that using vertical and horizontal Markovization improves parsing accuracy.An unlexicalized generative HD model will generate our two example sentences as we illustrate in figure 2.",
        "The generation of the context-free events in figure 1 is then broken down to seven different context-free parameters each, encoding head-parent and head-sister structural relationships – the latter mediated with a structurally-marked delta function (Ai).",
        "The rich morphological representation of phrase-level NP objects (+def/acc), for instance, is conditioned on the head sister, its direction, and the distance from the head (check, e.g., nodes , A#2).",
        "The Relational-Realizational (RR) parsing model of (Tsarfaty and Sima'an, 2008) similarly decomposes the generation of the context-free events in figure 1 into multiple independent parameters, but does so in a conceptually different way.",
