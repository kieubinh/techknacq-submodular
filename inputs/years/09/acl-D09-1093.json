        "We have designed, implemented and evaluated an end-to-end system that performs spellchecking and autocorrection.",
        "The key novelty of our work is that the system was developed entirely without the use of manually annotated resources or any explicitly compiled dictionaries of well-spelled words.",
        "Our multi-stage system integrates knowledge from statistical error models and language models (LMs) with a statistical machine learning classifier.",
        "At each stage, data are required for training models and determining weights on the classifiers.",
        "The models and classifiers are all automatically trained from frequency counts derived from the Web and from news data.",

        "We have also shown that the system can be rapidly ported across languages with very little manual effort.",
        "Most spelling systems today require some handcrafted language-specific resources, such as lex-ica, lists of misspellings, or rule bases.",

        "Instead, we rely on the Web as a large noisy corpus in the following ways.",

        "2) The most frequently observed terms are taken as a noisy list of potential candidate corrections.",
        "3) Token n-grams are used to build an LM, which we use to make context-appropriate corrections.",
        "Because our error model is based on scoring substrings, there is no fixed lexicon of well-spelled words to determine misspellings.",
        "Hence, both novel misspelled or well-spelled words are allowable.",

        "Spellchecking and correction are among the oldest text processing problems, and many different solutions have been proposed (Kukich, 1992).",
        "Most approaches are based upon the use of one or more manually compiled resources.",
        "Like most areas of natural language processing, spelling systems have been increasingly empirical, a trend that our system continues.",
        "The most direct approach is to model the causes of spelling errors directly, and encode them in an algorithm or an error model.",
        "Damerau-Levenshtein edit distance was introduced as a way to detect spelling errors (Damerau, 1964).",
        "Phonetic indexing algorithms such as Metaphone, used by gnu Aspell (Atkinson, 2009), repesent words by their approximate 'soundslike' pronunciation, and allow correction of words that appear orthographically dissimilar.",
        "Metaphone relies upon data files containing phonetic information.",
        "Linguistic intuition about the different causes of spelling errors can also be represented explicitly in the spelling system (Deorowicz and Ciura, 2005).",
        "Almost every spelling system to date makes use of a lexicon: a list of terms which are treated as 'well-spelled'.",
        "Lexicons are used as a source of corrections, and also to filter words that should be ignored by the system.",
        "Using lexicons introduces the distinction between 'non-word' and 'real-word' errors, where the misspelled word is another word in the lexicon.",
        "This has led to the two subtasks being approached separately (Golding and Schabes, 1996).",
        "Lexicon-based approaches have trouble handling terms that do not appear in the lexicon, such as proper nouns, foreign terms, and neologisms, which can account for a large proportion of 'non-dictionary' terms (Ahmad and Kondrak, 2005).",
        "A word's context provides useful evidence as to its correctness.",
        "Contextual information can be represented by rules (Mangu and Brill, 1997) or more commonly in an n-gram LM.",
        "Mays et al. (1991) used a trigram LM and a lexicon, which was shown to be competitive despite only allowing for a single correction per sentence (Wilcox-O'Hearn et al., 2008).",
        "Cucerzan and Brill (2004) claim that an LM is much more important than the channel model when correcting Web search queries.",
        "In place of an error-free corpus, the Web has been successfully used to correct real-word errors using bigram features (Lapata and Keller, 2004).",
        "This work uses predefined confusion sets.",
        "The largest step towards an automatically trainable spelling system was the statistical model for spelling errors (Brill and Moore, 2000).",
        "This replaces intuition or linguistic knowledge with a training corpus of misspelling errors, which was compiled by hand.",
        "This approach has also been extended to incorporate a pronunciation model (Toutanova and Moore, 2002).",
        "There has been recent attention on using Web search query data as a source of training data, and as a target for spelling correction (Yang Zhang and Li, 2007; Cucerzan and Brill, 2004).",
        "While query data is a rich source of misspelling information in the form of query-revision pairs, it is not available for general use, and is not used in our approach.",
        "The dependence upon manual resources has created a bottleneck in the development of spelling systems.",
        "There have been few language-independent, multilingual systems, or even systems for languages other than English.",
        "Language-independent systems have been evaluated on Persian (Barari and QasemiZadeh, 2005) and on Arabic and English (Hassan et al., 2008).",
        "To our knowledge, there are no previous evaluations of a language-independent system across many languages, for the full spelling correction task, and indeed, there are no pre-existing standard test sets for typed data with real errors and language context."

        "Our spelling system follows a noisy channel model of spelling errors (Kernighan et al., 1990).",
        "For an observed word w and a candidate correction s, we compute P(s\\w) as P(w\\s) x P(s).",

        "confidence classifiers corrected text.",
        "News data with artificial misspellings",
        "Figure 1 : Spelling process, and knowledge sources used.",
        "The text processing workflow and the data used in building the system are outlined in Figure 1 and detailed in this section.",
        "For each token in the input text, candidate suggestions are drawn from the term list (Section 3.1), and scored using an error model (Section 3.2).",
        "These candidates are evaluated in context using an LM (Section 3.3) and re-ranked.",
        "For each token, we use classifiers (Section 3.4) to determine our confidence in whether a word has been misspelled and if so, whether it should be autocorrected to the best-scoring suggestion available.",
        "We require a list of terms to use as candidate corrections.",
        "Rather than attempt to build a lexicon of words that are well-spelled, we instead take the most frequent tokens observed on the Web.",
        "We used a large (> 1 billion) sample of Web pages, tokenized them, and took the most frequently occurring ten million tokens, with very simple filters for non-words (too much punctuation, too short or long).",
        "This term list is so large that it should contain most well-spelled words, but also a large number of non-words or misspellings.",
        "We use a substring error model to estimate P(w\\s).",
        "To derive the error model, let R be a partitioning of s into adjacent substrings, and similarly let T be a partitioning of w, such that |T| = \\R\\.",
        "The partitions are thus in one-to-one alignment, and by allowing partitions to be empty, the alignment models insertions and deletions of substrings.",
        "Brill and Moore estimate P(w\\s) as follows:",
        "Our system restricts partitionings that have substrings of length at most 2.",
        "To train the error model, we require triples of (intended_word, observed.word, count), which are described below.",
        "We use maximum likelihood estimates of P(Ti\\Ri).",
        "To build the error model, we require as training data a set of (intended.word, observed.word, count) triples, which is compiled from the World Wide Web.",
        "Essentially the triples are built by starting with the term list, and a process that automatically discovers, from that list, putative pairs of spelled and misspelled words, along with their counts.",
        "We believe the Web is ideal for compiling this set of triples because with a vast amount of user-generated content, we believe that the Web contains a representative sample of both well-spelled and misspelled text.",
        "The triples are not used directly for proposing corrections, and since we have a substring model, they do not need to be an exhaustive list of spelling mistakes.",
        "The procedure for finding and updating counts for these triples also assumes that 1) misspellings tend to be orthographically similar to the intended word; Mays et al. (1991) observed that 80% of misspellings derived from single instances of insertion, deletion, or substitution; and 2) words are usually spelled as intended.",
        "For the error model, we use a large corpus (up to 3.7 x 10s pages) of crawled public Web pages.",
        "An automatic language-identification system is used to identify and filter pages for the desired language.",
        "As we only require a small window of context, it would also be possible to use an n-gram collection such as the Google Web IT dataset.",
        "Finding Close Words.",
        "For each term in the term list (defined in Section 3.1), we find all other terms in the list that are \"close\" to it.",
        "We define closeness using Levenshtein-Damerau edit distance, with a conservative upper bound that increases with word length (one edit for words of up to four characters, two edits for up to twelve characters, and three for longer words).",
        "We compile the term list into a trie-based data structure which allows for efficient searching for all terms within a maximum edit distance.",
        "The computation is 'embarassingly parallel' and hence easily distributable.",
        "In practice, we find that this stage takes tens to hundreds of cpu-hours.",
        "Filtering Triples.",
        "At this stage, for each term we have a cluster of orthographically similar terms, which we posit are potential misspellings.",
        "The set of pairs is reflexive and symmetric, e.g. it contains both (recieve, receive) and {receive, re-cieve).",
        "The pairs will also include e.g. {deceive, receive).",
        "On the assumption that words are spelled correctly more often than they are misspelled, we next filter the set such that the first term's frequency is at least 10 times that of the second term.",
        "This ratio was chosen as a conservative heuristic filter.",
        "Using Language Context.",
        "Finally, we use the contexts in which a term occurs to gather directional weightings for misspellings.",
        "Consider a term w; from our source corpus, we collect the set of contexts {ci} in which w occurs.",
        "The definition of a context is relatively arbitrary; we chose to use a single word on each side, discarding contexts with fewer than a total of ten observed occurrences.",
        "For each context a, candidate \"intended\" terms are w and w's close terms (which are at least 10 times as frequent as w).",
        "The candidate which appears in context Cj the most number of times is deemed to be the term intended by the user in that context.",
        "The resulting dataset consists of triples of the original observed term, one of the \"intended\" terms as determined by the above algorithm, and the number of times this term was intended.",
        "For a single term, it is possible (and common) to have multiple possible triples, due to the context-based assignment.",
        "Inspecting the output of this training process shows some interesting patterns.",
        "Overall, the dataset is still noisy; there are many instances where an obviously misspelled word is not assigned a correction, or only some of its instances are.",
        "The dataset contains around 100 million triples, orders of magnitude larger than any manually compiled list of misspellings .",
        "The kinds of errors captured in the dataset include stereotypical spelling errors, such as acomodation, but also ocr-style errors, computationally was detected as a misspelling of computationally where the 'U' is an ocr error for '11'; similarly, Postmodern was detected as a misspelling of Postmodern (an example of 'kerning').",
        "The data also includes examples of 'real-word' errors.",
        "For example, 13% of occurrences of occidental are considered misspellings of accidental; contrasting with 89% of occurrences of the non-word accidential.",
        "There are many examples of terms that would not be in a normal lexicon, including neologisms {mulitplayer for multiplayer), companies and products (Playsta-ton for Playstation), proper nouns {Schwarznegger for Schwarzenegger) and internet domain names (mysapce.com for myspace.com).",
        "We estimate P(s) using n-gram LMs trained on data from the Web, using Stupid Backoff (Brants et al., 2007).",
        "We use both forward and backward context, when available.",
        "Contrary to Brill and Moore (2000), we observe that user edits often have both left and right context, when editing a document.",
        "When combining the error model scores with the LM scores, we weight the latter by taking their A 'th power, that is",
        "The parameter A reflects the relative degrees to which the LM and the error model should be trusted.",
        "The parameter A also plays the additional role of correcting our error model's misestimation of the rate at which people make errors.",
        "For example, if errors are common then by increasing A we can reduce the value of P(w\\w) * P(w)x relative",
        "We train A by optimizing the average inverse rank of the correct word on our training corpus, where the rank is calculated over all suggestions that we have for each token.",
        "During initial experimentation, it was noticed that our system predicted many spurious autocorrections at the beginnings and ends of sentences (or in the case of sentence fragments, the end of the fragment).",
        "We hypothesized that we were weighting the LM scores too highly in such cases.",
        "We therefore conditioned A on how much context was available, obtaining values Xij where i, j represent the amount of context available to the LM to the left and right of the current word, i and j are capped at n, the order of the LM.",
        "While conditioning A in this way might at first appear ad hoc, it has a natural interpretation in terms of our confidence in the LM.",
        "When there is no context to either side of a word, the LM simply uses unigram probabilities, and this is a less trustworthy signal than when more context is available.",
        "To train Xij we partition our data into bins corresponding to pairs i, j and optimize each Xij independently.",
        "Training a constant A, a value of 5.77 was obtained.",
        "The conditioned weights Xij increased with the values of i and j, ranging from Ao,o = 0.82 to Azt;4 = 6.89.",
        "This confirmed our hypothesis that the greater the available context the more confident our system should be in using the LM scores.",
        "Spellchecking and autocorrection were implemented as a three stage process.",
        "These employ confidence classifiers whereby precision-recall tradeoffs could be tuned to desirable levels for both spellchecking and autocorrection.",
        "First, all suggestions s for a word w are ranked according to their P(s\\w) scores.",
        "Second, a spellchecking classifier is used to predict whether w is misspelled.",
        "Third, if w is both predicted to be misspelled and s is non-empty, an autocorrection classifier is used to predict whether the top-ranked suggestion is correct.",
        "The spellchecking classifier is implemented using two embedded classifiers, one of which is used when s is empty, and the other when it is nonempty.",
        "This design was chosen because the useful signals for predicting whether a word is misspelled might be quite different when there are no suggestions available, and because certain features are only applicable when there are suggestions.",
        "Our experiments will compare two classifier types.",
        "Both rely on training data to determine threshold values and training weights.",
        "A \"simple\" classifier which compares the value of log(P(s\\w)) â log(P(w\\w)), for the original word w and the top-ranked suggestion s, with a threshold value.",
        "If there are no suggestions other than w, then the log(P(s\\w)) term is ignored.",
        "A logistic regression classifier that uses five feature sets.",
        "The first set is a scores feature that combines the following scoring information (i) log(P(s\\w)) â log{P{w\\w)) for top-ranked suggestion s. (ii) LM score difference between the original word w and the top suggestion s. (iii) log(P(s\\w)) â log{P{w\\w)) for second top-ranked suggestion s. (iv) LM score difference between w and second top-ranked s. The other four feature sets encode information about case signatures, number of suggestions available, the token length, and the amount of left and right context.",
        "Certain categories of tokens are blacklisted, and so never predicted to be misspelled.",
        "These are numbers, punctuation and symbols, and single-character tokens.",
        "The training process has three stages.",
        "(1) The context score weighting is trained, as described in Section 3.3.",
        "(2) The spellchecking classifier is trained, and tuned on held-out development data.",
        "(3) The autocorrection classifier is trained on the instances with suggestions that the spellchecking classifier predicts to be misspelled, and it too is tuned on held-out development data.",
        "In the experiments reported in this paper, we trained classifiers so as to maximize the F\\-score on the development data.",
        "We note that the desired behaviour of the spellchecking and autocorrection classifiers will differ depending upon the application, and that it is a strength of our system that these can be tuned independently.",
        "Training and tuning the confidence classifiers require supervised data, in the form of pairs of misspelled and well-spelled documents.",
        "And indeed we posit that relatively noiseless data are needed to train robust classifiers.",
        "Since these data are",
        "Table 1: Artificial data set sizes.",
        "The development set is approximately the same size as the training set.",
        "not generally available, we instead use a clean corpus into which we artificially introduce misspellings.",
        "While this data is not ideal, we show that in practice it is sufficient, and removes the need for manually-annotated gold-standard data.",
        "We chose data from news pages crawled from the Web as the original, well-spelled documents.",
        "We chose news pages as an easily identifiable source of text which we assume is almost entirely well-spelled.",
        "Any source of clean text could be used.",
        "For each language the news data were divided into three non-overlapping data sets: the training and development sets were used for training and tuning the confidence classifiers, and a test set was used to report evaluation results.",
        "The data set sizes, for the languages used in this paper, are summarized in Table 1.",
        "Misspelled documents were created by artificially introducing misspelling errors into the well-spelled text.",
        "For all data sets, spelling errors were randomly inserted at an average rate of 2 per hundred characters, resulting in an average word misspelling rate of 9.2%.",
        "With equal likelihood, errors were either character deletions, transpositions, or insertions of randomly selected characters from within the same document."

        "We have implemented a spellchecking and autocorrection system and evaluated it on typed data.",
        "The main contribution of our work is that while this system incorporates several knowledge sources, an error model, LM and confidence classifiers, it does not require any manually annotated resources, and infers its linguistic knowledge entirely from the Web.",
        "Our approach begins with a very large term list that is noisy, containing both spelled and misspelled words, and derived automatically with no human checking for whether words are valid or not.",
        "We believe this is the first published system to obviate the need for any hand labeled data.",
        "We have shown that system performance improves from a system that embeds handcrafted knowledge, yielding a 3.8% total error rate on human typed data that originally had a 10.8% error rate.",
        "News data with artificially inserted spellings were sufficient to train confidence classifiers to a satisfactory level.",
        "This was shown for both German and English.",
        "These innovations enable the rapid development of a spellchecking and correction system for any language for which tokeniz-ers exist and string edit distances make sense.",
        "We have done so for Arabic and Russian.",
        "In this paper, our results were obtained without any optimization of the parameters used in the process of gathering data from the Web.",
        "We wanted to minimize manual tweaking particularly if it were necessary for every language.",
        "Thus heuristics such as the number of terms in the term list, the criteria for filtering triples, and the edit distance for defining close words were crude, and could easily be improved upon.",
        "It may be beneficial to perform more tuning in future.",
        "Furthermore, future work will involve evaluating the performance of the system for these language on real typed data."
