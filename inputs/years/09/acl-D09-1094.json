        "As we demonstrate later in the paper, such data may be automatically obtained by crawling specialized resources on the Web.",
        "We demonstrate how to use such data to estimate the word acquisition parameters (2) and to use the estimates to predict future readability ages.",
        "Traditionally, document readability has been defined in terms of the school grade level at which a large portion of the words have been acquired by most children (Chall and Dale, 1995).",
        "We propose the following interpretation ofthat definition, which is made appropriate for quantitative studies by taking into account the inherent randomness in the acquisition process.",

Despite the fact that it does not have a closed form, it is a continuous and smooth function of the parameters fj,w, aw in (1) (assuming T is infinite) and can be tabulated before inference begins.",
        "Following Definition 1 we define a logistic Rasch readability model:",
        "P(d is (s, r)-readable at age t) where qd(s, r) is the s quantile of {qWi{r) : i = 1,..., m}.",

        "It can be set to a high value such as 0.9 if a very precise understanding is required for readability but can be reduced when a more modest definition of readability applies.",

        "This raises some practical difficulties with respect to the computational maximization of the likelihood and subsequent estimation of (2).",
        "However, for long documents containing a large number of words, qd(s, r) is approximately smooth which motivates a maximum likelihood procedure using gradient descent on a smoothed version of qd(s).",

        "The word assimilation appears in 2 documents having 12th grade readability.",
        "The high grade level of these documents results in a high estimated acquisition age and the paucity of observations leads to a large uncertainty in this estimate as seen by the variance of the acquisition age distribution.",

        "The relationship in Figure 2 between the empirical word appearances and the age acquisition distribution demonstrates the following behavior: (a) The variance of the age acquisition distribution goes down as the word appears in more documents, and (b) the mean of the AoA distribution tends to be lower than the mean of the empirical word appearance distribution, and in many cases even smaller than the first grade in which the word appeared.",
        "This is to be expected as authors use specific words only after they believe the words were acquired by a large portion of the intended audience.",

        "The recent AoA list of Cortese and Khanna (2008) showed an increase in correlation relative to the GL study (r = 0.43) potentially reflecting change in the acquisition process due to temporal effects.",

        "Approximately 40% of the words assigned the same grade level by both Gilhooly and our prediction had an AoA of 1st grade.",
        "In some cases, the ages of acquisition obtained from readability data is actually lower than the ages reported in the older oral studies.",

        "Approximately 30 years have passed since Gilhooly and Logie's study was conducted.",
        "Specifically, society has made efforts to enhance the safety and health of children and to increase the attention to science education in very early grades.",
        "For example, the word drug appeared in writing 0.94 grades earlier than the age in which it was acquired orally according to the GL study.",
        "The newer Bristol Norm study confirms this observation as it predicts a decrease in grade level for drug of 0.88 over GL as well.",

        "A critical issue for reading difficulty prediction is how to handle words that appear in a new document that have never been seen in the training/development texts.",
        "In a statistical approach, the solution to this smoothing problem has two steps.",
        "First, we must decide how much total probability mass to allocate to all unknown words.",
        "Second, we must decide how to subdivide this total mass for individual words or classes of words using word-specific priors.",
        "Our experience suggests that the first step of estimating total probability mass is particularly important: the likelihood of seeing an unknown word increases as a function of total vocabulary size, which is continuously growing with time.",
        "We model this by defining the following dynamic threshold",
        "We learn the growth rate parameter a in (6) from the data at the same time as we learn the readability model's quantile parameters s = 1 – e\\, r = 1 – Ê2.",
        "The range of the resulting ß(t) is typically 0.5 in lower grades, increasing to 0.9 in higher grades.",
        "We discuss fitting these parameters and their optimal values further in Sec. 3.3.1.",
        "We found that using any fixed ß value for all grades was generally much less effective than a dynamic ß{t) threshold, and so we focus on the latter in our evaluation.",
        "For the second (word-specific) smoothing step, we simply assign uniform probability across grades, once the total unseen mass is determined.",
        "More sophisticated word-specific priors incorporating word length, morphological features, semantic clusters and so on are certainly possible and an interesting direction for future work.",
        "In the following section we conduct three experiments involving readability prediction.",
        "First, we confirm the effectiveness of the AoA-based model compared to other predictive models.",
        "Second, we examine how prediction effectiveness is affected when our learned (written) acquisition ages are replaced with existing oral AoA norms.",

        "Second, the trained model is applied with to the Reader A-Z corpus and the results are compared with alternative semantic variables.",
        "Because corpora can vary significantly in text homogeneity, amount of noise, document size, and other factors, training and testing across different corpora - rather than relying on cross-validation with a single pooled dataset - gives valuable information about how a prediction method might be expected to perform on data with widely different characteristics.",

        "In particular, we examine the performance of support vector regression (SVR) using the estimated AoA percentiles for each document as predictor variables.",
        "The results displayed in Figure 7 show that SVR and the dynamic threshold prediction rule perform similarly well, suggesting that Definition 1 and the Rasch model are suitable models for readability prediction.",
        "We now examine how predicting readability of novel documents using acquisition ages obtained in surveys perform in comparison to the ages obtained from the maximum likelihood estimation.",
        "We use the GL and Bristol age of acquisition norms.",
        "The intersection of AoA norm data and the Web Corpus are 1217 and 1012 words respectively for the GL and Bristol measure; additionally, the highest grade level associated with these word sets",
        "Figure 9: The Gilhooly and Logie AoA norms and the Bristol norms are independent sources for ages of acquisition.",
        "A comparison of the prediction quality using these norms shows two things: 1) the definition provides comparable prediction quality using expert norms, and 2) the dynamic threshold ß{t) improves prediction over the static threshold (optimal s-th percentile) for the norms.",
        "Figure 10: The readability of WR documents was predicted using 4 sources of AoA data.",
        "The parameters of the prediction model were fit using only the Web data, or the WR data, or both sources in the case of the GL and Bristol norms AoA data.",
        "are eight and seven respectively.",
        "When applying the prediction rule using AoA norms r is implicitly selected in the norming process as the result is a single value instead of a distribution.",
        "Interestingly, the optimal ranges of s-percentile, from 92 to 100, were the same for both the GL and Bristol norms.",
        "Table 9 shows that the prediction accuracy obtained using the GL Norms was almost identical to that obtained with the inferred AoA, while the Bristol Norms performed as well as some of the competitor procedures.",
        "To provide additional evidence for our model's ability to generalize to new corpora, we examine how the learned r and s values vary when the model is learned on one corpus and evaluated on another, and how this affects the accuracy of the readability prediction.",
        "Figure 10 demonstrates the corpus used for tuning the readability prediction has a large impact on the quality of the prediction.",
        "Comparing the MAE of the readability predictions on WR data when the age of acquisition is inferred from Web data to the MAE when the AoA is inferred from WR data shows the error rate more than doubles from 0.90 to 1.89.",
        "The increase in error rate also appears when the age of acquisition for WR data is predicted using the AoA norm data.",
        "In this case the prediction was performed using the parameters identified when the model was trained on Web data and when the model was trained on WR data.",
        "In each case a tendency to overfit appears as the MAE increases from 1.14 to 2.05 for the GL norms and 1.34 to 1.57 for the Bristol norms.",
        "Interestingly, the Bristol norms perform better on WR data when fit using the Web data, while the GL norms perform better when fit using the WR data.",

        "Age of acquisition for word reading and understanding has been extensively studied as a learning factor in the psycholinguistics literature, where AoA norms have been obtained using surveys.",
        "Examples of relevant literature are (Gilhooly and Lo-gie, 1980; Zevin and Seidenberg, 2002).",
        "Our approach differs by connecting AoA to readability through Definition 1 and using readability data to estimate AoA norms from large amounts of authentic language data.",
        "A related study is that by Crossley et al.",
        "(2007) who used AoA to help discriminate between authentic and simplified texts for second-language readers.",
        "In the past decade, there has been renewed interest in corpus-based statistical models for readability prediction.",
        "One example is the popular Lexile measure (Stenner, 1996) which uses word frequency statistics from a large English corpus.",
        "Collins-Thompson and Callan (2005) introduced a new approach based on statistical language modeling, treating a document as a mixture of language models for individual grades.",
        "Further recent refinements in methods for readability prediction include using machine learning methods such as Support Vector Machines (Schwann and Os-tendorf, 2005), log-linear models (Heilman et al., 2008), A;-NN classifiers and combining semantic and grammatical features (Heilman et al., 2007).",
        "The growing number of features investigated by these machine learning approaches reflect the fact that reading difficulty is a complex phenomenon involving many factors, from semantic difficulty (vocabulary) to syntax and discourse complexity, reader background, and others.",
        "While a fullfeatured comparison between previous approaches that includes AoA features would be very interesting, our goal in this study was to provide a clear analysis of the most fundamental factor of readability, semantic difficulty, which accounts for 80-90% of the variance in readability prediction scores (Chall and Dale, 1995).",
        "Because AoA is a semantic, vocabulary-based representation, we compare its effectiveness with the corresponding semantic components from previous machine-learning approaches in Sec. 3.3.1."
