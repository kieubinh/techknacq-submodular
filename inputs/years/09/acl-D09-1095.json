        "Constraints on the interpretation of a word w in context comes both from the local and global context, and are applied to the information/knowledge evoked by w. The local constraints come from the words with which w is (grammatically) related to.",

        "Metonymie words have a rather small number of possible interpretations (also called readings) which occur frequently (Markert and Nissim, 2002).",
        "Idiosyncratic interpretations are also possible, but very rare.",
        "One can view the possible interpretations of a potentially métonymie word (PMW) as corresponding to the word's possible senses (Nissim and Markert, 2003), bringing the task close to word sense disambiguation.",
        "The approach to metonymy resolution presented here is supervised, with unsupervised feature enrichment.",
        "We apply techniques inspired by unsupervised word sense disambiguation, which allow us to go beyond the annotated data provided in training, and quantify the restrictions imposed on the interpretation of a PMW by its grammatically related neighbours through collocation information extracted from corpora.",
        "The only annotation required for the corpora are automatically induced part-of-speech tags from which we obtain grammatical relations through regular expression matching over sequences of parts-of-speech.",

        "Analysis of metonymies as a linguistic phenomenon dates back at least to the 1930s (Stern, 1931), and are increasingly recognized as an important phenomenon to tackle in the interest of higher level language processing tasks, such as anaphora resolution (Harabagiu, 1998; Markert and Hahn, 2002), question answering (Stallard, 1993) or machine translation (Kamei and Wakao, 1992).",
        "Until the early 90s, the main view about metonymies was that they violate semantic constraints in their immediate context.",
        "To resolve metonymies then amounts to detecting violated constraints, usually from those imposed by the verbs on their arguments (Pustejovsky, 1991; Hobbs et al., 1993; Fass, 1991).",
        "Markert and Hahn (2002) showed that this approach misses metonymies which do not violate selectional restrictions.",
        "In this case referential cohesion relations may indicate that the literal reading is not appropriate and give clues about the intended metonymic interpretation.",
        "Markert and Nissim (2003) have combined observations from the linguistic analysis of metonymies with results of corpus studies.",
        "Linguistic research has postulated that (i) conventional metonymic readings are very systematic; (ii) unconventional metonymies can be created on the fly and their interpretation is context dependent; (iii) metonymies are frequent.",
        "The fact that most metonymic interpretations are systematic and correspond to a small set ofpossible readings allow the metonymy resolution to be modelled as a classifier learning task.",
        "Markert and Nisshown that conventional metonymies can be effectively resolved using a supervised machine learning approach.",
        "Moreover, grammatically related words are crucial in determining the interpretation of a PMW.",
        "The shortcoming is that manually annotated data is in short supply, and the approach suffers from data sparseness.",
        "To address this problem, Nissim and Markert (2003) proposed a word similarity-based method.",
        "They use Lin s thesaurus (Lin, 1998) to determine how close two lexical heads are, and use this instead of the more restrictive identity constraint when comparing two instances.",
        "This technique is complex, requiring smoothing, multiple iterations over the thesaurus and hybrid methods to allow a back-off to grammatical roles.",
        "The supervised approach to resolving metonymies was encouraged by the metonymy resolution task at the semantic evaluation exercise SemEval 2007 (Markert and Nissim, 2007).",
        "The participating systems in this task were varied.",
        "Most of them (four out of five) have used supervised machine learning techniques.",
        "The systems that beat the baseline used either the grammatical annotations provided by the organizers (Farkas et al., 2007; Nicolae et al., 2007), or a robust and deep (not freely available) parser (Brun et al., 2007).",
        "These systems represented instances in a manner similar to (Nissim and Markert, 2005).",
        "They used additional manually built resources - WordNet, FrameNet, Levin s verb classes, manually built lists of \"trigger\" words - to generalize the existing features.",
        "Brun et al.",
        "(2007) also used the British National Corpus (BNC) for computing the distance between words based on their syntactic distribution.",
        "While lexical resources and corpora are used to estimate word similarity, all these systems rely exclusively on the data provided by the organizers - instance representation captures only information that can be derived from or between the data points provided.",
        "The approach presented here goes beyond the given data, and induces from corpora measures that allow the system to determine what are the preferences of the words surrounding a PMW towards each of PMW's possible readings.",
        "The technique employed is adapted from unsupervised word sense disambiguation (WSD).",
        "In short, we use the local grammatical context as it is commonly used in WSD approaches, to guide the system in choosing the reading that fits best.",
        "The benefits of using grammatical information for automatic WSD were first explored by Yarowsky (1995) and Resnik (1996) in unsupervised approaches to disambiguating single words in context.",
        "The method described here uses automatically induced selectional preferences, computed from sense-untagged data, similar to Nas-tase (2008).",
        "We work with the data from the metonymy resolution task at SemEval 2007 (Markert and Nissim, 2007), generated based on a scheme developed by Markert and Nissim (2003).",
        "The metonymy resolution task at SemEval 2007 consisted of two subtasks - one for resolving country names, the other for companies.",
        "For each subtask there is a training and a test portion.",
        "Figure 1 shows the text fragment for one sample, and Table 1 the data statistics.",
        "The reading column shows the possible interpretations of a PMW for countries and companies respectively.",
        "For example, org-f or-product would be the interpretation of the PMW Kawasaki in the example shown in the introduction.",
        "Occurrences of country and company names were annotated with a small number of possible readings, as shown in Table 1.",
        "This reflects previous analyses of the metonymy phenomenon, which showed that there is a rather small number of possible interpretations that appear more frequently (Markert and Nissim, 2002).",
        "Special interpretations are very rarely encountered.",
        "Within the framework of the SemEval task, metonymy resolution is evaluated on the given test data, on three levels of granularity: coarse - distinguish between literal and non-literal readings; medium - distinguish between literal, mixed and non-literal readings; fine - identify the specific reading of the target word/words (potentially métonymie word -PMW)."
