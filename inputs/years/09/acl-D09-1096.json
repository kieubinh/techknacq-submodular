        "Today, the explosion of different email formats and styles, coupled with the ad hoc ways in which people vary the structure and layout of their messages, means that simple techniques for identifying quoted replies that used to yield 95% accuracy now find less than 10% of such content.",

        "Email message bodies consist of different functional parts such as email signatures, quoted reply content and advertising content.",
        "We refer to these as email zones.",
        "Many language processing tools stand to benefit from better knowledge of this message structure, facilitating focus on relevant content in specific parts of a message.",
        "In particular, access to zone information would allow email classification, summarisation and analysis tools to separate or filter out 'noise' and focus on the content in specific zones of a message that are relevant to the application at hand.",
        "Email contact mining tools such as that developed by Culotta et al.",
        "(2004), for example, might access the email signature zone, while tools that attempt to identify tasks or action items in email (e.g., (Bellotti et al., 2003; Corston-Oliver et al., 2004; Bennett and Carbonell, 2007; Lampert et al., 2007)) might restrict themselves to the sender-authored and forwarded content.",
        "Despite previous work on this problem, there are no available tools that can reliably extract or identify the different functional zones of an email message.",
        "While there is no agreed standard set of email zones, there are clearly different functional parts within the body text of email messages.",
        "For example, the content of an email disclaimer is functionally different from the sender-authored content and from the quoted reply content automatically included from previous messages in the thread of conversation.",
        "Of course, there are different distinctions that can be drawn between zones; in this paper we explore several different categorisations based on our proposed set of nine underlying email zones.",
        "Although we focus on content in the body of email messages, we recognise the presence of useful information in the semi-structured headers, and indeed make use of header information such as sender and recipient names in segmenting the unstructured body text.",
        "Segmenting email messages into zones is a challenging task.",
        "Accurate segmentation is hampered by the lack of standard syntax used by different email clients to indicate different message parts, and by the ad hoc ways in which people vary the structure and layout of their messages.",
        "When replying to a message, for example, it is often useful to include all or part of the original message that is being replied to.",
        "Different email clients indicate quoted material in different ways.",
        "By default, some prefix every line of the quoted message with a character such as ' >' or ' | ', while others indent the quoted content or insert the quoted message unmodified, prefixed by a message header.",
        "Sometimes the new content is above the quoted content (a style known as 'top-posting'); in other cases, the new content may appear after the quoted",

        "content (bottom-posting) or interleaved with the quoted content (inline replying).",
        "Confounding the issue further is that users are able to configure their email client to suit their individual tastes, and can change both the syntax of quoting and their quoting style (top, bottom or inline replying) on a permessage basis.",
        "To address these challenges, in this paper we describe Zebra, our email zone classification system.",
        "First we describe how Zebra builds and improves on previous work in Section 2.",
        "Section 3 then presents our set of email zones, along with details of the email data we use for system training and experiments.",
        "In Section 4 we describe two approaches to zone classification, one that is line-based and one that is fragment-based.",
        "The performance of Zebra across two, three and nine email zone classification tasks is presented and analysed in Section 5."

        "Segmenting email messages into zones requires both text segmentation and text classification.",
        "The main focus of most work on text segmentation is topic-based segmentation of news text (e.g., (Hearst, 1997; Beeferman et al., 1997)), but there have been some previous attempts at identifying functional zones in email messages.",
        "Chen et al.",
        "(1999) looked at both linguistic and two-dimensional layout cues for extracting structured content from email signature zones in email messages.",
        "The focus of their work was on extracting information from already identified signature blocks using a combination of two-dimensional structural analysis and one-dimensional grammatical constraints; the intended application domain was as a component in a system for email text-to-speech rendering.",
        "The authors claim that their system can be modified to also identify signature blocks within email messages, but their system performs this task with a recall of only 53%.",
        "No attempt is made to identify functional zones other than email signatures.",
        "Carvalho and Cohen's (2004) Jangada system attempted to identify email signatures within plain text email messages and to extract email signatures and reply lines.",
        "Unfortunately, the 20 Newsgroups corpus they worked with contains 15-year-old Usenet messages which are much more homogeneous in their syntax than contemporary email, particularly in terms of how quoted text from previous messages is indicated.",
        "As a result, using a very simple metric (a line-initial '>' character) to identify reply lines achieves more than 95% accuracy.",
        "In contrast, this same simple metric applied to the Enron email data we annotated detects less than 10% of actual reply or forward lines.",
        "Usenet messages are also markedly different from contemporary email when it comes to email signatures.",
        "Most Usenet clients produced messages which conformed to RFC3676 (Gellens, 2004), a standard that formalised a \"long-standing convention in Usenet news .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "of using two hyphens -- as the separator line between the body and the signature of a message.\"",
        "Unfortunately, this convention has long since ceased to be observed in email messages.",
        "Carvalho and Cohen's email signature detection approach also benefits greatly from a simplifying assumption that signatures are found in the last 10 lines ofan email message.",
        "While this holds true for their Usenet message data, it is no longer the case for contemporary email.",
        "In attempting to use Carvalho and Cohen's system to identify signature blocks and reply lines in our own work, we identified similar shortcomings to those noted by Estival et al.",
        "(2007).",
        "In particular, Jangada did not accurately identify forwarded or reply content in email data from the Enron email corpus.",
        "We believe that the use of older Usenet-style messages to train Jangada is a significant factor in the systematic errors the system makes in failing to identify quoted reply, forwarded and signature content in messages formatted in the range ofmessage formats and styles popularised by Microsoft Outlook.",
        "These errors are a fundamental problem with Jangada, especially since Outlook is the most common client used to compose messages in our annotated email collection drawn from the Enron corpus.",
        "More generally, we note that Outlook is the most popular email client in current use, with an estimated 350400 million users worldwide, representing anywhere up to 40% of all email users.",
        "More recently, as part of their work on profiling authors of email messages, Estival et al.",
        "(2007) classified email bodies into five email zones.",
        "Their paper does not provide results for five-zone classification, but they report accuracy of 88.16% using a CRF classifier to distinguish three zones: reply, author and signature.",

        "We consider that each line of text in the body of an email message belongs to one of nine more fine-grained email zones.",

        "This is the zone partition we use to generate the three-zone results reported in Section 5.",
        "This categorisation is useful for problems such as finding action items in email messages: such detection tools would look in text from the sender-authored message zones for new action item information, and could also look in quoted conversation content to link new action item information (such as reported completions) to previous action item content.",

        "We use a variety of graphic, orthographic and lexical features for classification in Zebra.",
        "The same features are applied in both the line-based and the fragment-based zone classification (to either individual lines or zone fragments).",
        "In the description of our features, we refer to both single lines and zone fragments (collections of contiguous lines) as text fragments.",

        "This information is a crucial source of information for identifying zones.",
        "Such information includes how the text is organised and ordered, as well as the 'shape' of the text.",

        "• the number of Unicode code points (i.e., characters) in the text fragment;",

        "First, we extract and normalise the names from the email headers to identify the relevant person's given name and surname.",
        "Our features then capture whether one or both of the given name or surname are present in the current text fragment.",

        "Table 1 shows Zebra's accuracy in classifying email zones.",
        "The results are calculated using 10-fold cross-validation.",
        "Accuracy is shown for three tasks – nine-, three-and two-zone classification – using both line and zone-fragment classification.",
        "Performance is compared against a majority class baseline in each case.",
        "Zebra's performance compares favourably with previously published results.",
        "While it is difficult to",
        "Table 2: Classification accuracy, without word n-gram features, compared against a majority baseline directly compare, since not all systems are freely available and they are not trained or tested over the same data, our three-zone classification (identifying sender, boilerplate and quoted reply content) is very similar to the three-zone task for which (Estival et al., 2007) report 88.16% accuracy for their system and 64.22% accuracy using Carvalho and Cohen's Jangada system.",
        "Zebra outperforms both, achieving 91.53% accuracy using a line-based approach.",
        "In the two-zone task, where we attempt to identify sender-authored lines, Zebra achieves 93.60% accuracy and an F-measure of 0.918, exceeding the 0.907 F-measure reported for Estival et al.",
        "'s system tuned for exactly this task.",
        "Interestingly, the line-based approach provides slightly better performance than the fragment-based approach for each of the two-zone, three-zone and nine-zone classification tasks.",
        "As noted earlier, our original hypothesis was that zone fragments would contain more information about the sequence and text shape of the original message, and that this would lead to better performance for fragment-based classification.",
        "When we restrict our feature set to those that look only at the text of the line or zone fragment, the fragment-based approach does perform better than the line-based one.",
        "Using only word unigram features, for example, our fragment classifier achieves 78.7% accuracy.",
        "Using the same features, the line-based classifier achieves only 57.5% accuracy.",
        "When we add further features that capture sequence and shape information from outside the text fragment being classified (e.g., the length of a text segment compared to the text segment before and after, and whether a segment occurs after another segment containing repeated punctuation or the sender's name), the line-based approach achieves a greater increase in accuracy than the fragment-based approach.",
        "This presumably is because individual lines intrinsically have less information about the message context, and so benefit more from the information added by the new features.",
        "We also experimented with removing all word unigram and bigram features to explore the classifier's portability across different domains.",
        "This removed all vocabulary and word order information from our feature set.",
        "In doing so, our feature set was reduced to less than thirty features, consisting of mostly graphic and orthographic information.",
        "The few remaining lexical features captured only the presence of sender and recipient names, which are independent of any particular email domain.",
        "As expected, performance did drop, but not dramatically.",
        "Table 2 shows that average performance without n-grams (across two-, three-and nine-zone tasks) for line-based classification drops by 4.67%.",
        "In contrast, fragment-based classification accuracy drops by less than half this amount – an average of 2.26%.",
        "This suggests that, as we originally hypothesised, there are additional non-lexical cues in zone fragments that give information about the zone type.",
        "This makes the zone fragment approach potentially more portable for use across email data from different enterprise domains.",
        "Of course, classification accuracy gives only a limited picture of Zebra's performance.",

        "Identifying functional zones in email messages is a challenging task, due in large part to the diversity in syntax used by different email software, and the dynamic manner in which people employ different styles in authoring email messages.",
