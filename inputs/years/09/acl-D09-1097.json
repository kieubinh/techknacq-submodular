        "Using the adjusted parameters, we conducted experiments to extract the hypernym of each target word with the help of the scoring method based on fc similar words.",
        "In these experiments, two kinds of distributional similarity mentioned in Section 4 were exploited individually.",
        "The words that were used in the development data were excluded.",
        "We also conducted a comparative experiment in which the parameter value for the penalty of the hierarchal difference, d, was set to 0 to clarify the ability of using hierarchal structures in the fc similar words method.",
        "This means each fc similar word votes only to their parent.",
        "We then judged the quality of each acquired hypernym.",
        "The evaluation data sets were sampled from the top 1,000, 10,000, 100,000, and 670,000 results that were ranked according to the score of each method.",
        "Then, against 200 samples that were randomly sampled from each set, one of the authors judged whether the hypernym extracted by each method for the target word was correct or not.",
        "In this evaluation, if the sentence \"The target word is a kind of the hypernym\" or \"The target word is an instance of the hypernym\" was consistent, the extracted hyponymy was judged as correct.",
        "It should be noted that the outputs of the compared methods are combined and shuffled to enable fair comparison.",
        "In addition, baseline approach 1 extracted several hypernyms for the target word.",
        "In this case, we judged the hypernym as correct when the case where one of the hypernyms was correct.",
        "The precision of each result is shown in Table 1.",
        "The results of the c similar words method are far better than those of the other baseline methods.",
        "In particular, the c similar words method with CVD outperformed the methods of the c similar words where the parameter value d was set to 0 and the method using RVD except for the top 1,000 results.",
        "This means that the use of hie-rarchal structures and the clustering process for calculating distributional similarity are effective for this task.",
        "We confirmed the significant differences of the proposed method (CVD) as compared with all the baseline approaches at the 1% significant level by the Fisher's exact test (Hays 1988).",
        "The precision of baseline approach 2 that selected the most similar hypernym was the worst among all the methods.",
        "There were words that were similar to the target word among the hyper-nyms extracted incorrectly.",
        "For example, the word semento-fcojo (cement factory) was extracted for the hypernym of the word fcuriningu-cojo (dry cleaning plant).",
        "It is difficult to judge whether the word is a hypernym or just a similar word by using only the similarity measure.",
        "As for the results of baseline approach 1 using the most similar hyponym and baseline approach 3 using the similarity of the set of hypernym's children, the noise on the Wikipedia relation database decreased the precision.",
        "Moreover, over-specified hypernyms were extracted incorrectly by these methods.",
        "In contrast, the method of scoring based on the use of c similar words was robust against noise because it uses the voting approach for the similarities.",
