        "Regarding Precision, simply judging the correctness of terms and their individual classification links may provide high scores, but this doesn't help with the eventual assembly of terms into a single coherent taxonomy.",
        "Furthermore, since there is no correct and complete gold standard to measure against, most work invents some ad hoc evaluation measure.",
        "We present an algorithm that is more precise and complete than previous ones for identifying from web text just those concepts 'below' a given seed term.",
        "Comparing the results to WordNet, we find that the algorithm misses terms, but also that it learns many new terms not in WordNet, and that it classifies them in ways acceptable to humans but different from WordNet."

        "Over the past few years, many algorithms have been published on automatically harvesting terms and their conceptual types from the web and/or other large corpora (Etzioni et al., 2005; Paşca, 2007; Banko et al., 2007; Yi and Niblack, 2005; Snow et al., 2005).",
        "But several basic problems limit the eventual utility of the results.",
        "First, there is no standard collection of facts against which results can be measured.",
        "As we show in this paper, WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), the most obvious contender because of its size and popularity, is deficient in various ways: it is neither complete nor is its taxonomic structure inarguably perfect.",
        "As a result, alternative ad hoc measures are invented that are not comparable.",
        "Second, simply harvesting facts about an entity without regard to its actual subsequent organization inflates Recall and Precision evaluation scores: while it is correct that a jaguar is a animal, mammal, toy, sports-team, car-make, and operating-system, this information doesn't help to create a taxonomy that, for example, places mammal and animal closer to one another than to some of the others.",
        "((Snow et al., 2005) is an exception to this.)",
        "As a result, this work may give a misleading sense of progress.",
        "Third, entities are of different formal types, and their taxonomic treatment is consequently different: some are at the level of instances (e.g., Michelangelo was a painter) and some at the level of concepts (e.g., a painter is a human).",
        "The goal of our research is to learn terms for entities (objects) and their taxonomic organization simultaneously, from text.",
        "Our method is to use a single surface-level pattern with several open positions.",
        "Filling them in different ways harvests different kinds of information, and/or confirms this information.",
        "We evaluate in two ways: against WordNet, since that is a commonly available and popular resource, and also by asking humans to judge the results since WordNet is neither complete nor exhaustively taxonomized.",
        "In this paper, we describe experiments with two rich and common portions of an entity taxonomy: Animals and People.",

        "We would like to also report on Recall relative to WordNet, but given the problems described in Section 4, this turns out to be much harder than would seem.",
        "First, we need to define some basic terminology: term: An English word (for our current purposes, a noun or a proper name).",
        "seed term: A word we use to initiate the algorithm, concept: An item in the classification taxonomy we are building.",
        "A concept may correspond to several terms (singular form, plural form, the term's synonyms, etc.",
        ").",
        "root concept: A concept at a fairly general (high) level in the taxonomy, to which many others are eventually learned to be subtypes/instances of.",
        "basic-level concept: A concept at the 'basic level', corresponding approximately to the Basic Level categories defined in Prototype Theory in Psychology (Rosch, 1978).",
        "For our purposes, a concept corresponding to the (proto)typical level of generality of its type; that is, a dog, not a mammal or a dachshund; a singer, not a human or an opera diva.",
        "instance: An item in the classification taxonomy that is more specific than a concept; only one example of the instance exists in 'the real world' at any time.",

        "2 Term and Relation Extraction using the Doubly-Anchored Pattern",
        "Our goal is to develop a technique that automatically 'fills in' the concept space in the taxonomy below any root concept, by harvesting terms through repeated web queries.",
        "We perform this in two alternating stages.",
        "Stage 1: Basic-level/Instance concept collection: We use the Doubly-Anchored Pattern DAP developed in (Kozareva et al., 2008):",
        "DAP: [SeedTerml] such as [SeedTerm2] and <X> which learns a list of basic-level concepts or instances (depending on whether SeedTerm2 expresses a basic-level concept or an instance).",
        "DAP is very reliable because it is instantiated with examples at both 'ends' of the space to be filled (the higher-level (root) concept SeedTerml and a basic-level term or instance (SeedTerm2)), which mutually disambiguate each other.",
        "For example, \"presidents\" for SeedTerml can refer to the leader of a country, corporation, or university, and \"Ford\" for SeedTerm2 can refer to a car company, an automobile pioneer, or a U.S. president.",
        "But when the two terms co-occur in a text that matches the pattern \"Presidents such as Ford and <X> \", the text will almost certainly refer to country presidents.",
        "The first stage involves a series of repeated replacements of SeedTerm2 by newly-learned terms in order to generate even more seed terms.",
        "That is, each new basic-level concept or instance is rotated into the pattern (becoming a new SeedTerm2) in a bootstrapping cycle that Kozareva et al.",
        "called reckless bootstrapping.",
        "This procedure is implemented as exhaustive breadth-first search, and iterates until no new terms are harvested.",
        "The harvested terms are incorporated in a Hyponym Pattern Linkage Graph (HPLG) G = (V, E), where each vertex v e V is a candidate term and each edge (u, v) e E indicates that term v was generated by term u.",
        "A term u is ranked by Out-Degree(u) = ^M^u'v) swhich represents the weighted sum of -u's outgoing edges normalized by the total number of other nodes in the graph.",
        "Intuitively, a term ranks highly if it is frequently discovering many different terms during the reckless bootstrapping cycle.",
        "This method is very productive, harvesting a constant stream of new terms for basic-level concepts or instances when the taxonomy below the initial root concept SeedTerm 1 is extensive (such as for Animals or People).",
        "'Strictly speaking, our lowest-level concepts can be instances, basic-level concepts, or concepts below the basic level (e.g., dachsund).",
        "But for the sake of simplicity we will refer to our lowest-level terms as basic-level concepts and instances.",
        "Stage 2: Intermediate level concept collection:",
        "Going beyond (Kozareva et al., 2008), we next apply the Doubly-Anchored Pattern in the 'backward' direction (DAP-1), for any two seed terms representing basic-level concepts or instances:",
        "which harvests a set of concepts, most of them intermediate between the basic level or instance and the initial higher-level seed.",
        "This second stage (DAP-1) has not yet been described in the literature.",
        "It proceeds analogously.",
        "For pairs of basic-level concepts or instances below the root concept that were found during the first stage, we instantiate DAP-1 and issue a new web query.",
        "For example, if the term \"cats\" was harvested by DAP in \"Animals such as dogs and <X> \", then the pair < dogs, cats > forms the new Web query \"<X> such as dogs and cats\".",
        "We extract up to 2 consecutive nouns from the <X> position.",
        "This procedure yields a large number of discovered concepts, but they cannot all be used for further bootstrapping.",
        "In addition to practical limitations (such as limits on web querying), many of them are too general-more general than the initial root concept-and could derail the bootstrapping process by introducing terms that stray every further away from the initial root concept.",
        "We therefore rank the harvested terms based on the likelihood that they will be productive if they are expanded in the next cycle.",
        "Ranking is based on two criteria: (1) the concept should be prolific (i.e., produce many lower-level concepts) in order to keep the bootstrapping process energized, and (2) the concept should be subordinate to the root concept, so that the process stays within the targeted part of the search space.",
        "To perform ranking, we incorporate both the harvested concepts and the basic-level/instance pairs into a Hypernym Relation Graph (HRG), which we define as a bipartite graph HRG = (V, E) with two types of vertices.",
        "One set of vertices represents the concepts (the category vertices (Vc), and a second set of vertices represents the basic-level/instance pairs that produced the concepts (the member pair vertices (Vmp)).",
        "We create an edge e(u, v) G E between u G Vc and v G Vmp when the concept represented by u was harvested by the basic-level/instance pair represented by v, with the weight of the edge defined as the number of times that the lower pair found the concept on the web.",
        "We use the Hypernym Relation Graph to rank the intermediate concepts based on each node's In-Degree, which is the sum of the weights on the node's incoming edges.",
        "Formally, In-Degree(u) = J2v(uv)€Ew(uiv)- Intuitively, a concept will be ranked highly if it was harvested by many different combinations of basic-level/instance terms.",
        "However, this scoring function does not determine whether a concept is more or less general than the initial root concept.",
        "For example, when harvesting animal categories, the system may learn the word \"species \", which is a very common term associated with animals, but also applies to non-animals such as plants.",
        "To prevent the inclusion of over-general terms and constrain the search to remain 'below' the root concept, we apply a Concept Positioning Test (CPT): We issue the following two web queries:",
        "(a) Concept such as RootConcept and <X> (b) RootConcept such as Concept and <X>",
        "If (b) returns more web hits than (a), then the concept passes the test, otherwise it fails.",
        "The first (most highly ranked) concept that passes CPT becomes the new seed concept for the next bootstrapping cycle.",
        "In principle, we could use all the concepts that pass the CPT for bootstrapping.",
        "However, for practical reasons (primarily limitations on web querying), we run the algorithm for 10 iterations."

        "We describe a novel extension to the DAP approach for discovering basic-level concepts or instances and their superconcepts given an initial root concept.",
        "By appropriate filling of different positions in DAP, the algorithm alternates between 'downward' and 'upward' learning.",
        "A key resulting benefit is that each new intermediate-level term acquired restarts harvesting in a new region of the concept space, which allows previously unseen concepts to be discovered with each bootstrapping cycle.",
        "We also introduce the Concept Positioning Test, which serves to confirm that a harvested concept falls into the desired part of the search space relative to either a superordinate or subordinate concept in the growing taxonomy, before it is selected for further harvesting using the DAP.",
        "These algorithms can augment other term harvesting algorithms recently reported.",
        "But in order to compare different algorithms, it is important to compare results to a standard.",
        "WordNet is our best candidate at present.",
        "But WordNet is incomplete.",
        "Our results include a significantly large number of instances of People (which WordNet does not claim to cover), a number comparable to the results of (Etzioni et al., 2005; Paşca, 2007; Ritter et al., 2009).",
        "Rather surprisingly, our results also include a large number of basic-level and intermediate concepts for Animals that are not present in WordNet, a category WordNet is actually fairly complete about.",
        "These numbers show clearly that it is important to conduct manual evaluation of term harvesting algorithms in addition to comparing to a standard resource."
