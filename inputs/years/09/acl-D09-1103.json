        "Coreference accounts for cohesion in a text and is, in a sense, the hyperlink for a natural language.",

        "Coreference resolution is the process of linking together multiple referring expressions of a given entity in the world.",
        "The key in coreference resolution is to determine the antecedent for each referring expression in a text.",
        "The ability of linking referring expressions both within a sentence and across the sentences in a text is critical to discourse and language understanding in general.",
        "For example, coreference resolution is a key task in information extraction, machine translation, text summarization, and question answering.",
        "There is a long tradition of research on coreference resolution within computational linguistics.",
        "While earlier knowledge-lean approaches heavily depend on domain and linguistic knowledge (Carter 1987; Carbonell and Brown 1988) and have significantly influenced the research, the later approaches usually rely on diverse lexical, syntactic and semantic properties of referring expressions (Soon et al., 2001;Ng and Cardie, 2002; Zhou et al., 2004).",
        "Current research has been focusing on exploiting semantic information in coreference resolution.",
        "For example, Yang et al. (2005) proposed a template-based statistical approach to compute the semantic compatibility between a pronominal anaphor and an antecedent candidate, and Yang and Su (2007) explored semantic relatedness information from automatically discovered patterns, while Ng (2007) automatically induced semantic class knowledge from a treebank and explored its application in coreference resolution.",
        "Particularly, this paper focuses on the centering theory (Sidner,1981;Grosz et al.,1995; Tetreault,2001), which reveals the significant impact of the local focus on referring expressions in that the antecedent of a referring expression usually depends on the center of attention throughout the local discourse segment (Mit-kov,1998).",
        "Although the centering theory has been considered as a critical theory and the driving force behind the coreferential phenomena since its proposal, its application in coreference resolution (in particular pronoun resolution) has been somewhat disappointing: it fails to improve or even harms the performance of the state-of-",

        "This section briefly overviews the related work in coreference resolution from both the centering theory and semantic perspectives.",
        "In the literature, there has been much research in the centering theory and its application to coreference resolution.",
        "In the centering theory itself, since the original work of Sidner (1979) on immediate focusing of pronouns and the subsequent work of Joshi and Weinstein (1981) on centering and inferences, much research has been done, including centering and linguistic realizations (Cote 1993; Prince and Walker 1995), empirical and psycholinguistic evaluation of centering predictions (Gordon et al. 1993,1995; Brennan 1995; Walker et al. 1998; Kibble 2001), and the cross-linguistic work on centering (Ziv and",
        "Crosz1994).",
        "In applications of the centering theory to coreference resolution, representative work includes Brennan et al.",
        "(1987), Strube (1998), Tetreault (1999) and Yang et al.",
        "(2004).",
        "Brennan et al.",
        "(1987) presented a centering theory-based formalism in modeling the local focus structure in discourse and used it to track the discourse context in binding occurring pronouns to corresponding entities.",
        "In particular, a BFP (Brennan, Friedman and Pollard) algorithm is proposed to extend the original centering model to include two additional transitions called smooth shift and rough shift.",
        "Strube (1998) proposed an S-list model, assuming that a referring expression prefers a hearer-old discourse entity to other hearer-new candidates.",
        "Tetreault (1999) further advanced the BFP algorithm by adopting a left-to-right breadth first walk of the syntactic parse trees to rank the antecedent candidates.",
        "However, the above methods have not been systematically evaluated on large annotated corpora, such as MUC and ACE.",
        "Thus their effects are still unclear in real coreference resolution tasks.",
        "Yang et al. (2004) presented a learning-based approach by incorporating several S-list model-based features to improve the performance in pronoun resolution.",
        "It shows that, although including S-list model-based features can slightly boost the performance in the ideal case (i.e. given the correct antecedents of anaphor's candidates), it deteriorates the overall performance in F-measure with slightly higher precision but much lower recall, in real cases, where the antecedents of anaphor's candidates are determined automatically by a separate coreference resolution module.",
        "It is well known that semantic information plays a critical role in coreference resolution.",
        "Besides the common practice of employing a thesaurus (e.g. WordNet) in semantic consistency checking, much research has been done to explore various kinds of semantic information, such as semantic similarity (Harabagiu et al. 2000), semantic compatibility (Yang et al. 2005, 2007), and semantic class information (Soon et al. 2001; Ng 2007).",
        "Although these methods have been proven useful in coreference resolution, their contributions are much limited.",
        "For example, Ng (2007) showed that semantic similarity information and semantic agreement information could only improve the performance of coreference resolution by 0.6 and 0.5 in F-measure respectively, on the ACE 2003 NWIRE corpus."

        "The centering theory is a theory about the local discourse structure that models the interaction of referential continuity and the salience of discourse entities in the internal organization of a text.",
        "In natural languages, a given entity may be referred by different expressions and act as different grammatical roles throughout a text.",
        "For example, people often use pronouns to refer to the main subject of the discourse in focus, which can change over different portions of the discourse.",
        "One main goal of the centering theory is to track the focus entities throughout a text.",
        "The main claims of the centering theory can be formalized in terms of Cb (the backward-looking center), Cf (a list of forward-looking centers for each utterance Un) and Cp (the preferred center, i.e. the most salient candidate for subsequent utterances).",

        "R2.Transitions have the descending preference order of \"Continue > Retain > Smooth Shift > Rough",
        "Furthermore, several kinds of focus transitions are defined in terms of two tests: whether Cb stays the same (i.e. Cb(Un+1)=Cb(Un)), and whether Cb is realized as the most prominent referring expression (i.e. Cb(Un=Cp(Un)).",
        "We refer to the first test as cohesion, and the second test as salience.",
        "Therefore, there are four possible combinations, which are displayed in Table 1 and can result in four kinds of transitions, namely Continue, Retain, Smooth Shift, and Rough Shift.",
        "Obviously, salience, which chooses a proper verb form to make Cb prominent within a clause or sentence, is an important matter for sentence planning, while cohesion, which orders propositions in a text to maintain referential continuity, is an important matter for text planning.",
        "Finally, the centering theory imposes several constraints and rules over Cb/Cf and above transitions, as shown in Table 2.",
        "Given the centering theory as described above, we can draw the following conclusions:",
        "1) The centering theory is discourse-related and centers are discourse constructs.",
        "2) The backward-looking center Cb of Un depends only on the expressions that constitute the utterance.",
        "That is, it is independent of its surface position and grammatical roles.",
        "Moreover, it is not constrained by any previous utterance in the segment.",
        "While the elements of Cf(Un) are partially ordered to reflect relative prominence in Un, grammatical role information is often a major determinant in ranking Cf, e.g. in the descending priority order of \"Subject > Object > Others\" in English (Grosz and Joshi, 2001).",

        "1993) and cross-linguistic research (Kameyama",

        "4) Frequent rough shifts would lead to a lack of local cohesion.",
        "To keep local cohesion, people tend to plan ahead and minimize the number of focus shifts.",

        "ARG0/agent and ARG1/patient account for 85% of all arguments and most likely act as the centers of the local focus structure in discourse due to the close relationship between subject/object and agent/patient.",
        "Therefore, it is appropriate to model the centers of an utterance from the semantic perspective via semantic roles.",
        "2) In a sense, semantic roles imply the information of grammatical roles, especially for subject/object.",
        "For example, the position of an argument and the voice of the predicate verb play a central role in SRL.",
        "In intuition, an argument, which occurs before an active verb and has the semantic role of Arg0/agent, tends to be a subject.",

        "Therefore, it would be interesting to represent the centers of the utterances and employ the centering theory from the semantic perspective.",
        "3) Semantic role labeling has been well studied in the literature and there are good ready-to-use toolkits available.",

        "This is realized in this paper according to its semantic roles (with regard to various predicates in a sentence) and surface position (in a left-to-right order) by mapping each pronoun into 5 levels: a) rank 1 for pronouns with semantic role ARG0/agent of the main predicate; b) rank 2 for pronouns with semantic role ARG1/patient of the main predicate; c) rank 3 for pronouns with semantic role ARG0/agent of other predicates; d) rank 4 for pronouns with semantic role ARG1/patient of other predicates; e) rank 5 for remaining pronouns.",
        "Furthermore, for those pronouns with the same ranking level, they are ordered according to their surface positions in a left-to-right order, motivated by previous research on the centering theory (Grosz et al.",
        "1995).",
        "3) Detailed pronominal subcategory features.",
        "Given a pronominal expression, its detailed pronominal subcategory features, such as whether it is a first person pronoun, second person pronoun, third person pronoun, neuter pronoun or others, are explored to enhance the discriminative power of both the semantic role features and the relative pronominal ranking feature, considering the predominant importance of pronouns in tracking the local focus structure in discourse.",
        "As a representative in explicitly employing semantic role labeling in coreference resolution, Ponzetto and Strube (2006) explored two semantic role features to capture the predicate-argument structure information to benefit coreference resolution: ISEMROLE, the predicate-argument pairs of one referring expression, and JSEMROLE, the predicate-argument pairs of another referring expression.",
        "Their experiments on the ACE 2003 corpus shows that, while the two semantic role features much improve the performance of common noun resolution by 3.8 and 2.7 in F-measure on the BNEWS and NWIRE domains respectively, they only slightly improve the performance of pronoun resolution by 0.4 and 0.3 in F-measure on the BNEWS and NWIRE domains respectively.",
        "In comparison, this paper proposes various kinds of centering-motivated semantic role features in attempt to better model the continuity or shift in the local discourse focus by extending the centering theory from the grammatical level to the semantic level.",
        "For example, the CAARG0MainVerb feature (as shown in Table 5) is designed to capture the semantic role of the antecedent candidate in the main predicate in modeling the discourse center, while, the AN-PronounRanking feature (as shown in Table 5) is designed to determinate the relative priority of the pronominal anaphor in retaining the discourse center.",
        "Although both this paper and Ponzetto and Strube (2006) employs semantic role features, their ways of deriving such features are much different due to different driving forces/motivations behind.",
        "As a result, their contributions on coreference resolution are different: while the semantic role features in Ponzette and Strube (2006) captures the predicate-argument structure information and contributes much to common noun resolution and their contribution on pronoun resolution can be ignored, the centering-motivated semantic role features in this paper contribute much in pronoun resolution.",
