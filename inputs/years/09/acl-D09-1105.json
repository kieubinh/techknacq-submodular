        "We have presented an entirely new model of reordering for statistical machine translation, based on the Linear Ordering Problem, and shown that it can substantially improve translation from German to English.",
        "The model is demonstrably useful in this preprocessing setting – which means that it can be very simply added as a preprocessing step to any MT system.",
        "German-to-English is a particularly attractive use case, because the word orders are sufficiently different as to require a good reordering model that requires long-distance reordering.",
        "Our preprocessing here gave us a BLEU gain of 0.9 point over the best Moses-based result.",
        "English-to-German would obviously be another potential win, as would translating between English and lapanese, for example.",
        "As mentioned in Section 6, our model could also be integrated into a phrase-based, or a syntax-based decoder.",
        "That possibility remains future work, but it is likely to lead to further improvements, because it allows the translation system to consider multiple possible reorderings under the model, as well as to tune the weight of the model relative to the other parts of the system during MERT.",
        "Tromble (2009) covers this integration in more detail, and proposes several other ways of integrating our reordering model into machine translation.",
        "It also experiments with numerous other parameter estimation procedures, including some that use the probabilistic interpretation of our model from (3).",
        "It presents numerous additional neighborhoods for search in the Linear Ordering Problem.",
        "We mentioned several possible extensions to the model, such as going beyond the scoring model of equation (2), or considering syntax-based features.",
        "Another extension would try to reorder not words but phrases, following (Xiong et al., 2006), or segment choice models (Kuhn et al., 2006), which assume a single segmentation of the words into phrases.",
        "We would have to define the pairwise preference matrix B over phrases rather than words (Eisner and Tromble, 2006).",
        "This would have the disadvantage of complicating the feature space, but might be a better fit for integration with a phrase-based decoder.",
        "Finally, we gave a novel algorithm for approximately solving the Linear Ordering Problem, interestingly combining dynamic programming with local search.",
        "Another novel contribution is that we showed how to parameterize a function that constructs a specific Linear Ordering Problem instance from an input sentence w, and showed how to learn those parameters from a corpus of parallel sentences, using the perceptron algorithm.",
        "Likelihood-based training using equation (3) would also be possible, with modifications to our algorithm, notably the use of normal forms to avoid counting some permutations multiple times (Tromble, 2009).",
        "It would be interesting to compare the speed and accuracy of our dynamic-programming local-search method with an exact algorithm for solving the LOP, such as integer linear programming with branch and bound (cf. Charon and Hudry (2006)).",
        "Exact solutions can generally be found in practice for n < 100."
