        "Statistical machine translation (SMT) relies heavily on annotated bilingual corpora.",
        "Word alignment, which indicates the correspondence between the words in a parallel text, is one of the most important annotations in SMT.",
        "Word-aligned corpora have been found to be an excellent source for translation-related knowledge, not only for phrase-based models (Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn et al., 2003), but also for syntax-based models (e.g., (Chiang, 2007; Galley et al., 2006; Shen et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2006)).",
        "Och and Ney (2003) indicate that the quality of machine translation output depends directly on the quality of initial word alignment.",
        "Modern alignment methods can be divided into two major categories: generative methods and discriminative methods.",
        "Generative methods (Brown et al., 1993; Vogel and Ney, 1996) treat word alignment as a hidden process and maximize the likelihood of bilingual training corpus using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm.",
        "In contrast, discriminative methods (e.g., (Moore et al., 2006; Taskar et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2005; Blunsom and Cohn, 2006)) have the freedom to define arbitrary feature functions that describe various characteristics of an alignment.",
        "They usually optimize feature weights on manually-aligned data.",
        "While discriminative methods show superior alignment accuracy in benchmarks, generative methods are still widely used to produce word alignments for large sentence-aligned corpora.",
        "However, neither generative nor discriminative alignment methods are reliable enough to yield high quality alignments for SMT, especially for distantly-related language pairs such as Chinese-English and Arabic-English.",
        "The F-measures for Chinese-English and Arabic-English are usually around 80% (Liu et al., 2005) and 70% (Fraser and Marcu, 2007), respectively.",
        "As most current SMT systems only use 1-best alignments for extracting rules, alignment errors might impair translation quality.",
        "Recently, several studies have shown that offering more alternatives of annotations to SMT systems will result in significant improvements, such as replacing 1-best trees with packed forests (Mi et al., 2008) and replacing 1-best word segmentations with word lattices (Dyer et al., 2008).",
        "Similarly, Venugopal et al.",
        "(2008) use n-best alignments instead of 1-best alignments for translation rule extraction.",
        "While they achieve significant improvements on the IWSLT data, extracting rules from n-best alignments might be computationally expensive.",
        "In this paper, we propose a new structure named weighted alignment matrix to represent the alignment distribution for a sentence pair compactly.",
        "In a weighted matrix, each element that corresponds to a word pair is assigned a probability to measure the confidence of aligning the two words.",
        "Therefore, a weighted matrix is capable of using a linear space to encode the probabilities of exponentially many alignments.",
        "Figure 1 : An example of word alignment between a pair of Chinese and English sentences.",
        "We develop a new algorithm for extracting phrase pairs from weighted matrices and show how to estimate their relative frequencies and lexical weights.",
        "Experimental results show that using weighted matrices achieves consistent improvements in translation quality and significant reduction in extraction time over using n-best lists."

        "Besides relative frequencies, lexical weights (Koehn et al., 2003) are widely used to estimate how well the words in / translate the words in ë.",
