        "It translates a source sentence to its target one in two steps by using structured translation rules.",
        "In the first step, which is called translation rule matching step, all the applicabletranslation rules are extracted from the entire rule set by matching the source parse tree/forest.",
        "The second step is to decode the source sentence into its target one using the extracted translation rules.",
        "Both of the two steps are very time-consuming due to the exponential number of translation rules and the complex nature of machine translation as an NP-hard search problem (Knight, 1999).",
        "In the SMT research community, the second step has been well studied and many methods have been proposed to speed up the decoding process, such as node-based or span-based beam search with different pruning strategies (Liu et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2008a, 2008b) and cube pruning (Huang and Chiang, 2007; Mi et al., 2008).",

        "Our solution includes two steps.",

        "Please note that the first step can be easily done off-line very fast.",

        "In the second step, we design a recursive algorithm to traverse the hyper-tree structure and the input source forest in a top-down manner to do the rule matching between them.",
        "As we will show later, the hyper-tree structure and the recursive algorithm significantly improve the speed of the rule matching and the entire translation process compared with previous methods.",
