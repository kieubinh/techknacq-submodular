        "The temporal patterns of word occurrences in human communication carry an implicit measure of their relationship to real-world events and behavioral patterns.",
        "For example, when there is an event affecting a given entity (such as a natural disaster in a country), the entity name will turn up more frequently in human conversation, newswire articles and web documents; and people will search for it more often.",
        "Two entities that are closely related in the real world, such as the name of a country and a prominent region inside the country are likely to share common events and therefore be closely associated in human communication.",
        "Finally, two instances of the same class are also likely to share common usage patterns.",
        "For example, names of airlines or retail stores are more likely to be used by day rather than by night (Chien, 2005).",
        "In this paper we explore the linguistic relationship between phrases that are judged to be similar based on their frequency time series correlation in search query logs.",
        "For every phrase available in WordNet 3.0 (Miller, 1995), we have obtained its temporal signature from query logs, and calculated all their pairwise correlations.",
        "Next, we study the relationship in the top-ranked pairs with respect to their distribution in WordNet and a human-annotated labelling.",
        "We also discuss possible applications of this data to solve open problems and present the results of two experiments: one where time series correlations turned out to be highly discriminative; and another where they were not particularly informative but shed some light on the nature of temporal semantics and topical categorization:",
        "• Query suggestion, i.e. given a query, generate a ranked list of alternative queries in which the user may be interested.",
        "• Query categorization, i.e. given a predefined set of categories, find the top categories to which the query can be assigned.",
        "Finally, we illustrate with an example another application of time series in solving information extraction problems.",
        "Although query logs are typically proprietary data, there are ongoing initiatives, like the Lemur toolbar, which make this kind of information available for research purposes.",
        "Other work (Bansal and Koudas, 2007b; Bansal and Koudas, 2007a) shows that temporal information can also be extracted from public data, such as blogs.",
        "More traditional types of text, such as news, are also typically associated with temporal labels; e.g., dates and timestamps.",
        "This paper is structured in the following way:",
        "!We use the term phrase to refer to any single word or multi-word expression that belongs to a synset in WordNet.",
        "Examples of phrases are person, causal entity or william Shakespeare.",

        "The study of query time series explores a particular instance of the so-called wisdom of the crowds effect.",
        "Within this area, we can distinguish two kinds of phenomena.",
        "Knowledge and resources assembled by people explicitly, either individually, such as the case of blogs, or in a collaborative way, as in forums or wikis.",
        "These resources are valuable for human-consumption and can also be exploited in order to learn computational resources (Medelyan et al., 2008; Weld et al., 2008; Zesch et al., 2008b; Zesch et al., 2008a).",
        "On the other hand, it is possible to acquire useful resources and knowledge from aggregating behavioral patterns of large groups of people, even in the absence of a conscious effort.",
        "There is extensive ongoing research on the use of web search usage patterns to develop knowledge resources.",
        "Some examples are clustering co-click patterns to learn semantically related queries (Beeferman and Berger, 2000), combining co-click patterns with hitting times (Mei et al., 2008), analyzing query revisions made by users when querying search engines (Jones et al., 2006), replacing query words with other words that have the highest pointwise mutual information (Terra and Clarke, 2004), or using the temporal distribution of words in documents to improve ranking of search results (Jones and Diaz, 2007).",
        "Within this second category, an important area is dedicated to the study of time-related features of search queries.",
        "News aggregators use real-time frequencies of user queries to detect spikes and identify news shortly after the spikes occur (Mu-rata, 2008).",
        "Web users' query patterns have also proved useful for building a real-time surveillance system that accurately estimates region-by-region influenza activity with a lag of one day (Ginsberg et al., 2009).",
        "Search engines specifically developed for real-time searches, like Twitter search, will most likely provide new use cases and scenarios for quickly detecting trends in user search query patterns.",
        "Our study builds upon the work of Chien (2005), who observed that queries with highly-correlated temporal usage patterns are typically semantically related, and described a procedure for calculating the correlations efficiently.",
        "We have extended the analysis described in this work, by performing a more extensive evaluation of the kinds of semantic relationships that we can find among temporally-similar queries.",
        "We also propose, to our knowledge for the first time, areas of applications in solving well-established problems which shed some light on the nature of time-based semantic similarity.",
        "This work is also related to the analysis of temporal properties of information streams in data mining (Kleinberg, 2006) and information retrieval from time series databases (Agrawal et al., 1993)."

      "text": [
        "Similarly to the method described in Chien (2005), we take a time interval, divide it into equally spaced subintervals, and represent each phrase of interest as the sequence of frequencies with which the phrase was observed in the subintervals.",
        "In our experiments, we have used as source data the set of fully anonymized query logs from the Google search engine between January 1st, 2004 and March 1st, 2009..",
        "These data have been aggregated on a daily basis so that we have the daily frequency of the queries of interest for over five years.",
        "The frequencies are then normalized with the total number of queries that happened on that day.",
        "The normalization is necessary to avoid daily and seasonal variations as there are typically more queries on weekdays than on weekends and fewer queries during holiday seasons than in the rest of the year.",
        "It also helps reducing the effect deriving from the fact that the population with Internet access is still monotonically growing, so we can expect that the number of queries will become higher and higher over time.",
        "Given two phrases and their associated time series, the similarity metric used is the correlation coefficient between the two series (Chien, 2005).",
        "For illustration, Figure 1 shows the time series obtained for two sample queries, gazpacho and summertime, whose time series yield a correlation of 0.92.",
        "Similar high correlations can be observed with other queries related to phenomena that occur mainly in summer in the countries from which most queries come, like summer rash.",
        "In this section, we describe a study carried out with the purpose of discovering the traditional lexico-semantic relationships which hold between the queries that are most strongly related according to their temporal profiles.",
        "For this evaluation, we have taken the nominal phrases appearing in WordNet 3.0.",
        "Given that users, when writing queries, typically do not pay attention to punctuation and case, we have normalized all phrases by lowercasing them and removing all punctuation.",
        "Next, we collected the time series for each phrase by computing the normalized daily frequency of each of them as exact queries in the query logs.",
        "The computation of the pairwise correlations was performed in parallel using the MapReduce infrastructure running over 2048 cores with 500 MB of RAM each.",
        "The total execution (including data shuffling and networking time) took approximately three hours.",
        "Next, we represented the data as a complete graph where phrases are nodes and the edge between each pair of nodes is weighted by their time series correlation.",
        "Using a simple graph-cut we obtained clusters of related terms.",
        "A minimum weight threshold equal to 0.9 was applied; thus, two phrases belong to the same cluster if there is a path between them only via edges with weight over 0.9.",
        "The previous procedure produced a set of 604 clusters, with highly different sizes.",
        "The first observation is that 70% of the phrases in WordNet do not have a correlation over 0.9 with any other phrase, so they are placed alone in singleton clusters.",
        "There are several reasons for this.",
        "The clusters obtained are very specific: only phrases that have a very strong temporal association have temporal correlations exceeding the threshold.",
        "This is combined with the fact that we are using a very restricted vocabulary, namely the terms included in WordNet, which is many orders of magnitude smaller than the vocabulary of all possible queries from the users.",
        "Few phrase pairs in WordNet have a temporal association and popularity strong enough to be clustered together.",
        "Finally, many of the phrases in WordNet are rare, including scientific names of animals and plants, genuses or families, which are not commonly used.",
        "Therefore, the clusters extracted here correspond to very salient sets of phrases.",
        "If, instead of WordNet, we choose a vocabulary from known user queries (cf.",
        "Section 4), there would be many fewer singleton clusters, as the options of similar phrases to choose from would be much larger.",
        "From the phrases that belong to clusters, 25% of the WordNet phrases do not have strong daily temporal profiles.",
        "The typical pattern for these terms is an almost flat time series, usually with small drops at summertime and Christmas (when seasonal leisure-related queries dominate).",
        "Therefore, these phrases were collected in just one cluster containing them all.",
        "Typical examples of the elements of this set are names of famous scientists and mathematicians (Gauss, Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein, Thomas Alva Edison, Hipprocrates, Gregor Mendel, ...), common terms (fertilization, famine, macroeconomics, genus, nationalism, ...), numbers and common first names, among other things.",
        "It is possible that using sub-day intervals might help to discriminate within this cluster.",
        "The items in this big cluster contrast with periodical events, which display recurring patterns (e.g., queries related to elections or tax-returns), and names of famous people and other entities which appeared in the news in the past few years.",
        "All of these are associated with irregular, spiky time series.",

        "Out of 2520 pairs, 283 belong to the same synset, 697 are related via hyponymy links, 60 via meronymy links, and 471 by alternating hyponymy and meronymy links in the path.",
        "When the phrases were polysemous, the shortest path between any of their meaning was used.",
        "About 40% of the relations do not have a clear structural interpretation in WordNet.",
        "The majority of pairs are related via more or less complex paths in the WordNet graph.",
        "Interestingly, even the structurally unrelated terms are characterized by transparent relations in terms of world knowledge, as it is the case between poppy and veteran day.",
        "Note as well that sometimes a WordNet term is used with a meaning not present in WordNet or in a different language, which may explain why aids has a very high correlation with welt (AIDS and welt are both hyponyms of health problem, but the correlation may be explained better by the AIDS World Day, Welt Aids Tag in German), and it also has a very high correlation with sida, defined in WordNet as a genus of tropical herbs, but which is in fact the translation of AIDS into Spanish.",
        "These observations motivated an additional manual labelling of the extracted pairs.",
        "As can be seen in Table 2, most of the terms that constitute a cluster are related to each other, although the kinds of semantic relationships that hold between them can vary significantly.",

        "The temporal dimension is a basic semantic component of lexical meaning and world knowledge which is not necessarily associated with any broad, and to some extent subjective, categorization.",
        "An inspection of the patterns found in each category shows in fact that similar patterns often emerge in different categories; e.g., \"Halloween costume\" and \"cheesecake recipe\" have a similar yearly periodical pattern with spikes in early winter, while monotonically decaying patterns are shared across all categories; e.g., between computer hardware and kids toys.",
        "The second interesting finding is the trend of the DFT system results, higher at low-intermediate values, providing some initial promising evidence that DFT analysis generates useful compressed representations which could be indexed and applied efficiently.",
        "Notice that the sequences reconstructed using 1,000 coefficients reproduce almost identically the original signals."
