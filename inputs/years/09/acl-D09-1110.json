        "Applied semantic inference is concerned with deriving target meanings from texts.",
        "In the textual entailment framework, this is reduced to inferring a textual statement (the hypothesis h) from a source text (t).",
        "Traditional formal semantics approaches perform such inferences over logical forms derived from the text.",
        "By contrast, most practical NLP applications operate over shallower representations such as parse trees, possibly supplemented with limited semantic information about named entities, semantic roles etc.",
        "Most commonly, inference over such representations is made by applying some kind of transformations or substitutions to the tree or graph representing the text.",
        "Such transformations may be generally viewed as entailment (inference) rules, which capture semantic knowledge about paraphrases, lexical relations such as synonyms and hyponyms, syntactic variations etc.",
        "Such knowledge is either composed manually, e.g. WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), or learned automatically.",
        "A large body of work has been dedicated to learning paraphrases and entailment rules, e.g. (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Shinyama et al., 2002; Szpektor et al., 2004; Bhagat and Ravichandran, 2008), identifying appropriate contexts for their application (Pantel et al., 2007) and utilizing them for inference (de Salvo Braz et al., 2005; Bar-Haim et al., 2007).",
        "Although current available rule bases are still quite noisy and incomplete, the progress made in recent years suggests that they may become increasingly valuable for text understanding applications.",
        "Overall, applied knowledge-based inference is a prominent line of research gaining much interest, with recent examples including the series of workshops on Knowledge and Reasoning for Answering Questions (KRAQ) and the planned evaluation of knowledge resources in the forthcoming 5th Recognizing Textual Entailment challenge (RTE-5).",
        "While many applied systems utilize semantic knowledge via such inference rules, their use is typically limited, application-specific, and quite heuristic.",
        "Formalizing these practices seems important for applied semantic inference research, analogously to the role of well-formalized models in parsing and machine translation.",

        "provides a principled framework for modeling such inferences, its implementation using explicit generation of consequents raises severe efficiency issues, since the number of consequents may grow exponentially in the number of rule applications.",

        "The number of derivable sentences (including the source sentence) would be 2 as each rule can either be applied or not, independently.",
        "Indeed, we found that this exponential explosion leads to poor scalability in practice.",
        "Intuitively, we would like that each rule application would add just the entailed part (e.g. kids) to a packed sentence representation.",
        "Yet, we still want the resulting structure to represent a set of entailed sentences, rather than some mixture of sentence fragments whose semantics is unclear.",
        "As discussed in section 5, previous work proposed only partial solutions to this problem.",
        "In this paper we present a novel data structure, termed compact forest, and a corresponding inference algorithm, which efficiently generate and represent all consequents while preserving the identity of each individual one (section 3).",
        "Our work is inspired by previous work on packed representations in other fields, such as parsing, generation and machine translation (section 5).",

        "The system operates in two primary stages: Inference, in which entailment rules are applied to the initial compact forest T, aiming to bring it closer to the hypothesis H, and Classification, in which a set of features is extracted from the resulting T and from H and fed into an SVM classifier, which determines entailment.",
        "The classification setting and its features are quite typical for the RTE literature.",
        "They include lexical and structural measures for the coverage of H by T, where high coverage is assumed to correlate with entailment, as well as features aiming to detect inconsistencies between T and H such as incompatible arguments for the same predicate or incompatible verb polarity (see below).",
        "For a complete feature description, see (Bar-Haim et al., 2009).",
        "Rule Bases In addition to the generic rules described in Section 4.1, the following large-scale sources for entailment rules were used: Wikipeda: We used the lexical rulebase of Shnarch et al.",
        "(2009), who extracted rules such as 'Janis Joplin – > singer' from Wikipedia based on both its metadata (e.g. links and redirects) and text definitions, using patterns such as 'X is a Y'.",
        "Word-Net: We extracted from WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) lexical rules based on synonyms, hyper-nyms and derivation relations.",
        "DIRT: The DIRT algorithm (Lin and Pantel, 2001) learns from a corpus entailment rules between binary predicates, e.g. 'X is fond of Y^X likes Y'.",
        "We used the version described in (Szpektor and Dagan, 2007), which learns canonical rule forms.",
        "Argument-Mapped WordNet (AmWN): A resource for entailment rules between verbal and nominal predicates (Szpektor and Dagan, 2009), including their argument mapping, based on WordNet and NomLex-plus (Meyers et al., 2004), verified statistically through intersection with the unary-DIRT algorithm (Szpektor and Dagan, 2008).",
        "In total, these rule bases represent millions of rules.",
        "Polarity Annotation Rules: We compiled a small set of annotation rules for marking the polarity of predicates as negative or unknown due to verbal negation, modal verbs, conditionals etc.",
        "(Bar-Haim et al., 2009).",
        "Search In this work we focus on efficient representation of the search space, leaving for future work the complementary problem of devising effective search heuristics over our representation.",
        "In the current experiment we implemented a simple search strategy, in the spirit of (de Salvo Braz et al., 2005): first, we applied three exhaustive iterations of generic rules.",
        "Since these rules have low fanout (few possible right-hand-sides for a given left-hand-side) it is affordable to apply and chain them more freely.",
        "We then perform a single iteration of all other lexical and lexical-syntactic rules, applying them only if their L part was matched in T and their R part was matched in H.",
        "The system was trained over the RTE-3 development set, and tested on both RTE-3 test set and RTE-4 (which includes only a test set).",
        "Results Table 2 provides statistics on rule application using all rule bases, over the RTE-3 development set and the RTE-4 dataset.",
        "Overall, the primary result is that the compact forest indeed accommodates well extensive rule application from large-scale rule bases.",
        "The resulting forest size is kept small, even in the maximal cases which were causing memory overflow for explicit inference.",
        "The accuracies obtained in this experiment and the overall contribution of rule-based inference are shown in Table 3.",
        "The results on RTE-3 are quite competitive: compared to our 66.4%, only 3 teams out of the 26 who participated in RTE-3 scored higher than 67%, and three more systems scored between 66% and 67%.",
        "The results for RTE4 rank 9-10 out of 26, with only 6 teams scoring higher by more than 1%.",
        "Overall, these results validate that the setting of our experiment represents a state-of-the-art system.",
        "Inference over the rule bases utilized in our experiment improved the accuracy on both test sets.",
        "The contribution was more prominent for the RTE-4 dataset.",
        "These results illustrate a typical contribution of current knowledge sources for current RTE systems.",
        "This contribution is likely to increase with current and near future research, on topics such as extending and improving knowledge resources, applying them only in semantically suitable contexts, improved classification features and broader search strategies.",
        "As for our current experiment, we may conclude that the goal of assessing the compact forest scalability in a state-of-the-art setting was achieved.",
        "Finally, Tables 4 and 5 illustrate the usage and contribution of individual rule bases.",
        "Table 4 shows the distribution of rule applications over the various rule bases.",
