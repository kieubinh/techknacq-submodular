        "In recent several years, the system combination methods based on confusion networks developed rapidly (Bangalore et al., 2001; Matusov et al., 2006; Sim et al., 2007; Rosti et al., 2007a; Rosti et al., 2007b; Rosti et al., 2008; He et al., 2008), which show state-of-the-art performance in benchmarks.",
        "A confusion network consists of a sequence of sets of candidate words.",
        "Each candidate word is associated with a score.",
        "The optimal consensus translation can be obtained by selecting one word from each set to maximizing the overall score.",
        "To construct a confusion network, one first need to choose one of the hypotheses (i.e., candidate translations) as the backbone (also called \"skeleton\" in the literature) and then decide the word alignments of other hypotheses to the backbone.",
        "Hypothesis alignment plays a crucial role in confusion-network-based system combination because it has a direct effect on selecting consensus translations.",
        "However, a confusion network is restricted in such a way that only 1-to-l mappings are allowed in hypothesis alignment.",
        "This is not the fact even for word alignments between the same languages.",
        "It is more common that several words are connected to another several words.",
        "For example, \"be capable of and \"be able to\" have the same meaning.",
        "Although confusion-network-based approaches resort to inserting null words to alleviate this problem, they face the risk of producing degenerate translations such as \"be capable to\" and \"be able of.",
        "In this paper, we propose a new system combination method based on lattices.",
        "As a more general form of confusion network, a lattice is capable of describing arbitrary mappings in hypothesis alignment.",
        "In a lattice, each edge is associated with a sequence of words rather than a single word.",
        "Therefore, we select phrases instead of words in each candidate set and minimize the chance to produce unexpected translations such as \"be capable to\".",
        "We compared our approach with the state-of-the-art confusion-network-based system (He et al., 2008) and achieved a significant absolute improvement of 1.23 BLEU points on the NIST 2005 Chinese-to-English test set and 0.93 BLEU point on the NIST 2008 Chinese-to-English test set.",
