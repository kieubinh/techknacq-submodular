        "In a number of language processing tasks, particularly automatic speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation (MT), there is the problem of selecting the best sequence of words from multiple hypotheses.",
        "This problem stems from the noisy channel approach to these applications.",
        "The noisy channel model states that the observed data, e.g., the acoustic signal, is the result of some input translated by some unknown stochastic process.",
        "Then the problem of finding the best sequence of words given the acoustic input, not approachable directly, is transformed into two separate models:",
        "where A is the acoustic signal and w™ is a sequence of n words.",
        "p(A\\wi) is called an acoustic model andp(w'i) is the language model.",
        "Typically, these applications use language models that compute the probability of a sequence in a generative way:",
        "Approximation is required to keep the parameter space tractable.",
        "Most commonly the context is reduced to just a few immediately preceding words.",
        "This type of model is called an ngram model:",
        "Even with limited context, the parameter space can be quite sparse and requires sophisticated techniques for reliable probability estimation (Chen and Goodman, 1996).",
        "While the ngram models perform fairly well, they are only capable of capturing very shallow knowledge of the language.",
        "There is extensive literature on a variety of methods that have been used to imbue models with syntactic and semantic information in different ways.",
        "These methods can be broadly categorized into two types:",
        "• The first method uses surface words within its context, sometimes organizing them into deterministic classes.",
        "Models of this type include: (Brown et al., 1992; Zitouni, 2007), which use semantic word clustering, and (Bahl et al., 1990), which uses variable-length context.",
        "• The other method adds stochastic variables to express the ambiguous nature of surface words.",
        "To obtain the probability of the next",

        "word we need to sum over all assignments of the stochastic variables, as in Eq.",
        "2.",
        "Models of this type, which we call joint models since they essentially predict joint events of words and some random variable^), include (Chelba and Jelinek, 2000) which used POS tags in combination with \"parser instructions\" for constructing a full parse tree in a left-to-right manner; (Wang et al., 2003) used SuperARVs (complex tuples of dependency information) without resolving the dependencies, thus called almost parsing; (Niesler and Woodland, 1996; Hee-man, 1999) utilize part of speech (POS) tags.",
        "Note that some models reduce the context by making the following approximation:",
        "thus, transforming the problem into a standard HMM application.",
        "However, these models perform poorly and have only been able to improve over the ngram model when interpolated with it (Niesler and Woodland, 1996).",
        "Although joint models have the potential to better express variability in word usage through the introduction of additional latent variables, they do not necessarily perform better because the increased dimensionality of the context substantially increases the already complex problem of parameter estimation.",
        "The complexity of the space also makes computation of the probability a challenge because of space and time constraints.",
        "This makes the choice of the random variables a matter of utmost importance.",
        "The model presented in this paper has some elements borrowed from prior work, notably (Hee-man, 1999; Xu and Jelinek, 2004), while others are novel.",
        "The message we aim to deliver in this paper can be summarized in two theses:",
        "• Use fine-grain syntactic tags in a joint LM.",
        "We propose a joint language model that can be used with a variety of tagsets.",
        "In Section 2, we describe those that we used in our experiments.",
        "Rather than tailoring our model to these tagsets, we aim for flexibility and propose an information theoretic framework for quick evaluation for tagsets, thus simplifying the creation of new tagsets.",
        "We show that our model with fine-grain tagsets outperform the coarser POS model, as well as the ngram baseline, in Section 5.",
        "• Address the challenges that arise in a joint language model with fine-grain tags.",
        "While the idea of using joint language modeling is not novel (Chelba and Jelinek, 2000; Hee-man, 1999), nor is the idea of using fine-grain tags (Bangalore, 1996; Wang et al., 2003), none of prior papers focus on the issues that arise from the combination of joint language modeling with fine-grain tags, both in terms of reliable parameter estimation and scalability in the face of the increased computational complexity.",
        "We dedicate Sections 3 and 4 to this problem.",
        "In Section 6, we summarize conclusions and lay out directions for future work."

        "The SuperARV essentially organizes information concerning one consistent set of dependency links for a word that can be directly derived from its syntactic parse.",
        "SuperARVs encode lexical information as well as syntactic and semantic constraints in a uniform representation that is much more fine-grained than POS.",
        "It is a four-tuple (C; F; R+; D), where C is the lexical category of the word, F is a vector of lexical features for the word, R+ is a set of governor and need labels that indicate the function of the word in the sentence and the types of words it needs, and D represents the relative position of the word and its dependents.",
        "We refer the reader to the literature for further details on SuperARVs (Wang and Harper, 2002; Wang et al., 2003).",
        "SuperARVs can be produced from parse trees by applying deterministic rules.",
        "In this work we use SuperARVs as individual tags and do not cluster them based of their structure.",
        "While SuperARVs are very attractive for language modeling, developing such a rich set of annotations for a new language would require a large amount of human effort.",
        "We propose two other types of tags which have not been applied to this task, although similar information has been used in parsing.",
        "This tag is a combination of the word's POS tag and the POS tag of its governor role.",
        "We designed it to resemble dependency parse structure.",
        "For example, the sentence in Figure 1 would be tagged: the/DT-NN black/JJ-NN cat/NN-VBD sat/VBD-root.",
        "Henceforth, we will refer to this kind of tag as head.",
        "This tag is a combination of the word's POS tag with its immediate parent in the parse tree, along with the POS tag's relative position among its siblings.",
        "We refer to this type of tags as parent.",

        "Note that the head and parent tagsets are more language-independent (all they require is a treebank) than the SuperARVs which, not only utilized the treebank, but were explicitly designed by a linguist for English only.",
        "As we have mentioned in Section 1, the choice of the tagset is very important to the performance of the model.",
        "There are two conflicting intuitions for tags: on one hand they should be specific enough to be helpful in the language model's task; on the other hand, they should be easy for the LM to predict.",
        "Of course, in order to argue which tags are more suitable, we need some quantifiable metrics.",
        "We propose an information theoretic approach:",
        "• To quantify how hard it is to predict a tag, we compute the conditional entropy:",
        "• To measure how helpful a tagset is in the LM task, we compute the reduction of the conditional cross entropy:",
        "Note that in this case we use conditional cross entropy because conditional entropy has the tendency to overfit the data as we select more and more fine-grain tags.",
        "Indeed, Hp(wi\\wi-iti-i) can be reduced to zero if the tags are specific enough, which would never happen in reality.",
        "This is not a problem for the former metric because the context there, Wi, is fixed.",
        "For this metric, we use a smoothed distribution ft computed on the training set and the test distribution q.",
        "The results of these measurements are presented in Figure 2.",
        "POS tags, albeit easy to predict, provide very little additional information about the following word, and therefore we would not expect them to perform very well.",
        "The parent tagset seems to perform somewhat better than SuperARVs - it provides 0.13 bits more information while being only 0.09 bits harder to predict based on the word.",
        "The head tagset is interesting: it provides 0.2 bits more information about the following word (which would correspond to 15% perplexity reduction if we had perfect tags), but on the other hand the model is less likely to predict these tags accurately.",
        "This approach is only a crude estimate (it uses only unigram and bigram context) but it is very useful for designing tagsets, e.g., for a new language, because it allows us to assess relative performance of tagsets without having to train a full model."
