        "The bidirectional approach outperformed the both the left-to-right strategy and the right-to-left strategy, showing consistent improvements that appeared to be unrelated to the specific languages used for translation.",

        "Human language production by its very nature is an ordered process.",
        "That is to say, words are written/uttered in a sequence.",
        "The current generation of phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) systems also generate their target word sequences according to an order.",
        "Since the generation process is symmetrical, there are two possible strategies that could be used to generate the target: from beginning to end; or from end to beginning.",
        "Generating the target in the 'wrong' direction (the opposite direction to the way in which humans do) is counter intuitive, and possibly as a result of this, SMT systems typically generate the target word sequence in the same order as human language production.",
        "However it is not necessarily the case that this is most effective strategy for all language pairs.",
        "In this paper we investigate the effect of direction in phrase-based SMT decoding.",
        "For the purposes of this paper, we will refer to target word sequence generation that follows the same order as human language production as forward generation, and generation in the opposite direction to human language production as reverse generation.",
        "These are often referred \"left-to-right\" and \"right-to-left\" respectively in the literature, but we avoid this notation as many languages are naturally written from right-to-left.",
        "In earlier work (Watanabe and Sumita, 2002), it was hypothesized that the optimal direction for decoding was dependent on the characteristics of the target language.",
        "Their results show that for Japanese to English translation a reverse decoding strategy was the most effective, whereas for English to Japanese translation, a forward decoding strategy proved superior.",
        "In addition they implemented a bidirectional decoder, but their results were mixed.",
        "For English to Japanese translation, decoding bidirectionally gives higher performance, but for Japanese to English translation they were unable to improve performance by decoding bidirectionally.",
        "Their experiments were performed using a decoder based on IBM Model 4 using the translation techniques developed at IBM (Brownetal., 1993).",
        "This work is closely related to the techniques proposed in (Watanabe and Sumita, 2002), but in our case we decode within the framework of a phrase-based SMT system, rather than the IBM model.",
        "Our intention was to explore the effect of direction in decoding within the context of a more",

        "The underlying motivation for our studies however remains the same.",
        "Languages have considerably different structure, and certain grammatical constructs tend to occupy particular positions within sentences of the same language, but different positions across languages.",
        "These differences may make it easier to tackle the automatic translation of a sentence in a given language from a particular direction.",
        "Our approach differs in that the decoding process of a phrased-based decoder is quite different from that used by (Watanabe and Sumita, 2002) since decoding is done using larger units making the reordering process much simpler.",
        "In (Watanabe and Sumita, 2002) only one language pair is considered, for our experiments we extended this to include translation among 17 different languages including the Japanese and English pair used in (Watanabe and Sumita, 2002).",
        "We felt that it was important to consider as many languages as possible in this study, as intuition and evidence from the original study suggests that the effect of direction in decoding is likely to be strongly language dependent.",
        "The next section briefly describes the mechanisms underlying phrase-based decoding.",
        "Then we explain the principles behind the forward, reverse and bidirectional decoding strategies used in our experiments.",

        "For our experiments we use the phrase-based machine translation techniques described in (Koehn, 2004) and (Koehn et al., 2007), integrating our models within a log-linear framework (Och and Ney, 2002).",
        "One of the advantages of a log-linear model is that it is possible to integrate a diverse set of features into the model.",
        "For the decoders used in the experiments in this paper, we included the following feature functions:",
        "• An n-gram language model over the target word sequence",
        "- Ensures the target word sequence is a likely sequence of words in the target language• A phrase translation model",
        "- Effects the segmentation of the source word sequence, and is also responsible for the transformation of source phrases into target phrases.",

        "- Influences the reordering of the translated source phrases in the target word sequence using lexical context on the boundaries of the phrases being reordered.",
        "In a phrase-based SMT decoder, the word sequence of the target language is typically generated in order in a forward manner.",
        "The words at the start of the translation are generated first, then the subsequent words, in order until the final word of the target word sequence is generated.",
        "As the process is phrase-based, the translation is generated in a phrase-by-phrase manner, rather word-by-word.",
        "The basic idea is to segment the source word sequence into subsequences (phrases), then translate each phrase individually, and finally compose the target word sequence by reordering the translations of the source phrases.",
        "This composition must occur in a particular order, such that target words are generated sequentially from the start (or end in the case of reverse decoding) of the sentence.",
        "The reason that the target needs to be generated sequentially is to allow an n-gram language model to be applied to the partial target word sequence at each step of the decoding process.",
        "This process is illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "In the decoding for both forward and reverse decoders the source sentence is segmented into 2 phrases: \"where is\" and \"the station\" (although in this example the segmentation is the same for both decoding strategies, it is not necessarily the case since the search processes are different).",
        "In the forward decoding process, first the English phrase \"the station\" is translated into the Japanese phrase \"eki wa\".",

        "This marker only serves as context to indicate the start of the sequence for the benefit of the language model.",
        "The first target phrase is separated into its component words and each word is added in order to the target word sequence.",
        "Each addition causes an application of the language model, hence in Figure 1 the first term of Plm is P(eki|(s)), the second is P(wa|(s)) and so on.",
        "For reverse decoding, the target sentence is generated starting from the end of sentence marker (/s) with the language model context being to the right of the current word.",
        "For the case of bidirectional decoding, the model probability for the hypothesis is a linear interpolation of the scores for both forward and reverse hypotheses.",
        "Direction in decoding influences both the models used by the decoder and the search process itself.",
        "The direction of decoding determines the order in which target words are generated, the source phrases being translated in any order, therefore it is likely to be features of the target language rather than those of the the source language that determine the effect that the decoding direction has on decoder performance.",
        "The fundamental difference between the language models of a forward decoder and that of a reverse decoder is the direction in which the model looks for its context.",
        "The forward model looks back to the start of the sentence, whereas the reverse model looks forward to the end of the sentence.",
        "Assuming a full search, a unigram language model and no limitations on reordering, the forward and reverse decoding processes are equivalent.",
        "When these constraints are lifted, as is the case in the experiments in this paper, the two search processes diverge and can give rise to hypotheses that are different in character.",
        "The partial hypotheses from early in the search process for forward decoding represent hypotheses for the first few words of the target word sequence, whereas the early partial hypotheses of a reverse decoder hold the last few words.",
        "This has two consequences for the search.",
        "The first is that (assuming a beam search as used in our experiments), certain candidate word sequences in the early stages of the search might be outside the beam and be pruned.",
        "The consequence of this is that sentences that start with (or end with in the case of reverse decoding) the pruned word sequence will not be considered during the remainder of the search.",
        "The second is that word sequences in the partial hypotheses are used in the context of the models used in the subsequent decoding.",
        "Thus, correctly decoding the start (or end for reverse decoding) of the sentence will benefit the subsequent decoding process."

        "Source languages are indicated by the column headers, the row headers denoting the target languages.",
        "ally better to decode in a forward direction.",
        "Our main contribution has been to show that a bidirectional decoding strategy is superior to both mono-directional decoding strategies.",
        "It might be argued that the gains arise simply from system combination.",
        "However, our systems are combined in a simple linear fashion, and gains will only arise when the second system contributes novel and useful information to into the combination.",
        "Furthermore, our systems are trained on two copies of the same data, no additional data is required.",
        "The gains from decoding bidirectionally were obtained very consistently, with only loose constraints on the decoding.",
        "This can be seen clearly in Table 5 where the results are almost unanimously positive.",
        "Moreover, these gains appear to be independent of the linguistic characteristics of the source and target languages.",
        "In the future we would like to explore the possibilities created by more tightly coupling the forward and reverse components of the bidirectional decoder.",
        "Scores from partial hypotheses of both processes could be combined and used at each step of the decoding, making the search more informed.",
        "Furthermore, forward partial hypotheses and reverse hypotheses would 'meet' during decoding (when one decoding direction has covered words in the source that the other has yet to cover), and provide paths for each other to a final state in the search.",
