        "Common NLP tasks, such as Named Entity Recognition and Chunking, involve the identification of spans of words belonging to the same phrase.",
        "These tasks are traditionally reduced to a tagging task, in which each word is to be classified as either Beginning a span, Inside a span, or Outside of a span.",
        "The decision is based on the word to be classified and its neighbors.",
        "Features supporting the classification usually include",
        "'Supported by the Lynn and William Frankel Center for Computer Sciences, Ben Gurion University",
        "the word forms themselves and properties derived from the word forms, such as prefixes, suffixes, capitalization information, and parts-of-speech.",
        "While early approaches to the NP-chunking task (Cardie and Pierce, 1998) relied on part-of-speech information alone, it is widely accepted that lexical information (word forms) is crucial for building accurate systems for these tasks.",
        "Indeed, all the better-performing systems in the CoNLL shared tasks competitions for Chunking (Sang and Buchholz, 2000) and Named Entity Recognition (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002; Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003) make extensive use of such lexical information.",
        "Is this belief justified?",
        "In this paper, we show that the influence of lexical features on such sequence labeling tasks is more complex than is generally assumed.",
        "We find that exact word forms aren't necessary for accurate classification.",
        "This observation is important because relying on the exact word forms that appear in a training corpus leads to over-fitting, as well as to larger models.",
        "In this work, we focus on learning with Support Vector Machines (SVMs) (Vapnik, 1995).",
        "SVM classifiers can handle very large feature spaces, and produce state-of-the-art results for NLP applications (see e.g. (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000; Nivre et al., 2006)).",
        "Alas, when trained on pruned feature sets, in which rare lexical items are removed, SVM models suffer a loss in classification accuracy.",
        "It would seem that rare lexical items are indeed crucial for SVM classification performance.",
        "However, in Goldberg and Elhadad (2007), we suggested that the SVM learner is using the rare lexical features for singling out hard cases rather than for learning meaningful generalizations.",
        "We provide further evidence to support this claim in this paper.",

        "We show that by using a variant of SVM Anchored SVM Learning (Goldberg and Elhadad, 2007) with a polynomial kernel, one can learn accurate models for English NP-chunking (Marcus and Ramshaw, 1995), base-phrase chunking (CoNLL 2000), and Dutch Named Entity Recognition (CoNLL 2002), on a heavily pruned feature space.",
        "Our models make use of only a fraction of the lexical features available in the training set (less than 1%), and yet provide highly-competitive accuracies.",
        "For the Chunking and NP-Chunking tasks, the most heavily pruned experiments, in which we consider only features appearing at least 100 times in the training corpus, do show a small but significant drop in accuracy on the testing corpus compared to the non-pruned models exposed to all available features in the training data.",
        "We provide detailed error analysis of a development set in Section 6, revealing the causes for these differences.",
        "We suggest one additional binary feature in order to account for some of the performance gap.",
        "Moreover, we show that the differences in accuracy vanish when the lexicalized and unlexi-calized models are tested on text from slightly different sources than the training corpus (Section 7).",
        "This goes to show that with an appropriate learning method, orthographic and structural (in the form of POS tag sequences) information is sufficient for achieving state-of-the-art performance on these kind of sequence labeling tasks.",
        "This does not mean semantic information is not needed for these tasks.",
        "It does mean that current models capture only a tiny amount of such semantic information through rare lexical features, and in a manner that does not generalize well.",
        "We believe this data motivates a different strategy to incorporate lexical features into classification models: instead of collecting the raw lexical forms appearing in a training corpus, we should attempt to actively construct a feature space including lexical features derived from external sources.",
        "The feature representation of (Collobert and Weston, 2008) could be a step in that direction.",
        "We also believe that hard cases for sequence labeling (POS ambiguity, coordination, long syntactic constructs) could be directly approached with specialized classifiers.",
        "This work complements a similar line of results from the parsing literature.",
        "While it was initially believed that lexicalization of PCFG parsers (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 2000) is crucial for obtaining good parsing results, Gildea (2001) demonstrated that the lexicalized Model-1 parser of Collins (1997) does not benefit from bilexical information when tested on a new text domain, and only marginally benefits from such information when tested on the same text domain as the training corpora.",
        "This was followed by (Bikel, 2004) who showed that bilexical-information is used in only 1.49% of the decisions in Collins' Model-2 parser, and that removing this information results in \"an exceedingly small drop in performance\".",
        "However, uni-lexical information was still considered crucial.",
        "Klein and Manning (2003) bridged the gap between lexicalized and unlexi-calized parsing performance, providing a competitive unlexicalized parsing model, relying on lexical information for only a few closed-class lexical items.",
        "This was recently followed by (Mat-suzaki et al., 2005; Petrov et al., 2006) who introduce state-of-the-art nearly unlexicalized PCFG parsers.",
        "Similarly for discriminative dependency parsing, state-of-the-art parsers (McDonald, 2006; Nivre et al., 2006) are highly lexicalized.",
        "However, the model analysis in (McDonald, 2006) reveals that bilexical features hardly contribute to the performance of a discriminative MST-based dependency parser, while Kawahara and Uchimoto (2007) demonstrate that minimally-lexicalized shift-reduce based dependency parsers can produce near state-of-the-art accuracy.",
        "In this work, we address the same question of determining the impact of lexical features on a different family of tasks: sequence labeling, as illustrated by named entity recognition and chunking.",
        "As discussed above, all state-of-the-art published methods rely on lexical features for such tasks (Zhang et al., 2001; Sha and Pereira, 2003; Finkel et al., 2005; Ratinov and Roth, 2009).",
        "Sequence labeling includes both a structural aspect (bracketing the chunks) and a tagging aspect (classifying the chunks).",
        "While we expect the structural aspect can benefit from techniques similar to those used in the parsing literature, it is unclear whether the tagging component could perform well without detailed lexical information.",
        "We demonstrate in this work that, indeed, lexical features are not necessary to obtain competitive performance.",
        "Our approach consists in performing a detailed analysis of the role played by rare lexical features in SVM models.",
        "We distinguish the information brought to the model by such features from the role they play in a specific learning method."

        "The lexical (word-form) features result in extremely high-dimensional (yet very sparse) feature vectors - each word-form in the vocabulary of the training set correspond to (at-least) one indicator function.",
        "Due to the Zipfian distribution of language data, many of the lexical features are very rare, and appear only a couple times in the training set.",
        "Ideally, we would like our classifiers to learn only from robust features: consider only features that appear at least k times in the training data (rare-feature pruning).",
        "These features are more likely to appear in unseen test data, and thus such features can support more robust generalization.",
        "However, we find empirically that performing such feature pruning prior to learning SVM models hurts the performance of the learned models.",
        "Our intuition is that this sensitivity to rare lexical features is not explained by the richness of information such rare features bring to the model.",
        "Instead, we believe that rare lexical features help the classifier because they make the data artificially more separable.",

        "SVMs with a polynomial kernel of degree 2 were shown to provide state-of-the-art performance in many NLP application, see for example (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000; Nivre et al., 2006; Isozaki and Kazawa, 2002; Goldberg et al., 2006).",
        "SVMs cope with inseparable data by introducing a soft-margin - allowing some of the training instances to be classified incorrectly subject to a penalty, controlled by a parameter C.",
        "Anchored SVM As we show in Section 5, the soft-margin heuristic performs sub-optimally for NLP tasks when the data is inseparable.",
        "We use instead the Anchored Learning heuristic, introduced in (Goldberg and Elhadad, 2007).",
        "The idea behind anchored learning is that some training instances are inherently ambiguous.",
        "This ambiguity stems from ambiguity in language structure, which cannot be resolved with a given feature representation.",
        "When a data-point cannot be classified, it might be due to missing information, which is not available in the data representation.",
        "Instead of allowing ambiguous items to be misclassified during training, we make the training data artificially separable.",
        "This is achieved by adding a unique feature to each training example (an anchor).",
        "These anchor features cause each data-point to be slightly more similar to itself than to any other data point.",
        "At test time, we remove anchor features.",
        "In terms of kernel-based learning, anchored learning can be achieved by redefining the dot product between two vectors to take into account the identity of the vectors: x% -anc Xj = x% â  Xj + Ã¶ij.",
        "The classifier learned over the anchored data takes into account the fine interactions between the various inseparable data points.",
        "In our experiments, SVM models over anchored data have many more support vectors than soft-margin SVM models.",
        "However, the anchored models generalize much better when less features are available.",
        "Relation to L2 SVM The classic soft-margin SVM formulation uses LI-penalty for misclassified instances.",
        "Specifically, the objective of the learner is to minimize ^||w|| + CJ2i(i subject to some margin constraints, where w is a weight vector to be learned and Â£j is the misclassification error for instance %.",
        "This is equivalent to maximizing the dual problem: EÂ»=i on-\\ Eij aiajViVjKixi, xj)",
        "Another variant is L2-penalty SVM (Koshiba and Abe, 2003), in which there is a quadratic penalty for misclassified instances.",

        "Interestingly, for the linear kernel, SVManchoring reduces to L2-SVM with C=l.",

        "In our experiments, as discussed in Section 5.4, we find that anchored-SVM and soft-margin SVM with tuned C value both reach good results when we reduce the amount of lexical features.",
        "Anchored-SVM, however, does not require fine-tuning of the error-parameter C since it insures separability.",
        "As a result, we learn anchored-SVM models quickly (few hours) as opposed to several days per model for C-tuned soft-margin SVM.",
        "Anchored-SVMs also provide an easy explanation of the role of features in terms of separability.",
        "Therefore, we use anchored-SVMs in our experiments as the learning method, but we expect that other learning methods are capable of learning with the same reduced feature sets."
