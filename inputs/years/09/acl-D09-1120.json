        "We present a simple approach which completely modularizes these three aspects.",

        "Despite its simplicity and discourse naivete, our system substantially outperforms all unsupervised systems and most supervised ones.",
        "Primary contributions include (1) the presentation of a simple-to-reproduce, high-performing baseline and (2) the demonstration that most remaining errors can be attributed to syntactic and semantic factors external to the coreference phenomenon (and perhaps best addressed by non-coreference systems)."

        "The resolution of entity reference is influenced by a variety of constraints.",

        "Semantic constraints like selectional compatibility (e.g. a spokesperson can announce things) and subsumption (e.g. Microsoft is a company) rule out many possible referents.",
        "Finally, discourse phenomena such as salience and centering theory are assumed to heavily influence reference preferences.",
        "As these varied factors have given rise to a multitude of weak features, recent work has focused on how best to learn to combine them using models over reference structures (Culotta et al., 2007; Denis and Baldridge, 2007; Klenner and Ailloud, 2007).",
        "In this work, we break from the standard view.",
        "Instead, we consider a vastly more modular system in which coreference is predicted from a deterministic function of a few rich features.",
        "In particular, we assume a three-step process.",
        "First, a self-contained syntactic module carefully represents syntactic structures using an augmented parser and extracts syntactic paths from mentions to potential antecedents.",
        "Some of these paths can be ruled in or out by deterministic but conservative syntactic constraints.",
        "Importantly, the bulk of the work in the syntactic module is in making sure the parses are correctly constructed and used, and this module's most important training data is a treebank.",
        "Second, a self-contained semantic module evaluates the semantic compatibility of headwords and individual names.",
        "These decisions are made from compatibility lists extracted from unlabeled data sources such as newswire and web data.",
        "Finally, of the antecedents which remain after rich syntactic and semantic filtering, reference is chosen to minimize tree distance.",
        "This procedure is trivial where most systems are rich, and so does not need any supervised coreference data.",
        "However, it is rich in important ways which we argue are marginalized in recent coreference work.",
        "Interestingly, error analysis from our final system shows that its failures are far more often due to syntactic failures (e.g. parsing mistakes) and semantic failures (e.g. missing knowledge) than failure to model discourse phenomena or appropriately weigh conflicting evidence.",
        "One contribution of this paper is the exploration of strong modularity, including the result that our system beats all unsupervised systems and approaches the state of the art in supervised ones.",
        "Another contribution is the error analysis result that, even with substantial syntactic and semantic richness, the path to greatest improvement appears to be to further improve the syntactic and semantic modules.",
        "Finally, we offer our approach as a very strong, yet easy to implement, baseline.",
        "We make no claim that learning to reconcile disparate features in a joint model offers no benefit, only that it must not be pursued to the exclusion of rich, non-reference analysis."

        "At a high level, our system resembles a pairwise coreference model (Soon et al., 1999; Ng and Cardie, 2002; Bengston and Roth, 2008); for each mention rm, we select either a single-best antecedent amongst the previous mentions mi,..., rrii-i, or the NULL mention to indicate the underlying entity has not yet been evoked.",

        "In contrast to most recent research, our pairwise decisions are not made with a learned model which outputs a probability or confidence, but instead for each mention rm, we select an antecedent amongst mi,..., m%-\\ or the null mention as follows:",

        "Initially, there is no syntactic constraint (improved in Section 3.1.3), the antecedent compatibility filter allows proper and nominal mentions to corefer only with mentions that have the same head (improved in Section 3.2), and pronouns have no compatibility constraints (improved in Section 3.1.2).",

        "We parse all document sentences with the Stanford parser, and then for each evaluation mention, we find the largest-span NP which has the previously determined mention head as its head.",
        "Often, this results in a different, typically larger, mention span than annotated in the data.",

        "Here, we represent apposition as a syntactic feature of an NP indicating that it is coreferent with its parent NP (e.g. it is an exception to the i-within-i constraint that parent and child NPs cannot be coreferent).",
        "We deterministically mark a node as NP-appos (see Figure 3) when it is the third child in of a parent NP whose expansion begins with (NP , NP), and there is not a conjunction in the expansion (to avoid marking elements in a list as appositive).",
        "Role Appositives: During development, we discovered many errors which involved a variant of appositives which we call 'role appositives' (see painter in Figure 3), where an NP modifying the head NP describes the role of that entity (typically a person entity).",
        "There are several challenges to correctly labeling these role NPs as being appositives.",
        "First, the NPs produced by Treebank parsers are flat and do not have the required internal structure (see Figure 3(a)).",
        "While fully solving this problem is difficult, we can heuristically fix many instances of the problem by placing an NP around maximum length sequences of NNP tags or NN (and JJ) tags within an NP; note that this will fail for many constructions such as U.S. President Barack Obama, which is analyzed as a flat sequence of proper nouns.",
        "Once this internal NP structure has been added, whether the NP immediately to the left of the head NP is an appositive depends on the entity type.",
        "For instance, Rabbi Ashi is an apposition but Iranian army is not.",
        "Again, a full solution would require its own model, here we mark as appositions any NPs immediately to the",
        "left of a head child NP where the head child NP is identified as a person by the NER tagger.",
        "We incorporate NP appositive annotation as a constraint during filtering.",
        "Any mention which corresponds to an appositive node has its set of possible antecedents limited to its parent.",
        "Along with the appositive constraint, we implement the i-within-i constraint that any non-appositive NP cannot be be coreferent with its parent; this constraint is then propagated to any node its parent is forced to agree with.",
        "The order in which these constraints are applied is important, as illustrated by the example in Figure 4: First the list of possible antecedents for the appositive NP is constrained to only its parent.",
        "Now that all appositives have been constrained, we apply the i-within-i constraint, which prevents its from having the NP headed by brand in the set of possible antecedents, and by propagation, also removes the NP headed by Gitano.",
        "This leaves the NP Wal-Mart as the closest compatible mention.",
        "Adding these syntactic constraints to our system yields 55.4 Fl, a fairly substantial improvement, but many recall errors remain between mentions with differing heads.",
        "Resolving such cases will require external semantic information, which we will automatically acquire (see Section 3.2).",
        "Predicate Nominatives: Another syntactic constraint exploited in Poon and Domingos (2008) is the predicate nominative construction, where the object of a copular verb (forms of the verb be) is constrained to corefer with its subject (e.g. Microsoft is a company in Redmond).",

        "As with appositives, we annotate object predicate-nominative NPs and constrain coreference as before.",
        "This yields a minor improvement to 55.5 Fl.",
        "While appositives and related syntactic constructions can resolve some cases of non-pronominal reference, most cases require semantic knowledge about the various entities as well as the verbs used in conjunction with those entities to disambiguate references (Kehler et al., 2008).",
        "However, given a semantically compatible mention head pair, say AOL and company, one might expect to observe a reliable appositive or predicative-nominative construction involving these mentions somewhere in a large corpus.",
        "In fact, the Wikipedia page for AOL has a predicate-nominative construction which supports the compatibility of this head pair: AOL LLC (formerly America Online) is an American global Internet services and media company operated by Time Warner.",
        "In order to harvest compatible head pairs, we utilize our BLIPP and WIKI data sets (see Section 2), and for each noun (proper or common) and pronoun, we assign a maximal NP mention node for each nominal head as in Section 3.1.1 ; we then annotate appositive and predicate-nominative NPs as in Section 3.1.3.",
        "For any NP which is annotated as an appositive or predicate-nominative, we extract the head pair of that node and its constrained antecedent.",
        "The resulting set of compatible head words, while large, covers a little more than half of the examples given in Table 1.",
