        "In most cases for parsers' error analysis, researchers associate output errors with failures in handling certain linguistic phenomena and attempt to avoid them by adding or modifying corresponding settings of their parsers.",
        "However, such an analysis cannot been done so smoothly since parsing errors sometimes depend on each other and the underlying dependencies behind superficial phenomena cannot be captured easily.",
        "In this paper, we propose descriptive and empirical approaches to effective extraction of dependencies among parsing errors and engage in a deeper error analysis with them.",
        "In our descriptive approach, we define various combinations of error patterns as organized error phenomena on the basis of linguistic knowledge, and then extract such combinations from given errors.",
        "In our empirical approach, on the other and, we re-parse a sentence under the condition where a target error is corrected, and errors which are additionally corrected are regarded as dependent errors.",
        "By capturing dependencies among parsing errors through systematic approaches, we can effectively collect errors which are related to the same linguistic properties.",
        "In the experiments, we applied both of our approaches to an HPSG parser Enju (Miyao and Tsujii, 2005; Ninomiya et al., 2006), and then evaluated the obtained error classes.",
