        "Given the accelerated growth of the number of multilingual documents on the Web and elsewhere, the need for effective multilingual and cross-lingual text processing techniques is becoming increasingly important.",
        "In this paper, we address the task of cross-lingual semantic relatedness, and introduce a method that relies on Wikipedia in order to calculate the relatedness of words across languages.",
        "For instance, given the word factory in English and the word lavoratore in Italian (En.",
        "worker), the method can measure the relatedness of these two words despite the fact that they belong to two different languages.",
        "Measures ofcross-language relatedness are useful for a large number of applications, including cross-language information retrieval (Nie et al., 1999; Monz and Dorr, 2005), cross-language text classification (Gliozzo and Strapparava, 2006), lexical choice in machine translation (Och and Ney, 2000; Bangalore et al., 2007), induction of translation lexicons (Schafer and Yarowsky, 2002), cross-language annotation and resource projections to a second language (Riloff et al., 2002; Hwa et al., 2002; Mohammad et al., 2007).",
        "The method we propose is based on a measure of closeness between concept vectors automatically built from Wikipedia, which are mapped via the Wikipedia interlanguage links.",
        "Unlike previous methods for cross-language mapping, which are typically limited by the availability ofbilingual dictionaries or parallel texts, the method proposed in this paper can be used to measure the relatedness of word pairs in any of the 250 languages for which a Wikipedia version exists.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "We first provide a brief overview of Wikipedia, followed by a description of the method to build concept vectors based on this encyclopedic resource.",
        "We then show how these concept vectors can be mapped across languages for a cross-lingual measure of word relatedness.",
        "Through evaluations run on six language pairs, connecting English, Spanish, Arabic and Romanian, we show that the method is effective at capturing the cross-lingual relatedness of words, with results comparable to the monolingual measures of relatedness."

        "A similar trend is observed for the cross-lingual relatedness, with higher results obtained for the languages with large Wikipedia versions (e.g., English-Spanish), and lower results for the languages with a smaller size Wikipedia (e.g., Arabic-Spanish).",
        "For comparison, we ran two additional experiments.",
        "In the first experiment, we compared the coverage of our cross-lingual relatedness method to a direct use of the translation links available in Wikipedia.",
        "The cross-lingual relatedness is turned into a monolingual relatedness by using the in-terlanguage Wikipedia links to translate the first of the two words in a cross-lingual pair into the language of the second word in the pair.",
        "From the total of 433 word pairs available in the two data sets, this method can produce translations for an average of 103 word pairs per language pair.",
        "This means that the direct Wikipedia inter-language links allow the cross-lingual relatedness measure to be transformed into a monolingual relatedness in about 24% of the cases, which is a low coverage compared to the full coverage that can be obtained with our cross-lingual method of relatedness.",
        "In an attempt to raise the coverage of the translation, we ran a second experiment where we used a state-of-the-art translation engine to translate the first word in a pair into the language of the second word in the pair.",
        "We use Google Translate, which is a statistical machine translation engine that relies on large parallel corpora, to find the most likely translation for a given word.",
        "Unlike the previous experiment, this time we can achieve full translation coverage, and thus we are able to produce data sets of equal size that can be used for a comparison between relatedness measures.",
        "Specifically, using the translation produced by the machine translation engine for the first word in a pair, we calculate the relatedness within the space of the language of the second word using a monolingual ESA also based on Wikipedia.",
        "The results obtained with this method are compared against the results obtained with our cross-lingual ESA relatedness.",

        "These results are encouraging, also given that the translation-based method is limited to those language pairs for which a translation engine exists (e.g., Google Translate covers 40 languages), whereas our method can be applied to any language pair from the set of 250 languages for which a Wikipedia version exists.",
        "To gain further insights, we also determined the impact of the vector length in the ESA concept vector representation, by calculating the Pearson correlation for vectors of different lengths.",
        "Figures 1 and 2 show the Pearson score as a function of the vector length for the Miller-Charles and WordSimilarity-353 data sets.",
        "The plots show that the cross-lingual measure of relatedness is not significantly affected by the reduction or increase of the vector length.",
        "Thus, the use of vectors of length 10,000 (as used in most of our experiments) appears as a reasonable tradeoff between accuracy and performance.",
        "Furthermore, by comparing the performance of the proposed Lesk-like model to the traditional cosine-similarity (Figures 3 and 4), we note that the Lesk-like model outperforms the cosine model on most language pairs.",
        "We believe that this is due to the stricter correlation conditions imposed by the cosine-metric in such sparse vector-based representations, as compared to the more relaxed hypothesis used by the Lesk model.",
        "Finally, we also looked at the relation between the number of interlanguage links found for the concepts in a vector and the length of the vector.",
        "Figures 5 and 6 display the average number of in-terlanguage links as a function of the concept vector length.",
        "By analyzing the effect of the average number of interlanguage links found per word in the given datasets (Figures 5 and 6), we notice that these links increase proportionally with the vector size, as expected.",
        "However, this increase does not lead to any significant improvements in accuracy (Figures 1 and 2).",
        "This implies that while the presence of interlanguage links is a prerequisite for the measure of relatedness, their effect is only significant for the top ranked concepts in a vector.",
        "Therefore, increasing the vectors size to maximize the matching of the projected dimensions does not necessarily lead to accuracy improvements."

        "Measures of word relatedness were found useful in a large number of natural language processing applications, including word sense disambiguation (Patwardhan et al., 2003), synonym identification (Turney, 2001), automated essay scoring (Foltz et al., 1999), malapropism detection (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2001), coreference resolution (Strube and Ponzetto, 2006), and others.",
        "Most of the work to date has focused on measures of word relatedness for English, by using methods applied on knowledge bases (Lesk, 1986; Wu and Palmer, 1994; Resnik, 1995; Jiang and Conrath, 1997; Hughes and Ramage, 2007) or on large corpora (Salton et al., 1997; Landauer et al., 1998; Turney, 2001; Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007).",
        "Although to a lesser extent, measures of word relatedness have also been applied on other languages, including German (Zesch et al., 2007; Zesch et al., 2008; Mohammad et al., 2007), Chinese (Wang et al., 2008), Dutch (Heylen et al., 2008) and others.",
        "Moreover, assuming resources similar to those available for English, e.g., WordNet structures or large corpora, the measures of relatedness developed for English can be in principle applied to other languages as well.",
        "All these methods proposed in the past have been concerned with monolingual word relatedness calculated within the boundaries of one language, as opposed to cross-lingual relatedness, which is the focus of our work.",
        "The research area closest to the task of crosslingual relatedness is perhaps cross-language information retrieval, which is concerned with matching queries posed in one language to document collections in a second language.",
        "Note however that most of the approaches to date for cross-language information retrieval have been based on direct translations obtained for words in the query or in the documents, by using bilingual dictionaries (Monz and Dorr, 2005) or parallel corpora (Nie et al., 1999).",
        "Such explicit translations can identify a direct correspondence between words in two languages (e.g., they will find that fabbrica (It.)",
        "and factory (En.)",
        "are translations of each other), but will not capture similarities of a different degree (e.g., they will not find that lavoratore (It.",
