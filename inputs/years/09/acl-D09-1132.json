        "Definitions of terms are among the most common types of information users search for on the Web.",
        "In the trec 2001 QA track (Voorhees, 2001), where the distribution of question types reflected that of real user logs, 27% of the questions were requests for definitions (e.g., \"What is gasohol?",
        "\", \"Who was Duke Ellington?\").",
        "Consequently, some Web search engines provide special facilities (e.g., Google's \"define:\" query prefix) that seek definitions of user-specified terms in online encyclopedias or glossaries; to save space, we call both \"encyclopedias\".",
        "There are, however, often terms that are too recent, too old, or less widely used to be included in encyclopedias.",
        "Their definitions may be present on other Web pages (e.g., newspaper articles), but they may be provided indirectly (e.g., \"He said that gasohol, a mixture of gasoline and ethanol, has been great for his business.\")",
        "and they may be difficult to locate with generic search engines that may return dozens of pages containing, but not defining the terms.",
        "We present a system to find short definitions of user-specified terms on Web pages.",
        "It can be used as an add-on to generic search engines, when no definitions can be found in on-line encyclopedias.",
        "The system first invokes a search engine using the (possibly multi-word) term whose definition is sought, the target term, as the query.",
        "It then scans the top pages returned by the search engine to locate 250-character snippets with the target term at their centers; we call these snippets windows.",
        "The windows are candidate definitions of the target term, and they are then classified as acceptable (positive class) or unacceptable (negative class) using supervised machine learning.",
        "The system reports the windows for which it is most confident that they belong in the positive class.",
        "Table 1 shows examples of short definitions found by our system.",
        "In our experiments, we allow the system to return up to five windows per target term, and the system's response is counted as correct if any of the returned windows contains an acceptable short definition of the target.",
        "This is similar to the treatment of definition questions in TREC 2000 and 2001 (Voorhees, 2000; Voorhees, 2001), but the answer is sought on the Web, not in a given document collection of a particular genre.",
        "More recent TREC QA tracks required definition questions to be answered by lists of complementary text snippets, jointly providing required or optional information nuggets (Voorhees, 2003).",
        "In contrast, we focus on locating single snippets that include self-contained short definitions.",
        "Despite its simpler nature, we believe the task we address is of practical use: a list of single-snippet definitions from Web pages accompanied by the source URLs is a good starting point for users seeking definitions of terms not covered by encyclopedias.",
        "We also note that evaluating multi-snippet definitions can be problematic, because it is often difficult to agree which information nuggets should be treated as required, or even optional (Hildebrandt et al., 2004).",
        "In contrast, earlier experimental results we have reported (Androutsopoulos and Galanis, 2005) show strong inter-assessor agreement (K > 0.8) for single-snippet definitions (Eu-genio and Glass, 2004).",
        "The task we address also differs from duc's query focused summarization (Dang, 2005; Dang, 2006).",
        "Our queries are single terms, whereas duc queries are longer topic",

        "The system we present is based on our earlier work (Miliaraki and Androutsopoulos, 2004), where an SVM classifier (Cristianini and Shawe-Taylor, 2000) was used to separate acceptable windows from unacceptable ones; the SVM also returned confidence scores, which were used to rank the acceptable windows.",
        "On datasets from the trec 2000 and 2001 QA tracks, our earlier system clearly outperformed the methods of Joho and Sanderson (2000; 2001) and Prager et al.",
        "(2001; 2002), as reported in previous work (Miliaraki and Androutsopoulos, 2004).",
        "To train the SVM, however, thousands of training windows were required, each tagged as a positive or negative example.",
        "Obtaining large numbers of training windows is easy, but manually tagging them is very time-consuming.",
        "In the trec 2000 and 2001 datasets, it was possible to tag the training windows automatically by using training target terms and accompanying regular expression patterns provided by the trec organizers.",
        "The regular expressions covered all the known acceptable definitions of the corresponding terms that can be extracted from the datasets.",
        "When the training windows, however, are obtained from the Web, it is impossible to construct manually regular expressions for all the possible phrasings of the acceptable definitions in the training windows.",
        "In subsequent work (Androutsopoulos and Galanis, 2005), we developed attw (automatic tagging of training windows), a technique that produces arbitrarily large collections of training windows from the Web with practically no manual effort, in effect making our overall system unsupervised.",
        "attw uses training terms for which several encyclopedia definitions are available, and compares each Web training window (each window extracted from the pages the search engine returned for a training term) to the corresponding encyclopedia definitions.",
        "Web training windows that are very similar (or dissimilar) to the corresponding encyclopedia definitions are tagged as positive (or negative) examples; if the similarity is neither too high nor too low, the window is not included in the classifier's training data.",
        "Previously reported experiments (Androutsopoulos and Galanis, 2005) showed that attw leads to significantly better results, compared to training the classifier on all the available trec windows, for which regular expressions are available, and then using it to classify Web windows.",
        "Note that in attw the encyclopedia definitions are used only during training.",
        "Once the classifier has been trained, it can be used to discover definitions on arbitrary Web pages.",
        "In fact, during testing we discard windows originating from on-line encyclopedias, simulating the case where we seek definitions of terms not covered by encyclopedias; we also ignore windows from on-line encyclopedias during training.",
        "Also, note that the classifier is trained on Web windows, not directly on encyclopedia definitions, which allows it to avoid relying excessively on phrasings that are common in encyclopedia definitions, but uncommon in more indirect definitions of arbitrary Web pages.",
        "Furthermore, training the classifier directly on encyclopedia definitions would not provide negative examples.",
        "In our previous work with ATTW (Androutsopoulos and Galanis, 2005) we used a measure constructed by ourselves to assess the similarity between Web windows and encyclopedia definitions.",
        "Here, we use the more established rouge-W measure (Lin, 2004) instead.",
        "rouge-w and other versions of rouge have been used in summarization to measure how close a machine-authored summary is to multiple human summaries of the same input.",
        "We use rouge-w in a similar setting, to measure how close a training window is to multiple encyclopedia definitions of the same term.",
        "A further difference from our previous work is that we also use rouge-w when computing the features of the windows to be classified.",
        "Previously, the SVM relied, among others, on Boolean features indicating if the target term was preceded or followed in the window to be classified by a particular phrase indicating a definition (e.g., \"target, a kind of, \"such as target\").",
        "The indicative phrases are selected automatically during training, but now the corresponding features are not Boolean; their values are the rouge-w similarity scores between an indicative phrase and the context of the target term in the window.",
        "This allows the system to soft-match the phrases to the windows (e.g., encountering \"target, another kind of, instead of \"target, a kind of).",
        "In our new system we also use a Maximum Entropy (maxent) classifier (Ratnaparkhi, 1997) instead of an SVM, because much faster implementations of the former are available.",
        "We present experimental results showing that our new system significantly outperforms our previously published one.",
        "The use of the maxent classifier by itself improved slightly our results, but the improvements come mostly from using rouge-W.",
        "Apart from presenting an improved version of our system, the main contribution of this paper is a detailed experimental comparison of our new system against Cui et al.",
        "'s (2004; 2005; 2006; 2007).",
        "The latter is particularly interesting, because it is well published, it includes both an alternative, centroid-based technique to automatically tag training examples and a soft-matching classifier,",
        "!We also experimented with other similarity measures (e.g., edit distance) and rouge variants, but we obtained the best results with rouge-w.",
        "and it is publicly available.",

        "The longest common subsequence is divided into consecutive matches, producing in our example (A, B\\C\\D).",
        "We then compute the following score (weighted longest common subsequence), where m is the number of consecutive matches, ki is the length of the i-th consecutive match, and / is a weighting function.",
        "We use f(k) = ka, where a > 1 is a parameter we tune experimentally.",
        "We then compute the following quantities, where I I is word length, and f~l is the inverse of /.",

        "If R(w, d) is high, the longest common substring is very similar to d; then w (which also includes the longest common substring) intuitively contains almost all the information of d, i.e., all the information of a known acceptable definition (high recall).",
        "If P(w, d) is high, the longest common substring is very similar to w; then d (which also includes the longest common substring) contains almost all the information of w, i.e., w does not contain any (redundant) information not included in a known acceptable definition, something we care less for.",
        "The rouge-w similarity sim(w,Ct) between w and Ct is the maximum F(w,d), for all d g Ct. Training windows with sim(w, Ct) > T+ are tagged as positive; if sim(w, Ct) < T_, they are tagged as negative; and if T_ < sim(w,Ct) < T+, they are discarded.",

        "For each training target term, we construct a \"centroid\" pseudo-text containing the words that co-occur most frequently with the target term.",
        "We then compute the similarity between each training window and the centroid of its target term.",
        "If it exceeds a threshold, the window is tagged as positive; Cui et al.",
        "produce only positive examples.",
        "The centroid of a training target term t is constructed as follows.",
        "For each word u in fs training windows, we compute the centrality score defined below, where SFt is the number of fs training windows, SFU is the number of u's windows that can be extracted from the retained Web pages the search engine returned for t, SFtnu is the number of windows on the same pages that contain both t and u, and idf{u) is the inverse document frequency of w. Centrality scores are pointwise mutual information with an extra idf(u) factor.",
        "The words u whose centrality scores exceed the mean by at least a standard deviation are added to the centroid of t. Before computing the centrality scores, stop-words, punctuation, and non-alphanumeric characters are removed, and a stemmer is applied, as in attw.",
        "The similarities between training windows and centroids are then computed using cosine similarity, after turning the centroids and windows into binary vectors that show which words they contain.",
        "To evaluate the two methods that tag training windows, we selected randomly q = 200 target terms, different from those used for training and testing.",
        "We collected the q â  r â  f = 200 â¢ 10 â¢ 5 windows from the corresponding Web pages, we selected randomly 400 from the collected 10,000 windows, and tagged them manually as positive or negative.",
        "Figure 1 plots the positive precision of the two methods against their positive recall, and figure 2 shows negative precision against negative recall.",
        "For different values of T+, we obtain a different point in figure 1; similarly for T_ and figure 2.",
        "Positive precision is TP/( TP + FP), positive recall is TP/{TP + FN), and likewise for negative precision and recall; TP (true positives) are the positive training windows the method has correctly tagged as positive, FP are the negative windows the method has tagged as positives etc.",
        "For very high (strict) T+ values, the methods tag very few (or none) training windows as positive; hence, both TP and TP + FP approach (or become) zero; we take positive precision to be zero in that case.",
        "Positive recall also approaches (or becomes) zero, which is why both positive recall and precision reach zero in the left of figure 1.",
        "Similar comments apply to figure 2, though both methods always tagged correctly at least a few training windows as negative, for the T_ values we tried; hence, negative precision was never zero.",
        "Positive precision shows how certain we can be that training windows tagged as positive are indeed positive; whereas positive recall is the percentage of true positive examples that we manage to tag as such.",
        "Figure 1 shows that when using attw, we need to settle for a low positive recall, i.e., miss out many positive examples, in order to obtain a reasonably high precision.",
        "It also shows that the centroid method is clearly worse when tagging positive examples; its positive precision is almost always less than 0.3.",
        "Figure 2 shows that both methods achieve high negative precision and recall; they manage to assign trustworthy negative labels without missing many negative examples.",
        "However, attw is significantly better when tagging positive examples, as shown in figure 1; hence, it is better than the centroid method.",
        "When using attw in practice, we need to select T+ and T_.",
        "We assign more importance to selecting a T+ (a point of attw's curve in figure 1) that yields high positive precision; the choice of T_ (point in figure 2) is less important, because attw's negative precision is always reasonably high.",
        "Based on figure 1, we set T+ to 0.58, which corresponds to positive precision 0.66 and positive recall 0.16.",
        "By tuning the two thresholds we can control the number of positively or negatively tagged examples we produce (and their ratio), and the number of examples we discard.",
        "Having set T+, we set T_ to 0.30, a value that maintains the ratio of truly positive to truly negative windows of the 400 manually tagged windows (0.2 to 1), since this is approximately the ratio the classifier will confront during testing; we also experimented with a 1 to 1 ratio, but the results were worse.",
        "This T_ value corresponds negative precision 0.70 and negative recall 0.02.",
        "Thus, both positive and negative precision is approximately 0.7, which means that approximately 30% of the tags we assign to the examples are incorrect.",
