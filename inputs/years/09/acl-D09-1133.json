        "Moreover, while automatic parse trees only decrease the performance of English nominal SRL by about 4.2 in F1-measure, automatic parse trees significantly decrease the performance of Chinese nominal SRL by more than 12 in F1-measure due to the much lower performance of Chinese syntactic parsing."
