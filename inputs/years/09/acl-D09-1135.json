        "At present, most high-performance parsers are based on probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) in one way or another (Collins, 1999; Charniak and Johnson, 2005; Petrov and Klein, 2007).",
        "However, restricted by the strong context-free assumptions, the original PCFG model which simply takes the grammars and probabilities off a treebank, does not perform well.",
        "Therefore, a variety of techniques have been developed to enrich and generalize the original grammar, ranging from lexicalization to symbol annotation.",
        "Corresponding author: Xihong Wu.",
        "Lexicalized PCFGs use the structural features on the lexical head of phrasal node in a tree, and get significant improvements for parsing (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 1997; Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000).",
        "However, they suffer from the problem of fundamental sparseness of the lexical dependency information.",

        "In order to deal with this limitation, a variety of unlexicalized parsing techniques have been proposed.",
        "Johnson (1998) annotates each node by its parent category in a tree, and gets significant improvements compared with the original PCFGs on the Penn Treebank.",
        "Then, some manual and automatic symbol splitting methods are presented, which get comparable performance with lexicalized parsers (Klein and Manning, 2003; Matsuzaki et al., 2005).",
        "Recently, Petrov et al.",

        "The grammars refined in this way are proved to be much more accurate and compact than previous work on automatic annotation.",

        "This paper tries to refine the grammars through an improved hierarchical state-split process integrated with semantic knowledge.",
        "The related works are reviewed as follows.",
        "Semantic knowledge is useful to resolving syntactic ambiguities, and a variety of researches focus on how to utilize it.",
        "Especially in recent years, a conviction arose that semantic knowledge could be incorporated into the lexicalized parsing.",
        "Based on the lexicalized grammars, Bikel (2000) attempts at combining parsing and word sense disambiguation in a unified model, using a subset of SemCor (Miller et al., 1994).",
        "Bikel (2000) evaluates this model in a parsing context with sense information from WordNet, but does not get improvements on parsing performance.",
        "Xiong et al.",
        "(2005) combines word sense from CiLin and HowNet (two Chinese semantic resources) in a generative parsing model, which generalizes standard bilexical dependencies to word-class dependencies, and indeed help to tackle the sparseness problem in lexicalized parsing.",
        "The experiments show that the parse model combined with word sense and the most special hypernyms achieves a significant improvement on Penn Chinese Treebank.",
        "This work only considers the most special hypernym of a word, rather than other hypernyms at different levels of the hypernym-hyponym hierarchy.",
        "Then, Fujita et al.",
        "(2007) uses the Hinoki treebank as training data to train a discriminative parse selection model combining syntactic features and word sense information.",
        "Instead of utilizing the most special hypernym, the word sense information in this model is embodied with more general concepts.",
        "Based on the hand-craft sense information, this model is proved to be effective for parse selection.",
        "Recently, Agirre et al.",
        "(2008) train two lexicalized models (Charniak, 2000; Bikel, 2004) on preprocessed inputs, where content words are substituted with semantic classes from WordNet.",
        "By integrating the word semantic classes into the process of parser training directly, these two models obtain significant improvements in both parsing and prepositional phrase attachment tasks.",
        "Zhang (2008) does preliminary work on integrating POS with semantic class of words directly, which can not only alleviate the confusion in parsing, but also infer syntax and semantic information at the same time.",
        "In order to alleviate the context-free assumptions, Petrov et al.",
        "(2006) proposes a hierarchical state-split approach to refine and generalize the original grammars, and achieves state-of-the-art performance.",
        "Starting with the basic nonterminals, this method repeats the split-merge (SM) cycle to increase the complexity of grammars.",
        "That is, it splits every symbol into two, and then re-merges some new subcategories based on the likelihood computation.",
        "Splitting",
        "In each splitting stage, the previous syntactic symbol is split into two subcategories, and the EM algorithm is adopted to learn probability of the rules for these latent annotations to maximize the likelihood of trees in the training data.",
        "Finally, each symbol generates a series of new subcategories in a hierarchical fashion.",
        "With this method, the splitting strategy introduces more context information, and the refined grammars cover more linguistic information which helps resolve the syntactic ambiguities.",
        "However, it is worth noting that the EM algorithm does not guarantee a global optimal solution, and often gets stuck in a suboptimal configuration.",
        "Therefore, a good starting annotation is expected to help alleviate this problem, as well as reduce the search space for EM.",
        "It is obvious that using more derived subcategories can increase accuracy, but the refined grammars fit tighter to the training data, and may lead to over-fitting to some extent.",
        "In addition, different symbols should have their specific numbers of subcategories.",
        "For example, the comma POS tag should have only one subcategory, as it always produces the terminal comma.",
        "On the contrary, the noun POS tag and the verb POS tag are expected to have much more subcategories to express their context dependencies.",
        "Therefore, it is not reasonable to split them in the same way.",
        "The symbol merging stage is introduced to alleviate this defect.",
        "This approach splits symbols only where needed, and it is implemented by splitting each symbol first and then measure the loss in likelihood incurred when removing this subcategory.",
        "If the loss is small, it means that this subcategory does not take enough information and should be removed.",
        "In general it is hard to decide the threshold of the likelihood loss, and this merging stage is often executed by removing a certain proportion of subcategories, as well as giving priority to the most informative subcategories.",
        "By splitting and merging alternately, this method can refine the grammars step by step to mitigate the overfitting risk to some extent.",
        "However, this data-driven method can not solve this problem completely, and we need to find other external information to improve it.",
        "Analysis",
        "The hierarchical state-split approach is used to split all the symbols in the same way.",
        "Table 1 cites the subcategories for several POS tags, along with their two most frequent words.",
        "Results show that the words in the same subcategory of POS tags are semantic consistent in some cases.",

        "Since only the lemma of English words can be found in HowNet, we just annotated two kinds of POS tags \"VB\"(Verb, base form) and \"NN\"(Noun, singular or mass) with semantic knowledge, on the contrary, we annotated almost all POS tags whose corresponding words could be found in HowNet on Chinese.",
        "This might be the reason that the improvement on the English Treebank was much smaller than that of Chinese.",

        "It is hard to inspect all the grammars by hand.",
        "Since the semantic knowledge is mainly used for generating and splitting new semantic-related tags in our method, we focus on the refined subcategories of these tags.",
        "First, we examine the refined subcategories of POS tags, which are generated from the original training set and the good starting annotations respectively.",
        "Several subcategories are listed and compared in Table 5, along with their frequent words.",
        "It can be seen that the subcategories refined with semantic knowledge are more consistent than the previous one.",
        "For example, the subcategory \"PN-0\", which is refined from the original training set, produces a lot of words without semantic consistence.",
        "In contrast, we refine the subcategories \"PN-0\", \"PN-Event-0\" and \"PN-AttributeValue-2\" from the good starting annotations.",
        "Each of them produces a small but semantic consistent word set.",
        "In order to inspect the difference between the automatic splitting process and the semantic based one, we compare the numbers of subcategories refined in these two processes.",
        "Since it is hard to list all the semantic-related tags here, three parts of the semantic-related tags were selected and listed in Table 6, along with the number of their subcategories.",
        "The first part is the noun and verb related tags, which are most heavily split in both two processes.",
        "It is clear that the semantic based splitting process can generate more subcategories than the automatic one, because the semantic structures of noun and verb are sophisticated.",
        "The second part lists the tags that have much more subcategories (> 4) from the automatic splitting process than the semantic based one, and the third part vice verse.",
        "It can be seen that most of the subcategories in the second part are functional categories, while most of the subcategories in the third part are content categories.",
        "It means that the semantic based splitting process is prone to generating less subcategory for the functional categories, but more subcategories for the content categories.",

        "In this paper, we present a novel approach to integrate semantic knowledge into the hierarchical state-split process for grammar refinement, which yields better accuracies on Chinese than previous methods.",
        "The improvements are mainly owing to two aspects.",
        "Firstly, the original treebank is initialized by annotating the tag of each POS node with the most general hypernym of its terminal word, which reduces the search space for the EM algorithm and brings an initial restrict to the following splitting step.",
        "Secondly, the splitting process is supervised by a knowledge-based criterion with the new semantic-related tags.",
        "Benefitting from the hierarchical semantic knowledge, the proposed approach alleviates the overfitting risk in a knowledge-driven manner.",
        "Experimental results reveal that the semantic knowledge is of great use to syntactic disambiguation.",
        "The further analysis on the refined grammars shows that, our method tends to split the content categories more often than the baseline method and the function classes less often."
