        "Tagging is the process of labeling web resources based on their content.",
        "Each label, or tag, corresponds to a topic in a given document.",
        "Unlike metadata assigned by authors, or by professional indexers in libraries, tags are assigned by endusers for organizing and sharing information that is of interest to them.",
        "The organic system of tags assigned by all users of a given web platform is called a folksonomy.",
        "In contrast to traditional taxonomies painstakingly constructed by experts, a user can add any tags to a folksonomy.",
        "This leads to the greatest downside of tagging, inconsistency, which originates in the synonymy and polysemy of human language, as well as in the varying degrees of specificity used by taggers (Golder and Huber-man, 2006).",
        "In traditional libraries, consistency is the primary evaluation criterion of indexing (Rolling, 1981).",
        "Much work has been done on describing the statistical properties of folksono-mies, such as tag distribution and co-occurrences (Halpin et al., 2007; Sigurbjörnsson et al., 2008; Sood et al., 2007), but to our knowledge there has been none on assessing the actual quality of tags.",
        "How well do human taggers perform?",
        "How consistent are they with each other?",
        "One potential solution to inconsistency in folksonomies is to use suggestion tools that automatically compute tags for new documents (e.g. Mishne, 2006; Sood et al., 2007; Heymann et al., 2008).",
        "Interestingly, the blooming research on automatic tagging has so far not been connected to work on keyphrase extraction (e.g. Frank et al., 1999; Turney, 2003; Hulth, 2004), which can be used as a tool for the same task (note: we use tag and keyphrase as synonyms).",
        "Instead of simple heuristics based on term frequencies and co-occurrence of tags, keyphrase extraction methods apply machine learning to determine typical distributions of properties common to manually assigned phrases, and can include analysis of semantic relations between candidate tags (Turney, 2003).",
        "How well do state-of-the-art keyphrase extraction systems perform compared to simple tagging techniques?",
        "How consistent are they with human taggers?",
        "These are questions we address in this paper.",
        "Until now, keyphrase extraction methods have primarily been evaluated using a single set of keyphrases for each document, thereby largely ignoring the subjective nature of the task.",
        "Collaboratively tagged documents, on the other hand, offer multiple tag assignments by independent users, a unique basis for evaluation that we capitalize upon in this paper.",
        "The experiments reported in this paper fill these gaps in the research on automatic tagging and keyphrase extraction.",
        "First, we analyze tagging consistency on the CiteULike.org platform for organizing academic citations.",
        "Methods traditionally used for the evaluation of professional indexing will provide insight into the quality of this folksonomy.",
        "Next, we extract a high quality corpus from CiteULike, containing documents that have been tagged consistently by the best human taggers.",
        "2,100 at least 3 agreed tags j and each tagger has 2 co-taggjjii",
        "Following that, our goal is to build a system that matches the performance of these taggers.",
        "We first apply an existing approach proposed by Brooks and Montanez (2006) and compare it to the keyphrase extraction algorithm Kea (Frank et al., 1999).",
        "Next we create a new algorithm, called Maui, that enhances Kea's successful machine learning framework with semantic knowledge retrieved from Wikipedia, new features, and a new classification model.",
        "We evaluate Maui using tag sets assigned to the same documents by several users and show that it is as consistent with CiteULike users as they are with each other.",
        "Most of the computation required for automatic tagging with this method can be performed offline.",
        "In practice, it can be used as a tag suggestion tool that provides users with tags describing the main topics of newly added documents, which can then be corrected or enhanced by personal tags if required.",
        "This will improve consistency in the folksonomy without compromising its flexibility."

        "CiteULike.org is a bookmarking service that resembles the popular del.icio.us, but concentrates on scholarly papers.",
        "Rather than replicating the full text of tagged papers it simply points to them on the web (e.g. PubMed, CiteSeer, ScienceDi-rect, Amazon) or in journals (e.g. HighWire, Nature).",
        "This avoids violating copyright but means that the full text of articles is not necessarily available.",
        "When entering new resources, users are encouraged to assign tags describing their content or reflecting their own grouping of the information.",
        "However, the system does not suggest tags.",
        "Moreover, users do not see other users' tags and are thus not biased in their tag choices.",
        "The CiteULike data set is freely available and contains information about which documents were tagged with what tags by which users (although identities are not provided).",
        "CiteULike's 22,300 users have tagged 713,600 documents with 2.4M \"tag assignments\" – single applications of a tag by a user to a document.",
        "The two most popular tags, bibtex-import and no-tag, indicate an information source and a missing tag respectively.",
        "Most of the remainder describe particular concepts relevant to the documents.",
        "We exclude non-content tags from our experiments, e.g. personal tags like to-read or todo.",
        "Note that spam entries have been eliminated from the data set.",
        "Because CiteULike taggers are not professional indexers, high quality of the assigned topics cannot be guaranteed.",
        "In fact, manual assessment of users' tags by human evaluators shows precision of 59% (Mishne, 2006) and 49% (Sood et al., 2006).",
        "However, why is the opinion of human evaluators valued more than the opinion of taggers?",
        "We propose an alternative way of determining ground truth using an automatic approach to determine reliable tags: We concentrate on a subset of CiteULike containing documents that have been indexed with at least three tags on which at least two users have agreed.",
        "In order to be able to measure the tagging consistency between the users, and then compare it to the algorithm's consistency, we need taggers who have tagged documents that some others had tagged.",
        "We say that two users are \"co-taggers\" if they have both tagged at least one common document.",
        "As well as restricting the document set, we only include taggers who have at least two co-taggers.",
        "Figure 1 shows the proportions of CiteULike documents that are discarded in order to produce our high quality data set.",
        "The final set contains only 2,100 documents (0.3% of the original).",
        "Unfortunately, many of these are unavailable for download – for example, books at Amazon.com and ArXiv.org references cannot be crawled.",
        "We further restrict attention to two sources: High-Wire and Nature, both of which provide easily-accessible PDFs of the full text.",
        "The result is a set of 180 documents indexed by 332 taggers.",
        "A total of 4,638 tags were assigned by all taggers to documents in this set; however, the number of tags on which at least two users agreed is significantly smaller, namely 946.",
        "Still, this results in accurate tag sets that contain an average of five tags per document.",
        "Note that traditionally much smaller data sets are used to assess consistency of human indexers, because such sets need to be created specifically for the experiment.",
        "Collaborative tagging platforms like CiteULike can be mined for large collections of this kind in natural settings.",
        "Most documents in the extracted set relate to the area of bioinformatics.",
        "To give an example, a document entitled Initial sequencing and comparative analysis of the mouse genome was tagged by eight users with a total of 22 tags.",
        "Four of them agreed on the tag mouse, but one used the broader term rodents.",
        "Three agreed on the tag genome, but one added genome paper, and another used the more specific comparative genom-ics.",
        "There are also cases when tags are written together, e.g. genomepaper, or with a prefix key genome, or in a different grammatical form: sequence vs. sequencing.",
        "This example shows that many inconsistencies in tags are not caused by personalized tag choices as Chirita et al.",
        "(2007) suggest, but rather stem from the lack of guidelines and uniform tag suggestions that a bookmarking service could provide.",
        "Traditional indexers aim for consistency, on the basis that this will enhance document retrieval (Leonard, 1975).",
        "Consistency is measured using experiments in which several people index the same documents – usually a small set of a few dozen documents.",
        "It is computed for pairs of indexers, by formulae such as Rolling's (1981):",
        "where C is the number of tags (index terms) indexers I1 and I2 have in common and A and B is the size of their tag sets respectively.",
        "In our experiments, before computing the number of terms in common, we stem each tag with the Porter (1980) stemmer.",
        "For example, the overlap C between the tag sets {complex systems, network, small world} and {theoretical, small world, networks, dynamics} consist of the two tags { network, small world}, and the consistency is 2x2/(3+4) = 0.57.",
        "To compute the overall consistency of a particular indexer, this figure is averaged over all documents and co-indexers.",
        "There were no cases where the same user reassigned tags to the same articles, so computing intra-tagger consistency, although interesting, was not impossible.",
        "To our knowledge, traditional indexing consistency metrics have not yet been applied to collaboratively tagged data.",
        "However, experiments on determining tagging quality do follow the same idea.",
        "For example, Xu et al.",
        "(2006) define an authority metric that assigns high scores to those users who match other users' choices on the same documents, in order to eliminate spammers.",
        "In the collection of 180 documents tagged by 332 users described in Section 3.1, each tagger has 18 co-taggers on average, ranging from 2 to 129, and has indexed 1 to 25 documents.",
        "For each user we compute the consistency with all other users who tagged the same document.",
        "Consistency is then averaged across documents.",
        "We found that the distribution of peruser consistency resembles a power law with a few users achieving high consistency values and a long tail of inconsistent taggers.",
        "The maximum consistency in this group is 92.3% and the average is 18.5%.",
        "The average consistency of the most prolific 70 indexers – those who have indexed at least five documents – is in the same range, namely 18.4%.",
        "The consistency of traditional approaches to free indexing is reported to be between 4% and 67%, with an average of 27% depending on what aids are used (Leininger, 2000).",

        "It works in two stages: candidate selection and machine learning based filtering.",
        "In this paper, we apply it to automatic tagging.",
        "In the candidate selection stage, Maui first determines textual sequences defined by orthographic boundaries and splits these sequences into tokens.",
        "Then all n-grams up to a maximum length of 3 words that do not begin or end with a stop-word are extracted as candidate tags.",
        "To reduce the number of candidates, all those that appear only once are discarded.",
        "This speeds up the training and the extraction process without impacting the results.",
