        "Lexicons are invaluable resources for semantic processing.",
        "In many cases, lexicons are necessary to restrict a set of semantic classes to be assigned to a word.",
        "In fact, a considerable number of works on semantic processing implicitly or explicitly presupposes the availability of a lexicon, such as in word sense disambiguation (WSD) (McCarthy et al., 2004), and in token-level verb class disambiguation (Lapata and Brew, 2004; Girju et al., 2005; Li and Brew, 2007; Abend et al., 2008).",
        "In other words, those methods are heavily dependent on the availability of a semantic lexicon.",
        "Therefore, recent research efforts have invested in developing semantic resources, such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998), and VerbNet (Kipper et al., 2000; Kipper-Schuler, 2005), which greatly advanced research in semantic processing.",
        "However, the construction of such resources is expensive, and it is unrealistic to presuppose the availability of full-coverage lexicons; this is the case because unknown words always appear in real texts, and word-semantics associations may vary (Abend et al., 2008).",
        "This paper explores a method for the supervised learning of a probabilistic model for the VerbNet lexicon.",
        "We target the automatic classification of arbitrary verbs, including polysemous verbs, into all VerbNet classes; further, we target the estimation of a probabilistic model, which represents the saliences of verb-class associations for polyse-mous verbs.",
        "In our approach, an existing lexicon and/or an annotated corpus are used as the training data.",
        "Since VerbNet classes are designed to represent the distinctions in the syntactic frames that verbs can take, features, representing the statistics of syntactic frames, are extracted from the unan-notated corpora.",
        "Additionally, as the classes represent semantic commonalities, semantically inspired features, like distributionally similar words, are used.",
        "These features can be considered as a generalized representation of verbs, and we expect that the obtained probabilistic model predicts VerbNet classes of the unknown words.",
        "Our model is evaluated in two tasks of typelevel verb classification: one is the classification of monosemous verbs into a small subset of the classes, which was studied in some previous works (Joanis and Stevenson, 2003; Joanis et al., 2008).",
        "The other task is the classification of all verbs into the full set of VerbNet classes, which has not yet",

        "Levin's (1993) work on verb classification has broadened the field of computational research that concerns the relationships between the syntactic and semantic structures of verbs.",
        "The principal idea behind the work is that the meanings of verbs can be identified by observing possible syntactic frames that the verbs can take.",
        "In other words, with the knowledge of syntactic frames, verbs can be semantically classified.",
        "This idea provided the computational linguistics community with criteria for the definition and the classification of verb semantics; it has subsequently resulted in the research of the induction of verb classes (Korhonen and Briscoe, 2004), and the construction of a verb lexicon based on Levin's criteria.",
        "VerbNet (Kipper et al., 2000; Kipper-Schuler, 2005) is a lexicon of verbs organized into classes that share the same syntactic behaviors and semantics.",
        "The design of classes originates from Levin (1993), though the design has been considerably reorganized and extends beyond the original classification.",
        "The classes therefore cover more English verbs, and the classification should be more consistent (Korhonen and Briscoe, 2004; Kipper et al., 2006).",

        "Theme corresponds to \"the coins\" V to \"jangled\" P:loc to \"in,\" and Location to \"mypocket\"",
        "While VerbNet provides associations between verbs and semantic classes, SemLink (Loper et al., 2007) additionally provides mappings among VerbNet, FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998), PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005), and WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "Since FrameNet and PropBank include annotated instances of sentences, SemLink can be considered as a corpus annotated with VerbNet classes.",
        "Figure 3 presents some annotated sentences obtained from SemLink.",
        "For example, the annotation \"blared;VN=43.2\" indicates that the occurrence of \"blare\" in this context is classified as Sound Emission.",
        "There has been much research effort invested in the automatic classification of verbs into lexical semantic classes, in a supervised or unsupervised way.",
        "The present work inherits the spirit of the supervised approaches to verb classification (Stevenson et al., 1999; Stevenson and Merlo, 1999; Merlo and Stevenson, 2001; Stevenson and Joanis, 2003; Joanis and Stevenson, 2003; Joanis et al., 2008).",
        "Our learning framework basically follows the above listed works: features are obtained from an unannotated (automatically parsed) corpus, and gold verb-class associations are used as training instances for machine learning classifiers, such as decision trees and support vector machines.",
        "However, those works targeted a small subset of Levin classes, and a limited number of monosemous verbs; for example, Merlo and Stevenson (2001) studied three classes and 59 verbs, and Joanis et al.",
        "(2008) focused on 14 classes and 835 verbs.",
        "Although these works provided a theoretical framework for supervised verb classification, their results were not readily available for practical applications, because of the limitation in the coverage of the targeted classes/verbs on real texts.",
        "On the contrary, we target the classification of arbitrary verbs, including polysemous verbs, into all VerbNet classes (270 in total).",
        "In this realistic situation, we will empirically compare settings for model learning, in order to explore effective conditions to obtain better models.",
        "Another difference from the aforementioned works is that we aim at obtaining a probabilistic model, which represents saliences of classes of polysemous verbs.",
        "Lapata and Brew (2004) and Li and Brew (2007) focused on this issue, and described methods for inducing probabilities of verb-class associations.",
        "The obtained probabilistic model was intended to be incorporated into a token-level disambiguation model.",
        "Their methods claimed to be unsupervised, meaning that the induction of a probabilistic lexicon did not require any hand-annotated corpora.",
        "In fact, however, their methods relied on the existence of a full-coverage lexicon, both in training and running time.",
        "In their methods, a lexicon was necessary for restricting possible classes to which each word belongs.",
        "Since most verbs are associated with only a couple of classes, such a restriction significantly reduces the search space, and the problem becomes much easier to solve.",
        "This presupposition is implicitly or explicitly used in other semantic disambiguation tasks (McCarthy et al., 2004), but it is unrealistic for practical applications.",
        "Clustering methods have also been extensively researched for verb classification (Stevenson and 2001; Korhonen, 2002; Korhonen et al., 2003; Schulte im Walde, 2003).",
        "The extensive research is in large part due to the intuition that the set of classes could not be fixed beforehand.",
        "In particular, it is often problematic to define a static set of semantic classes.",
        "However, it is reasonable to assume that the set of VerbNet classes is fixed, because Levin-type classes are more static than ontological classes, like in WordNet synsets.",
        "Therefore, we can apply supervised classification methods to our task.",
        "It is true that the current VerbNet classes are imperfect and require revisions, but in this work we adopt them as they are, because as time advances, more stable classifications will become available.",
        "The problem focused in this work has a close relationship with automatic thesaurus/ontology expansion.",
        "In fact, we evaluate our method in the task of automatic verb classification, which can be considered as lexicon expansion.",
        "The most prominent difference of the present work from thesaurus/ontology expansion is that the number of classes is much smaller in our problem, and the set of verb classes can be assumed to be fixed.",
        "These characteristics indicate that our problem is easier and more well-defined than is the case for automatic thesaurus/ontology expansion.",
        "Supervised approaches to token-level verb class disambiguation have recently been addressed (Girju et al., 2005; Abend et al., 2008), largely owing to SemLink.",
        "Their approaches fundamentally follow traditional supervised WSD methods: extracting features representing the context in which the target word appears, and training a classification model with an annotated corpus.",
        "While those works achieved an impressive accuracy (more than 95%), the results may not necessarily indicate the method's effectiveness; rather, it may imply the importance of a lexicon.",
        "In fact, these works restrict their target to verb tokens, in which the correct class exists in a given lexicon, and they only consider candidate classes that are registered in the lexicon.",
        "This setting reduces the ambiguity significantly, and the problem becomes much easier to handle; for example, approximately half of verb tokens are monosemous in their setting.",
        "Thus, a simple baseline achieves very high accuracy figures.",
        "However, in our preliminary experiment on token-level verb classification with unknown verbs, we found that the accuracy for unknown verbs (i.e., lemmas not included in the VerbNet lexicon) is catastrophically low.",
        "This indicates that VerbNet and SemLink are insufficient for unknown verbs, and that we cannot expect the availability of a full-coverage lexicon in the real world.",
        "Instead of a static lexicon, our probabilistic model is intended to be used as a prior distribution for the token-level disambiguation, as in Lapata and Brew (2004)'s model."
