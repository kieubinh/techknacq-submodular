        "For speakers of a language whose nouns have no gender (such as modern English), making the leap to a language that does (such as German), does not come easy.",
        "With no or few rules or heuristics to guide him, the language learner will try to draw on the \"obvious\" parallel between grammatical and natural gender, and will be immediately baffled to learn that girl - Mädchen - is neuter in German.",
        "Furthermore, one may refer to the same object using words with different gender: car can be called (das) Auto (neuter) or (der) Wägen (masculine).",
        "Imagine that after hard work, the speaker has mastered gender in German, and now wishes to proceed with a Romance language, for example Italian or Spanish.",
        "He is now confronted with the task of relearning to assign gender in these new languages, made more complex by the fact that gender does not match across languages: e.g. sun - feminine in German (die Sonne), but masculine in Spanish (el sol), Italian (il sole) and French (le soleil); moon - masculine in German (der Mond), but feminine in Spanish (lä lunä), Italian (lä lunä) and French (la lune).",
        "Gender doesn't even match within a single language family: travel - masculine in Spanish (el viage) and Italian (il viaggio), but feminine in Portuguese (a viagem).",
        "Grammatical gender groups nouns in a language into distinct classes.",
        "There are languages whose nouns are grouped into more or less than three classes.",
        "English for example has none, and makes no distinction based on gender, although Old English did have three genders and some traces remain (e.g. blonde, blond).",
        "Linguists assume several sources for gender: (i) a first set of nouns which have natural gender and which have associated matching grammatical gender; (ii) nouns that resemble (somehow) the nouns in the first set, and acquire their grammatical gender through this resemblance.",
        "Italian and Romanian, for example, have strong and reliable phonological correlates (Vigliocco et al., 2004b, for Italian).",
        "(Doca, 2000, for Romanian).",
        "In Romanian the majority of feminine nouns end in a or e. Some rules exists for German as well (Schumann, 2006), for example nouns ending in -tat, -ung, -e, -enz, -ur, -keit, in tend to be feminine.",
        "Also, when specific morphological processes apply, there are rules that dictate the gender of the newly formed word.",
        "This process explains why Frau (woman) is feminine in German, while Fraulein (little woman, miss) is neuter - Fmulein = Frau + lein.",
        "The existing rules have exceptions, and there are numerous nouns in the language which are not derived, and such suffixes do not apply.",
        "Words are names used to refer to concepts.",
        "The fact that the same concept can be referred to using names that have different gender - as is the case for c r in German - indicates that at least in some cases, grammatical gender is in the name and not the concept.",

        "This supplements the situation when some concepts have natural gender that matches their grammatical gender: it allows for an explanation where there is no such match, either directly perceived, or induced through literary devices.",
        "The present research has both theoretical and practical benefits.",
        "From a theoretical point of view, it contributes to research on phonology and gender, in particular in going a step further in understating the link between the two.",
        "From a practical perspective, such a connection between gender and sounds could be exploited in advertising, in particular in product naming, to build names that fit a product, and which are appealing to the desired customers.",
        "Studies have shown that especially in the absence of meaning, the form of a word can be used to generate specific associations and stimulate the imagination of prospective customers (Sells and Gonzales, 2003; Bedgley, 2002;",
        "What is the origin of grammatical gender and how does it relate to natural gender?",
        "Opinions are split.",
        "Historically, there were two main, opposite, views: (i) there is a semantic explanation, and natural gender motivated the category (ii) the relationship between natural and grammatical gender is arbitrary.",
        "Grimm (1890) considered that grammatical gender is an extension of natural gender brought on by imagination.",
        "Each gender is associated with particular adjectives or other attributes, and in some cases (such as for sun and moon) the assignment of gender is based on personification.",
        "Brug-mann (1889) and Bloomfield (1933) took the position that the mapping of nouns into genders is arbitrary, and other phenomena - such as derivations, personification - are secondary to the established agreement.",
        "Support for this second view comes also from language acquisition: children who learn a gendered language do not have a natural gender attribute that they try to match onto the newly acquired words, but learn these in a separate process.",
        "Any match or mapping between natural and grammatical gender is done after the natural gender \"feature\" is acquired itself.",
        "Kilarski (2007) presents a more detailed overview of currents and ideas about the origin of gender.",
        "Unterbeck (1999) contains a collection of papers that investigate grammatical gender in several languages, aspects of gender acquisition and its relation with grammatical number and agreement.",
        "There may be several reasons for the polemic between these two sides.",
        "One may come from the categorization process, the other from the relation between word form and its meaning.",
        "Let us take them each in turn, and see how they influenced gender.",
        "Grammatical gender separates the nouns in a language into disjoint classes.",
        "As such, it is a categorization process.",
        "The traditional - classical theory of categorization and concepts viewed categories and concepts as defined in terms of a set of common properties that all its members should share.",
        "Recent theories of concepts have changed, and view concepts (and categories) not necessarily as \"monolithic\" and defined through rules, but rather as clusters of members that may resemble each other along different dimensions (Margolis and Laurence, 1999).",
        "In most linguistic circles, the principle of arbitrariness of the association between form and meaning, formalized by de Saussure (1916) has been largely taken for granted.",
        "It seems however, that it is hard to accept such an arbitrary relation, as there have always been contestants of this principle, some more categorical than others (Jakob-son, 1937; Jespersen, 1922; Firth, 1951).",
        "Itispos-sible that the correlation we perceive between the word form and the meaning is something that has arisen after the word was coined in a language, being the result of what Firth called \"phonetic habit\" through \"an attunement of the nervous system\", and that we have come to prefer, or select, certain word forms as more appropriate to the concept they name - \"There is no denying that there are words which we feel instinctively to be adequate to express the ideas they stand for.",
        "... Sound symbolism, we may say, makes some words more fit to survive\" (Jespersen, 1922).",
        "These two principles relate to the discussion on gender in the following manner: First of all, the categories determined by grammatical gender need not be homogeneous, and their members need not all respect the same membership criterion.",
        "This frees us from imposing a matching between natural and grammatical gender where no such relation is obvious or possible through literary devices (personification, metaphor, metonymy).",
        "Nouns belonging to the same gender category may resemble each other because ofsemantic considerations, lexical derivations, internal structure, perceived associations and so on.",
        "Second, the fact that we allow for the possibility that the surface form of a word may encode certain word characteristics or attributes, allows us to hypothesize that there is a surface, phonological, similarity between words grouped within the same gender category, that can supplement other resemblance criteria in the gender category (Zubin and Kopcke, 1986).",
        "Zubin and Kopcke (1981), Zubin and Kopcke (1986) have studied the relation between semantic characteristics and word form with respect to gender for German nouns.",
        "Their study was motivated by two observations: Zipf (1935) showed that word length is inversely correlated with frequency of usage, and Brown (1958) proposed that in choosing a name for a given object we are more likely to use a term corresponding to a \"basic\" level concept.",
        "For example, chair, dog, apple would correspond to the basic level, while furniture, animal, fruit and recliner, collie, braeburn pple correspond to a more general or a more specific level, respectively.",
        "Their study of gender relative to these levels have shown that basic level terms have masculine, feminine, and rarely neuter genders, while the more undifferentiated categories at the superordinate level are almost exclusively neuter.",
        "In psycholinguistic research, Friederici and Jacobsen (1999) adopt the position that a lexical entry consists of two levels: form and semantic and grammatical properties to study the influence of gender priming - both from a form and semantic perspective - on language comprehension.",

        "(2004a) study gender priming for German word production.",
        "While this research studies the influence of the word form on the production of nouns with the same or different grammatical gender, there is no study of the relation between word forms and their corresponding gender.",
        "In recent studies we have found on the relation between word form and its associated gender, the only phonological component of a word that is considered indicative is the ending.",

        "Cucerzan and Yarowsky (2003) present a bootstrapping process to predict gender for nouns in context.",
        "They show that context gives accurate clues to gender (in particular through determiners, quantifiers, adjectives), but when the context is not useful, the algorithm can fall back successfully on the word form.",
        "Cucerzan and Yarowsky model the word form for predicting gender using suffix trie models.",
        "When a new word is encountered, the word is mapped onto the trie starting from the last letter, and it is assigned the gender that has the highest probability based on the path it matches in the trie.",
        "In context nouns appear with various inflections - for number and case in particular.",
        "Such morphological derivations are gender specific, and as such are strong indicators for gender.",
        "The hypothesis tested here is that gender comes from the general sound of the language, and is distributed throughout the word.",
        "For this, the data used should not contain nouns with \"tell tale\" inflections.",
        "The data will therefore consist of nouns in the singular form, nominative case.",
        "Some nouns are derived from verbs, adverbs or adjectives, or other nouns through morphological derivations.",
        "These derivations are regular and are identifiable through a rather small number of regular suffixes.",
        "These suffixes (when they are indicative of gender) and word endings will be used as baselines to compare the accuracy of prediction on the full word with the ending fragment.",
        "We test our gender-language sounds connection through two languages from different language families.",

        "This is not the case, and the improvement over the random baseline is 32% points.",
        "It is interesting to notice that when cutting off the last letter the class for which the gender assignment heuristic was clearest - the feminine class with -ä and e endings - the performance remains very high -85% F-score.",
        "To further test where the gender indicators are located, we performed two more sets of experiments: (i) classify words in their corresponding gender class using the word minus the last N letters; (ii) classify words based on the last N letters.",
        "The results of these experiments in terms of accuracy are presented in Figure 1.",
        "When considering only the last N letters the performance is high for both German and Romanian, as expected if the gender indicators are concentrated at the end of the word.",
        "It is interesting though to notice the results of classification based on the word without the last N letters.",
        "The prediction accuracy monotonically decreases, but remains above the baseline until more than 6 letters are cut.",
        "Because as letters are cut some words completely disappear, the baseline changes accordingly.",
        "94.07% of the words have a length of at most 12 letters in the Romanian dataset, and 96.07% in the German one.",
        "Because gender prediction can be done with accuracy higher than the random baseline even after 6 letters are cut from the ending of the word indicate that for more than 94% of the words considered, gender clues are spread over more than the second half of the word.",
        "Again, we remind the reader that the word forms are in nominative case, with no case or number inflections (which are strong indicators of gender in both Romanian and German).",
        "Except for lines KRR – SKhowb, the results in Table 3 are obtained through experiments conducted on words containing word boundary markers, as indicated in Section 4.",
        "Because of these markers, word starting or word ending substrings are distinct from all the others, and information about their position in the original word is thus preserved.",
        "To further explore the idea that gender indicators are not located only in word endings, we ran classification experiments for German and Romanian when the word representation does not contain word boundary markers.",
        "This means that the substrings generated by the string kernel have no position information.",
        "The results of these experiments are presented in rows KRR – SKnowb in Table 3.",
        "The accuracy is slightly lower than the best results obtained when word boundaries are marked and the entire word form is used.",
        "However, they are well above all the baselines considered, without no information about word endings.",
        "For both German and Romanian, the gender that was learned best was feminine.",
        "For German part of this effect is due to the fact that the feminine class is more numerous in the data.",
        "For Romanian the data was perfectly balanced, so there is no such bias.",
        "Neuter and masculine nouns have lower learning performance.",
        "For Romanian, a contribution to this effect is the fact that neuter nouns behave as masculine nouns in their singular form (take the same articles, inflections, derivations), but as feminine in the plural, and our data consists of nouns in singular form.",
        "It would seem that from an orthographic point of view, neuter and masculine nouns are closer to each other than to feminine nouns.",
        "From the reviewed related work, the one that uses the word form to determine gender is Cucerzan and Yarowsky (2003) for Romanian.",
        "There are two important differences with respect to the approach presented here.",
        "First, they consider words in context, which are inflected for number and case.",
        "Number and case inflections are reflected in suffixes that are gender specific.",
        "The words considered here are in singular form, nominative case - as such, with no inflections.",
        "Second, Cucerzan and Yarowsky consider two classes: feminine vs. masculine and neuter.",
        "Masculine and neuter nouns are harder to distinguish, as in singular form neuter nouns behave like masculine nouns in Romanian.",
        "While the datasets and word forms used by Cucerzan and Yarowsky are different than the one used here, the reader may be curious how well the word form distinguishes between feminine and the other two classes in the experimental set-up used here.",
        "On the fullRomanian dataset described in Section 3, a two class classification gives 99.17% accuracy.",
        "When predicting gender for all words in their dataset, Cucerzan and Yarowsky obtain 98.25% accuracy."

        "When a speaker of a genderless language tries to learn a language with grammatical gender, it is very tempting to try to assign grammatical gender based on perceived or guessed natural gender types.",
        "This does not work out well, and it only serves to confuse the learner even more, when he finds out that nouns expressing concepts with clear feminine or masculine natural gender will have the opposite or a neutral grammatical gender, or that one concept can be referred to through names that have different grammatical genders.",
        "Going with the flow of the language seems to be a better idea, and allow the sound of a word to dictate the gender.",
        "In this paper we have investigated the hypothesis that gender is encoded in the word form, and this encoding is more than just the word endings as it is commonly believed.",
        "The results obtained show that gender assignment based on word form analysis can be done with high accuracy - 72.36% for German, and 78.83% for Romanian.",
        "Existing gender assignment rules based on word endings have lower accuracy.",
        "We have further strengthened the point by conducting experiments on Romanian nouns without tell-tale word endings.",
        "The accuracy remains high, with remarkably high performance in terms of F-score for the feminine class (85%).",
        "This leads us to believe that gender information is somehow redundantly coded in a word.",
        "We plan to look closer at cases where we obtain different predictions based on the word ending and the full form of the word, and use boosting to learn weights for classifiers based on different parts of the word to see whether we can further improve the results.",
        "As we have underlined before, word form similarity between words under the same gender is one criterion for gender assignment.",
        "It would be interesting to verify whether gender recognition can be boosted by using lexical resources that capture the semantics of the words, such as WordNets or knowledge extracted from Wikipedia, and verify whether similarities from a semantic point of view are also responsible for gender assignments in various languages."
