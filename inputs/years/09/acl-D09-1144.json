        "There are many debates in lexical semantics about what kind of world knowledge actually belongs to the meaning of a lexeme.",
        "Nowadays, it is widely accepted that predicates impose selectional restrictions on their arguments.",
        "For example, since we know that the predicate to be hungry mainly takes expressions describing animate beings as arguments, we can correctly resolve the anaphora in the following sentence: We gave the bananas to the monkeys because they were hungry.",
        "There exists also multiple linguistic evidence showing that the semantics of arguments can help to predict implicit predicates.",
        "For example, the sentence John finished the cigarette usually means John finished smoking the cigarette because the meaning of the noun cigarette is strongly associated with the smoking activity.",
        "It has been claimed that information about predicates associated with nouns can be helpful for a variety of tasks in natural language processing (NLP), see for example (Pustejovsky et al., 1993; Voorhees, 1994).",
        "However, at present there exists no corresponding lexical semantic resource.",
        "Several approaches have been presented that aim at creating a knowledge base containing noun-verb relations.",
        "There are two main research paradigms for developing such knowledge bases.",
        "The first paradigm assumes manual development of the resource (Pustejovsky et al., 2006), while the second one relies on automatic acquisition methods, see for example (Cimiano and Wenderoth, 2007).",
        "In this paper we propose a procedure for automatic acquisition of argument-predicate relations from a semantically annotated corpus.",
        "In line with (Lapata and Lascarides, 2003) our approach is based on the assumption that predicates are omitted in a discourse when they are highly predictable from the semantics of their arguments.",
        "We exploit SALSA (Burchardt et al., 2006), a German newspaper corpus manually annotated with FrameNet frames based on frame semantics.",
        "Using a manually annotated corpus for relation extraction has one particular advantage compared to extraction from plain text: the type of an argument-predicate relation is already annotated; there is no need to determine it by automatic means which are usually error-prone.",
        "However, the relatively small size of SALSA does not allow to make relevant predictions about the degree of semantic relatedness in the extracted argument-predicate pairs, see section 4.",
        "We therefore employ a considerably larger unannotated corpus for weighting.",
        "The results are evaluated quantitatively against human judgments obtained experimentally.",
        "The proposed evaluation procedure is similar to that presented in (Cimiano and Wenderoth, 2007).",
        "First, we create a gold standard for 30 words from the argument list and evaluate our approach with respect to this",

        "Sections 4 discusses the SALSA corpus.",

        "As in the previous examples, a predicate is left out in (1d).",
        "The meaning of the preposition über 'about' can help to narrow down the set of possible predicates, but still allows an inadequately large range of interpretations.",
        "However, the semantics of the noun Nachrichtenagentur news agency supports such interpretations as berichten to report or informieren to inform .",
        "Most of the literature discusses predicates inferable from nouns.",
        "However, other parts of speech can support similar inferences.",
        "In example (1e) a predicate is predictable on the basis of the meaning of the adjective beredt eloquent .",
        "The sentence (1e) most plausibly means that Hans speaks eloquently.",
        "Example 1 shows that knowledge about predicates associated with explicitly given arguments can help to deal with several linguistic phenomena.",
        "The cases when a predictable predicate is left out are not rare in natural language.",

        "From these tuples we generated short grammatically correct phrases structurally similar to those in example 3.",
        "These phrases were uniformly distributed among 10 subjects so that every phrase was evaluated by one subject.",
        "The participants were asked to rate the phrases with respect to their naturalness using a scale from 0 to 3, whereby 0 means 'unnatural', 1 'possible', 2 'natural' and 3 'totally natural and self-evident'.",

        "In this paper we presented an approach to automatic extraction of argument-predicate relations from a frame-annotated corpus.",
        "In our approach we aimed to combine the advantages offered by annotated and unannotated lexical resources.",
        "Besides extracting AP-pairs the proposed method allows us to define types of semantic relations in terms of FrameNet frames.",
        "The proposed procedure is not restricted to arguments expressed by nouns and treats also other content parts of speech.",
        "The main goal of this paper was to show that though manually annotated corpora usually have a relatively small size, they can be successfully exploited for the relation extraction.",
        "An obvious limitation of the presented approach is that it is bounded to manual annotations which are hard to obtain.",
        "However, since semantic annotations are useful for many different goals in linguistics and NLP, the number of reliable annotated corpora constantly grows.",
        "Moreover, recently several tools have been developed which perform role annotation automatically, for example see (Erk and Pado, 2006).",
        "Therefore we believe that approaches using semantic annotation are valid and promising.",
        "In the future we plan to experiment with large role-annotated corpora for English such as PropBank (approx.",
        "300 000 words, (Palmer et al., 2005)) and the FrameNet-annotated corpus provided by the FN project (more than 135 000 annotated sentences, (Ruppenhofer et al., 2006)).",
        "Since these corpora do not contain syntactic annotation, for extracting argument-predicate relations we will need to parse annotated sentences.",
        "There are several ways to improve the proposed procedure.",
        "First, an implementation of a more advanced anaphora resolution algorithm treating pronominal as well as nominal anaphora should significantly raise the precision/recall characteristics.",
        "Second, splitting German compounds occurring in the corpus should provide additional evidence.",

        "The presented procedure was evaluated quantitatively against human judgments obtained experimentally.",

        "Nevertheless, the described learning procedure proved to extract intuitively reasonable relations.",
        "The evaluation strategy presented in this paper on relies on the underlying assumptions (A1 and A2 in section 5) and is compatible with the other approaches to relation extraction, cf. (Cimi-ano and Wenderoth, 2007).",
        "However, it is plausible that human responses in the context of providing associated predicates for target words will differ from the responses in the experimental settings where subjects are asked to infer implicit predicates, e.g. to extend phrases containing implicit predicates.",
        "In the future we plan to implement a procedure making use of the extracted AP-relations which would automatically extend phrases containing implicit predicates.",
        "Then we intend to compare output results of the procedure with the human responses.",
        "Additionally, a study of a possible correspondence between human agreement on associated predicates and a semantic type of an argument (e.g. concrete/abstract, natural kind/artifact) should be performed on more test arguments.",
        "Potential Applications",
        "As already mentioned in the literature, see for example (Lapata and Lascarides, 2003), knowledge about implicit predicates could be potentially useful for a variety of NLP tasks such as language generation, information extraction, question answering or machine translation.",
        "Many applications of semantic relations in NLP are connected to paraphrasing or query expansion, see for example (Voorhees, 1994).",
        "Suppose that a search engine or a question answering system receives the query schnelle Bombe 'quick bomb'.",
        "Probably, in this case the user is interested in finding information about bombs that explode quickly rather then about bombs in general.",
        "Knowledge about predicates associated with the noun Bombe 'bomb' could be used for predicting a set ofprob-able implicit predicates.",
        "For generation of the semantically and syntactically correct paraphrases it is sometimes not enough to guess the most probable argument-predicate pairs.",
        "Information about types of an argument-predicate relation could be helpful, i.e. which semantic and syntactic position does the argument fill in the argument structure of the predicate.",
        "For example, compare eine Bombe explodiert schnell 'a bomb explodes quickly' for schnelle Bombe with ein Buch schnell lesen/schreiben 'to read/write a book quickly' for schnelles Buch 'quick book'.",
        "In the first case the argument Bombe fills the subject position, while in the second case Buch fills the object position.",
        "Since FrameNet contains information about syntactic realization patterns for frame elements, representation of argument-predicate relations in terms of frames directly supports generation of semantically and syntactically correct paraphrases.",
        "The described procedure could also support manual development of a lexical resource, providing evidence from corpora as well as the distributional information."
