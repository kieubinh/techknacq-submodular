        "We experimented both with the stemmed and non-stemmed versions of this feature type.",
        "The non-stemmed versions performed slightly better than the stemmed versions.",
        "The reason might be due to the different likelihoods of being used in a speculative context of different inflected forms of words.",
        "For example, consider the words \"appears\" and \"appearance\".",
        "They have the same stems, but \"appearance\" is less likely to be a real speculation keyword than \"appears\".",
        "Another observation is that, decreasing the window size led to improvement in performance.",
        "This suggests that the words right before and right after the candidate speculation keyword are more effective in distinguishing its speculative vs. non-speculative context compared to a wider local context.",
