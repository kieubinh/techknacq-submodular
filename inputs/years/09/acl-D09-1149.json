        "Information Extraction (IE) is such a technology that IE systems are expected to identify relevant information (usually of predefined types) from text documents in a certain domain and put them in a structured format.",
        "According to the scope of the NIST Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) program (ACE, 20002007), current research in IE has three main objectives: Entity Detection and Tracking (EDT), Relation Detection and Characterization (RDC), and Event Detection and Characterization (EDC).",
        "This paper focuses on the ACE RDC subtask, where many machine learning methods have been proposed, including supervised methods 2005).",
        "Current work on semantic relation extraction task mainly uses supervised learning methods, since it achieves relatively better performance.",
        "However this method requires a large amount of manually labeled relation instances, which is both time-consuming and laborious.",
        "In the contrast, unsupervised methods do not need definitions of relation types and hand-tagged data, but it is difficult to evaluate their performance since there are no criteria for evaluation.",
        "Therefore, semi-supervised learning has received more and more attention, as it can balance the advantages and disadvantages between supervised and unsupervised methods.",
        "With the plenitude of unlabeled natural language data at hand, semi-supervised learning can significantly reduce the need for labeled data with only limited sacrifice in performance.",
        "Specifically, a bootstrapping algorithm chooses the unlabeled instances with the highest probability of being correctly labeled and use them to augment labeled training data iteratively.",
        "Although previous work (Yarowsky, 1995; 2004) has tackled the bootstrapping approach from both the theoretical and practical point of view, many key problems still remain unresolved, such as the selection of initial seed set.",
        "Since the size of the initial seed set is usually small (e.g.",

        "Nevertheless, the initial labeled data is still randomly generated only to ensure that there are at least 5 instances for every relation subtype.",
        "This paper presents a new approach to selecting the initial seed set based on stratified sampling strategy in the bootstrapping procedure for semi-supervised semantic relation classification.",
        "The motivation behind the stratified sampling is that every relation type should be as much as possible represented in the initial seed set, thus leading to more instances with diverse structures being added to the labeled set.",
        "In addition, we also explore different strategies to augment reliably classified instances to the labeled data iteratively, and attempt to find a stoppage criterion for the iteration procedure to greatly decrease the training time, other than using up all the unlabeled set.",

        "Due to the lack of comparability followed from the different size of the labeled data used in (Zhou et al., 2008), we omit their results here.",
        "This table shows that our stratified bootstrapping procedure significantly outperforms both Bootproject and Label Propagation methods on the ACE RDC corpus, with the increase of 5.9/4.1 units in F-score on average respectively.",
        "Stratified bootstrapping consistently outperforms Bootproject in every major relation type, while it outperforms Label Propagation in three of the major relation types, especially SOC type, with the exception of AT and NEAR types.",
        "The reasons may be follows.",
        "Although there are many AT relation instances in the corpus, they are scattered divergently in multi-dimension space so that they tend to be relatively difficult to be recognized via SVM.",
        "For the NEAR relation instances, they occur least frequently in the whole corpus, so it is very hard for them to be identified via SVM.",
        "By contrast, even small size of labeled instances can be fully utilized to correctly induce the unlabeled instances via LP algorithm due to its ability to exploit manifold structures of both labeled and unlabeled instances (Chen et al., 2006).",
        "In general, these results again suggest that the sampling strategy in selecting the initial seed set plays a critical role for relation classification, and stratified sampling can significantly improve the performance due to proper selection of the initial seed set."

        "However, the augmentation of the labeled data using the stratified strategy fails to function effectively largely due to the unbalanced distribution of the confidently classified instances, rather than the stratified sampling strategy itself.",
