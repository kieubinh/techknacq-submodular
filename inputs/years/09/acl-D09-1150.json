        "Despite the increased focus on analysis of web content, there has been limited emotion analysis of web contents, with the majority of studies focusing on sentiment analysis or opinion mining.",
        "Classifying the mood of a single text is a hard task; state-of-the-art methods in text classification achieve only modest performance in this domain (Mishne, 2005).",
        "In this area, some of the hardest problems involve acquiring basic resources.",
        "Corpora are fundamental both for developing sound conceptual analyses and for training these emotion-oriented systems at different levels: to recognize emotions, to express appropriate emotions, to anticipate emotions, and other emotion processing applications.",
        "In this study we propose a relatively finegrained annotation scheme, annotating emotion in text at three levels: document, paragraph, and sentence.",
        "We select eight emotion classes (expect, joy, love, surprise, anxiety, sorrow, angry and hate) for this annotation, and explore various linguistic expressions that indicate emotion in Chinese.",
        "The annotation scheme has been employed in the manual annotation of a corpus containing 1,487 documents, with 11,255 paragraphs, 35,096 sentences, and 878,164 Chinese words.",
        "Then, using this corpus, we explore and present data analyses on emotions, involving emotion states, accompanying emotions, transfer emotions, independent emotions in texts.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",

        "Two merits let them well accepted as emotion corpora: a large number of weblogs contained and moods annotated by blog users.",
        "However, there is a great inconsistency on emotion categories given by different websites.",
        "Livejournal gives a predefined list of 132 common moods, while Yahoo !",
        "'s Chinese news provides readers 8 emotion categories.",
        "Too many mood classes may confuse users, and Mishne (2005) also pointed out one obvious drawback of the mood \"annotation\" in this corpora is that they are not provided in a consistent manner; the blog writers differ greatly from each other, and their definitions of moods differ accordingly.",
        "In addition, some words are not fitted to be taken as emotion classes, such as \"useful\" in Yahoo !",
        "'s emotion categories.",
        "These corpora may be helpful for analyzing the global moods on a full text, but the inconsistent emotion categories is a problem, and no more labeled information can be exploited from them.",
        "The emotion analysis on sentence level may also be important for more detailed emotion analysis systems.",
        "Aim, Roth, et al.",
        "(2005) explore the text-based emotion prediction problem; they annotated a corpus of 22 Grimms ' tales on sentence level with eight emotion categories (angry, disgusted, fearful, happy, sad, positively surprised, negatively surprised), contain 1580 sentences.",
        "Neviarouskaya, Prendinger et al.",
        "(2007) address the tasks of recognition and interpretation of affect communicated through text messaging.",
        "They collected 160 sentences labeled with one of nine emotions categories (anger, disgust, fear, guilt, interest, joy, sadness, shame, and surprise) from a corpus of online diary-like blog posts and a corresponding intensity value.",
        "Aman and Szpakowicz (2007) classify emotional and non-emotional sentences based on a knowledge-based approach.",
        "They used a corpus with tags of emotion category, emotion intensity and the words/phrases that indicate emotion in text.",
        "An emotion corpus for Japanese was built for recognizing emotions and emotion estimation (Ren, 2009; Matsumoto, 2006).",
        "However, the sizes of these corpora seem not enough for large scale textual emotion analysis, a lot of linguistic features are not reflected from them.",
        "A more fine-grained opinion and emotion corpus is the MPQA Corpus (Wiebe, Wilson, et al., 2005), which contains 535 news articles (10,000-sentence) from a wide variety of news sources, manually annotated at the sentential and subsentential level for opinions and other private states.",
        "But emotion categories are not included in it.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, at present, there's no relatively large corpora annotated with detailed linguistic expressions for emotion in Chinese, and we believe that such corpora would support the development and evaluation of emotion analysis systems."

        "In this study we proposed an emotional expression space model.",
        "Emotion of a document, a paragraph, a sentence, or even a word is represented by an emotional vector.",
        "Based on this model, we described a relatively fine-grained annotation scheme and annotated emotion in text.",
        "We also gave the inter-annotator agreement study on annotation.",
        "Then, we explore the emotional expressions in texts.",
        "This annotated dataset can be obtained for free with license .",
        "Eleven annotators made efforts on it spanning a period of ten months (They are Ph.D and M.S.",
        "candidates specialize in Natural Language Processing and Emotion Analysis).",
        "To ensure the quality of this dataset, each document was performed a three pass annotation, in which the first pass is annotated by one annotator and then the second and the third verification pass were performed by other two annotators.",
        "The process of this corpus annotation is easy to make mistakes because of a lot of information should be annotated.",
        "The verification pass is to check the annotation mistakes (such as the start and end positions of emotional phrases in sentences), but not to change the choices of emotion classes or emotional words which had been annotated by other annotators.",
        "Using this corpus, we will make a more extensive study of textual emotion analysis in Chinese, for example, the influence of degree words, negative words, or other elements on emotional expression; the difference between subjective emotion and objective emotion; emotion transfer tracking.",
        "More applications also will be explored, such as emotional summarization, emotional question answering; emotional topic discovering.",
        "At the same time, new research problems will arise, for examples, how to acquiring more emotional words and to generate their emotional vectors automatically; how to generate emotional vectors for sentences, paragraphs and documents with known emotional elements in them?",
        "There is need to immerge further into these problems."
