        "It has long been a goal of the natural language processing (NLP) community to be able to interpret language utterances into logical representations of their meaning.",
        "Quantifier scope ambiguity has been recognized as one particularly challenging aspect of this problem.",
        "For example, the following sentence has two possible readings, depending on the scope of its quantifiers:",
        "Every boy wants a dog.",
        "One reading of this sentence is that there exists a single dog in the world which all boys want.",
        "The second, and usually preferred, reading is that the sentence is describing a separate \"wanting\" relation for each boy, and that the dog in question is a function of the boy who wants it.",
        "In this reading, there may be as many different dogs as boys, although it leaves open the possibility that several of the boys want the same dog.",
        "In logic, these two readings can be represented as follows:",

        "VbeBoys ^deDogs wants(6,d) Alexander Yates",
        "Temple University 1805 N. Broad St.",
        "The readings differ only in the order of the quantifiers.",
        "The quantifier that comes first in each expression is said to have wide scope; the second quantifier has narrow scope.",
        "Linguists and NLP researchers have come up with several theories and mechanisms for automatically determining the scope of quantified linguistic expressions.",
        "Despite a long history of proposed solutions, however, researchers have for the most part abandoned this task as hopeless because of \"overwhelming evidence suggesting that quantifier scope is a phenomenon that must be treated at the pragmatic level\" (Saba and Corriveau, 2001).",
        "For example, in active voice clauses, the quantifier for the subject noun is usually preferred for wide scope over the quantifier of the predicate noun (Kurtzman and MacDonald, 1993).",
        "But such preferences can easily be overruled by world knowledge:",

        "Syntactic preferences would normally indicate that reading 1 is better, but in this particular case common-sense knowledge of the world overrules that preference and makes reading 2 far more probable.",

        "2) We devise a novel probabilistic model in the Markov Logic Network framework for reasoning over possible readings of sentences that involve quantifier scope ambiguities.",
        "The model is able to assign a probability that a particular reading is plausible, given the pragmatic knowledge we extract.",

        "Quantifier scope disambiguation has received attention in linguistics and computational linguistics since at least the 1970s.",
        "Montague (1973) gave a seminal treatment of quantifier ambiguities, and argued that a particular syntax-based mechanism known as \"quantifying-in\" could resolve scope ambiguities.",
        "Since then, most work on disambiguation has focused on syntactic clues for determining which readings of an ambiguous statement are possible, and of the set of possible readings, which ones are preferred (Van Lehn, 1978; Hobbs and Shieber, 1987; Poesio, 1993a; Hurum, 1988; Moran, 1988).",
        "For instance, one linguistic study (Kurtzman and MacDonald, 1993) determined that in active voice sentences where quantifiers in the subject and object give rise to scope ambiguity, there is a preference for the reading in which the subject quantifier has wide scope – the direct reading is acceptable 70-80% of the time, whereas the indirect reading is acceptable 30-40% of the time.",
        "Sentences that are similar in all respects except that they are passive voice have no such preference.",
        "Nevertheless, in these studies both readings are often quite plausible.",
        "In addition to syntactic clues, other studies have noted that the choice of quantifier has a significant effect on scope disambiguation (e.g., \"each\" has a greater tendency for wide scope than \"every\") (Van Lehn, 1978; Alshawi, 1990).",
        "Most authors have noted that both syntactic and lexical evidence fall short of a full solution, and that pragmatic knowledge (knowledge about the world) is necessary for this task (Van Lehn, 1978; Saba and Corriveau, 1997; Moran, 1988).",
        "Saba and Corriveau (2001) recently proposed a test for quantifier scope disambiguation using pragmatic knowledge.",
        "However, they do not show how to extract the necessary information, nor do they implement or evaluate their proposed test.",
        "Due to the difficulty of the problem, several authors have devised techniques for \"underspec-ified\" logical representations that can efficiently store multiple ambiguous readings, and they devise techniques for automated reasoning using underspecified representations (Reyle, 1995; Late-cki, 1992; Poesio, 1993b).",
        "Others (Hobbs and Shieber, 1987; Park, 1988) have devised computational mechanisms for generating all of the possible readings of statements exhibiting quantifier ambiguity, especially in cases involving more than two quantifiers.",
        "Detecting functions in extracted relational data has been studied in several contexts.",
        "Ritter et al.",
        "(2008) use knowledge of functions to determine when two extracted relationships contradict one another.",
        "Knowledge of functions has also been important in finding synonyms (Yates and Etzioni, 2009) and in review mining (Popescu, 2007).",
        "We extend this work by extracting not just a binary determination of whether a relation is functional, but a distribution over the expected number of arguments for that relation.",
        "Our technique also differs from previous work based on extracted relationships between named entities.",
        "We leverage domain-independent extraction patterns involving numeric phrases, as discussed below; our technique is complementary to existing approaches and could in fact be combined with them for even greater accuracy.",
        "Finally, we apply the extracted knowledge in a novel way to quantifier scope disambiguation.",
        "Our work is similar in spirit to several recent projects that use semantic reasoning over extracted knowledge for a novel approach to well-known tasks.",

        "As far as we are aware, finding the expected size of an argument set for a relation is a novel task for information extraction, but several researchers (Ritter et al., 2008; Yates and Etzioni, 2009) have investigated the special case of detecting functional relations – those relations where the expected size of the Y argument set is precisely 1.",
        "As with class size extraction, they use extractions involving named-entity arguments to find functional relations.",
        "Approaches that depend on named-entity extractions have several disadvantages: they must find a large set of named-entities for every set, which can be time-consuming and difficult.",
        "Also, many classes, like \"trees\" and \"hot dogs,\" have no or very few named instances, but many unnamed instances, so approaches based on named entities have little hope.",
        "In fact, besides classes like people, locations, and organizations (and their subclasses), there are few classes that have a large number of named instances.",
        "For classes that do have named instances, synonymy, polysemy, and extraction errors are common problems that can all affect estimates of size (Ritter et al., 2008).",

        "For words like \"hundreds,\" we set the value of the word to be the lower limit (i.e., 100).",
        "This gives a conservative estimate of the value, but our techniques described below can help to compensate for this bias.",
        "Table 2 lists examples of the hand-crafted, domain-independent extraction patterns we use.",
        "Our extraction patterns generate two types of extractions, one for classes and one for relations.",
        "For classes, each extraction E consists of a class name Ec and a number En indicating the size of some subset S Ç Ec.",
        "For instance, the 4gram \"hundreds of students are\" matches our first pattern.",

        "Unfortunately, in our experiments we found that this setting for the parameters often gave far too little weight for large values of m and n, and as a consequence, the classifier would systematically judge one reading to be more likely than another.",
        "To counteract this problem, we take a hybrid approach to parameter estimation, informed by both labeled training data and the extracted distributions.",
        "Crucially, our approach, which we call ZlPF Flattening, has only two parameters that need to be trained using a supervised approach, and these parameters do not depend on the relation R. Thus, the approach minimizes the amount of training data we need to a practical level.",
        "Zipf Flattening works by correcting the Pr distributions to give higher weight to larger values of m and n. First, we estimate a Zipf distribution from the raw extracted counts for each argument of relation R. To fit a Zipf curve, we use least-squares linear regression on the log-log plot of the extracted counts to find parameters zr and cr such",
        "We can perform this part automatically, using only the extraction data and no manually labeled training data, for every relation.",
        "However, the fitted Zipf distribution needs to be corrected for the systematic bias in the extracted counts.",
        "To do this, we introduce two parameters, et\\ and 0:2, that we use to scale back the sharp falloff in the Zipf distribution.",
        "Our flattened distribution has the form:",
        "count = eaiCR ■ argSizea2ZR",
        "When 0L2 is less than 1, the resulting curve has a less steep slope, and greater weight is placed on the large values of m and n, as desired.",
        "Our last step is to interpolate the pR%9ht wà PRe^ distributions with the flattened Zipf distribution to come up with corrected distributions for the right and left argument sizes of R. We use equal weights on the two distributions to interpolate.",
        "Note that if the original counts from the extraction system include counts for only one argument size, then it is impossible to estimate a Zipf distribution, and we simply fall back on the extracted distribution.",
        "We do not include counts for an argument size of zero in this process.",
        "To estimate the parameters cti, we collect a training set of QSD problems Q, labeled with the correct reading for each (direct or indirect), and run the extractor for the relations Qr appearing in the training set.",

        "Table 3 shows our results.",
        "A baseline system that simply predicts the majority class (nonfunctions) on this data set would achieve an accuracy of 56%, well below the 81% accuracy of our classifier.",
        "Many of the relations in our test set, like built (Person, House) andis riding (Person, Animal), do not ordinarily have named-entity extractions for both arguments, and would therefore not be amenable to previous function detection approaches.",

        "Since indirect readings are very rarely preferred for active-voice sentences of this form,we charge the system with making a different type of prediction: determine whether the indirect reading is plausible or not.",
        "The system assumes that every sentence has a plausible direct reading, but by determining whether the indirect reading is plausible, it can determine whether the sentence is ambiguous between the two readings.",
        "We created data sets for these tasks by sampling our 5grams for examples containing the relations in our function experiment.",
        "From this set, we selected phrases that involved named classes for the arguments to the relation.",
        "When a class was missing, we either manually supplied one, or discarded the example.",
        "We then constructed two examples from each combination of relation and argument classes: one example in which the first argument is constrained by the quantifier \"a\" and the second by \"every,\" and a second example in which the quantifiers are reversed.",
        "Finally, we manually labeled every example with a preference for direct or indirect reading (in the case of \"a/every\" examples) or with a plausibility judgment for the indirect reading (in the case of \"every/a\" examples).",
