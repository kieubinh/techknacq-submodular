        "Identification of term variations is fundamental to many NLP applications: words (or more generally, terms) are the building blocks of NLP applications, and any robust application must be able to handle variations in the surface representation of terms, be it a spelling mistake, valid spelling variation, or abbreviation.",
        "In search applications, term variations can be used for query expansion, which generates additional query terms for better matching with the terms in the document set.",
        "Identifying term variations is also useful in other scenarios where semantic equivalence of terms is sought, as it represents a very special case of paraphrase.",
        "This paper addresses the problem of identifying term variations in Japanese, specifically for the purpose of query expansion in web search, which appends additional terms to the original query string for better retrieval quality.",
        "Query expansion has been shown to be effective in improving web search results in English, where different methods of generating the expansion terms have been attempted, including relevance feedback (e.g., Salton and Buckley, 1990), correction of spelling errors (e.g., Cucerzan and Brill, 2004), stemming or lemmatization (e.g., Frakes, 1992), use of manually (e.g., Aitchison and Gilchrist, 1987) or automatically (e.g., Rasmussen 1992) constructed thesauri, and Latent Semantic Indexing (e.g., Deerwester et al., 1990).",
        "Though many of these methods can be applied to Japanese query expansion, there are unique problems posed by Japanese search queries, the most challenging of which is that valid alternative spellings of a word are extremely common due to the multiple script types employed in the language.",
        "For example, the word for 'protein' can be spelled as /cÂyff< Lo, SÖÄ, /cÂyfiïC and so on, all pronounced tanpakushitsu but using combinations of different script types.",
        "We give a detailed description of the problem posed by the Japanese writing system in Section 2.",
        "Though there has been previous work on addressing specific subsets of spelling alterations within and across character types in Japanese, there has not been any comprehensive solution for the purpose of query expansion.",
        "Our approach to Japanese query expansion is unique in that we address the problem comprehensively: our method works independently of the character types used, and targets a wide range of term variations that are both orthographically and semantically similar, including spelling errors, valid alternative spellings, transliterations and abbreviations.",

        "Another important contribution of our approach is that we derive our semantic similarity models by mining user query logs, which has been explored for the purposes of collecting related words (e.g., Jones et al., 2006a), improving search results ranking (e.g., Craswell and Szummer, 2007) and learning query intention (e.g., Li et al., 2008), but not for the task of collecting term variations.",
        "We show that our semantic similarity models are not only effective in the term variation identification task, but also for generating candidates of term variations much more efficiently than the standard method whose candidate generation is based on edit distance metrics."

      "text": [
        "In this section we give a summary of the Japanese writing system and the problem it poses for identifying term variations, and define the problem we want to solve in this paper.",
        "There are four different character types that are used in Japanese text: hiragana, katakana, kanji and Roman alphabet.",
        "Hiragana and katakana are the two subtypes of kana characters, which are syllabic character sets, each with about 50 basic characters.",
        "There is a one-to-one correspondence between hiragana and katakana characters, and, as they are phonetic, they can be unambiguously converted into a sequence of Roman characters.",
        "For example, the word for 'mackerel' is spelled in hiragana as èfâ or in katakana as both of which can be transcribed in Roman characters as saba, which is how the word is pronounced.",
        "Kanji characters, on the other hand, are ideographic and therefore numerous - more than 5,000 are in common usage.",
        "One difficulty in handling Japanese kanji is that each character has multiple pronunciations, and the correct pronunciation is determined by the context in which the character is used.",
        "For instance, the character is read as kou in the word ififT ginkou 'bank', gyou in 'column', and i or okona in ff o f itta 'went' or okonatta 'done' depending on the context in which the word is used.",
        "Proper name readings are particularly difficult to disambiguate, as their pronunciation cannot be inferred from the context (they tend to have the same grammatical function) or from the dictionary (they tend to be out-of-vocabulary).",
        "Therefore, in Japanese, computing a pronunciation-based edit distance metric is not straightforward, as it requires estimating the readings of kanji characters.",
        "Spelling variations are commonly observed both within and across character types in Japanese.",
        "Within a character type, the most prevalent is the variation observed in katakana words.",
        "Katakana is used to transliterate words from English and other foreign languages, and therefore reflects the variations in the sound adaptation from the source language.",
        "For example, the word 'spaghetti' is transliterated into six different forms (X^^'yf^ supagetti, T/< f yfi – supagettii, ^^^'yf^ supagettei, T/< f fi supageti, T /< ff i – supagetii, TSf f ^ supagetei) within a newspaper corpus (Masuyama et al., 2004).",
        "Spelling variants are also prevalent across character types: in theory, a word can be spelled using any of the character types, as we have seen in the example for the word 'protein' in Section 1.",
        "Though there are certainly preferred character types for spelling each word, variations are still very common in Japanese text and search queries.",
        "Alterations are particularly common among hira-gana, katakana and kanji (e.g. M sa- ba 'mackerel'), and between katakana and Roman alphabet (e.g. y^T'y^T fedekkusu fedex).",
        "This latter case constitutes the problem of transliteration, which has been extensively studied in the context of machine translation (e.g. Knight and Graehl, 1998; Bilac and Tanaka, 2004; Brill et al., 2001).",
        "Table 1 shows the rewrite categories of related terms observed in web query logs, drawing on our own data analysis as well as on previous work such as Jones et al.",
        "(2006a) and Okazaki et al.",
        "(2008b).",
        "Categories 1 though 9 represent strictly synonymous relations; in addition, terms in Categories 1 through 5 are also similar orthographically or in pronunciation.",
        "Categories 10 through 12, on the other hand, specify non-synonymous relations.",
        "Different sets out of these categories can be useful for different purposes.",
        "For example, Jones et al. (2006a; 2006b) target all of these categories, as their goal is to collect related terms as broadly as possible for the application of sponsored search, i.e., mapping search queries to a small corpus of advertiser listings.",
        "Okazaki et al.",
        "(2008b) define their task narrowly, to focusing on spelling variants and inflection, as they aim at building lexical resources for the specific domain of medical text.",
        "For web search, a conservative definition of the task as dealing only with spelling errors has been successful for English; a more general definition using related words for query expansion has been a mixed blessing as it compromises retrieval precision.",
        "A comprehensive review on this topic is provided by Baeza-Yates and Ribei-ro-Neto (1999).",
        "In this paper, therefore, we adopt a working definition of the term variation identification task as including Categories 1 through 5, i.e., those that are synonymous and also similar in spelling or in pronunciation.",
        "This definition is reasonably narrow so as to make automatic discovery of term variation pairs realistic, while covering all common cases of term variation in Japanese, including spelling variants and transliterations.",
        "It is also appropriate for the purpose of query expansion: because term variation defined in this manner is based on spelling or pronunciation similarity, their meaning and function tend to be completely equivalent, as opposed to Categories 6 through 9, where synonymy is more context-or user-dependent.",
        "This will ensure that the search results by query expansion will avoid the problem of compromised precision.",
        "Related Work",
        "In information retrieval, the problem of vocabulary mismatch between the query and the terms in the document has been addressed in many ways, as mentioned in Section 1, achieving varying degrees of success in the retrieval task.",
        "In particular, our work is closely related to research in spelling correction for English web queries (e.g., Cucerzan and Brill, 2004; Ahmad and Kondrak, 2005; Li et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2007).",
        "Among these, Li et al.",
        "(2006) and Chen et al.",
        "(2007) incorporate both string and semantic similarity in their discriminative models of spelling correction, similarly to our approach.",
        "In Li et al.",
        "(2006), semantic similarity was computed as distributional similarity of the terms using query strings in the log as context.",
        "Chen et al.",
        "(2007) point out that this method suffers from the data sparseness problem in that the statistics for rarer terms are unreliable, and propose using web search results as extended contextual information.",
        "Their method, however, is expensive as it requires web search results for each query-candidate pair, and also because their candidate set, generated using an edit distance function and phonetic similarity from query log data, is impractically large and must be pruned by using a language model.",
        "Our approach differs from these methods in that we exploit user query logs to derive semantic knowledge of terms, which is used both for the purpose of generating a candidate set efficiently and as features in the term variation identification model.",

        "From raw query logs, we extracted pairs of queries q1 and q2 such that they are (i) issued by the same user; (ii) q2 follows within 3 minutes of issuing q1; and (iii) q2 generated at least one click of a URL on the result Figure 1.",

        "After applying an LLR threshold (LLR > 15) and a count cutoff (we used only the top 15 candidate q2 according to the LLR value for each q1), we obtained a list of 47,139,976 pairs for the 14,929,497 distinct qx, on average generating 3.2 candidates per q1.",

        "Semantic similarity features (17, 18) use the LLR score from the session data, and the click-though pair probability described in the subsection above.",
        "Finally, features 19-39 capture the script types of the query-candidate pair.",
        "We first defined six basic character types for each query or candidate: Hira (hiragana only), Kata (katakana only), Kanji (kanji only), Roman (Roman alphabet only), MixedNoKanji (includes more than one character sets but not kanji) and Mixed (includes more than one character sets with kanji).",
        "We then derived 21 binary features by concatenating these basic character type features for the combination",
        "http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms970129.aspx.",
        "We took the one-best conversion result from the API.",
        "The conversion accuracy on a randomly sampled 100 kanji queries was 89.6%.",
        "of query and candidate strings.",
        "For example, if both the query and candidate are in hiragana, BothHira will be on; if the query is Mixed and the candidate is Roman, then RomanMixed will be on.",
        "Punctuation characters and Arabic numerals were treated as being transparent to character type assignment.",
        "The addition of these features is motivated by the assumption that appropriate types of edit distance operations might depend on different character types for the query-candidate pair.",
        "Since the dynamic ranges of different features can be drastically different, we normalized each feature dimension to a normal variable with zero-mean and unit-variance.",
        "We then used the same normalized features for both the maximum entropy and the MART classifiers.",
        "In order to generate the training data for the binary classification task, we randomly sampled the query session (5,712 samples) and click-through data (6,228 samples), and manually labeled each pair as positive or negative: the positive label was assigned when the term pair fell into Categories 1 through 5 in Table 1; otherwise it was assigned a negative label.",
        "Only 364 (6.4%) and 244 (3.9%) of the samples were positive examples for the query session and click-through data respectively, which makes the baseline performance of the classifier quite high (always predict the negative label - the accuracy will be 95%).",
        "Note, however, that these data sets include term variation candidates much more efficiently than a candidate set generated by the standard method that uses an edit distance function with a threshold.",
        "For example, there is a query-candidate pair q=^JEÏ#fB kafuujouhou 'house-style information' c= ^Ëfô'ïïîf ß kafunjouhou 'pollen information') in the session data extract, the first one of which is likely to be a misspelling of the second.",
        "If we try to find candidates for the query ^JE'ïffB using an edit distance function naively with a threshold of 2 from the queries in the log, we end up collecting a large amount of completely irrelevant set of candidates such as ■nJEïffB taifuujouhou 'typhoon information', ttÏïffB kabu jouhou 'stock information', PlilîÏïîfB kouu jouhou 'rainfall information' and so on - as many as 372 candidates were found in the top one million most frequent queries in the query log from the same period; for rarer queries these numbers will only be worse.",
        "Computing the edit distance based on the pronunciation will not help here: the examples above are within the edit distance of 2 even in terms of Romanized strings.",
        "Another advantage of generating the annotated data using the result of query log data mining is that the annotation process is less prone to subjectivity than creating the annotation from scratch.",
        "As Cucerzan and Brill (2004) point out, the process of manually creating a spelling correction candidate is seriously flawed as the intention of the original query is completely lost: for the query gogle, it is not clear out of context if the user meant goggle, google, or gogle.",
        "Using data mined from query logs solves this problem: an annotator can safely assume that if gogle-goggle appears in the candidate set, it is very likely to be a valid term variation intended by the user.",
        "This makes the annotation more robust and efficient: the inter-annotator agreement rate for 2,000 query pairs by two annotators was 95.7% on our data set, each annotator spending only about two hours to annotate 2,000 pairs.",
        "In order to compare the performance of two classifiers, we first built maximum entropy and MART classifiers as described in Section 4 using Features_Error rate (%) Table 3: Results of Features Ablation Experiments",
        "Using MART Model all the features in Section 5.2.",
        "We run five experiments using different random split of training and test data: in each run, we used 10,000 samples for training and the remaining 1,940 samples for testing, and measured the performance of the two classifiers on the task of term variation identification in terms of the error rate i.e., 1 -accuracy.",
        "The results, average over five runs, were 4.18 for the maximum entropy model, and",
        "MART model outperformed the maximum entropy classifier.",
        "This is not surprising given the superior performance of tree-boosting algorithms previously reported on similar classification tasks (e.g., Hastie et al., 2001).",
        "In our task where different types of features are likely to perform better when they are combined (such as semantic features and character types features), MART would be a better fit than linear classifiers because the decision trees generated by MART optimally combines features in the local sense.",
        "In what follows, we only discuss the results produced by MART for further experiments.",
        "Note that the baseline classifier, which always predicts the label to be negative, achieves 95.04% in accuracy (or 4.96% error rate), which sounds extremely high, but in fact this baseline classifier is useless for the purpose of collecting term variations, as it learns none of them by classifying all samples as negative.",
        "For evaluating the contribution of different types of features in Section 5.2, we performed feature ablation experiments using MART.",
        "Table 3 shows the results in error rate by various MART classifiers using different combination of features.",
        "The results in this table are also averaged over five run with random training/test data split.",
        "From Table 3, we can see that the best performance was achieved by the model using all features (line A of the table), which reduces the baseline error rate (4.96%) by 38%.",
        "The improvement is statistically significant according to the McNemar test (P < 0.05).",
        "Models that use string edit distance features only (lines B and C) did not perform well: in particular, the model that uses surface edit distance features only Figure 2: Precision/Recall Curve of MART without considering the term pronunciation performed horribly (line C), which confirms the results reported by Jones et al.",
        "(2006b).",
        "However, unlike Jones et al.",
        "(2006b), we see a positive contribution of semantic features: the use of semantic features reduced the error rate from 3.28 (line D) to 3.07 (line A), which is statistically significant.",
        "This may be attributable to the nature of semantic information used in our experiments: we used the user session and click-though data to extract semantic knowledge, which may be semantically more specific than the probability of word substitution in a query collection as a whole, which is used by Jones et al.",
        "(2006b).",
        "Finally, the character type features also contributed to reducing the error rate (lines A and E).",
        "In particular, the observation that the addition of semantic features without the character type features (comparing lines B and E) did not improve the error rate indicates that the character type features are also important in bringing about the contribution of semantic features.",
        "Figure 2 displays the test data precision/recall curve of one of the runs of MART that uses all features.",
        "The x-axis of the graph is the confidence score of classification P(clq), which was set to 0.5 for the results in Table 3.",
        "At this confidence, the model achieves 70% precision with the recall slightly higher than 60%.",
        "In the graph, we observe a familiar trade-off between precision and recall, which is useful for practical applications that may favor one over the other.",
        "In order to find out where the weaknesses of our classifiers lie, we performed a manual error analysis on the same MART run whose results are shown in Figure 2.",
        "Most of the classification errors are false negatives, i.e., the model failed to predict a case of term variation as such.",
        "The most conspicuous error is the failure to capture abbreviations, such as failing to capture the alteration between + %.",
        "^ ^ t& juujoochuugakkou 'Juujoo middle school' and +^cf] juujoochuu, which our edit distance-based features fail as the length difference between a term and its abbreviation is significant.",
        "Addition of more targeted features for this subclass of term variation (e.g., Okazaki et al., 2008a) is called for, and will be considered in future work.",
        "Mistakes in the Romanization of kanji characters were not always punished as the query and the candidate string may contain the same mistake, but when they occurred in either in the query or the candidate string (but not in both), the result was destructive: for example, we assigned a wrong Romanization on kkffill as suiginnakari 'mercury lamp', as opposed to the correct suiginntou, which causes the failure to capture the alteration with zkf.fi ê suiginntou, (a misspelling of kkffil!).",
        "Using N-best (N>1) candidate pronunciations for kanji terms or using all possible pronunciations for kanji characters might reduce this type of error.",
        "Finally, the features of our models are the edit distance functions themselves, rather than the individual edit rules or operations.",
        "Using these individual operations as features in the classification task directly has been shown to perform well on spelling correction and normalization tasks (e.g., Brill and Moore, 2000; Okazaki et al., 2008b).",
        "Okazaki et al.",
        "'s (2008b) method of generating edit operations may not be viable for our purposes, as they assume that the original and candidate strings are very similar in their surface representation - they target only spelling variants and inflection in English.",
        "One interesting future avenue to consider is to use the edit distance functions in our current model to select a subset of query-candidate pairs that are similar in terms of these functions, separately for the surface and Romanized forms, and use this subset to align the character strings in these query-candidate pairs as described in Brill and Moore (2000), and add the edit operations derived in this manner to the term variation identification classifier as features."
