        "Statistical models have achieved great success in language parsing and obtained the state-of-the-art results in a variety of languages.",
        "In general, they can be divided into two major categories, namely lexicalized models (Collins 1997, 1999; Charniak 1997, 2000) and un-lexicalized models (Klein and Manning 2003; Matsuzaki et al.",
        "2005; lexicalized models, word information play a key role in modeling grammar rule generation, while un-lexicalized models usually utilize latent information derived from the parse structure diversity.",
        "Although the two models are different from each other in essence, both have achieved state-of-the-art results in a variety of languages and are complementary to each other (this will be empirically verified later in this paper).",
        "Therefore, it is natural to combine the two models for better parsing performance.",
        "Besides individual parsing models, many system combination methods for parsing have been proposed (Henderson and Brill 1999; Zeman and Zabokrtsky 2005; Sagae and Lavie 2006) and promising performance improvements have been reported.",
        "In addition, parsing re-ranking (Collins 2000; Riezler et al.",
        "2002; Charniak and Johnson 2005; Huang 2008) has also been shown to be another effective technique to improve parsing performance.",
        "This technique utilizes a bunch of linguistic features to re-rank the k-best (Huang and Chiang 2005) output on the forest level or tree level.",
        "In prior work, system combination was applied on multiple parsers while re-ranking was applied on the k-best outputs of individual parsers.",
        "In this paper, we propose a linear model-based general framework for multiple parsers combination.",
        "The proposed framework leverages on the strengths of previous system combination and re-ranking methods and is open to any type of features.",
        "In particular, it is capable of utilizing the logarithm of the parse tree probability from each individual parser while previous combination methods are unable to use this feature since the probabilities from different parsers are not comparable.",
        "In addition, we experiment on k-best combination while previous methods are only verified on 1-best combination.",
        "Finally, we apply our method in combining outputs from both the lexicalized and un-lexicalized parsers while previous methods only carry out experiments on multiple lexicalized parsers.",
        "We also compare two learning algorithms in tuning the feature weights for the linear model.",
        "We perform extensive experiments on the Chinese and English Penn Treebank corpus.",

        "As discussed in the previous section, system combination and re-ranking are two techniques to improve parsing performance by postprocessing parsers' k-best outputs.",
        "Regarding the system combination study, Henderson and Brill (1999) propose two parser combination schemes, one that selects an entire tree from one of the parsers, and one that builds a new tree by selecting constituents suggested by the initial trees.",
        "According to the second scheme, it breaks each parse tree into constituents, calculates the count of each constituent, then applies the majority voting to decide which constituent would appear in the final tree.",
        "Sagae and Lavie (2006) improve this second scheme by introducing a threshold for the constituent count, and search for the tree with the largest number of count from all the possible constituent combination.",
        "Zeman and Zabokrtsky (2005) study four combination techniques, including voting, stacking, unbalanced combining and switching, for constituent selection on Czech dependency parsing.",
        "Promising results have been reported in all the above three prior work.",
        "Henderson and Brill (1999) combine three parsers and obtained an F1 score of 90.6, which is better than the score of 88.6 obtained by the best individual parser as reported in their paper.",
        "Sagae and Lavie (2006) combine 5 parsers to obtain a score of 92.1, while they report a score of 91.0 for the best single parser in their paper.",
        "Finally, Zeman and Zabokrtsky (2005) reports great improvements over each individual parsers and show that a parser with very low accuracy can also help to improve the performance of a highly accurate parser.",
        "However, there are two major limitations in these prior works.",
        "First, only one-best output from each individual parsers are utilized.",
        "Second, none of these works uses the parse probability of each parse tree output from the individual parser.",
        "Regarding the parser re-ranking, Collins (2000) proposes a dozen of feature types to re-rank k-best outputs of a single head-driven parser.",
        "He uses these feature types to extract around half a million different features on the training set, and then examine two loss functions, MRF and Boosting, to do feature selection.",
        "Charniak and Johnson (2005) generate a more accurate k-best output and adopt MaxEnt method to estimate the feature weights for more than one million features extracted from the training set.",
        "Huang (2008) further improves the re-ranking work of Charniak and Johnson (2005) by re-ranking on packed forest, which could potentially incorporate exponential number of k-best list.",
        "The re-ranking techniques also achieve great improvement over the original individual parser.",
        "Collins (2002) improves the F1 score from 88.2% to 89.7%, while Charniak and Johnson (2005) improve from 90.3% to 91.4%.",
        "This latter work was then further improved by Huang (2008) to 91.7%, by utilizing the benefit of forest structure.",
        "However, one of the limitations of these techniques is the huge number of features which makes the training very expensive and inefficient in space and memory usage.",
        "3 K-best Combination of Lexicalized and Un-Lexicalized Parsers with Model Probabilities",
        "In this section, we first introduce our proposed k-best combination framework.",
        "Then we apply this framework to the combination of two state-of-the-art lexicalized and un-lexicalized parsers with an additional feature inspired by traditional combination techniques.",
        "Our proposed framework consists of the following steps:",
        "1) Given an input sentence and N different parsers, each parser generates K-best parse trees.",
        "2) We combine the N*K output trees and remove any duplicates to obtain M unique tress.",
        "3) For each of the M unique trees, we re-evaluate it with all the N models which are used by the N parsers.",
        "It is worth noting that this is the key point (i.e. one of the major advantages) of our method since some parse trees are only generated from one or I (I<N) parsers.",
        "For example, if a tree is only generated from head-driven lexicalized model, then it only has the head-driven model score.",
        "Now we re-evaluate it with the latent-annotation un-lexicalized model to reflect the latent-",
        "annotation model's confidence for this tree.",
        "This enables our method to effectively utilize the confidence measure of all the individual models without any bias.",
        "Without this re-evaluation step, the previous combination methods are unable to utilize the various model scores.",
        "4) Besides model scores, we also compute some additional feature scores for each tree, such as the widely-used \"constituent count\" feature.",
        "5) Then we adopt the linear model to balance and combine these feature scores and generate an overall score for each parse tree.",
        "6) Finally we re-rank the M best trees and output the one with the highest score.",
        "fit) = AiACt) + - + xNfN (t) + x\\f\\{t) + ».",
        "The above is the linear function used in our method, where t is the tree to be evaluated, fx to fN are the model confidence scores (in this paper, we use logarithm of the parse tree probability) from the N models, Xx to XN are their weights, f'i to f'h are the L additional features, X\\ to X\\ are their weights.",
        "In this paper, we employ two individual parsing model scores and only one additional feature.",
        "Let /i be the head-driven model score, f2 be the latent-annotation model score, f'x be the constituent count feature and X\\ is the weight of feature f\\.",
        "The term \"confidence\" was used in prior parser combination studies to refer to the accuracy of each individual parser.",
        "This reflects how much we can trust the parse output of each parser.",
        "In this paper, we use the term \"confidence\" to refer to the logarithm of the tree probability computed by each model, which is a direct measurement of the model's confidence on the target tree being the best or correct parse output.",
        "In fact, the feature weight Xt in our linear model functions similarly as the traditional \"confidence\".",
        "However, we do not directly use parser's accuracy as its value.",
        "Instead we tune it automatically on development set to optimize it against the parsing performance directly.",
        "In the following, we introduce the state-of-the-art head-driven lexicalized and latent-annotation un-lexicalized models (which are used as two individual models in this paper), and describe how they compute the tree probability briefly.",
        "Head-driven model is one of the most representative lexicalized models.",
        "It attaches the head word to each non-terminal and views the generation of each rule as a Markov process first from father to head child, and then to the head child's left and right siblings.",
        "Take following rule r as example,",
        "F is the rule's left hand side (i.e. father label), M is the head child, Lt is M's left sibling and fij is M's right sibling.",
        "Let h be M's head word, the probability of this rule is",
        "The probability of a tree is just the product of the probabilities of all the rules in it.",
        "The above is the general framework of head-driven model.",
        "For a specific model, there may be some additional features and modification.",
        "For example, the model2 in Collins (1999) introduces sub-categorization and model3 introduces gap as additional features.",
        "Charniak (2000)'s model introduces pre-terminal as additional features.",
        "The latent-annotation model (Matsuzaki et al.",
        "2005; Petrov et al.",
        "2006) is one of the most effective un-lexicalized models.",
        "Briefly speaking, latent-annotation model views each non-terminal in the Treebank as a non-terminal followed by a set of latent variables, and uses EM algorithms to automatically learn the latent variables' probability functions to maximize the probability of the given training data.",
        "Take the following binarized rule as example, could be viewed as the set of rules {Ai -* Bj Ck\\i,j, k are latent variables}",
        "The process of computing the probability of a normal tree is to first binarized all the rules in it, and then replace each rule to the corresponding set of rules with latent variables.",
        "Now the previous tree becomes a packed forest (Klein and Manning 2001; Petrov et al.",
        "2007) in the latentannotation model, and its probability is the inside probability of the root node.",
        "This model is quite different from the head-driven model in which the probability of a tree is just the product all the rules' probability.",
        "Besides the two model scores, we also adopt constituent count as an additional feature inspired by (Henderson and Brill 1999) and (Sagae and Lavie 2006).",
        "A constituent is a non-terminal node covering a special span.",
        "For example, \"NP[2,4]\" means a constituent labelled as \"NP\" which covers the span from the second word to the fourth word.",
        "If we have 100 trees and NP[2,4] appears in 60 of them, then its constituent count is 60.",
        "For each tree, its constituent count is the sum of all the counts of its constituent.",
        "However, as suggested in (Sagae and Lavie 2006), this feature favours precision over recall.",
        "To solve this issue, Sagae and Lavie (2006) use a threshold to balance them.",
        "For any constituent, we calculate its count if and only if it appears more than X times in the k-best trees; otherwise we set it as 0.",
        "In this paper, we normalize this feature by dividing the constituent count by the number of k-best.",
        "Note that the threshold value and the additional feature value are not independent.",
        "Once the threshold changes, the feature value has to be recalculated.",
        "In conclusion, we have four parameters to estimate: two model score weights, one additional feature weight and a threshold for the additional feature."
