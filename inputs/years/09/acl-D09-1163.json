        "Furthermore, most of the approaches are predominantly built upon graph-based methods, which may ignore some hidden information among the retrieval set.",
        "This paper proposes a novel document re-ranking method based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) which exploits the implicit structure of the documents with respect to original queries.",
        "Rather than relying on graph-based techniques to identify the internal structure, the approach tries to find the latent structure of \"topics\" or \"concepts\" in the initial retrieval set.",

        "Consider a traditional IR problem, where there exists a set of documents D in the collection.",
        "In response to an information need (as expressed in a query q), the system determines a best fit between the query and the documents and returns a list of retrieval results, sorted in a decreasing order of their relevancy.",
        "In practice, high precision at the top rankings of the returned results is of particular interest.",
        "Generally, there are two ways to automatically assist in achieving this ultimate goal after an initial retrieval process (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999): document re-ranking and query expansion/re-weighting.",
        "Since the latter normally need a second round of retrieval process, our method focuses on the document re-ranking approach.",
        "We will focus on adjusting the ranking positions directly over initial retrieval results set .",
        "Recently, there is a trend of exploring the hidden structure of documents to re-rank results.",
        "Some of the approaches represent the document entities as a connected graph G. It is usually constructed by links inferred from the content information as a nearest-neighbor graph.",
        "For example, Zhang et al.",
        "(2005) proposed an affinity ranking graph to re-rank search results by optimizing diversity and information richness.",

        "However in this work we are more interested in adopting an automatic approach.",
        "There are two important factors that should be taken into account when designing any re-ranking algorithms: the original queries and initial retrieval scores.",
        "One of issues is that previous structural re-ranking algorithms treat the query and the content individually when computing re-ranking scores.",
        "Each document is assigned a score independent of other documents without considering of queries.",
        "The problem we want to address in this paper is how we can leverage the interconnections between query and documents for the re-ranking purpose.",
        "Another problem with such approaches concerns the fundamental re-ranking strategy they adopted.",

        "(2009), re-ranking algorithms that rely only on the structure of the global graph are likely lead to the problem of topic drift.",
        "Instead, we introduce a new document re-ranking method based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) which exploits implicit structure of the documents with respect to original queries.",
        "Rather than relying on graph-based techniques to identify the internal structure, the approach tries to directly model the latent structure of \"topics\" or \"concepts\" in the initial retrieval set.",
        "Then we can compute the distance between queries and initial retrieval results based on latent semantic information inferred.",
        "To prevent the problem of topic drift, the generative probability of a document is summed over all topics induced.",
        "By combining the initial retrieval scores calculated by language models, we are able to gather important information for re-ranking purposes.",
        "The intuition behind this method is the hidden structural information among the documents: similar documents are likely to have the same hidden information with respect to a query.",
        "In other words, if a group of documents are talking about the same topic which shares a strong similarity with a query, in our method they will get allocated similar ranking as they are more likely to be relevant to the query.",
        "In addition, the refined ranking scores should be relevant to the initial ranking scores, which, in our method, are combined together with the re-ranking score either using a linear fashion or multiplication process.",
        "To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, we apply the framework to ad-hoc document retrieval and compare it with the initial language model-based method and other three PageRank style re-ranking methods.",

        "There exist several groups of related work in the areas of document retrieval and re-ranking.",
        "The first category performs re-ranking by using inter-document relationship (Lee et al., 2001), evidences obtained from external resources (Kamps, 2004), or through local context analysis (Xu and Croft, 2000).",
        "In the past, document distances (Balinski and Daniowicz, 2005), manually built external thesaurus (Qu et al., 2001), and structural information (such as document title) (Luk and Wong, 2004), etc have been used extensively for this very purpose.",
        "A second category of work is related to recent advances in structural re-ranking paradigm over graphs.",
        "Kurland and Lee performed re-ranking based on measures of centrality in the graph formed by generation links induced by language model scores, through a weighted version of PageRank algorithm (Kurland and Lee, 2005) and HITS-style cluster-based approach (Kurland and Lee, 2006).",

        "(2005) proposed a similar method to improve web search based on a linear combination of results from text search and authority ranking.",
        "The graph, which they named affinity graph, shares strong similarities with Kurland and Lee's work with the links induced by a modified version of cosine similarity using the vector space model.",
        "Diaz (2005) used score regularization to adjust document retrieval rankings from an initial retrieval by a semi-supervised learning method.",
        "Deng et al.",
        "(2009) further developed this method.",
        "They built a latent space graph based on content and explicit links information.",
        "Unlike their approach we are trying to model the latent information directly.",
        "This work is also related to a family of methods so called latent semantic analysis (LSA) (Landauer et al., 1998), especially topic models used for document representation.",
        "Latent Dirich-let Allocation (LDA), after it was first introduced by Blei et al.",
        "(2003), has quickly become one of the most popular probabilistic text modeling techniques and has inspired research ranging from text classification and clustering (Phan et al., 2008), information discovery (Mei et al., 2007; Titov and McDonald, 2008) to information retrieval (Wei and Croft, 2006).",
        "In this model, each topic is represented by a set of words and each word corresponds with a weight to measure its contribution to the topic.",
        "Wei and Croft (2006) described large-scale information retrieval experiments by using LDA.",
        "In their work, LDA-based document model and language model-based document model were linearly combined to rank the entire corpus.",
        "However, unlike this approach we only apply LDA to a small set of documents.",
        "There are two reasons by doing so.",
        "One is the concern of computational cost.",
        "LDA is a very complex model and the complexity will grow linearly with the number of topics and the number of documents.",
        "Only running it through a document set significantly smaller than the whole corpus has obvious advantages.",
        "Secondly, it is well known that LSA-based method suffers from an incremental build problem.",
        "Normally adding new documents to the corpus needs to \"be folded in\" to the latent representation.",
        "Such incremental addition fails to capture the cooccurrences of the newly added documents (and even ignores all new terms they contain).",
        "As such, the quality of the LSA representation will degrade as more documents are added and will eventually require a re-computation of the LSA representation.",
        "Because our method only requires running LDA once for a small number of documents, this problems could be easily avoided.",
        "In addition, we also introduce two new measures to calculate the distance between a query and a document."

        "In the next subsection we will introduce how to achieve this goal and apply it to document re-ranking.",
        "LDA is a complex model and cannot be solved by exact inference.",
        "There are a few approximate inference techniques available in the literature: variational methods (Blei et al., 2003), expectation propagation (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004) and Gibbs sampling (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004).",
        "Gibbs sampling is a special case of Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation and often yields relatively simple algorithms.",
        "For this reason, we choose to use Gibbs sampling to estimate LDA.",
        "According to Gibbs sampling, we need to compute the conditional probability p(zt |z_, t, w), where w denotes the vector of all words and z_ tdenotes the vector of topic assignment except the considered word at position i.",

        "We do not tune to optimize these parameters because in our experiments the markov chain turns out to converge very quickly.",

        "Given a set of initial results Ojnit, we are trying to remeasure the distance between the query and a document.",
        "In the vector space model, this distance is normally the cosine or inner product measure between two vectors.",
        "Under the probabilistic model framework, this distance can be obtained from a non-commutative measure of the difference between two probability distributions.",
        "The distance used in our approach is the Kull-back-Leibler (KL) divergence (Kullback and Leibler, 1951).",
        "Given two probability mass function p(x) and q(x), the KL divergence (or relative entropy) between p and q is defined as:",
        "In terms of text sequences (either queries or documents), the probability distribution can be regarded as a probabilistic language model Mdor Mq from each document d or each query q.",
        "In other words, it assumes that there is an underlying language model which \"generates\" a term (sequence) (Ponte and Croft, 1998).",

The initial ranker that we choose to use later in the experiment computes the KL divergence between the MLEqw and a modified version of DIRdw (Zhai and Lafferty, 2001).",
        "Both estimations can be easily extended to distributions over text sequences by assuming that the terms are independent:",

        "A closer examination of the results in Table 2 reveals some interesting properties.",
        "As expected, the RWILM method bought improvements in many cases in CLEF-2008 test collections.",
        "However, the performance over CLEF-2007 collection was somewhat disappointing.",
        "This seems to indicate that the language model induced graph method tends to perform better in sparse data rather than longer documents.",
        "Also Language Modeling requires large set training data to be effective, while the complexity of our method is only linear with number of topics and the number of documents for each iteration.",
        "The affinity and vector graph based methods demonstrated poor performance across all the collections.",
        "This may be due to the fact that the approach Zhang et al.",
        "(Zhang et al., 2005) developed focuses more on diversity and information richness and cares less about the precision of the retrieval results while asymmetric graph as constructed by the vector space model fails in capturing important relationship between the documents.",
        "Another observation we can draw from Table 2 is that the relative performance tends to be stable during test collections written in different languages.",
        "This shows a promising future for studying structure of the documents with respect to queries for re-ranking purpose.",
        "At the same time, efficiency is always an issue in all re-ranking methods.",
        "Although this is not a primary concern in the current work, it would definitely worth thinking in the future.",
        "We also conducted some experiments over queries constructed by using Title field only.",
        "This forms some more realistic short queries.",
        "The experiments showed very similar results compared to longer queries.",
        "This demonstrates that the query length is a trivial issue in our methods (as in other graph-based structural re-ranking).",
        "We examined the best and worse performed queries, their performance are generally consistent across all the methods.",
        "This phenomenon should be investigated further in the follow up evaluation.",
        "Comparison of Different Methods In comparison of performance between four permutations of our methods, LDA2 is the clear winner over CLEF-2008 test collections.",
        "The results obtained by LDA2 and LDA4 over CLEF-2007 test collection were mixed.",
        "LDA2 performed better in precision at top n documents while LDA4 showed promising results in terms of more general evaluation metrics.",
        "On the other hand, the linear combination approach performed much better than multiplication based combination.",
        "The situation is even worse when we adopted the RSlqa method, which was inferior in several cases.",
        "Thus the linear combination should be highly recommended.",
        "Scalability We have shown that our latent document re-ranking method is successful at accomplishing the goal of improving the results returned by an initial retrieval engine.",
        "But one may raise a question of whether it is necessary to restrict our attention to an initial pool Djnjt at such a small size.",
        "As it happens, preliminary experiments with LDA2 on larger size of the initial pool are presented in Figure 1.",
        "As we can see, our method can bring consistently stable improvements."
