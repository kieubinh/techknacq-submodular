        "Whereas the former is suitable for classifying news (e.g., editorials vs. reports) into positive and negative, the latter is essential for question-answering and recommendation systems.",
        "A recommendation system, for example, must be able to recommend restaurants (or movies, books, etc.)",
        "based on a variety of features such as food, service or ambience.",
        "Any single review sentence may contain both positive and negative opinions, evaluating different features of a restaurant.",

        "In tasks such as this, therefore, it is important that sentiment analysis be done at the phrase level.",
        "(1) The Taj has great food but I found their service to be lacking.",
        "Subjective phrases in a sentence are carriers of sentiments in which an experiencer expresses an attitude, often towards a target.",
        "These subjective phrases may express neutral or polar attitudes depending on the context of the sentence in which they appear.",
        "Context is mainly determined by content and structure of the sentence.",
        "For example, in the following sentence (2), the underlined subjective phrase seems to be negative, but in the larger context of the sentence, it is positive.",
        "(2) The robber entered the store but his efforts were crushed when the police arrived on time.",
        "Our task is to predict contextual polarity of subjective phrases in a sentence.",
        "A traditional approach to this problem is to use a prior polarity lexicon of words to first set priors on target phrases and then make use of the syntactic and semantic information in and around the sentence to make the final prediction.",
        "As in earlier approaches, we also use a lexicon to set priors, but we explore new uses of a Dictionary of Affect in Language (DAL) (Whissel, 1989) extended using WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "We augment this approach with n-gram analysis to capture the effect of context.",

        "• N-gram Analysis: exploiting automatically derived polarity of syntactic constituents",
        "We compute polarity for each syntactic constituent in the input phrase using lexical affect scores for its words and extract n-grams over these constituents.",
        "N-grams of syntactic constituents tagged with polarity provide patterns that improve prediction of polarity for the subjective phrase.",
        "• Polarity of Surrounding Constituents: We",
        "use the computed polarity of syntactic constituents surrounding the phrase we want to classify.",
        "These features help to capture the effect of context on the polarity of the subjective phrase.",
        "We show that classification of subjective phrases using our approach yields better accuracy than two baselines, a majority class baseline and a more difficult baseline of lexical n-gram features.",
        "We also provide an analysis of how the different component DAL scores contribute to our results through the introduction of a \"norm\" that combines the component scores, separating polar words that are less subjective (e.g., Christmas , murder) from neutral words that are more subjective (e.g., most, lack).",

        "Second, each chunk in a sentence is then assigned a 2-D AE space score as defined by Cowie et al., (2001) by adding the individual AE space scores of all the words in the chunk and then normalizing it by the number of words.",
        "At this point, we are only concerned with the polarity of the chunk (i.e., whether it is positive or negative or neutral) and imagery will not help in this task; the AE space score is determined from pleasantness and activeness alone.",
        "A threshold, determined empirically by analyzing the distributions of positive (pos), negative (neg) and neutral (neu) expressions, is used to define ranges for these classes of expressions.",
        "This enables us to assign each chunk a prior semantic polarity.",
        "Having the semantic orientation (positive, negative, neutral) and phrasal tags, the sentence is then converted to a sequence of encodings [Phrasal – Tag]poiarity.",
        "We mark each phrase that we want to classify as a \"target\" to differentiate it from the other chunks and attach its encoding.",
        "As mentioned, if the target phrase partially overlaps with chunks, it is simply expanded to subsume the chunks.",
        "This encoding is illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "After these two steps, we extract a set of features that are used in classifying the target phrase.",
        "These include n-grams of chunks from the all sentences, minimum and maximum pleasantness scores from the chunks in the target phrase itself, and the syntactic categories that occur in the context of the target phrase.",

        "It was surprising to find another top chunk feature, the bigram \"[Other]^' [NP]neg\" (i.e., a neutral chunk of syntactic type \"Other\" preceding a negative noun phrase), present in neutral expressions six times more than in polar expressions.",

        "In this and the other experiment, pleasantness, activation and the norm were among the top 5 features.",

        "While the increase of adding the chunk features, for example, is not as great as in the previous classification, it is nonetheless significant (p-value = 0.0018) in this classification task.",
        "The smaller increase lends support to our hypothesis that polar expressions tend to be less subjective and thus are less likely to be affected by contextual polarity.",
        "Another thing that supports our hypothesis that neutral expressions are more subjective is the fact that the rank of imagery (ii), dropped significantly in this classification task as compared to the previous classification task.",
        "This implies that imagery has a much lesser role to play when we are dealing with non-neutral expressions."

        "We do not require any manual intervention during feature selection, and thus our system is fully automated.",
        "We also introduced a 3-D representation that maps different classes to spatial coordinates.",
        "It may seem to be a limitation of our system that it requires accurate expression boundaries.",
        "However, this is not true for the following two reasons: first, Wiebe et al., (2005) declare that while marking the span of subjective expressions and hand annotating the MPQA corpus, the annotators were not trained to mark accurate expression boundaries.",
        "The only constraint was that the subjective expression should be within the mark-ups for all annotators.",
        "Second, we expanded the marked subjective phrase to subsume neighboring phrases at the time of chunking.",
        "A limitation of our scoring scheme is that it does not handle polysemy, since words in DAL are not provided with their parts of speech.",
        "Statistics show, however, that most words occurred with primarily one part of speech only.",
        "For example, \"will\" occurred as modal 1272 times in the corpus, whereas it appeared 34 times as a noun.",
        "The case is similar for \"like\" and \"just\", which mostly occur as a preposition and an adverb, respectively.",
        "Also, in our state machine, we haven't accounted for the impact of connectives such as \"but\" or \"although\"; we propose drawing on work in argumentative orientation to do so ((Anscombre and Ducrot, 1983); (Elhadad and McKeown, 1990)).",
        "For future work, it would be interesting to do subjectivity and intensity classification using the same scheme and features.",
        "Particularly, for the task of subjectivity analysis, we speculate that the imagery score might be useful for tagging chunks with \"subjective\" and \"objective\" instead of positive, negative, and neutral."
