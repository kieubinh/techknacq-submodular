        "We find that combining lexical, syntactic, and language model-related features with the output of a state-of-the-art disfluency identification system improves overall word-level identification of these and other errors.",

        "The output of an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system is often not what is required for subsequent processing, in part because speakers themselves often make mistakes (e.g. stuttering, self-correcting, or using filler words).",
        "A cleaner speech transcript would allow for more accurate language processing as needed for natural language processing tasks such as machine translation and conversation summarization which often assume a grammatical sentence as input.",
        "A system would accomplish reconstruction of its spontaneous speech input if its output were to represent, in flawless, fluent, and content-preserving text, the message that the speaker intended to convey.",
        "Such a system could also be applied not only to spontaneous English speech, but to correct common mistakes made by non-native speakers (Lee and Seneff, 2006), and possibly extended to non-English speaker errors.",
        "A key motivation for this work is the hope that a cleaner, reconstructed speech transcript will allow for simpler and more accurate human and natural language processing, as needed for applications like machine translation, question answering, text summarization, and paraphrasing which often assume a grammatical sentence as input.",
        "This benefit has been directly demonstrated for statistical machine translation (SMT).",
        "Rao et al.",
        "(2007) gave evidence that simple disfluency removal from transcripts can improve BLEU (a standard SMT evaluation metric) up to 8% for sentences with disfluencies.",
        "The presence of disfluencies were found to hurt SMT in two ways: making utterances longer without adding semantic content (and sometimes adding false content) and exacerbating the data mismatch between the spontaneous input and the clean text training data.",
        "While full speech reconstruction would likely require a range of string transformations and potentially deep syntactic and semantic analysis of the errorful text (Fitzgerald, 2009), in this work we will first attempt to resolve less complex errors, corrected by deletion alone, in a given manually-transcribed utterance.",
        "We build on efforts from (Johnson et al., 2004), aiming to improve overall recall - especially of false start or non-copy errors - while concurrently maintaining or improving precision.",
        "Common simple disfluencies in sentence-like utterances (SUs) include filler words (i.e. \"um\", \"ah\", and discourse markers like \"you know\"), as well as speaker edits consisting of a reparandum, an interruption point (IP), an optional interregnum (like \"I mean\"), and a repair region (Shriberg, 1994), as seen in Figure 1.",
        "reparandum interregnum repair",
        "Figure 1: Typical edit region structure.",
        "In these and other examples, reparandum regions are in brackets ('[', ']'), interregna are in braces ('{', '}'), and interruption points are marked by '+'.",
        "These reparanda, or edit regions, can be classified into three main groups:",
        "1.",
        "In a repetition (above), the repair phrase is approximately identical to the reparandum.",

        "In a revision, the repair phrase alters reparan-dum words to correct the previously stated thought.",

        "In simple cleanup (a precursor to full speech reconstruction), all detected filler words are deleted, and the reparanda and interregna are deleted while the repair region is left intact.",
        "This is a strong initial step for speech reconstruction, though more complex and less deterministic changes are often required for generating fluent and grammatical speech text.",
        "In some cases, such as the repetitions mentioned above, simple cleanup is adequate for reconstruction.",
        "However, simply deleting the identified reparandum regions is not always optimal.",

        "In the first restart fragment example (ex3 in Section 1.1), the reparandum introduces no new active verbs or new content, and thus can be safely deleted.",
        "The second example (ex4) however demonstrates a case when the reparandum may be considered to have unique and preservable content of its own.",
        "Future work should address how to most appropriately reconstruct speech in this and similar cases; this initial work will for risk information loss as we identify and delete these reparandum regions.",
        "Stochastic approaches for simple disfluency detection use features such as lexical form, acoustic cues, and rule-based knowledge.",
        "Most state-of-the-art methods for edit region detection such as (Johnson and Charniak, 2004; Zhang and Weng, 2005; Liu et al., 2004; Honal and Schultz, 2005) model speech disfluencies as a noisy channel model.",
        "In a noisy channel model we assume that an unknown but fluent string F has passed through a disfluency-adding channel to produce the observed disfluent string D, and we then aim to recover the most likely input string F, defined as where P(F) represents a language model defining a probability distribution over fluent \"source\" strings F, and P(D|F) is the channel model defining a conditional probability distribution of observed sentences D which may contain the types of construction errors described in the previous subsection.",
        "The final output is a word-level tagging of the error condition of each word in the sequence, as seen in line 2 of Figure 2.",
        "The Johnson and Charniak (2004) approach, referred to in this document as JC04, combines the noisy channel paradigm with a tree-adjoining grammar (TAG) to capture approximately repeated elements.",
        "The TAG approach models the crossed word dependencies observed when the reparandum incorporates the same or very similar words in roughly the same word order, which JC04 refer to as a rough copy.",
        "Our version of this system does not use external features such as prosodic classes, as they use in Johnson et al.",
        "(2004), but otherwise appears to produce comparable results to those reported.",
        "While much progress has been made in simple disfluency detection in the last decade, even top-performing systems continue to be ineffective at identifying words in reparanda.",

        "Figure 2: Example of word class and refined word class labels, where - denotes a non-error, fl denotes a filler, e generally denotes reparanda, and rc and nc indicate rough copy and non-copy speaker errors, respectively.",
        "for improvement, we used the top-performingJC04 noisy channel TAG edit detector to produce edit detection analyses on the test segment of the Spontaneous Speech Reconstruction (SSR) corpus (Fitzgerald and Jelinek, 2008).",
        "Table 1 demonstrates the performance of this system for detecting filled pause fillers, discourse marker fillers, and edit words.",
        "The results of a more granular analysis compared to a hand-refined reference (as shown in line 3 of Figure 2) are shown in Table 2.",
        "The reader will recall that precision P is defined",
        "We denote the harmonic mean of P and R as F-score F and calculate it F =",
        "As expected given the assumptions of the TAG approach, JC04 identifies repetitions and most revisions in the SSR data, but less successfully labels false starts and other speaker self-interruptions which do not have a cross-serial correlations.",
        "These non-copy errors (with a recall of only 43.2%), are hurting the overall edit detection recall score.",
        "Precision (and thus F-score) cannot be calculated for the experiment in Table 2; since the JC04 does not explicitly label edits as rough copies or non-copies, we have no way of knowing whether words falsely labeled as edits would have been considered as false RCs or false NCs.",
        "This will unfortunately hinder us from using JC04 as a direct baseline comparison in our work targeting false starts; however, we consider these results to be further motivation for the work.",
        "Surveying these results, we conclude that there is still much room for improvement in the field of simple disfluency identification, especially the cases of detecting non-copy reparandum and learning how and where to implement non-deletion reconstruction changes."

        "We next consider the impact of the four feature groups on our prediction results.",
        "The CRF model appears competitive even without the advantage of building on JC04 results, as seen in Table 5.",
        "Interestingly and encouragingly, the NT bounds features which indicate the linguistic phrase structures beginning and ending at each word according to an automatic parse were also found to be highly contribututive for both fillers and non-copy identification.",
        "We believe that further pursuit of syntactic features, especially those which can take advantage of the context-free weakness of statistical parsers like (Charniak, 1999) will be promising in future research.",
        "It was unexpected that NC classification would be so sensitive to the loss of lexical features while RC labeling was generally resilient to the dropping of any feature group.",
        "We hypothesize that for rough copies, the information lost from the removal of the lexical items might have been compensated for by the JC04 features as JC04 performed most strongly on this error type.",
        "This should be further investigated in the future.",
        "Depending on the downstream task of speech reconstruction, it could be imperative not only to identify many of the errors in a given spoken utterance, but indeed to identify all errors (and only those errors), yielding the precise cleaned sentence that a human annotator might provide.",
        "In these experiments we apply simple cleanup (as described in Section 1.1) to both JC04 output and the predicted output for each experimental setup in Table 3, deleting words when their right boundary class is a filled pause, rough copy or non-copy.",
        "Taking advantage of the dual annotations for each sentence in the SSR corpus, we can report both single-reference and double-reference evaluation.",
        "Thus, we judge that if a hypothesized cleaned sentence exactly matches either reference sentence cleaned in the same manner, we count the cleaned utterance as correct and otherwise assign no credit.",
        "Analysis: We see the outcome of this set of experiments in Table 6.",
        "While the unfiltered test sets of JC04-1, setup #1 and setup #2 appear to have much higher sentence-level cleanup accuracy than the other experiments, we recall that this is natural also due to the fact that the majority of these sentences should not be cleaned at all, besides",
