        "A standard model for extracting biographic facts is to learn templatic contextual patterns such as <NAME> \"was born in\" <Birthplace>.",

        "Thus for our baseline we implemented a standard Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) pattern learning model using 100 seed examples from an online biographic database called NNDB (http://www.nndb.com) for each of the biographic attributes: \"Birthdate\", \"Birthplace\", \"Death-date\", \"Gender\", \"Nationality\", \"Occupation\" and \"Religion\".",
        "Given the seed pairs, patterns for each attribute were learned by searching for seed <Name,Attribute Value> pairs in the Wikipedia page and extracting the left, middle and right contexts as various contextual patterns.",

        "Hence, the values for training/evaluation were extracted from NNDB which provides a cleaner set of gold truth, and is similar to an approach utilizing trained annotators for marking up and extracting the factual information in a standard format.",
        "For consistency, only the people names whose articles occur in Wikipedia where selected as part of seed and test sets.",
        "Given the attribute values of the seed names and their text articles, the probability of a relationship r(Attribute Name), given the surrounding context \"Ai p A2 q A3\", where p and q are <NAME> and <Attrib Val> respectively, is given using the rote extractor model probability as in (Ravichan-dran and Hovy, 2002; Mann and Yarowsky 2005):",
        "Thus, the probability for each contextual pattern is based on how often it correctly predicts a relationship in the seed set.",
