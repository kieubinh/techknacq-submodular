        "One of the main advantages of Integer Linear Programming (ILP) applied to NLP problems is that prescriptive linguistic knowledge can be used to pose global restrictions on the set of desirable solutions.",
        "ILP tries to find an optimal solution while adhering to the global constraints.",
        "One of the central global constraints in the field of coreference resolution evolves from the interplay of intra-sentential binding constraints and the transitivity of the anaphoric relation.",
        "Consider the following sentence taken from the Internet: 'He told him that he deeply admired him'.",
        "'He' and 'him' are exclusive (i.e. they could never be coreferent) within their clauses (the main and the subordinate clause, respectively).",
        "A pairwise classifier could learn this given appropriate features or, alternatively, binding constraints could act as a hard filter preventing such pairs from being generated at all.",
        "But in either case, since pairwise classification is trapped in its local perspective, nothing can prevent the classifier to resolve the 'he' and 'him' from the subordinate clause in two independently carried out steps to the same antecedent from the main clause.",
        "It is transitivity that prohibits such an assignment: if two elements are both coreferent to a common third element, then the two are (transitively given) coreferent as well.",
        "If they are known to be exclusive, such an assignment is disallowed.",
        "But transitivity is beyond the scope of pairwise classification – it is a global phenomena.",
        "The solution is to take ILP as a clustering device, where the probabilities of the pairwise classifier are interpreted as weights and transitivity and other restrictions are acting as global constraints.",
        "Unfortunately, in an ILP program every constraint has to be extensionalized (i.e. all instantiations of the constraint are to be generated).",
        "Capturing transitivity for e.g. 150 noun phrases (about 30 sentences) already produces 1,500,000 equations (cf.",
        "Section 4).",
        "Solving such ILP programs is far too slow for real applications (let alone its brute force character).",
        "A closer look at existing ILP approaches to NLP reveals that they are of a special kind, namely Zero-One ILP with unweighted constraints.",
        "Although still NP-complete there exist a number of algorithms such as the Balas algorithm (Balas, 1965) that efficiently explore the search space and reduce thereby run time complexity in the mean.",
        "We have adapted Balas' algorithm to the special needs of coreference resolution.",
        "First and foremost, this results in an optimization algorithm that treats global constraints intensionally, i.e. that generates instantiations of a constraint only on demand.",
        "Thus, transitivity can be captured for even the longest texts.",
        "But more important, we found out empirically that 'full optimization' is not really needed.",
        "The first consistent solution, which often can be found very fast, is already as good – in terms of F-measure values – as the optimal solution.",
        "This is good news, since it reduces runtime and at same time maintains the empirical results.",
        "We first introduce Zero-One ILP, discuss our baseline model and give an ILP formalization of coreference resolution.",
        "Then we go into the details of our Balas adaptation and provide empirical evidence for our central claim – that optimization search can already be stopped (without quality loss) when the first consistent solution has been found."

        "Unlike its real-valued counterpart, Zero-One ILP is NP-complete (cf., say, (Papadimitriou and Steiglitz, 1998)), but branch-and-bound algorithms with efficient heuristics exist, as the Balas Algorithm: Balas (1965) proposes an approach where the objective function's addends are sorted according to the magnitude of the weights: 0 < w1 < ... < wn.",

        "The Balas algorithm follows a depth-first search while checking feasibility (i.e., through the constraints) of the branches partially explored: Upon branching, the algorithm bounds the cost of setting the current variable xN to 1 by the costs accumulated so far: w1x1 + ... + wN_ixN_i + wN is now the lowest cost this branch may yield.",
        "If, on the contrary, xN is set to 0, a violated >-constraint may only be satisfied via an xi set to 1 (i > N), so the cheapest change to ameliorate the partial solution is to set the right-next variable to 1: w1x1 + ... + wN-1xN-1 + wN+1 would be the cheapest through this branch.",
        "If setting all weights past the branching variable to 0 yields a cheaper solution than the so far minimal solution obtained, then it is worthwile exploring this branch, and the algorithms goes on to the next weighted variable, until it reaches a feasible solution; otherwise it backtracks to the last unexplored branching.",
