        "Second, it employs a chart parser which utilizes manually created syntax rules in addition to scores obtained after statistical processing during speech recognition.",

        "The integration of speech and language technologies plays an important role in speech to text translation.",
        "This paper describes a unification-based active chart parser and how it is utilized for language modeling in speech recognition or speech translation.",
        "The fundamental idea behind the proposed solution is to combine the strengths of unification-based chart parsing and statistical language modeling.",
        "In the solution, all sentence hypotheses, which are represented in word-lattice format at the end of automatic speech recognition (ASR), are parsed simultaneously.",
        "The chart is initialized with the lattice and it is processed until the first sentence hypothesis is selected by the parser.",
        "The parser also utilizes the scores assigned to words during the speech recognition process.",
        "This leads to a hybrid solution.",
        "An important benefit of this approach is that it allows one to make use of the available grammars and parsers for language modeling task.",
        "So as to be used for this task, syntactic analyzer components developed for a rule-based machine translation (RBMT) system are modified.",
        "In speech translation (ST), this approach leads to a perfect integration of the ASR and RBMT components.",
        "Language modeling effort in ASR and syntactic analysis effort in RBMT are overlapped and merged into a single task.",
        "Its advantages are twofold.",
        "First, this allows us to avoid unnecessary duplication of similar jobs.",
        "Secondly, by using the available components, we avoid the difficulty of building a syntactic language model all from the beginning.",
        "There are two basic methods that are being used to integrate ASR and rule-based MT systems: First-best method and the N-best list method.",
        "Both techniques are motivated from a software engineering perspective.",
        "In the First-best approach (Figure 1.a), the ASR module sends a single recognized text to the MT component to translate.",
        "Any ambiguity existing in the recognition process is resolved inside the ASR.",
        "In contrast to the First-best approach, in the N-best List approach (Figure 1.b); the ASR outputs N possible recognition hypotheses to be evaluated by the MT component.",
        "The MT picks the first hypothesis and translates it if it is grammatically correct.",
        "Otherwise, it moves to the second hypothesis and so on.",
        "If none of the available hypotheses are syntactically correct, then it translates the first one.",
        "We propose a new method to couple ASR and rule-based MT system as an alternative to the approaches mentioned above.",
        "Figure 1 represents the two currently in-use coupling methods followed by the new approach we introduce (Figure 1.c).",
        "In the newly proposed technique, which we call the N-best word graph approach, the ASR module outputs a word graph containing all N-best hypotheses.",
        "The MT component parses the word graph, thus, all possible hypotheses at one time.",
        "While integrating the SR system with the rule-based MT system, this study uses word graphs and chart parsing with new extensions.",
        "Parsing of word lattices has been a topic of research over the past decade.",
        "The idea of chart parsing the word graph in SR systems has been previously used in different studies in order to resolve ambiguity.",
        "Tomita (1986) introduced the concept of wordlattice parsing for the purpose of speech recognition and used an LR parser.",
        "Next, Paeseler (1988) used a chart parser to process word-lattices.",
        "However, to the best of our knowledge, the specific method for chart parsing a word graph introduced in this paper has not been previously used for coupling purposes.",
        "Recent studies point out the importance of utilizing word graphs in speech tasks (Dyer et al., 2008).",
        "Previous work on language modeling can be classified according to whether a system uses purely statistical methods or whether it uses them in combination with syntactic methods.",
        "In this paper, the focus is on systems that contain syntactic approaches.",
        "In general, these language modeling approaches try to parse the ASR output in wordlattice format in order to choose the most probable hypothesis.",
        "Chow and Roukos (1989) used a unification-based CYK parser for the purpose of speech understanding.",
        "Chien et al.",
        "(1990) and Weber (1994) utilized probabilistic context free grammars in conjunction with unification grammars to chart-parse a word-lattice.",
        "There are various differences between the work of Chien et al.",
        "(1990) and Weber (1994) and the work presented in this paper.",
        "First, in the previously mentioned studies, the chart is populated with the same word graph that comes from the speech recognizer without any pruning, whereas in our approach the word graph is reduced to an acceptable size.",
        "Otherwise, the efficiency becomes a big challenge because the search space introduced by a chart with over thousands of initial edges can easily be beyond current practical limits.",
        "Another important difference in our approach is the modification of the chart parsing algorithm to eliminate spurious parses.",
        "Ney (1991) deals with the use of probabilistic CYK parser for continous speech recognition task.",
        "Stolcke (1995) summarizes extensively their approach to utilize probabilistic Earley parsing.",
        "Chappelier et al.",
        "(1999) gives an overview of different approaches to integrate linguistic models into speech recognition systems.",
        "They also research various techniques of producing sets of hypotheses that contain more \"semantic\" variability than the commonly used ones.",
        "Some of the recent studies about structural language modeling extract a list of N-best hypotheses using an N-gram and then apply structural methods to decide on the best hypothesis (Chelba, 2000; Roark, 2001).",
        "This contrasts with the approach presented in this study where, instead of a single sentence, the word-lattice is parsed.",
        "Parsing all sentence hypotheses simultaneously enables a reduction in the number of edges produced during the parsing process.",
        "This is because the shared word hypotheses are processed only once compared to the N-best list approach, where the shared words are processed each time they occur in a hypothesis.",
        "Similar to the current work, other studies parse the whole word-lattice without extracting a list (Hall, 2005).",
        "A significant distinction between the work of Hall (2005) and our study is the parsing algorithm.",
        "In contrast to our chart parsing approach augmented by unification based feature structures, Charniak parser is used in Hall (2005)'s along with PCFG.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In the following section, an overview of the proposed language model is presented.",
        "Next, in Section 3, the parsing process of the word-lattice is described in detail.",

        "It is unpractical and unreasonable to parse the lattice in the same form as it is output from the ASR.",
        "Instead, the word graph is pruned to a reasonable size so that it can be parsed according to acceptable time and memory limitations.",

        "The links between the words in the lattice are mapped as the FSM arcs.",

        "Similarly, the words are also on the nodes.",
        "This representation does not fit into the chart definition where the words are on the arcs.",
        "Therefore, the FSM is converted to an arc labeled FSM.",

        "The weights on the arcs represent the negative logarithms of probabilities.",
        "In order to find the weight of a path in the FSM, all weights on the arcs existing on that path are added up.",

        "The FSM is nondeterministic because, at a given state, there are different alternative arcs with the same word label.",
        "Before parsing the converted FSM, it is essential to find an equivalent finite automata that is deterministic and that has as few nodes as possible.",
        "This way, the work necessary during parsing is reduced and efficient processing is ensured.",
        "The minimization process serves to shrink down the FSM to an equivalent automata with a suitable size for parsing.",

        "This corresponds to the top-down parsing strategy.",
        "Bottom-up rules and top-down rules differ in that the former contains a non-terminal that is marked as the trigger or central element on the left-hand-side of the rule.",
        "This central element is the starting point for the execution of the bottom-up rule.",
        "After the central element is matched, the extension continues in a bidirectional manner to complete the missing constituents.",

        "Different from the original implementation of the fundamental rule, the procedure has the additional parameters to define starting and ending node identifiers.",
        "Before creating a new incomplete edge, it is checked whether the node identifiers match or not.",
        "When we consider the chart given in Figure 3, ' 1 boycott 2' and ' 5 goes 6' cannot be combined according to the new fundamental rule in a parse tree because the ending node id, i.e. 2, of the former does not match the starting node id, i.e. 5, of the latter.",
        "In another example, '0 the 1' can be combined with both '1 boy 5' and '1 boycott 2' because their respective node identifiers match.",
