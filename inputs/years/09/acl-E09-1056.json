        "More advanced tools are meant to identify inconsistencies in terminological translations and might prove useful in controlled-language situations (Itagaki et al., 2007).",
        "One approach to translate terms consists in using a domain-specific parallel corpus with standard alignment techniques (Brown et al., 1993) to mine new translations.",
        "Massive amounts of parallel data are certainly available in several pairs of languages for domains such as parliament debates or the like.",
        "However, having at our disposal a domain-specific (e.g. computer science) bitext with an adequate coverage is another issue.",
        "One might argue that domain-specific comparable (or perhaps unrelated) corpora are easier to acquire, in which case context-vector techniques (Rapp, 1995; Fung and McKeown, 1997) can be used to identify the translation of terms.",
        "We certainly agree with that point of view to a certain extent, but as discussed by Morin et al.",
        "(2007), for many specific domains and pairs of languages, such resources simply do not exist.",

        "Langlais and Patry (2007) applied it to the task of translating unknown words in several European languages, an idea investigated as well by Denoual (2007) for a Japanese to English translation task.",

        "We evaluate our analogical engine on the task of translating terms of the medical domain; a domain well-known for its tendency to create new words, many of which being complex lexical constructions.",

        "Let x be a string over an alphabet E, a factorization of x, noted fx, is a sequence of n factors fx = (fx, ■ ■ ■, fx), such that x = fx © fx © ■■■ © fx, where 0 denotes the concatenation operator.",

        "During inference, analogies are recognized independently in the input and the output space, and nothing pre-establishes which subpart of one input form corresponds to which subpart of the output one.",
        "This \"knowledge\" is passively captured thanks to the inductive bias of the learning strategy (an analogy in the input space corresponds to one in the output space).",

        "Indeed, in adverse situations, an exponential number of synchronizations will have to be computed.",
        "Second, the algorithm fails to deliver an expected form in a rather frequent situation where two identical symbols align fortuitously in two strings.",

        "Our implementation of the two rational operations are sketched in Algorithm 1.",

        "To this end, we proposed in (Langlais and Yvon, 2008) to organize the input space into a data structure which supports efficient runtime retrieval.",
