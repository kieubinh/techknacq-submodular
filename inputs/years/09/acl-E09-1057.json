        "On the other hand, the statistical corpus-based approaches select n-gram sequences as candidate terms that are filtered by means of statistical measures.",
        "More recent ATR systems use hybrid approaches that combine both linguistic and statistical information (Frantzi and Ananiadou, 1999).",

        "In a second step, we use frequency information of a general purpose corpus and the n-gram frequencies of the automotive corpus to determine the term specificity.",
        "Our approach is more flexible in the sense that we do not first generate candidate terms based on language-dependent predefined PoS patterns (e.g. for French, N N, N Prep N, and N Adj are typical patterns), but immediately link linguistically motivated phrases in our parallel corpus based on lexical correspondences and syntactic similarity.",
