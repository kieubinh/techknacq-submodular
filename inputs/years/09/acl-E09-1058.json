      "text": [
        "A crucial problem in the design of spoken dialogue systems (SDS) is to decide for incoming recognition hypotheses whether a system should accept (consider correctly recognized), reject (assume misrecognition), or ignore (classify as noise or speech not directed to the system) them.",
        "Obviously, incorrect decisions at this point can have serious negative effects on system usability and user satisfaction.",
        "On the one hand, accepting misrecognized hypotheses leads to misunderstandings and unintended system behaviors which are usually difficult to recover from.",
        "On the other hand, users might get frustrated with a system that behaves too cautiously and rejects or ignores too many utterances.",
        "Thus an important feature in dialogue system engineering is the tradeoff between avoiding task failure (due to misrecognitions) and promoting overall dialogue efficiency, flow, and naturalness.",
        "In this paper, we investigate the use of machine learning trained on a combination of acoustic features and features computed from dialogue context to predict the quality of incoming n-best recognition hypotheses to a SDS.",
        "These predictions are then used to select a \"best\" hypothesis and to decide on appropriate system reactions.",
        "We evaluate this approach in comparison with a baseline system that works in the standard way: always choosing the topmost hypothesis in the n-best list.",
        "In such systems, complex repair strategies are required when the top hypothesis is incorrect.",
        "The main novelty of this work is that we explore the use of predictions from simple statistical User Simulations to re-rank n-best lists ofASR hypotheses.",
        "These User Simulations are now commonly used in statistical learning approaches to dialogue management (Williams and Young, 2003; Schatzmann et al., 2006; Young, 2006; Young et al., 2007; Schatzmann et al., 2007), but they have not been used for context-sensitive ASR before.",
        "In our model, the system's \"belief\" b(h) in a recognition hypothesis h is factored in two parts: the observation probability P (o|h) (approximated by the ASR confidence score) and the User Simulation probability P(h|us, C) of the hypothesis:",
        "where us is the state of the User Simulation in context C. The context is simply a window of dialogue acts in the dialogue history, that the US is sensitive to (see section 3).",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "After a short relation to previous work, we describe the data (Section 5) and derive baseline results (Section 6).",
        "Section 3 describes the User Simulations that we use for re-ranking hypotheses.",
        "Section 7 describes our learning experiments for classifying and selecting from n-best recognition hypotheses and Section 9 reports our results."

        "In psycholinguistics, the idea that human dialogue participants simulate each other to some extent is gaining currency.",
        "(Pickering and Garrod, 2007) write:",
        "\"if B overtly imitates A, then A's comprehension of B's utterance is facilitated by A's memory for A's previous utterance.\"",
        "We explore aspects of this idea in a computational manner.",
        "Similar work in the area of spoken dialogue systems is described below.",
        "(Litman et al., 2000) use acoustic-prosodic information extracted from speech waveforms, together with information derived from their speech recognizer, to automatically predict misrecog-nized turns in a corpus of train-timetable information dialogues.",
        "In our experiments, we also use recognizer confidence scores and a limited number of acoustic-prosodic features (e.g. amplitude in the speech signal) for hypothesis classification, but we also use User Simulation predictions.",
        "(Walker et al., 2000) use a combination of features from the speech recognizer, natural language understanding, and dialogue manager/discourse history to classify hypotheses as correct, partially correct, or misrecognized.",
        "Our work is related to these experiments in that we also combine confidence scores and higher-level features for classification.",
        "However, both (Litman et al., 2000) and (Walker et al., 2000) consider only single-best recognition results and thus use their classifiers as \"filters\" to decide whether the best recognition hypothesis for a user utterance is correct or not.",
        "We go a step further in that we classify n-best hypotheses and then select among the alternatives.",
        "We also explore the use of more dialogue and task-oriented features (e.g. the dialogue move type of a recognition hypothesis) for classification.",
        "(Gabsdil and Lemon, 2004) similarly perform reordering of n-best lists by combining acoustic and pragmatic features.",
        "Their study shows that dialogue features such as the previous system question and whether a hypothesis is the correct answer to a particular question contributed more to classification accuracy than the other attributes.",
        "(Jonson, 2006) classifies recognition hypotheses with labels denoting acceptance, clarification, confirmation and rejection.",
        "These labels were learned in a similar way to (Gabsdil and Lemon, 2004) and correspond to varying levels of confidence, being essentially potential directives to the dialogue manager.",
        "Apart from standard features Jonson includes attributes that account for the whole n-best list, i.e. standard deviation of confidence scores.",
        "As well as the use of a User Simulation, the main difference between our approach and work on hypothesis reordering (e.g. (Chotimongkol and Rudnicky, 2001)) is that we make a decision regarding whether a dialogue system should accept, clarify, reject, or ignore a user utterance.",
        "Like (Gabsdil and Lemon, 2004; Jonson, 2006), our approach is more generally applicable than preceding research, since we frame our methodology in the Information State Update (ISU) approach to dialogue management (Traum et al., 1999) and therefore expect it to be applicable to a range of related multimodal dialogue systems."

        "What makes this study different from the previous work in the area of post-processing of the ASR hypotheses is the incorporation of a User Simulation output as an additional feature.",
        "The history of a dialogue between a user and a dialogue system plays an important role as to what the user might be expected to say next.",
        "As a result, most of the studies mentioned in the previous section make various efforts to capture history by including relevant features directly in their classifiers.",
        "Various statistical User Simulations have been trained on corpora of dialogue data in order to simulate real user behaviour (Schatzmann et al., 2006; Young, 2006; Georgila et al., 2006; Young et al., 2007; Schatzmann et al., 2007).",
        "We developed a simple n-gram User Simulation, using n-grams of dialogue moves.",
        "It treats a dialogue as a sequence of lists of consecutive user and system turns in a high level semantic representation, i.e.",
        "< SpeechAct >, < Task > pairs, for example < provide-info >, < music-genre(punk) >.",
        "It takes as input the n â€“ 1 most recent lists of < SpeechAct >, < Task > pairs in the dialogue history, and uses the statistics in the training set to compute a distribution over the possible next user actions.",
        "If no n-grams match the current history, the model can back-off to n-grams of lower order.",
        "We use this model to assess the likelihood of each candidate ASR hypothesis.",
        "Intuitively, this is the likelihood that the user really would say the hypothesis in the current dialogue situation.",
        "The benefit of using n-gram models is that they are fast and simple to train even on large corpora.",

        "To evaluate performance we use Dialogue Move Accuracy (DMA), a strict variant of Concept Error Rate (CER) as defined by (Boros et al., 1996), which takes into account the semantic aspects of the difference between the classified utterance and the true transcription.",
        "CER is similar to WER, since it takes into account deletions, insertions and substitutions on the semantic (rather than the word) level of the utterance.",
        "DMA is stricter than CER in the sense that it does not allow for partial matches in the semantic representation.",
        "In other words, if the classified utterance corresponds to the same semantic representation as the transcribed then we have 100% DMA, otherwise 0%.",
        "Sentence Accuracy (SA) is the alignment of a single hypothesis in the n-best list with the true transcription.",

        "For each utterance we have a series of files of 60-best lists produced by the speech recogniser, namely the transcription hypotheses on a sentence level along with the acoustic model score and the equivalent transcriptions on a word level, with information such as the duration of each recognised frame and the confidence score of the acoustic and language model of each word.",
        "We transcribed all user utterances and parsed the transcriptions offline using a natural language understanding component (a robust Keyword Parser) in order to get a gold-standard labeling of the data.",
        "We devised four labels with decreasing order of confidence: 'opt' (optimal), 'pos' (positive), 'neg' (negative), 'ign' (ignore).",
        "These are automatically generated using two different modules: a keyword parser that computes the < SpeechAct >< Task > pair as described in the previous section and a Levenshtein Distance calculator, for the computation of the DMA and WER of each hypothesis respectively.",
        "The reason for opting for a more abstract level, namely the semantics of the hypotheses rather than individual word recognition, is that in SDS it is usually sufficient to rely on the meaning of message that is being conveyed by the user rather than the precise words that they used.",
        "Similar to (Gabsdil and Lemon, 2004; Jonson, 2006) we ascribe to each utterance either of the 'opt', 'pos', 'neg', 'ign' labels according to the following schema:",
        "â€¢ opt: The hypothesis is perfectly aligned and semantically identical to the transcription",
        "â€¢ pos: The hypothesis is not entirely aligned (WER < 50) but is semantically identical to the transcription",
        "â€¢ neg: The hypothesis is semantically identical to the transcription but does not align well (WER > 50) or is semantically different to the transcription",
        "â€¢ ign: The hypothesis was not addressed to the system (crosstalk), or the user laughed, coughed, etc.",
        "The 50% value for the WER as a threshold for the distinction between the 'pos' and 'neg' category is adopted from (Gabsdil, 2003), based on the fact that WER is affected by concept accuracy (Boros et al., 1996).",
        "In other words, if a hypothesis is erroneous as far as its transcript is concerned",

        "We find a 37.36% relative increase in F1-measure and 34.02% increase in the accuracy compared to the 3rd experiment, which contains all but the User Simulation score attribute and a 66.20% relative increase of the accuracy compared to the Baseline.",
        "In table 7 we make note of a rather low recall measure for the 'ign' category in the case of the LF experiment, suggesting that the list features do not add extra value to the classifier, partially validating the Information Gain measure (Table 3).",
        "Taking a closer look at the 4th experiment with all 13 features we notice in table 9 that most errors occur between the 'pos' and 'neg' category.",
        "In fact, for the 'neg' category the False Positive Rate (FPR) is 18.17% and for the 'pos' 8.9%, all in all a lot larger than for the other categories.",
        "In these experiments we measure WER, DMA and SA for the system as a whole.",
        "In order to make sure that the improvement noted was really attributed to the classifier we computed the p-values for each of these measures using the Wilcoxon signed rank test for WER and McNemar chi-square test for the DMA and SA measures.",
        "In table 10 we note that the classifier scores 45.27% WER making a notable relative reduction of 5.13% compared to the baseline and 78.22% DMA incurring a relative improvement of 4.22%.",
        "The classifier scored 42.26% on SA but it was not considered significant compared to the baseline (0.05 < p < 0.10).",
        "Comparing the classifier's performance with the Oracle it achieves a 44.06% of the possible WER improvement on this data, 61.55% for the DMA measure and 37.16% for the SA measure.",
        "Finally, we also notice that the Oracle has a of the n-best lists did not include at all a hypothesis that matched semantically to the true transcript.",

        "This prediction was used to re-rank n-best hypotheses of a speech recognizer for a corpus of 2564 user utterances.",
        "The results, obtained using TiMBL and an n-gram User Simulation, show a significant relative reduction of Word Error Rate of 5% (this is 44% of the possible WER improvement on this data), and 62% of the possible Dialogue Move Accuracy improvement, compared to the baseline policy of selecting the topmost ASR hypothesis.",
