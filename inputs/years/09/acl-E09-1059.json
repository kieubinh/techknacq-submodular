        "The growth of the Internet as a commerce medium, and particularly the Web 2.0 phenomenon of user-generated content, have resulted in the proliferation of massive numbers ofproduct, service and merchant reviews.",
        "While this means that users have plenty of information on which to base their purchasing decisions, in practice this is often too much information for a user to absorb.",
        "To alleviate this information overload, research on systems that automatically aggregate and summarize opinions have been gaining interest (Hu and Liu, 2004a; Hu and Liu, 2004b; Gamon et al., 2005; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Carenini et al., 2005; Carenini et al., 2006; Zhuang et al., 2006; Blair-Goldensohn et al., 2008).",
        "Evaluating these systems has been a challenge, however, due to the number of human judgments required to draw meaningful conclusions.",
        "Often systems are evaluated piecemeal, selecting pieces that can be evaluated easily and automatically (Blair-Goldensohn et al., 2008).",
        "While this technique produces meaningful evaluations of the selected components, other components remain untested, and the overall effectiveness of the entire system as a whole remains unknown.",
        "When systems are evaluated end-to-end by human judges, the studies are often small, consisting of only a handful of judges and data points (Carenini et al., 2006).",
        "Furthermore, automated summarization metrics like ROUGE (Lin and Hovy, 2003) are non-trivial to adapt to this domain as they require human curated outputs.",
        "We present the results of a large-scale, end-to-end human evaluation of three sentiment summarization models applied to user reviews of consumer products.",
        "The evaluation shows that there is no significant difference in rater preference between any of the sentiment summarizers, but that raters do prefer sentiment summarizers over non-sentiment baselines.",
        "This indicates that even simple sentiment summarizers provide users utility.",
        "An analysis of the rater judgments also indicates that there are identifiable situations where one sentiment summarizer is generally preferred over the others.",
        "We attempt to learn these preferences by training a ranking SVM that exploits the set of preference judgments collected during the evaluation.",
        "Experiments show that the ranking SVM summarizer's cross-validation error decreases by as much as 30% over the previous best model.",

        "A standard setting for sentiment summarization assumes a set of documents D = [d\\,... ,dm} that contain opinions about some entity ofinterest.",
        "The goal of the system is to generate a summary S of that entity that is representative of the average opinion and speaks to its important aspects.",
        "An example summary is given in figure 1.",
        "For simplicity we assume that all opinions in D are about the entity being summarized.",
        "When this assumption fails, one can parse opinions at a finer-level (Jindal and Liu, 2006; Stoyanov and Cardie, 2008) In this study, we look at an extractive summarization setting where S is built by extracting representative bits of text from the set D, subject to pre-specified length constraints.",
        "Specifically, assume each document di is segmented into candidate text excerpts.",
        "For ease of discussion we will assume all excerpts are sentences, but in practice they can be phrases or multi-sentence groups.",
        "Viewed this way, D is a set of candidate sentences for our summary, D = [s\\,... ,sn}, and summarization becomes the following optimization:",
        "where L is some score over possible summaries, length(S) is the length of the summary and K is the pre-specified length constraint.",
        "The definition of L will be the subject of much of this section and it is precisely different forms of L that will be compared in our evaluation.",
        "The nature of length is specific to the particular use case.",
        "Solving equation 1 is typically NP-hard, even under relatively strong independence assumptions between the sentences selected for the summary (McDonald, 2007).",
        "In cases where solving L is non-trivial we use an approximate hill climbing technique.",
        "First we randomly initialize the summary S to length <~-K. Then we greedily insert/delete/swap sentences in and out of the summary to maximize L(S) while maintaining the bound on length.",
        "We run this procedure until no operation leads to a higher scoring summary.",
        "In all our experiments convergence was quick, even when employing random restarts.",
        "Alternate formulations of sentiment summarization are possible, including aspect-based summarization (Hu and Liu, 2004a), abstractive summarization (Carenini et al., 2006) or related tasks such as opinion attribution (Choi et al., 2005).",
        "We choose a purely extractive formulation as it makes it easier to develop baselines and allows raters to compare summaries with a simple, consistent presentation format.",
        "Before delving into the details of the summarization models we must first define some useful functions.",
        "The first is the sentiment polarity function that maps a lexical item t, e.g., word or short phrase, to a real-valued score,",
        "The LEX-SENT function maps items with positive polarity to higher values and items with negative polarity to lower values.",
        "To build this function we constructed large sentiment lexicons by seeding a semantic word graph induced from WordNet with positive and negative examples and then propagating this score out across the graph with a decaying confidence.",
        "This method is common among sentiment analysis systems (Hu and Liu, 2004a; Kim and Hovy, 2004; Blair-Goldensohn et al., 2008).",
        "In particular, we use the lexicons that were created and evaluated by Blair-Goldensohn et al.",
        "(2008).",
        "Next we define sentiment intensity, which simply measures the magnitude of sentiment in a sentence.",
        "intensity can be viewed as a measure of subjectiveness irrespective of polarity.",
        "A central function in all our systems is a sentences normalized sentiment,",
        "/ x Etes LEX-SENT(t)",
        "a + INTENSITY(s)",
        "This function measures the (signed) ratio oflexical sentiment to intensity in a sentence.",
        "Sentences that only contain lexical items of the same polarity will have high absolute normalized sentiment, whereas sentences with mixed polarity items or no polarity items will have a normalized sentiment near zero.",
        "We include the constant a in the denominator so that sent gives higher absolute scores to sentences containing many strong sentiment items of the same polarity over sentences with a small number of weak items of the same polarity.",
        "Most sentiment summarizers assume that as input, a system is given an overall rating of the entity it is attempting to summarize, R G [ – 1,1], where a higher rating indicates a more favorable opinion.",
        "This rating may be obtained directly from user provided information (e.g., star ratings) or automatically derived by averaging the sent function over all sentences in D. Using R, we can define a mismatch function between the sentiment of a summary and the known sentiment of the entity,",
        "Summaries with a higher mismatch are those whose sentiment disagrees most with R.",
        "Another key input many sentiment summarizers assume is a list of salient entity aspects, which are specific properties of an entity that people tend to rate when expressing their opinion.",
        "For example, aspects of a digital camera could include picture quality, battery life, size, color, value, etc.",
        "Finding such aspects is a challenging research problem that has been addressed in a number of ways (Hu and Liu, 2004b; Gamon et al., 2005; Carenini et al., 2005; Zhuang et al., 2006; Branavan et al., 2008; Blair-Goldensohn et al., 2008; Titov and McDonald, 2008b; Titov and McDonald, 2008a).",
        "We denote the set of aspects for an entity as A and each aspect as a g A.",
        "Furthermore, we assume that given A it is possible to determine whether some sentence s g D mentions an aspect in A.",
        "For our experiments we use a hybrid supervised-unsupervised method for finding aspects as described and evaluated in Blair-Goldensohn et al.",
        "(2008).",
        "Having defined what an aspect is, we next define a summary diversity function over aspects, diversity(S) = ^ coverage(a) where coverage(a) g r is a function that weights how well the aspect is covered in the summary and is proportional to the importance of the aspect as some aspects are more important to cover than others, e.g., \"picture quality\" versus \"strap\" for digital cameras.",
        "The diversity function rewards summaries that cover many important aspects and plays the redundancy reducing role that is common in most extractive summarization frameworks (Goldstein et al., 2000).",
        "For our evaluation we developed three extractive sentiment summarization systems.",
        "Each system models increasingly complex objectives.",
        "The first system that we look at attempts to extract sentences so that the average sentiment of the summary is as close as possible to the entity level sentiment R, which was previously defined in section 2.1.",
        "In this case l can be simply defined as,",
        "Thus, the model prefers summaries with average sentiment as close as possible to the average sentiment across all the reviews.",
        "There is an obvious problem with this model.",
        "For entities that have a mediocre rating, i.e., R w 0, the model could prefer a summary that only contains sentences with no opinion whatsoever.",
        "There are two ways to alleviate this problem.",
        "The first is to include the intensity function into L,",
        "Where the coefficients allow one to trade-off sentiment intensity versus sentiment mismatch.",
        "The second method, and the one we chose based on initial experiments, was to address the problem at inference time.",
        "This is done by prohibiting the algorithm from including a given positive or negative sentence in the summary if another more positive/negative sentence is not included.",
        "Thus the summary is forced to consist of only the most positive and most negative sentences, the exact mix being dependent upon the overall star rating.",
        "The SM model extracts sentences for the summary without regard to the content of each sentence relative to the others in the summary.",
        "This is in contrast to standard summarization models that look to promote sentence diversity in order to cover as many important topics as possible (Goldstein et al., 2000).",
        "The sentiment match + aspect coverage system (SMAC) attempts to model diversity by building a summary that trades-off maximally covering important aspects with matching the overall sentiment of the entity.",
        "The model does this through the following linear score,",
        "This score function rewards summaries for being highly subjective (intensity), reflecting the overall product rating (mismatch), and covering a variety of product aspects (diversity).",
        "The coefficients were set by inspection.",
        "This system has its roots in event-based summarization (Filatova and Hatzivassiloglou, 2004) for the news domain.",
        "In that work an optimization problem was developed that attempted to maximize summary informativeness while covering as many (weighted) sub-events as possible.",
        "Because the SMAC model only utilizes an entity's overall sentiment when calculating mismatch, it is susceptible to degenerate solutions.",
        "Consider a product with aspects A and B, where reviewers overwhelmingly like A and dislike B, resulting in an overall sent close to zero.",
        "If the SMAC model finds a very negative sentence describing A and a very positive sentence describing B, it will assign that summary a high score, as the summary has high intensity, has little overall mismatch, and covers both aspects.",
        "However, in actuality, the summary is entirely misleading.",
        "To address this issue, we constructed the sentiment-aspect match model (SAM), which not only attempts to cover important aspects, but cover them with appropriate sentiment.",
        "There are many ways one might design a model to do this, including linear combinations of functions similar to the SMAC model.",
        "However, we decided to employ a probabilistic approach as it provided performance benefits based on development data experiments.",
        "Under the SAM model, each sentence is treated as a bag of aspects and their corresponding mentions' sentiments.",
        "For a given sentence s, we define Asas the set of aspects mentioned within it.",
        "For a given aspect a G As, we denote sent(as) as the sentiment associated with the textual mention of a in s. The probability of a sentence is defined as, which can be rewritten as,",
        "aeAs aeAs",
        "if we assume aspect mentions are generated independently of one another.",
        "Thus we need to estimate both p(a) and p(sent(as)|a).",
        "The probability of seeing an aspect, p(a), is simply set to the maximum likelihood estimates over the data set D. Furthermore, we assume that p(sent(as)|a) is normal about the mean sentiment for the aspect /xa with a constant standard deviation, <ra.",
        "The mean and standard deviation are estimated straightforwardly using the data set D. Note that the number of parameters our system must estimate is very small.",
        "For every possible aspect a G A we need three values: p(a), /xa, and <ra.",
        "Since | A| is typically small - on the order of 5-10 - it is not difficult to estimate these models even from small sets of data.",
        "Having constructed this model, one logical approach to summarization would be to select sentences for the summary that have highest probability under the model trained on D. We found, however, that this produced very redundant summaries - if one aspect is particularly prevalent in a product's reviews, this approach will select all sentences about that aspect, and discuss nothing else.",
        "To combat this we developed a technique that scores the summary as a whole, rather than by individual components.",
        "First, denote sam(D) as the previously described model learned over the set of entity documents D. Next, denote sam(S) as an identical model, but learned over a candidate summary S, i.e., given a summary S, compute p(a), ma, and aa for all a G A using only the sentences from S. We can then measure the difference between these models using KL-divergence:",
        "In our case we have 1 + |A| distributions - p(a), and p( |a) for all a G A - so we just sum the KL-divergence of each.",
        "The key property of the SAM system is that it naturally builds summaries where important aspects are discussed with appropriate sentiment, since it is precisely these aspects that will contribute the most to the KL-divergence.",
        "It is important to note that the short length of a candidate summary S can make estimates in sam(S) rather crude.",
        "But we only care about finding the \"best\" of a set of crude models, not about finding one that is \"good\" in absolute terms.",
        "Between the few parameters we must learn and the specific way we use these models, we generally get models useful for our purposes.",
        "Alternatively we could have simply incorporated the diversity measure into the objective function or used an inference algorithm that specifically accounts for redundancy, e.g., maximal marginal relevance (Goldstein et al., 2000).",
        "However, we found that this solution was well grounded and required no tuning of coefficients.",
        "Initial experiments indicated that the SAM system, as described above, frequently returned sentences with low intensity when important aspects had lukewarm sentiment.",
        "To combat this we removed low intensity sentences from consideration, which had the effect of encouraging important lukewarm aspects to mentioned multiple times in order to balance the overall sentiment.",
        "Though the particulars of this model are unique, fundamentally it is closest to the work of Hu and",

        "These observations suggest that we could build a new system that takes into account all these factors (weighted accordingly) or we could build a rule-based meta-classifier that selects a single summary from the four systems described in this paper based on the global characteristics of each.",
        "The problem with the former is that it will require hand-tuning of coefficients for many different signals that are all, for the most part, weakly correlated to summary quality.",
        "The problem with the latter is inefficiency, i.e., it will require the maintenance and output of all four systems.",
        "In the next section we explore an alternate method that leverages the data gathered in the evaluation to automatically learn a new model.",
        "This approach is beneficial as it will allow any coefficients to be automatically tuned and will result in a single model that can be used to build new summaries."

        "Besides allowing us to assess the relative performance of our summarizers, our evaluation produced several hundred points of empirical data indicating which among two summaries raters prefer.",
        "In this section we explore how to build improved summarizers with this data by learning preference ranking SVMs, which are designed to learn relative to a set of preference judgments (Joachims, 2002).",
        "A ranking SVM typically assumes as input a set of queries and associated partial ordering on the items returned by the query.",
        "The training data is defined as pairs of points, T = {(xk, xk)t}tT='i, where each pair indicates that the ith item is preferred over the jth item for the kth query.",
        "Each input point xk G Rm is a feature vector representing the properties of that particular item relative to the query.",
        "The goal is to learn a scoring function s(xk) G R such that s(xk) > s(xk) if (xk, xk) G T. In other words, a ranking SVM learns a scoring function whose induced ranking over data points respects all preferences in the training data.",
        "The most straightforward scoring function, and the one used here, is a linear classifier, s(xk) = w • xk, making the goal of learning to find an appropriate weight vector w G Rm.",
        "In its simplest form, the ranking SVM optimization problem can be written as the following quadratic programming problem, where pref(xk, xk) G R is a function indicating to what degree item xk is preferred over xk (and serves as the margin of the classifier).",
        "This optimization is well studied and can be solved with a wide variety of techniques.",
        "In our experiments we used the SVM-light software package.",
        "Our summarization evaluation provides us with precisely a large collection of preference points over different summaries for different product queries.",
        "Thus, we naturally have a training set T where each query is analogous to a specific product of interest and training points are two possible summarizations produced by two different systems with corresponding rater preferences.",
        "Assuming an appropriate choice of feature representation it is straightforward to then train the model on our data using standard techniques for SVMs.",
        "To train and test the model we compiled 1906 pairs of summary comparisons, each judged by three different raters.",
        "These pairs were extracted from the four experiments described in section 3 as well as the additional experiments we ran during development.",
        "For each pair of summaries (Sk, Sk) (for some product query indexed by k), we recorded how many raters preferred each ofthe items as vk and vk respectively, i.e., vk is the number of the three raters who preferred summary Si over Sj for product k. Note that vk + vk does not necessarily equal 3 since some raters expressed no preference between them.",
        "We set the loss function pref(Sk ,Sk) = vk – vk, which in some cases could be zero, but never negative since the pairs are ordered.",
        "Note that this training set includes all data points, even those in which raters disagreed.",
        "This is important as the model can still learn from these points as the margin function PREF encodes the fact that these judgments are less certain.",
        "We used a variety of features for a candidate summary: how much capitalization, punctuation, pros-cons, and (unique) aspects a summary had; the overall intensity, sentiment, min sentence sentiment, and max sentence sentiment in the summary; the overall rating R of the product; and conjunctions of these.",
        "Note that none of these features encode which system produced the summary or which experiment it was drawn from.",
        "This is important, as it allows the model to be used as standalone scoring function, i.e., we can set L to the learned linear classifier s(S).",
        "Alternatively we could have included features like what system was the summary produced from.",
        "This would have helped the model learn things like the SMAC system is typically preferred for products with midrange overall ratings.",
        "Such a model could only be used to rank the outputs of other summarizers and cannot be used standalone.",
        "We evaluated the trained model by measuring its accuracy on predicting a single preference prediction, i.e., given pairs of summaries (Sk, Sk), how accurate is the model at predicting that Si is preferred to Sj for product query k?",
        "We measured 10-fold cross-validation accuracy on the subset of the data for which the raters were in agreement.",
        "We measure accuracy for both weak agreement cases (at least one rater indicated a preference and the other two raters were in agreement or had no preference) and strong agreement cases (all three raters indicated the same preference).",
        "We ignored pairs in which all three raters made a no preference judgment as both summaries can can be considered equally valid.",
        "Furthermore, we ignored pairs in which two raters indicated conflicting preferences as there is no gold standard for such cases.",
        "Results are given in table 2.",
        "We compare the ranking SVM summarizer to a baseline system that always selects the overall-better-performing summarization system from the experiment that the given datapoint was drawn from, e.g., for all the data points drawn from the SAM versus SMAC experiment, the baseline always chooses the SAM summary as its preference.",
        "Note that in most experiments the two systems emerged in a statistical tie, so this baseline performs only slightly better than chance.",
        "Table 2 clearly shows that the ranking SVM can predict preference accuracy much better than chance, and much better than that obtained by using only one summarizer (a reduction in error of 30% for strong agreement cases).",
        "We can thus conclude that the data gathered in human preference evaluation experiments, such as the one presented here, have a beneficial secondary use as training data for constructing a new and more accurate summarizer.",
        "This raises an interesting line of future research: can we iterate this process to build even better summarizers?",
        "That is, can we use this trained summarizer (and variants of it) to generate more examples for raters to judge, and then use that data to learn even more powerful summarizers, which in turn could be used to generate even more training judgments, etc.",
        "This could be accomplished using Mechanical Turk or another framework for gathering large quantities of cheap annotations."
