        "The variation of data between years allows for a comprehensive analysis of the robustness of features, but poses a challenge for building a combined corpus which can be used for training and testing.",

        "The input to a summarization system significantly affects the quality of the summary that can be produced for it, by either a person or an automatic method.",
        "Some inputs are difficult and summaries produced by any approach will tend to be poor, while other inputs are easy and systems will exhibit good performance.",
        "User satisfaction with the summaries can be improved, for example by automatically flagging summaries for which a system expects to perform poorly.",
        "In such cases the user can ignore the summary and avoid the frustration of reading poor quality text.",
        "(Brandow et al., 1995) describes an intelligent summarizer system that could identify documents which would be difficult to summarize based on structural properties.",
        "Documents containing question/answer sessions, speeches, tables and embedded lists were identified based on patterns and these features were used to determine whether an acceptable summary can be produced.",
        "If not, the inputs were flagged as unsuitable for automatic summarization.",
        "In our work, we provide deeper insight into how other characteristics of the text itself and properties of document clusters can be used to identify difficult inputs.",
        "The task of predicting the confidence in system performance for a given input is in fact relevant not only for summarization, but in general for all applications aimed at facilitating information access.",
        "In question answering for example, a system may be configured not to answer questions for which the confidence of producing a correct answer is low, and in this way increase the overall accuracy of the system whenever it does produce an answer (Brill et al., 2002; Dredze and Czuba, 2007).",
        "Similarly in machine translation, some sentences might contain difficult to translate phrases, that is, portions of the input are likely to lead to garbled output if automatic translation is attempted.",
        "Automatically identifying such phrases has the potential of improving MT as shown by an oracle study (Mohit and Hwa, 2007).",
        "More recent work (Birch et al., 2008) has shown that properties of reordering, source and target language complexity and relatedness can be used to predict translation quality.",
        "In information retrieval, the problem of predicting system performance has generated considerable interest and has led to notably good results (Cronen-Townsend et al., 2002; Yom-Tov et al., 2005; Carmel et al., 2006)."

        "In summarization, researchers have recognized that some inputs might be more successfully handled by a particular subsystem (McKeown et al., 2001), but little work has been done to qualify the general characteristics of inputs that lead to suboptimal performance of systems.",
        "Only recently the issue has drawn attention: (Nenkova and Louis, 2008) present an initial analysis of the factors that influence system performance in content selection.",
        "This study was based on results from the Document Understanding Conference (DUC) evaluations (Over et al., 2007) of multi-document summarization of news.",
        "They showed that input, system identity and length of the target summary were all significant factors affecting summary quality.",
        "Longer summaries were consistently better than shorter ones for the same input, so improvements can be easy in applications where varying target size is possible.",
        "Indeed, varying summary size is desirable in many situations (Kaisser et al., 2008).",
        "The most predictive factor of summary quality was input identity, prompting a closer investigation of input properties that are indicative of deterioration in performance.",
        "For example, summaries of articles describing different opinions about an issue or of articles describing multiple distinct events of the same type were of overall poor quality, while summaries of more focused inputs, dealing with descriptions of a single event, subject or person (biographical), were on average better.",
        "A number of features were defined, capturing aspects of how focused on a single topic a given input is.",
        "Analysis of the predictive power of the features was done using only one year of DUC evaluations.",
        "Data from later evaluations was used to train and test a logistic regression classifier for prediction of expected system performance.",
        "The task could be performed with accuracy of 61.45%, significantly above chance levels.",
        "The results also indicated that special care needs to be taken when pooling data from different evaluations into a single dataset.",
        "Feature selection performed on data from one year was not useful for prediction on data from other years, and actually led to worse performance than using all features.",
        "Moreover, directly indicating which evaluation the data came from was the most predictive feature when testing on data from more than one year.",
        "In the work described here, we show how the approach for predicting performance confidence can be improved considerably by paying special attention to the way data from different years is combined, as well as by adopting alternative task formulations (pairwise comparisons of inputs instead of binary class prediction), and utilizing more representative examples for good and bad performance.",
        "We also extend the analysis to single document summarization, for which predicting system performance turns out to be much more accurate than for multi-document summarization.",
        "We address three key questions.",
        "What features are predictive ofperformance on a given input?",
        "In Section 4, we discuss four classes of features capturing properties of the input, related to input size, information-theoretic properties of the distribution of words in the input, presence of descriptive (topic) words and similarity between the documents in multi-document inputs.",
        "Rather than using a single year of evaluations for the analysis, we report correlation with expected system performance for all years and tasks, showing that in fact the power of these features varies considerably across years (Section 5).",
        "How to combine data from different years?",
        "The available data spans several years of summarization evaluations.",
        "Between years, systems change, as well as number of systems and average input difficulty.",
        "All of these changes impact system performance and make data from different years difficult to analyze when taken together.",
        "Still, one would want to combine all of the available evaluations in order to have more data for developing machine learning models.",
        "In Section 6 we demonstrate that this indeed can be achieved, by normalizing within each year by the highest observed performance and only then combining the data.",
        "How to define input difficulty?",
        "There are several possible definitions of \"input difficulty\" or \"good performance\".",
        "All the data can be split in two binary classes of \"good\" and \"bad\" performance respectively, or only representative examples in which there is a clear difference in performance can be used.",
        "In Section 7 we show that these alternatives can dramatically influence prediction accuracy: using representative examples improves accuracy by more than 10%.",
        "Formulating the task as ranking of two inputs, predicting which one is more difficult, also turns out to be helpful, offering more data even within the same year of evaluation.",
        "We use the data from single-and multi-document evaluations performed as part of the Document Understanding Conferences (Over et al., 2007) from 2001 to 2004.",
        "Generic multi-document summarization was evaluated in all of these years, single document summaries were evaluated only in 2001 and 2002.",
        "We use the 100-word summaries from both tasks.",
        "In the years 2002-2004, systems were evaluated respectively on 59, 37 and 100 (50 for generic summarization and 50 biographical) multi-document inputs.",
        "There were 149 inputs for single document summarization in 2001 and 283 inputs in 2002.",
        "Combining the datasets from the different years yields a collection of 432 observations for single-document summarization, and 196 for multi-document summarization.",
        "Input difficulty, or equivalently expected confidence of system performance, was defined empirically, based on actual content selection evaluations of system summaries.",
        "More specifically, expected performance for each input was defined as the average coverage score of all participating systems evaluated on that input.",
        "In this way, the performance confidence is not specific to any given system, but instead reflects what can be expected from automatic summarizers in general.",
        "The coverage score was manually computed by NIST evaluators.",
        "It measures content selection by estimating overlap between a human model and a system summary.",
        "The scale for the coverage score was different in 2001 compared to other years: 0 to 4 scale, switching to a 0 to 1 scale later."
