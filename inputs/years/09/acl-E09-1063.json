        "State-of-the-art Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) requires a certain amount of bilingual corpora as training data in order to achieve competitive results.",
        "The only assumption of most current statistical models (Brown et al., 1993; Vogel et al., 1996; Deng and Byrne, 2005) is that the aligned sentences in such corpora should be segmented into sequences of tokens that are meant to be words.",
        "Therefore, for languages where word boundaries are not orthographically marked, tools which segment a sentence into words are required.",
        "However, this segmentation is normally performed as a preprocessing step using various word segmenters.",
        "Moreover, most of these segmenters are usually trained on a manually segmented domainspecific corpus, which is not adapted for the specific translation task at hand given that the manual segmentation is performed in a monolingual context.",
        "Consequently, such segmenters cannot produce consistently good results when used across different domains.",
        "A substantial amount of research has been carried out to address the problems of word segmentation.",
        "However, most research focuses on combining various segmenters either in SMT training or decoding (Dyer et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2008).",
        "One important yet often neglected fact is that the optimal segmentation of the source (target) language is dependent on the target (source) language itself, its domain and its genre.",
        "Segmentation considered to be \"good\" from a monolingual point of view may be unadapted for training alignment models or PB-SMT decoding (Ma et al., 2007).",
        "The resulting segmentation will consequently influence the performance of an SMT system.",
        "In this paper, we propose a bilingually motivated automatically domain-adapted approach for SMT.",
        "We utilise a small bilingual corpus with the relevant language segmented into basic writing units (e.g. characters for Chinese or kana for Japanese).",
        "Our approach consists of using the output from an existing statistical word aligner to obtain a set of candidate \"words\".",
        "We evaluate the reliability of these candidates using simple metrics based on co-occurrence frequencies, similar to those used in associative approaches to word alignment (Melamed, 2000).",
        "We then modify the segmentation of the respective sentences in the parallel corpus according to these candidate words; these modified sentences are then given back to the word aligner, which produces new alignments.",
        "We evaluate the validity of our approach by measuring the influence of the segmentation process on Chinese-to-English Machine Translation (MT) tasks in two different domains.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organised as follows.",
        "In section 2, we study the influence of word segmentation on PB-SMT across different domains.",
        "Section 3 describes the working mechanism of our bilingually motivated word segmentation approach.",
        "In section 4, we illustrate the adaptation of our decoder to this segmentation scheme.",
        "The experiments conducted in two different domains are reported in Section 5 and 6.",
        "We discuss related work in section 7.",
        "Section 8 concludes and gives avenues for future work.",
        "2 The Influence of Word Segmentation on SMT: A Pilot Investigation",
        "The monolingual word segmentation step in traditional SMT systems has a substantial impact on the performance of such systems.",
        "A considerable amount of recent research has focused on the influence of word segmentation on SMT (Ma et al., 2007; Chang et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2008); however, most explorations focused on the impact of various segmentation guidelines and the mechanisms of the segmenters themselves.",
        "A current research interest concerns consistency of performance across different domains.",
        "From our experiments, we show that monolingual segmenters cannot produce consistently good results when applied to a new domain.",
        "Our pilot investigation into the influence of word segmentation on SMT involves three off-the-shelf Chinese word segmenters including ICTCLAS (ICT) Olympic version, LDC seg-menter and Stanford segmenter version 2006-0511.",
        "Both ICTCLAS and Stanford segmenters utilise machine learning techniques, with Hidden conditional random fields for the Stanford segmenter (Tseng et al., 2005).",
        "Both segmentation models were trained on news domain data with named entity recognition functionality.",
        "The LDC segmenter is dictionary-based with word frequency information to help disambiguation, both of which are collected from data in the news domain.",
        "We used Chinese character-based and manual segmentations as contrastive segmentations.",
        "The experiments were carried out on a range of data sizes from news and dialogue domains using a state-of-the-art Phrase-Based SMT (PB-SMT) system â€“ Moses (Koehn et al., 2007).",
        "The performance of PB-SMT system is measured with Bleu score (Papineni et al., 2002).",
        "We firstly measure the influence of word segmentation on in-domain data with respect to the three above mentioned segmenters, namely UN data from the NIST 2006 evaluation campaign.",
        "As can be seen from Table 1, using monolingual segmenters achieves consistently better SMT performance than character-based segmentation (CS) on different data sizes, which means character-based segmentation is not good enough for this domain where the vocabulary tends to be large.",
        "We can also observe that the ICT and Stanford segmenter consistently outperform the LDC segmenter.",
        "Even using 3M sentence pairs for training, the differences between them are still statistically significant (p < 0.05) using approximate randomisation (Noreen, 1989) for significance testing.",
        "However, when tested on out-of-domain data, i.e. IWSLT data in the dialogue domain, the results seem to be more difficult to predict.",
        "We trained the system on different sizes of data and evaluated the system on two test sets: IWSLT 2006 and 2007.",
        "From Table 2, we can see that on the IWSLT 2006 test sets, LDC achieves consistently good results and the Stanford segmenter is the worst.",
        "Furthermore, the character-based segmentation also achieves competitive results.",
        "On IWSLT 2007, all monolingual segmenters outperform character-based segmentation and the LDC segmenter is only slightly better than the other segmenters.",
        "From the experiments reported above, we can reach the following conclusions.",
        "First of all, character-based segmentation cannot achieve state-of-the-art results in most experimental SMT settings.",
        "This also motivates the necessity to work on better segmentation strategies.",
        "Second, monolingual segmenters cannot achieve consistently good results when used in another domain.",
        "In the following sections, we propose a bilingually motivated segmentation approach which can be automatically derived from a small representative data set and the experiments show that we can consistently obtain state-of-the-art results in different domains.",

        "This very simple measure is frequently used in associative approaches (Melamed, 2000).",
        "The second measure is the alignment confidence (Ma et al., 2007), defined as where C(ai) denotes the number of alignments proposed by the word aligner that are identical to ai.",
        "In other words, AC(ai) measures how often the aligner aligns Ci and ei when they co-occur.",
        "We also impose that | Ci | < k, where k is a fixed integer that may depend on the language pair (between 3 and 5 in practice).",

        "Our bilingually motivated segmentation approach has to overcome another challenge in order to produce competitive results, i.e. data sparseness.",
        "Given that our segmentation is based on bilingual dictionaries, the segmentation process can significantly increase the size of the vocabulary, which could potentially lead to a data sparseness problem when the size of the training data is small.",
        "Tables 7 and 8 list the statistics of the Chinese side of the training data, including the total vocabulary (Voc), number of character vocabulary (Char.voc) in Voc, and the running words (Run.words) when different word segmentations were used.",
        "From Table 7, we can see that our approach suffered from data sparseness on the NIST task, i.e. a large vocabulary was generated, of which a considerable amount of characters still remain as separate words.",
        "On the IWSLT task, since the dictionary generation process is more conservative, we maintained a reasonable vocabulary size, which contributed to the final good performance.",
        "The experimental results reported above are based on a small training corpus containing roughly 40,000 sentence pairs.",
        "We are particularly interested in the performance of our segmentation approach when it is scaled up to larger amounts of data.",
        "Given that the optimisation of the bilingual dictionary is computationally intensive, it is impractical to directly extract candidate words and estimate their reliability.",
        "As an alternative, we can use the obtained bilingual dictionary optimised on the small corpus to perform segmentation on the larger corpus.",
        "We expect competitive results when the small corpus is a representative sample of the larger corpus and large enough to produce reliable bilingual dictionaries without suffering severely from data sparseness.",
        "As we can see from Table 9, our segmentation approach achieved consistent results on both IWSLT 2006 and 2007 test sets.",
        "On the NIST task (cf. Table 10), our approach outperforms the basic character-based segmentation; however, it is still inferior compared to the other in-domain monolingual segmenters due to the low quality of the bilingual dictionary induced (cf. section 6.1).",

        "Firstly, (Xu et al., 2004) use word aligners to reconstruct a (monolingual) Chinese dictionary and reuse this dictionary to segment Chinese sentences as other monolingual segmenters.",

        "In this paper, we introduced a bilingually motivated word segmentation approach for SMT.",
        "The assumption behind this motivation is that the language to be segmented can be tokenised into basic writing units.",
        "Firstly, we extract 1-to-n word alignments using statistical word aligners to construct a bilingual dictionary in which each entry indicates a correspondence between one English word and n Chinese characters.",
        "This dictionary is then filtered using a few simple association measures and the final bilingual dictionary is deployed for word segmentation.",
        "To overcome the segmentation problem in the decoding stage, we deployed word lattice decoding.",
        "We evaluated our approach on translation tasks from two different domains and demonstrate that our approach is (i) not as sensitive as monolingual segmenters, and (ii) that the SMT system using our word segmentation can achieve state-of-the-art performance.",
        "Moreover, our approach can easily be scaled up to larger data sets and achieves competitive results if the small data used is a representative sample.",
        "As for future work, firstly we plan to integrate some named entity recognisers into our approach.",
        "We also plan to try our approach in more domains and on other language pairs (e.g. Japanese-English).",
        "Finally, we intend to explore the correlation between vocabulary size and the amount of training data needed in order to achieve good results using our approach."
