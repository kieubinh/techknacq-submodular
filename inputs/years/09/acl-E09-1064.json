        "Lexical-semantic resources, which provide the needed knowledge for lexical inference, are commonly utilized by applied inference systems (Giampiccolo et al., 2007) and applications such as Information Retrieval and Question Answering (Shah and Croft, 2004; Paşca and Harabagiu, 2001).",
        "Beyond WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), a wide range of resources has been developed and utilized, including extensions to WordNet (Moldovan and Rus, 2001; Snow et al., 2006) and resources based on automatic distributional similarity methods (Lin, 1998; Pantel and Lin, 2002).",
        "Recently, Wikipedia is emerging as a source for extracting semantic relationships (Suchanek et al., 2007; Kazama and Torisawa, 2007).",
        "As of today, only a partial comparative picture is available regarding the actual utility and limitations of available resources for lexical-semantic inference.",
        "Works that do provide quantitative information regarding resources utility have focused on few particular resources (Kouylekov and Magnini, 2006; Roth and Sammons, 2007) and evaluated their impact on a specific system.",
        "Most often, works which utilized lexical resources do not provide information about their isolated contribution; rather, they only report overall performance for systems in which lexical resources serve as components.",
        "Our paper provides a step towards clarifying this picture.",
        "We propose a system-and application-independent evaluation methodology that isolates resources' performance, and systematically apply it to seven prominent lexical-semantic resources.",
        "The evaluation and analysis methodology is specified within the Textual Entailment framework, which has become popular in recent years for modeling practical semantic inference in a generic manner (Dagan and Glickman, 2004).",
        "To that end, we assume certain definitions that extend the textual entailment paradigm to the lexical level.",
        "The findings of our work provide useful insights and suggested directions for two research communities: developers of applied inference systems and researchers addressing lexical acquisition and resource construction.",
        "Beyond the quantitative mapping of resources' performance, our analysis points at issues concerning their effective utilization and major characteristics.",
        "Even more importantly, the results highlight current gaps in existing resources and point at directions towards filling them.",
        "We show that the coverage of most resources is quite limited, where a substantial part of recall is attributable to semantic relations that are typically not available to inference systems.",
        "Notably, distributional acquisition methods are shown to provide many useful relationships which are missing from other resources, but these are embedded amongst many irrelevant ones.",

      "text": [
        "Textual entailment captures the relation between a text t and a textual statement (termed hypothesis) h, such that a person reading t would infer that h is most likely correct (Dagan et al., 2005).",
        "The entailment relation has been defined insofar in terms of truth values, assuming that h is a complete sentence (proposition).",
        "However, there are major aspects of inference that apply to the sub-sentential level.",
        "First, in certain applications, the target hypotheses are often sub-sentential.",
        "For example, search queries in IR, which play the hypothesis role from an entailment perspective, typically consist of a single term, like drug legalization.",
        "Such sub-sentential hypotheses are not regarded naturally in terms of truth values and therefore do not fit well within the scope of the textual entailment definition.",
        "Second, many entailment models apply a compositional process, through which they try to infer each sub-part of the hypothesis from some parts of the text (Giampiccolo et al., 2007).",
        "Although inferences over sub-sentential elements are being applied in practice, so far there are no standard definitions for entailment at sub-sentential levels.",
        "To that end, and as a prerequisite of our evaluation methodology and our analysis, we first establish two relevant definitions for sub-sentential entailment relations: (a) entailment of a sub-sentential hypothesis by a text, and (b) entailment of one lexical element by another.",
        "We first seek a definition that would capture the entailment relationship between a text and a sub-sentential hypothesis.",
        "A similar goal was addressed in (Glickman et al., 2006), who defined the notion of lexical reference to model the fact that in order to entail a hypothesis, the text has to entail each non-compositional lexical element within it.",
        "We suggest that a slight adaptation of their definition is suitable to capture the notion of entailment for any sub-sentential hypotheses, including compositional ones:",
        "Definition 1 A sub-sentential hypothesis h is entailed by a text t if there is an explicit or implied reference in t to a possible meaning ofh.",
        "For example, the sentence \"crude steel output is likely to fall in 2000\" entails the sub-sentential hypotheses production, steel production and steel output decrease.",
        "Glickman et al., achieving good inter-annotator agreement, empirically found that almost all non-compositional terms in an entailed sentential hypothesis are indeed referenced in the entailing text.",
        "This finding suggests that the above definition is consistent with the original definition of textual entailment for sentential hypotheses and can thus model compositional entailment inferences.",
        "We use this definition in our annotation methodology described in Section 3.",
        "In the majority of cases, the reference to an \"atomic\" (non-compositional) lexical element e in h stems from a particular lexical element e' in t, as in the example above where the word output implies the meaning of production.",
        "To identify this relationship, an entailment system needs a knowledge resource that would specify that the meaning of e' implies the meaning of e, at least in some contexts.",
        "We thus suggest the following definition to capture this relationship between e' and e:",
        "Definition 2 A lexical element e' entails another lexical element e, denoted e'^e, if there exist some natural (non-anecdotal) texts containing e' which entail e, such that the reference to the meaning ofe can be implied solely from the meaning of e in the text.",
        "(Entailment of e by a text follows Definition 1).",
        "We refer to this relation in this paper as lexical entailment, and call e' => e a lexical entailment rule.",
        "e' is referred to as the rule's left hand side (LHS) and e as its right hand side (RHS).",
        "Currently there are no knowledge resources designed specifically for lexical entailment modeling.",
        "Hence, the types of relationships they capture do not fully coincide with entailment inference needs.",
        "Thus, the definition suggests a specification for the rules that should be provided by a lexical entailment resource, following an operative rationale: a rule e' == e should be included in an entailment knowledge resource if it would be needed, as part of a compositional process, to infer the meaning of e from some natural texts.",
        "Based on this definition, we perform an analysis of the relationships included in lexical-semantic resources, as described in Section 5.",
        "A rule need not apply in all contexts, as long as it is appropriate for some texts.",
        "Two contextual aspects affect rule applicability.",
        "First is the \"lexical context\" specifying the meanings of the text's words.",
        "A rules is applicable in a certain context only when the intended sense of its LHS term matches the sense of that term in the text.",
        "For example, the application of the rule lay == produce is valid only in contexts where the producer is poultry and the products are eggs.",
        "This is a well known issue observed, for instance, by Voorhees (1994).",
        "A second contextual factor requiring validation is the \"logical context\".",
        "The logical context determines the monotonicity of the LHS and is induced by logical operators such as negation and (explicit or implicit) quantifiers.",
        "For example, the rule mammal = whale may not be valid in most cases, but is applicable in universally quantified texts like \"mammals are warm-blooded\".",
        "This issue has been rarely addressed in applied inference systems (de Marneffe et al., 2006).",
        "The above mentioned rules both comply with Definition 2 and should therefore be included in a lexical entailment resource."

        "Each resource was evaluated using two measures Precision and Recall-share, macro averaged over all hypotheses.",

        "Not surprisingly, resources such as WNd, XWN* or WikiFS achieved relatively high precision scores, due to their accurate construction methods.",
        "In contrast, Lin's distributional resources are not designed to include lexical entailment relationships.",
        "They provide pairs of contextually similar words, of which many have non-entailing relationships, such as co-hyponyms (e.g. *doctor == journalist) or topically-related words, such as *ra-diotherapy == outpatient.",
        "Hence their relatively low precision.",
        "One visible outcome is the large gap between the perceived high accuracy of resources constructed by accurate methods, most notably WNd, and their performance in practice.",
        "This finding emphasizes the need for instance-based evaluations, which capture the \"real\" contribution of a resource.",
        "To better understand the reasons for this gap we further assessed the three factors that contribute to incorrect applications: incorrect rules, lexical context and logical context (see Section 2.2).",
        "This analysis is presented in Table 2.",
        "From Table 2 we see that the gap for accurate resources is mainly caused by applications of correct rules in inappropriate contexts.",
        "More interestingly, the information in the table allows us to asses the lexical \"context-sensitivity\" of resources.",
        "When considering only the COR-LEX rules to recalculate resources precision, we find that Lin-dep achieves precision of 71% (i5%5%6%), while WNdyields only 56% (55%5_%l4%).",

        "From Table 1 we see that along with their relatively low precision, Lin s resources recall greatly surpasses that of any other resource, including WordNet.",
        "The rest of the resources are even inferior to WNd in that respect, indicating their limited utility for inference systems.",
        "As expected, synonyms and hyponyms in WordNet contributed a noticeable portion to recall in all resources.",

        "We observed that many entailing sentences were retrieved by inherently incorrect rules in the distributional resources.",

        "The non-categorized relations do not correspond to any WordNet relation.",
        "tional correct rules in a more comprehensive resource.",
        "An important finding of our analysis is that some less standard entailment relationships have a considerable impact on recall (see Table 3).",
        "These rules, which comply with Definition 2 but do not conform to any WordNet relation type, were mainly contributed by Lin s distributional resources and to a smaller degree are also included in XWN*.",
        "In Lin-dep, for example, they accounted for approximately a third of the recall.",
        "Among the finer grained relations we identified in this set are topical entailment (e.g. IBM as the company entailing the topic computers), consequential relationships (pregnancy == motherhood) and an entailment of inherent arguments by a predicate, or of essential participants by a scenario description, e.g. beatification == pope.",
        "A comprehensive typology of these relationships requires further investigation, as well as the identification and development of additional resources from which they can be extracted.",
        "As opposed to hyponymy and synonymy rules, these rules are typically non-substitutable, i.e. the RHS of the rule is unlikely to have the exact same role in the text as the LHS.",
        "Many inference systems perform rule-based transformations, substituting the LHS by the RHS.",
        "This finding suggests that different methods may be required to utilize such rules for inference.",
        "WordNet relations other than synonyms and hy-ponyms, including antonyms, holonyms and hy-pernyms (see Table 3), contributed a noticeable share of valid rule applications for some resources.",
        "Following common practice, these relations are missing by construction from the other resources.",
        "As shown in Table 2 (COR-LOG columns), such relations accounted for a seventh of Lin-dep s valid rule applications, as much as was the contribution of hyponyms and synonyms to this resource s recall.",
        "Yet, using these rules resulted with more erroneous applications than correct ones.",
        "As discussed in Section 2.2, the rules induced by these relations do conform with our lexical entailment definition.",
        "However, a valid application of these rules requires certain logical conditions to occur, which is not the common case.",
        "We thus suggest that such rules are included in lexical entailment resources, as long as they are marked properly by their types, allowing inference systems to utilize them only when appropriate mechanisms for handling logical context are in place.",
        "In Section 5.1.1 we observed that some resources are highly sensitive to context.",
        "Hence, when considering the validity of a rule s application, two factors should be regarded: the actual context in which the rule is to be applied, as well as the rule s prior likelihood to be valid in an arbitrary context.",
        "Somewhat indicative, yet mostly indirect, information about rules priors is contained in some resources.",
        "This includes sense ranks in WordNet, SemCor statistics (Miller et al., 1993), and similarity scores and rankings in Lin s resources.",
        "Inference systems often incorporated this information, typically as top-k or threshold-based filters (Pan-tel and Lin, 2003; Roth and Sammons, 2007).",
        "By empirically assessing the effect of several such filters in our setting, we found that this type of data is indeed informative in the sense that precision increases as the threshold rises.",
        "Yet, no specific filters were found to improve results in terms of F1 score (where recall is measured relatively to the yield of the unfiltered resource) due to a significant drop in relative recall.",
        "For example, Lin prox loses more than 40% of its recall when only the top-50 rules for each hypothesis are exploited, and using only the first sense of WNd costs the resource over 60% of its recall.",
        "We thus suggest a better strategy might be to combine the prior information with context matching scores in order to obtain overall likelihood scores for rule applications, as in (Szpektor et al., 2008).",
        "Furthermore, resources should include explicit information regarding the prior likelihoods of of their rules.",
        "Our findings highlight the currently limited recall of available resources for lexical inference.",
        "The higher recall of Lin's resources indicates that many more entailment relationships can be acquired, particularly when considering distributional evidence.",
        "Yet, available distributional acquisition methods are not geared for lexical entailment.",
        "This suggests the need to develop acquisition methods for dedicated and more extensive knowledge resources that would subsume the correct rules found by current distributional methods.",
        "Furthermore, substantially better recall may be obtained by acquiring non-standard lexical entailment relationships, as discussed in Section 5.2, for which a comprehensive typology is still needed.",
        "At the same time, transformation-based inference systems would need to handle these kinds of rules, which are usually non-substitutable.",
        "Our results also quantify and stress earlier findings regarding the severe degradation in precision when rules are applied in inappropriate contexts.",
        "This highlights the need for resources to provide explicit information about the suitable lexical and logical contexts in which an entailment rule is applicable.",
        "In parallel, methods should be developed to utilize such contextual information within inference systems.",
        "Additional auxiliary information needed in lexical resources is the prior likelihood for a given rule to be correct in an arbitrary context."
