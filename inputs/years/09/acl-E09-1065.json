        "One of the most important aspects of the learning process is the assessment of the knowledge acquired by the learner.",
        "In a typical examination setting (e.g., an exam, assignment or quiz), this assessment implies an instructor or a grader who provides students with feedback on their answers to questions that are related to the subject matter.",
        "There are, however, certain scenarios, such as the large number of worldwide sites with limited teacher availability, or the individual or group study sessions done outside of class, in which an instructor is not available and yet students need an assessment of their knowledge of the subject.",
        "In these instances, we often have to turn to computerassisted assessment.",
        "While some forms of computer-assisted assessment do not require sophisticated text understanding (e.g., multiple choice or true/false questions can be easily graded by a system if the correct solution is available), there are also student answers that consist of free text which require an analysis of the text in the answer.",
        "Research to date has concentrated on two main subtasks of computerassisted assessment: the grading of essays, which is done mainly by checking the style, grammaticality, and coherence of the essay (cf. (Higgins et al., 2004)), and the assessment of short student answers (e.g., (Leacock and Chodorow, 2003; Pul-man and Sukkarieh, 2005)), which is the focus of this paper.",
        "An automatic short answer grading system is one which automatically assigns a grade to an answer provided by a student through a comparison with one or more correct answers.",
        "It is important to note that this is different from the related task of paraphrase detection, since a requirement in student answer grading is to provide a grade on a certain scale rather than a binary yes/no decision.",
        "In this paper, we explore and evaluate a set of unsupervised techniques for automatic short answer grading.",
        "Unlike previous work, which has either required the availability of manually crafted patterns (Sukkarieh et al., 2004; Mitchell et al., 2002), or large training data sets to bootstrap such patterns (Pulman and Sukkarieh, 2005), we attempt to devise an unsupervised method that requires no human intervention.",
        "We address the grading problem from a text similarity perspective and examine the usefulness of various text-to-text semantic similarity measures for automatically grading short student answers.",
        "Specifically, in this paper we seek answers to the following questions.",
        "First, given a number of corpus-based and knowledge-based methods as previously proposed in the past for word and text semantic similarity, what are the measures that work best for the task of short answer grading?",
        "Second, given a corpus-based measure of similarity, what is the impact of the domain and the size of the corpus on the accuracy of the measure?",
        "Finally, can we use the student answers themselves to improve the quality of the grading system?"

        "There are a number of approaches that have been proposed in the past for automatic short answer grading.",
        "Several state-of-the-art short answer graders (Sukkarieh et al., 2004; Mitchell et al., 2002) require manually crafted patterns which, if matched, indicate that a question has been answered correctly.",
        "If an annotated corpus is available, these patterns can be supplemented by learning additional patterns semi-automatically.",
        "The Oxford-UCLES system (Sukkarieh et al., 2004) bootstraps patterns by starting with a set of keywords and synonyms and searching through windows of a text for new patterns.",
        "A later implementation of the Oxford-UCLES system (Pulman and Sukkarieh, 2005) compares several machine learning techniques, including inductive logic programming, decision tree learning, and Bayesian learning, to the earlier pattern matching approach with encouraging results.",
        "C-Rater (Leacock and Chodorow, 2003) matches the syntactical features of a student response (subject, object, and verb) to that of a set of correct responses.",
        "The method specifically disregards the bag-of-words approach to take into account the difference between \"dog bites man\" and \"man bites dog\" while trying to detect changes in voice (\"the man was bitten by a dog\").",
        "Another short answer grading system, AutoTu-tor (Wiemer-Hastings et al., 1999), has been designed as an immersive tutoring environment with a graphical \"talking head\" and speech recognition to improve the overall experience for students.",
        "AutoTutor eschews the pattern-based approach entirely in favor of a bag-of-words LSA approach (Landauer and Dumais, 1997).",
        "Later work on Au-toTutor (Wiemer-Hastings et al., 2005; Malatesta et al., 2002) seeks to expand upon the original bag-of-words approach which becomes less useful as causality and word order become more important.",
        "These methods are often supplemented with some light preprocessing, e.g., spelling correction, punctuation correction, pronoun resolution, lemmatization and tagging.",
        "Likewise, in order to facilitate their goals of providing feedback to the student more robust than a simple \"correct\" or \"incorrect,\" several systems break the gold-standard answers into constituent concepts that must individually be matched for the answer to be considered fully correct (Callear et al., 2001).",
        "In this way the system can determine which parts of an answer a student understands and which parts he or she is struggling with.",
        "Automatic short answer grading is closely related to the task of text similarity.",
        "While more general than short answer grading, text similarity is essentially the problem of detecting and comparing the features of two texts.",
        "One of the earliest approaches to text similarity is the vector-space model (Salton et al., 1997) with a term frequency / inverse document frequency (tf.idf weighting.",
        "This model, along with the more sophisticated LSA semantic alternative (Landauer and Dumais, 1997), has been found to work well for tasks such as information retrieval and text classification.",
        "Another approach (Hatzivassiloglou et al., 1999) has been to use a machine learning algorithm in which features are based on combinations of simple features (e.g., a pair of nouns appear within 5 words from one another in both texts).",
        "This method also attempts to account for synonymy, word ordering, text length, and word classes.",
        "Another line of work attempts to extrapolate text similarity from the arguably simpler problem of word similarity.",
        "(Mihalcea et al., 2006) explores the efficacy of applying WordNet-based word-to-word similarity measures (Pedersen et al., 2004) to the comparison of texts and found them generally comparable to corpus-based measures such as LSA.",
        "An interesting study has been performed at the University of Adelaide (Lee et al., 2005), comparing simpler word and n-gram feature vectors to LSA and exploring the types of vector similarity metrics (e.g., binary vs. count vectors, Jaccard vs. cosine vs. overlap distance measure, etc.).",
        "In this case, LSA was shown to perform better than the word and n-gram vectors and performed best at around 100 dimensions with binary vectors weighted according to an entropy measure, though the difference in measures was often subtle.",
        "SELSA (Kanejiya et al., 2003) is a system that attempts to add context to LSA by supplementing the feature vectors with some simple syntactical features, namely the part-of-speech ofthe previous word.",
        "Their results indicate that SELSA does not perform as well as LSA in the best case, but it has a wider threshold window than LSA in which the system can be used advantageously.",
        "Finally, explicit semantic analysis (ESA) (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007) uses Wikipedia as a source of knowledge for text similarity.",
        "It creates for each text a feature vector where each feature maps to a Wikipedia article.",
        "Their preliminary experiments indicated that ESA was able to significantly outperform LSA on some text similarity tasks."

        "Thirty students were enrolled in the class and submitted answers to these assignments.",
        "Thus, the data set we work with consists of a total of 630 student answers (3 assignments x 7 questions/assignment x 30 student answers/question).",
        "The answers were independently graded by two human judges, using an integer scale from 0 (completely incorrect) to 5 (perfect answer).",
        "Both human judges were graduate computer science students; one was the teaching assistant in the Data Structures class, while the other is one of the authors of this paper.",

        "The grades assigned by the two human judges are also included.",
        "The evaluations are run using Pearson's correlation coefficient measured against the average of the human-assigned grades on a per-question and a per-assignment basis.",
        "In the per-question setting, every question and the corresponding student answer is considered as an independent data point in the correlation, and thus the emphasis is placed on the correctness of the grade assigned to each answer.",
        "In the per-assignment setting, each data point is an assignment-student pair created by totaling the scores given to the student for each question in the assignment.",
        "In this setting, the emphasis is placed on the overall grade a student receives for the assignment rather than on the grade received for each independent question.",

        "Of the 630 grades given, only 358 (56.8%) were exactly agreed upon by the annotators.",
        "Even more striking, a full 107 grades (17.0%) differed by more than one point on the five point scale, and 19 grades (3.0%) differed by 4 points or more.",
        "Furthermore, on the occasions when the annotators disagreed, the same annotator gave the higher grade 79.8% of the time.",
        "Over the course of this work, much attention was given to our choice of correlation metric.",
        "Previous work in text similarity and short-answer grading seems split on the use of Pearson's and Spearman's metric.",
        "It was not initially clear that the underlying assumptions necessary for the proper use of Pearson's metric (e.g. normal distribution, interval measurement level, linear correlation model) would be met in our experimental setup.",
        "We considered both Spearman's and several less often used metrics (e.g. Kendall's tau, Goodman-Kruskal's gamma), but in the end, we have decided to follow previous work using Pearson's so that our scores can be more easily compared."

        "The remaining answers are then rescored according the the new gold standard vector.",
        "In practice, we hold the scores from the first run (i.e., with no feedback) constant for the top N highest-scoring answers, and the second-run scores for the remaining answers are multiplied by the first-run score of the Nth highest-scoring answer.",
        "In this way, we keep the original scores for the top N highest-scoring answers (and thus prevent them from becoming artificially high), and at the same time, we guarantee that none of the lower-scored answers will get a new score higher than the best answers.",

        "Overall, an improvement of up to 0.047 on the 0-1 Pearson scale can be obtained by using this technique, with a maximum improvement observed after about 4-6 iterations on average.",
        "After an initial number of high-scored answers, it is likely that the correctness of the answers degrades, and thus the decrease in performance observed after an initial number of iterations.",
        "Our results indicate that the LSA and WordNet similarity metrics respond more favorably to feedback than the ESA metric.",
        "It is possible that supplementing the bag-of-words in ESA (with e.g. synonyms and phrasal differences) does not drastically alter the resultant concept vector, and thus the overall effect is smaller."

        "Our experiments show that several knowledge-based and corpus-based measures of similarity perform comparably when used for the task of short answer grading.",
        "However, since the corpus-based measures can be improved by accounting for domain and corpus size, the highest performance can be obtained with a corpus-based measure (LSA) trained on a domain-specific corpus.",
        "Further improvements were also obtained by integrating the highest-scored student answers through a relevance feedback technique.",
        "Table 4 summarizes the results of our experiments.",
        "In addition to the per-question evaluations that were reported throughout the paper, we also report the per-assignment evaluation, which reflects a cumulative score for a student on a single assignment, as described in Section 3.",

        "This method improves significantly over the tf*idf baseline and also over the LSA trained on BNC model, which has been used extensively in previous work.",
        "The differences were found to be significant using a paired t-test (p<0.001).",
        "To gain further insights, we made an additional analysis where we determined the ability of our system to make a binary accept/reject decision.",
        "In this evaluation, we map the 0-5 human grading of the data set to an accept/reject annotation by using a threshold of 2.5.",
        "Every answer with a grade higher than 2.5 is labeled as \"accept,\" while every answer below 2.5 is labeled as \"reject.\"",
        "Next, we use our best system (LSA trained on domain-specific data with relevance feedback), and run a tenfold cross-validation on the data set.",
        "Specifically, for each fold, the system uses the remaining nine folds to automatically identify a threshold to maximize the matching with the gold standard.",
        "The threshold identified in this way is used to automatically annotate the test fold with \"ac-cept\"/\"reject\" labels.",
        "The tenfold cross validation resulted in an accuracy of 92%, indicating the ability of the system to automatically make a binary accept/reject decision."

        "We filled this gap by running comparative evaluations of several knowledge-based and corpus-based measures on a data set of short student answers.",
        "Our results indicate that when used in their original form, the results obtained with the best knowledge-based (WordNet shortest path and Jiang & Conrath) and corpus-based measures (LSA and ESA) have comparable performance.",
        "The benefit of the corpus-based approaches over knowledge-based approaches lies in their language independence and the relative ease in creating a large domain-sensitive corpus versus a language knowledge base (e.g., WordNet).",
        "Second, we analysed the effect of domain and corpus size on the effectiveness of the corpus-based measures.",
        "We found that significant improvements can be obtained for the LSA measure when using a medium size domain-specific corpus built from Wikipedia.",
        "In fact, when using LSA, our results indicate that the corpus domain may be significantly more important than corpus size once a certain threshold size has been reached.",
        "Finally, we introduced a novel technique for integrating feedback from the student answers themselves into the grading system.",
        "Using a method similar to the pseudo-relevance feedback technique used in information retrieval, we were able to improve the quality of our system by a few percentage points.",
        "Overall, our best system consists of an LSA measure trained on a domain-specific corpus built on Wikipedia with feedback from student answers, which was found to bring a significant absolute improvement on the 0-1 Pearson scale of 0.14 over the tf*idf baseline and 0.10 over the LSA BNC model that has been used in the past.",
        "In future work, we intend to expand our analysis of both the gold-standard answer and the student answers beyond the bag-of-words paradigm by considering basic logical features in the text (i.e., AND, OR, NOT) as well as the existence of shallow grammatical features such as predicate-argument structure(Moschitti et al., 2007) as well as semantic classes for words.",
        "Furthermore, it may be advantageous to expand upon the existing measures by applying machine learning techniques to create a hybrid decision system that would exploit the advantages of each measure.",
