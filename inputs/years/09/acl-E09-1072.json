        "In computational linguistic work, animacy has been shown to provide important information in anaphora resolution (Orasan and Evans, 2007), argument disambiguation (Dell'Orletta et al., 2005) and syntactic parsing in general (0vrelid and Nivre, 2007).",
        "The dimension of animacy roughly distinguishes between entities which are alive and entities which are not, however, other distinctions are also relevant and the animacy dimension is often viewed as a continuum ranging from humans to inanimate objects.",
        "Following Silverstein (1976) several animacy hierarchies have been proposed in typological studies, focusing on the linguistic category of animacy, i.e., the distinctions which are relevant for linguistic phenomena.",
        "An example of an animacy hierarchy, taken from (Aissen, 2003), is provided in (1):",
        "(1) Human > Animate > Inanimate",
        "Clearly, non-human animates, like animals, are not less animate than humans in a biological sense, however, humans and animals show differing linguistic behaviour.",
        "Empirical studies of animacy require human annotation efforts, and, in particular, a well-defined annotation task.",
        "However, annotation studies of animacy differ distinctly in their treatment of ani-macy as a type or token-level phenomenon, as well as in terms of granularity of categories.",
        "The use of the annotated data as a computational resource furthermore poses requirements on the annotation which do not necessarily agree with more theoretical considerations.",
        "Methods for the induction of animacy information for use in practical applications require the resolution of issues of level of representation, as well as granularity.",
        "This article addresses these issues through empirical and experimental evaluation.",
        "We present an in-depth study of a manually annotated data set which indicates that animacy may be treated as a lexical semantic property at the type level.",
        "We then evaluate this proposal through supervised machine learning of animacy information and focus on an in-depth error analysis of the resulting classifier, addressing issues of granularity of the animacy dimension.",
        "Finally, the automatically annotated data set is employed in order to train a syntactic parser and we investigate the effect of the an-imacy information and contrast the automatically acquired features with gold standard ones.",
        "The rest of the article is structured as follows.",
        "In section 2, we briefly discuss annotation schemes for animacy, the annotation strategies and categories proposed there.",
        "We go on to describe annotation for the binary distinction of 'human reference' found in a Swedish dependency treebank in section 3 and we perform an evaluation of the consistency of the human annotation in terms of linguistic level.",
        "In section 4, we present experiments in lexical acquisition of animacy based on mor-phosyntactic features extracted from a considerably larger corpus.",
        "Section 5 presents experiments with the acquired animacy information applied in the data-driven dependency parsing of Swedish.",

        "A set of parsers are trained on Tal-banken05, both with and without additional an-imacy information, the origin of which is either the manual annotation described in section 3 or the automatic animacy classifier described in section 4.2- 4.4 (MBL).",
        "The common nouns in the treebank are classified for animacy using leave-one-out training and testing.",
        "This ensures that the training and test instances are disjoint at all times.",
        "Moreover, the fact that the distributional data is taken from a separate data set ensures non-circularity since we are not basing the classification on gold standard parses.",
        "All parsing experiments are performed using 10-fold cross-validation for training and testing on the entire written part of Talbanken05.",

        "The addition of automatically assigned animacy information for common nouns (Anim) causes a small, but significant improvement in overall results (p<.04) compared to the baseline, as well as the corresponding gold standard experiment (p<.04).",
        "In the gold standard experiment, the results are not significantly better than the baseline and the main, overall, improvement from the gold standard animacy information reported in 0vrelid andNivre (2007) and 0vrelid (2008) stems largely from the animacy annotation of pronouns.",
        "This indicates that the animacy information for common nouns, which has been automatically acquired from a considerably larger corpus, captures distributional distinctions which are important for the general effect of animacy and furthermore that the differences from the gold standard annotation prove beneficial for the results.",
        "We see from Table 5, that the improvement in overall parse results is mainly in terms of dependency labeling, reflected in the LAS score.",
        "A closer error analysis shows that the performance of the two parsers employing gold and automatic animacy information is very similar with respect to dependency relations and we observe an improved analysis for subjects, (direct and indirect) objects and subject predicatives with only minor variations.",
        "This in itself is remarkable, since the covered set of animate instances is notably smaller in the automatically annotated data set.",
        "We furthermore find that the main difference between the gold standard and automatic Anim-experiments does not reside in the analysis of syntactic arguments, but rather of non-arguments.",
        "One relation for which performance deteriorates with the added information in the gold Anim-experiment is the nominal postmodifier relation (et) which is employed for relative clauses and nominal pp-attachment.",

        "This article has dealt with an empirical evaluation of animacy annotation in Swedish, where the main focus has been on the use of such annotation for computational purposes.",
        "We have seen that human annotation for animacy shows little variation at the type-level for a binary animacy distinction.",
        "Following from this observation, we have shown how a typelevel induction strategy based on morphosyntac-tic distributional features enables automatic ani-macy classification for noun lemmas which furthermore generalizes to different machine learning algorithms (MBL, SVM).",
        "We obtain results for animacy classification, ranging from 97.3% accuracy to 93.9% depending on the sparsity of the data.",
        "With an absolute frequency threshold of 10, we obtain an accuracy of 95.4%, which constitutes a 50% reduction of error rate.",
        "A detailed error analysis revealed some interesting results and we saw that more than half of the errors performed by the animacy classifier for the large class of inanimate nouns actually included elements which have been assigned an intermediate animacy status in theoretical work, such as animals and collective nouns.",
        "The application of animacy annotation in the task of syntactic parsing provided a test bed for the applicability of the annotation, where we could contrast the manually assigned classes with the automatically acquired ones.",
        "The results showed that the automatically acquired information gives a slight, but significant improvement of overall parse results where the gold standard annotation does not, despite a considerably lower coverage.",
        "This is a suprising result which highlights important properties of the annotation.",
        "First of all, the automatic annotation is completely consistent at the type level.",
        "Second, the automatic animacy classifier captures important distributional properties of the nouns, exemplified by the case of nominal postmodifiers in PP-attachment.",
        "The automatic annotation thus captures a purely linguistic notion of animacy and abstracts over contextual influence in particular instances.",
        "Animacy has been shown to be an important property in a range of languages, hence animacy classification of other languages constitutes an interesting line of work for the future, where empirical evaluations may point to similarities and differences in the linguistic expression of animacy."
