        "Motivation: Sharing basic intuitions and long-term goals with other tasks within the area of Web-based information extraction (Banko and Etzioni, 2008; Davidov and Rappoport, 2008), the task of acquiring class attributes relies on unstructured text available on the Web, as a data source for extracting generally-useful knowledge.",
        "In the case of attribute extraction, the knowledge to be extracted consists in quantifiable properties of various classes (e.g., top speed, body style and gas mileage for the class of sports cars).",
        "Existing work on large-scale attribute extraction focuses on producing ranked lists of attributes, for target classes of instances available in the form of flat sets of instances (e.g., ferrari modena, porsche carrera gt) sharing the same class label (e.g., sports cars).",
        "Independently ofhow the input target classes are populated with instances (manually (Pa§ca, 2007) or automatically (Pa§ca and Van Durme, 2008)), and what type of textual data source is used for extracting attributes (Web documents or query logs), the extraction of attributes operates at a lexical rather than semantic level.",
        "Indeed, the class labels of the target classes may be not more than text surface strings (e.g., sports cars) or even artificially-created labels (e.g., Car-toonChar in lieu of cartoon characters).",
        "Moreover, although it is commonly accepted that sports cars are also cars, which in turn are also motor vehicles, the presence ofsports cars among the input target classes does not lead to any attributes being extracted for cars and motor vehicles, unless the latter two class labels are also present explicitly among the input target classes.",
        "Contributions: The contributions of this paper are threefold.",
        "First, we investigate the role of classes of instances acquired automatically from unstructured text, in the task of attribute extraction over concepts from existing conceptual hierarchies.",
        "For this purpose, ranked lists of attributes are acquired from query logs for various concepts, after linking a set of more than 4,500 open-domain, automatically-acquired classes containing a total of around 250,000 instances into conceptual hierarchies available in WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "In comparison, previous work extracts attributes for either manually-specified classes of instances (Pa§ca, 2007), or for classes of instances derived automatically but considered as flat rather than hierarchical classes, and manually associated to existing semantic concepts (Pa§ca and Van Durme, 2008).",
        "Second, we expand the set of classes of instances acquired from text, thus increasing their usefulness in attribute extraction in particular and information extraction in general.",
        "To this effect, additional class labels (e.g., motor vehicles) are identified for existing instances (e.g., ferrari modena) of existing class labels (e.g., sports cars), by exploiting IsA relations available within the conceptual hierarchy (e.g., sports cars are also motor vehicles).",
        "Third, we show that large-scale, automatically-derived classes of instances can have as much as, or even bigger, practical impact in open-domain information extraction tasks than similar data from large-scale, high-coverage, manually-compiled resources.",
        "Specifically, evaluation results indicate that the accuracy of the extracted lists of attributes is higher by 8% at rank 10, 13% at rank 30 and 18% at rank 50, when using the automatically-extracted classes of instances rather than the comparatively more numerous and a-priori more reliable, human-generated, collaboratively-vetted classes of instances available within Wikipedia (Remy, 2002)."

        "Extraction of Flat Labeled Classes: Unstructured text from a combination of Web documents and query logs represents the source for deriving a flat set of labeled classes of instances, which are necessary as input for attribute extraction experiments.",
        "The labeled classes are acquired in three stages:",
        "1) extraction of a noisy pool of pairs of a class label and a potential class instance, by applying a few Is-A extraction patterns, selected from (Hearst, 1992), to Web documents:",
        "2) extraction of unlabeled clusters of distribu-tionally similar phrases, by clustering vectors of contextual features collected around the occurrences of the phrases within Web documents (Lin",
        "3) merging and filtering of the raw pairs and un-labeled clusters into smaller, more accurate sets of class instances associated with class labels, in an attempt to use unlabeled clusters to filter noisy raw pairs instead of merely using clusters to generalize class labels across raw pairs (Pa§ca and Van",
        "fruits= {apple, mango, orange, ..}.",
        "To increase precision, the vocabulary of class instances is confined to the set of queries that are most frequently submitted to a general-purpose Web search engine.",
        "After merging, the resulting pairs of an instance and a class label are arranged into instance sets (e.g., {ferrari modena, porsche carrera gt} ), each associated with a class label (e.g., sports cars).",
        "Linking Labeled Classes into Hierarchies:",
        "Manually-constructed language resources such as WordNet provide reliable, wide-coverage upper-level conceptual hierarchies, by grouping together phrases with the same meaning (e.g., {analgesic, painkiller, pain pill}) into sets of synonyms (synsets), and organizing the synsets into conceptual hierarchies (e.g., painkillers are a subconcept, or a hyponym, of drugs) (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "To determine the points of insertion of automatically-extracted labeled classes into hand-built WordNet hierarchies, the class labels are looked up in WordNet using built-in morphological normalization routines.",
        "When a class label (e.g., age-related diseases) is not found in WordNet, it is looked up again after iteratively removing its leading words (e.g., related diseases, and diseases) until a potential point of insertion is found where one or more senses exist in WordNet for the class label.",
        "An efficient heuristic for sense selection is to uniformly choose the first (that is, most frequent) sense of the class label in WordNet, as point of insertion.",
        "Due to its simplicity, the heuristic is bound to make errors whenever the correct sense is not the first one, thus incorrectly linking academic journals under the sense of journals as personal diaries rather than periodicals, and active volcanoes under the sense of volcanoes as fissures in the earth, rather than mountains formed by volcanic material.",
        "Nevertheless, choosing the first sense is attractive for three reasons.",
        "First, WordNet senses are often too fine-grained, making the task of choosing the correct sense difficult even for humans (Palmer et al., 2007).",
        "Second, choosing the first sense from WordNet is sometimes better than more intelligent disambiguation techniques (Pradhan et al., 2007).",
        "Third, previous experimental results on linking Wikipedia classes to WordNet concepts confirm that first-sense selection is more effective in practice than other techniques (Suchanek et al., 2007).",
        "Thus, a class label and its associated instances are inserted under the first WordNet sense available for the class label.",
        "For example, silicon valley companies and its associated instances (apple, hewlett packard etc.)",
        "are inserted under the first of the 9 senses of companies in WordNet, which corresponds to companies as institutions created to conduct business.",
        "In order to trade off coverage for higher precision, the heuristic can be restricted to link a class label under the first WordNet sense available, as before, but only when no other senses are available at the point of insertion beyond the first sense.",
        "With the modified heuristic, the class label internet search engines is linked under the first and only sense of search engines in WordNet, but silicon valley companies is no longer linked under the first of the 9 senses of companies.",
        "Extraction of Attributes for Hierarchy Concepts: The labeled classes of instances linked to conceptual hierarchies constitute the input to the acquisition of attributes of hierarchy concepts, by mining a collection of Web search queries.",
        "The attributes capture properties that are relevant to the concept.",
        "The extraction of attributes exploits the sets of class instances rather than the associated class labels.",
        "More precisely, for each hierarchy concept for which attributes must be extracted, the instances associated to all class labels linked under the subhierarchy rooted at the concept are collected as a union set of instances, thus exploiting the transitivity of IsA relations.",
        "This step is equivalent to propagating the instances upwards, from their class labels to higher-level WordNet concepts under which the class labels are linked, up to the root of the hierarchy.",
        "The resulting sets of instances constitute the input to the acquisition of attributes, which consists of four stages:",
        "1) identification of a noisy pool of candidate attributes, as remainders of queries that also contain one of the class instances.",
        "In the case of the concept movies, whose instances include jay and silent bob strike back and kill bill, the query \"cast jay and silent bob strike back\" produces the candidate attribute cast;",
        "2) construction of internal vector representations for each candidate attribute, based on queries (e.g., \"cast selection for kill bill\") that contain a candidate attribute (cast) and a class instance (kill bill).",
        "These vectors consist of counts tied to the frequency with which an attribute occurs with a given \"templatized\" query.",
        "The latter replaces specific attributes and instances from the query with common placeholders, e.g., \"Xfor Y\";",
        "3) construction of a reference internal vector representation for a small set of seed attributes provided as input.",
        "A reference vector is the normalized sum of the individual vectors corresponding to the seed attributes;",
        "4) ranking of candidate attributes with respect to each concept, by computing the similarity between their individual vector representations and",
        "the reference vector of the seed attributes.",
        "The result of the four stages, which are described in more detail in (Pa§ca, 2007), is a ranked list of attributes (e.g., [opening song, cast, characters,...]) for each concept (e.g., movies)."

        "Conversely, the acquisition of open-domain attributes relies on a random sample of fully-anonymized queries in English submitted by Web users in 2006.",
        "The sample contains about 50 million unique queries.",
        "Each query is accompanied by its frequency of occurrence in the logs.",
        "Other sources of similar data are available publicly for research purposes (Gao et al., 2007).",
        "Parameters for Extracting Labeled Classes: When applied to the available document collection, the method for extracting open-domain classes of instances from unstructured text introduced in (Pa§ca and Van Durme, 2008) produces 4,583 class labels associated to 258,699 unique instances, for a total of 869,118 pairs of a class instance and an associated class label.",

        "Parameters for Extracting Attributes: For each target concept from the hierarchy, given the union of all instances associated to class labels linked to the target concept or one of its subconcepts, and given a set of five seed attributes (e.g., {quality, speed, number ofusers, market share, reliability} for search engines), the method described in (Pa§ca, 2007) extracts ranked lists of attributes from the input query logs.",

        "Depending on the experiments, the amount of supervision is thus limited to either 5 seed attributes for each target concept, or to 5 seed attributes (population, area, president, flag and climate) provided for only one of the extracted labeled classes, namely european countries.",
        "Experimental Runs: The experiments consist of four different runs, which correspond to different choices for the source of conceptual hierarchies and class instances linked to those hierarchies, as illustrated in Table 2.",
        "In the first run, denoted N, the class instances are those available within the latest version of WordNet (3.0) itself via Hasln-stance relations.",
        "The second run, Y, corresponds to an extension of WordNet based on the manually-compiled classes of instances from categories in Wikipedia, as available in the 2007-w50-5 version of Yago (Suchanek et al., 2007).",
        "Therefore, run Y has the advantage of the fact that Wikipedia categories are a rich source of useful and accurate knowledge (Nastase and Strube, 2008), which explains their previous use as a source for evaluation gold standards (Blohm et al., 2007).",
        "The last two runs from Table 2, Es and Ea, correspond to the set of open-domain labeled classes acquired from unstructured text.",
        "In both Es and Ea, class labels are linked to the first sense available at the point of insertion in WordNet.",
        "In Es, the class labels are linked only if no other senses are available at the point of insertion beyond the first sense, thus promoting higher linkage precision at the expense of fewer links.",
        "For example, since the phrases impressionists, sports cars and painters have 1, 1 and 4 senses available in WordNet respectively, the class labels french impressionists and sports cars are linked to the respective WordNet concepts, whereas the class label painters is not.",
        "Comparatively, in Ea, the class labels are uniformly linked to the first sense available in WordNet, regardless of whether other senses may or may not be available.",
        "Thus, Ea trades off potentially lower precision for the benefit of higher linkage recall, and results in more of the class labels and their associated instances extracted from text to be linked to WordNet than in the case of run Es."

        "On the other dimension, in the graphs at the top of Figure 1, seed attributes are provided only for one class (namely, european countries), for a total of 5 attributes over all classes.",
        "In the graphs at the bottom of the figure, there are 5 seed attributes for each of the 25 target concepts in the graphs at the bottom of Figure 1, for a total of 5 x 25=125 attributes.",
        "Several conclusions can be drawn after inspecting the results.",
        "First, providing more supervision, in the form of seed attributes for all concepts rather than for only one concept, translates into higher attribute accuracy for all runs, as shown by the graphs at the top vs. graphs at the bottom of Figure 1.",
        "Second, in the leftmost graphs, run N has the lowest precision scores, which is in line with the relatively small number of instances available in the original WordNet, as confirmed by the counts from Table 2.",
        "Third, in the leftmost graphs, the more restrictive run Es has lower precision scores across all ranks than its less restrictive counterpart Ea.",

        "Seed attributes are provided as input for each target concept restrictions may improve precision but hurts recall of class instances, which results in lower average precision scores for the attributes.",
        "Fourth, in the leftmost graphs, the runs using the automatically-extracted labeled classes (Es and Ea) not only outperform N, but one of them (Ea) also outperforms Y.",
        "This is the most important result.",
        "It shows that large-scale, automatically-derived classes of instances can have as much as, or even bigger, practical impact in attribute extraction than similar data from larger (cf. Table 2), manually-compiled, collaboratively created and maintained resources such as Wikipedia.",
        "Concretely, in the graph on the bottom left of Figure 1, the precision scores at ranks 10, 30 and 50 are 0.71, 0.59 and 0.53 for run Y, but 0.77, 0.67 and 0.63 for run Ea.",
        "The scores correspond to attribute accuracy improvements of 8% at rank 10, 13% at rank 30, and 18% at rank 50 for run E„ over run Y.",
        "In fact, in the rightmost graphs, that is, without taking into account target concepts without any extracted attributes, the precision scores of both Es and Ea are higher than for run Y across most, if not all, ranks from 1 through 50.",
        "In this case, it is E\\ that produces the most accurate attributes, in a task-based demonstration that the more cautious linking of class labels to WordNet concepts in Es vs. Ea leads to less coverage but higher precision of the linked labeled classes, which translates into extracted attributes of higher accuracy but for fewer target concepts.",
        "Analysis: The curves plotted in the two graphs at the bottom of Figure 1 are computed as averages over precision scores for individual target concepts, which are shown in detail in Table 5.",
        "Precision scores of 0.00 correspond to runs for which no attributes are acquired from query logs, because no instances are available in the subhier-archy rooted at the respective concepts.",
        "For example, precision scores for run N are 0.00 for Award and DigitalCamera, among others concepts in Table 5, due to the lack of any HasInstance instances in WordNet for the respective concepts.",
        "The number of target concepts for which some attributes are extracted is 12 for run N, 23 for Y, 17 for Es and 23 for Ea.",
        "Thus, both run N and run Es exhibit rather binary behavior across individual classes, in that they tend to either not retrieve any attributes or retrieve attributes of relatively higher quality than the other runs, causing Es and N to have the worst precision scores in the last but one row ofTable 5, but the best precision scores in the last row of Table 5.",
