        "Measuring relatedness among linguistic entities is a crucial topic in NLP.",
        "Automatically assessing the degree of similarity or relatedness between two words or two expressions, is of great help in a variety of tasks, such as Question Answering, Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE), Information Extraction and discourse processing.",
        "Since the very beginning of computational linguistics, many studies have been devoted to the definition and the implementation of automatic measures for word relatedness (e.g. (Ruben-stein and Goodenough, 1965; Resnik, 1995; Lin, 1998; Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006; Mohammad and Hirst, 2006)).",
        "More recently, relatedness between lexical-syntactic patterns has also been studied (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Szpektor et al., 2004), to support advanced tasks such as paraphrasing and RTE.",
        "Unfortunately, no attention has been paid so far to the definition of relatedness at the more abstract situational level - i.e. relatedness between two prototypical actions, events or state-of-affairs, taken out of context (e.g. the situations of Killing and Death).",
        "A prominent definition of \"prototypical situation\" is given in frame semantics (Fillmore, 1985), where a situation is modelled as a conceptual structure (a frame) constituted by the predicates that can evoke the situation, and the semantic roles expressing the situation's participants.",
        "As measures of word relatedness help in discovering if two word occurrences express related concepts, so measures of frame relatedness should help to discover if two large text fragments are related or talk about similar situations.",
        "Such measures would be valuable in many tasks.",
        "For example, consider the following fragment, in the context of discourse processing:",
        "\"In the 1950s the Shah initiated Iran 's nuclear research program and developed an ambitious plan to produce 23,000MW from nuclear power.",
        "The program was stopped by the Islamic Revolution in 1979, but it was revived later in the decade, when strategic interests began to drive the nuclear program.\"",
        "The underlined words evoke highly related frames, namely Activity-start, Activ-ity_stop and Cause_to_resume.",
        "This could suggest to link the three textual fragments associated to the words, into a single coherent discourse unit, where the semantic roles of the different fragments can be easily mapped as co-referential (e.g. \"Iran's nuclear research program\" - \"The program\" - \"it\").",
        "Frame relatedness can also help in RTE.",
        "Consider for example the following entailment pair:",
        "Text : \"An avalanche has struck a popular skiing resort in Austria, killing at least 11 people.\"",
        "Hypothesis : \"Humans died in an avalanche.\"",
        "The frames Killing and Death, respectively evoked by killing and died, are highly related and can then be mapped.",
        "Leveraging this mapping, an RTE system could easily discover that the Text entails the Hypothesis, by verifying that the fillers of the mapped semantic roles of the two frames are semantically equivalent.",
        "In this paper we investigate the notion of relatedness in the context of frame semantics, and propose different types of automatic measures to compute relatedness between frames.",
        "Our main contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) We empirically show that the notion of frame relatedness is intuitive and principled from a cognitive perspective: to support this claim, we report agreement results over a pool of human annotators on the task of ranking frame pairs on relatedness; (2) We propose a variety of measures for computing frame relatedness, inspired by different approaches and by existing measures for word relatedness; (3) We show that our measures offer good performance, thus opening the path to the use of frame relatedness as a practical tool for NLP, and showing that measures for word relatedness can be successfully adapted to frames.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we summarize related work.",
        "In Section 3 we describe the experiment of humans ranking frame pairs, and discuss the results.",

        "Their experiment was later replicated by Resnik (1995) and Charles (2000).",
        "All these studies reported good levels of agreements among annotators, suggesting that the notion of word relatedness is cognitively principled.",
        "In our experiment in Section 3.2 we apply the same procedure to assess agreement on ranking frames.",
        "Measures for estimating word relatedness have been systematically proposed since the early 90's, and are today widely used in NLP for various tasks.",
        "Most measures can be classified either as corpus-based or ontology-based.",
        "Corpus-based measures compute relatedness looking at the distributional properties of the two words: words that tend to co-occur in the same contexts or having similar distributional profiles, are deemed to be highly related.",
        "A complete survey on these measures is reported in (Mohammad and Hirst, 2006).",
        "Ontology-based measures estimate relatedness by studying the path connecting the two words in an ontology or a hierarchical lexicon (e.g. WordNet).",
        "The basic idea is that closer words are more related than distant ones.",
        "Budanitsky and Hirst (2006) provide an extensive survey of these measures.",
        "Budanitsky and Hirst (2006) also point out an important distinction, between relatedness and similarity.",
        "Two words are related if any type of relation stands between them, e.g. antonymy or meronymy; they are similar when related through an is-a like hierarchy.",
        "Similarity is then a special case of relatedness.",
        "Following Budanitsky and Hirst (2006), we consider two frames as similar if they are linked via is-a like relations (e.g. Getting and Commerce_buy), while as related if any relation stands between them (e.g. causation between Killing and Death).",

        "Frame pairs in the simple set were randomly selected from the FrameNet database.",
        "Frame pairs in the controlled set were either composed of two frames belonging to the same scenario, or being so that one frame is one edge from the scenario of the other.",
        "This ensured that all pairs in the controlled set contained semantically related frames.",
        "Indeed, we use the controlled set to check if human agreement and automatic measure accuracy get better when considering only highly related frames.",
        "Human ranking agreement.",
        "A preliminary annotation phase involved a group of 15 annotators consisting of graduate students and researchers, native or nearly native speakers of English.",
        "For each set, each annotator was given 15 frame pairs from the original 155 set: 5 of these where shared with all other annotators.",
        "This setting has three advantages: (1) The set is small enough to obtain a reliable annotation in a short time; (2) We can compute the agreement among the 15 annotators over the shared pairs; (3) We can check the reliability of the final gold standard created in the second phase (see following section) by comparing to the annotations.",
        "Each annotator was asked to order a shuffled deck of 15 cards, each one describing a pair of frames.",
        "The card contained the following information about the two frames: names; definitions; the lists of core FEs; a frame annotated sentence for each frame, randomly chosen from the FrameNet database.",
        "Similarly to Rubenstein and Goodenough (1965) we gave the annotators the following instructions: (i) After looking through the whole deck, order the pairs according to amount of relatedness; (ii) You may assign the same rank to pairs having the same degree of relatedness (i.e. ties are allowed).",
        "We checked the agreement among the 15 annotators in ranking the 5 shared pairs by using the Kendall's t correlation coefficient (Kendall, 1938).",
        "Kendall's t can be interpreted as the difference between the probability that in the dataset two variables are in the same order versus the probability that they are in different orders (see (Lapata, 2006) for details).",
        "The average correlation among annotators on the simple and controlled sets was t = 0.600 and t = 0.547.",
        "Gold standard ranking.",
        "The final dataset was created by two expert annotators, jointly working to rank the 155 pairs collected in the data creation phase.",

        "These results are all statistically significant at the 99% level, indicating that the notion of \"frame relatedness\" is intuitive and principled for humans, and that the final datasets are reliable enough to be used as gold standard for our experiments.",
        "Table 2 reports the first and last 5 ranked frame pairs for the two datasets.",
        "We compared the correlation results obtained above on \"frame relatedness\", to those derived from previous works on \"word relatedness\".",
        "This comparison should indicate if ranking related frames (i.e. situations) is more or less complex and intuitive than ranking words.",
        "As for words, we computed the average Kendall's t among three different annotation efforts (namely, (Rubenstein and Goodenough, 1965; Resnik, 1995; Charles, 2000)) carried out over a same dataset of 28 word pairs originally created by Rubenstein and Goode-nough.",
        "Note that the annotation schema followed in the three works is the same as ours.",
        "We obtained a Kendall's t = 0.775, which is statistically significant at the 99% level.",

        "All measures, but the WordNet-based ones, significantly outperform the definition overlap baseline on both datasets, and most of them also beat the more informed LU overlap baseline.",
        "It is interesting to notice that the two best performing measures, namely cr_wgtsent and hrfe, use respectively a distributional and a hierarchy-based strategy, suggesting that both approaches are valuable.",
        "WordNet-based measures are less effective, performing close or below the baselines.",
        "Results obtained on the simple set are in general lower than those on the controlled set, suggesting that it is easier to discriminate among pairs of connected frames than random ones.",
        "A possible explanation is that when frames are connected, all measures can rely on meaningful evidence for most of the pairs, while this is not always the case for random pairs.",
        "For example, corpus-based measures tend to suffer the problem of data sparseness much more on the simple set, because many of the pairs are so loosely related that statistical information cannot significantly emerge from the corpus.",
        "WordNet-based measures.",
        "The low performance of these measures is mainly due to the fact that they fail to predict relatedness for many pairs, e.g. wnJiso assigns zero to 137 and 119 pairs, respectively on the simple and controlled sets.",
        "This is mostly caused by the limited set of relations of the WordNet database.",
        "Most importantly in our case, WordNet misses the situational relation (Hirst and St.Onge, 1998), which typically relates words participating in the same situation (e.g. child care - school).",
        "This is exactly the relation that would help in mapping frames' LUs.",
        "Another problem relates to adjectives and adverbs: WordNet measures cannot be trustfully applied to these part-of-speech, as they are not hierarchically organized.",
        "Unfortunately, 18% of FrameNet LUs are either adjectives or adverbs, meaning that such amount of useful information is lost.",
        "Finally, WordNet has in general an incomplete lexical coverage: Shi and Mihalcea (2005) show that 7% of FrameNet verbal LUs do not have a mapping in WordNet.",
