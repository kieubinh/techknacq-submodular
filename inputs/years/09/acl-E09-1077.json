        "The literature on sentiment polarity lexicon induction can be broadly classified into two categories, those based on corpora and the ones using WordNet.",
        "One of the earliest work on learning polarity of terms was by Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) who deduce polarity by exploiting constraints on conjoined adjectives in the Wall Street Journal corpus.",
        "For example, the conjunction \"and\" links adjectives of the same polarity while \"but\" links adjectives of opposite polarity.",
        "However the applicability of this method for other important classes of sentiment terms like nouns and verbs is yet to be demonstrated.",
        "Further they assume linguistic features specific to English.",
        "Wiebe (2000) uses Lin (1998a) style distribu-tionally similar adjectives in a cluster-and-label process to generate sentiment lexicon of adjectives.",
        "In a different work, Riloff et al.",
        "(2003) use manually derived pattern templates to extract subjective nouns by bootstrapping.",
        "Another corpora based method due to Turney and Littman (2003) tries to measure the semantic orientation O(t) for a term t by where S + and S-are minimal sets of polar terms that contain prototypical positive and negative terms respectively, and PMI(t,ti) is the point-wise mutual information (Lin, 1998b) between the terms t and ti.",
        "While this method is general enough to be applied to several languages our aim was to develop methods that exploit more structured sources like WordNet to leverage benefits from the rich network structure.",
        "Kaji and Kitsuregawa (2007) outline a method of building sentiment lexicons for Japanese using structural cues from HTML documents.",
        "Apart from being very specific to Japanese, excessive dependence on HTML structure makes their method brittle.",
        "These approaches use lexical relations defined in WordNet to derive sentiment lexicons.",
        "A simple but high-precision method proposed by Kim and Hovy (2006) is to add all synonyms of a polar word with the same polarity and its antonyms with reverse polarity.",
        "As demonstrated later, the method suffers from low recall and is unsuitable in situations when the seed polar words are too few not uncommon in low resource languages.",
        "In line with Turney's work, Kamps et.",
        "al.",
        "(2004) try to determine sentiments of adjectives in WordNet by measuring relative distance of the term from exemplars, such as \"good\" and \"bad\".",
        "The polarity orientation of a term t is measured as follows where d(.)",
        "is a WordNet based relatedness measure (Pedersen et al., 2004).",
        "Again they report results for adjectives alone.",
        "Another relevant example is the recent work by Mihalcea et.",
        "al.",
        "(2007) on multilingual sentiment analysis using cross-lingual projections.",
        "This is achieved by using bridge resources like dictionaries and parallel corpora to build sentence subjectivity classifiers for the target language (Romanian).",
        "An interesting result from their work is that only a small fraction of the lexicon entries preserve their polarities under translation.",
        "The primary contributions of this paper are :",
        "• An application of graph-based semi-supervised learning methods for inducing sentiment lexicons from WordNet and other thesauri.",
        "The label propagation method naturally allows combining several relations from WordNet.",
        "• Our approach works on all classes of words and not just adjectives",
        "• Though we report results for English, Hindi, and French, our methods can be easily replicated for other languages where WordNet is available.",

        "Such information can be readily encoded as a graph where the presence of an edge between two nodes would indicate a relationship between the two nodes and, optionally, the weight on the edge could encode strength of the relationship.",
        "This additional information aids learning when very few annotated examples are present.",
        "We review three well known graph based semi-supervised learning methods -mincuts, randomized mincuts, and label propagation - that we use in induction of polarity lexicons.",
        "A mincut of a weighted graph G(V, E) is a partitioning the vertices V into V1 and V2 such that sum of the edge weights of all edges between V1and V2 is minimal (Figure 2).",
        "Mincuts for semi-supervised learning proposed by Blum and Chawla (2001) tries to classify datapoints by partitioning the similarity graph such that it minimizes the number of similar points being labeled differently.",
        "Mincuts have been used in semi-supervised learning for various tasks, including document level sentiment analysis (Pang and Lee, 2004).",

        "Let the nodes with degree one be labeled as positive and negative respectively, and for the purpose of illustration let all edges be of the same weight.",
        "The graph in Figure 3 a. can be partitioned in four equal cost cuts two of which are shown in (b) and (c).",
        "The mincut algorithm, depending on the implementation, will return only one of the extreme cuts (as in (b)) while the desired classification might be as shown in Figure 3c.",
        "The randomized mincut approach tries to address this problem by randomly perturbing the adjacency matrix by adding random noise.",
        "Mincut is then performed on this perturbed graph.",
        "This is repeated several times and unbalanced partitions are discarded.",
        "Finally the remaining partitions are used to deduce the final classification by majority voting.",
        "In the unlikely event of the voting resulting in a tie, we refrain from making a decision thus favoring precision over recall.",
        "Another semi-supervised learning method we use is label propagation by Zhu and Ghahramani (2002).",
        "The label propagation algorithm is a trans-ductive learning framework which uses a few examples, or seeds, to label a large number of un-labeled examples.",
        "In addition to the seed examples, the algorithm also uses a relation between the examples.",
        "This relation should have two requirements:",
        "1.",
        "It should be transitive.",
        "2.",
        "It should encode some notion of relatedness between the examples.",

        "This relation between the examples can be easily encoded as a graph.",
        "Thus every node in the graph is an example and the edge represents the relation.",
        "Also associated with each node, is a probability distribution over the labels for the node.",
        "For the seed nodes, this distribution is known and kept fixed.",
        "The aim is to derive the distributions for the remaining nodes.",
        "Consider a graph G(V, E, W) with vertices V, edges E, and an n x n edge weight matrix W = [wij ], where n = |V |.",
        "The label propagation algorithm minimizes a quadratic energy function where yi and yj are the labels assigned to the nodes i and j respectively.",
        "Thus, to derive the labels at yi, we set Jj^S = 0 to obtain the following update equation",
        "In practice, we use the following iterative algorithm as noted by Zhu and Ghahramani (2002).",
        "A n x n stochastic transition matrix T is derived by row-normalizing W as follows:",

        "This paper demonstrated the utility of graph-based semi-supervised learning framework for building sentiment lexicons in a variety of resource availability situations.",
        "We explored how the structure of WordNet could be leveraged to derive polarity lexicons.",
        "The paper combines, for the first time, relationships like synonymy and hyper-nymy to improve label propagation results.",
        "All of our methods are independent of language as shown in the French and Hindi cases.",
        "We demonstrated applicability of our approach on alternative thesaurus-derived graphs when WordNet is not freely available, as in the case of French.",
        "Although our current work uses WordNet and other thesauri, in resource poor situations when only monolingual raw text is available we can perform label propagation on nearest neighbor graphs derived directly from raw text using distributional similarity methods.",
        "This is work in progress.",
        "We are also currently working on the possibility of including WordNet relations other than synonymy and hypernymy.",
        "One relation that is interesting and useful is antonymy.",
        "Antonym edges cannot be added in a straightforward way to the graph for label propagation as antonymy encodes negative similarity (or dissimilarity) and the dissimilarity relation is not transitive.",
