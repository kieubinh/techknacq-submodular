        "Some linguists considered them as two different dialects of one language (Bhatia and Koul, 2000).",
        "However, Urdu is written in Perso-arabic script and inherits most of the vocabulary from Arabic and Persian.",
        "On the other hand, Hindi is written in Devanagari script and inherits vocabulary from Sanskrit.",
        "Urdu is a morphologically rich language.",
        "Forms of the verb, as well as case, gender, and number are expressed by the morphology.",
        "Urdu represents case with a separate character after the head noun of the noun phrase.",
        "Due to their separate occurrence and their place of occurrence, they are sometimes considered as postpositions.",
        "Considering them as case markers, Urdu has no",
        "minative, ergative, accusative, dative, instrumental, genitive and locative cases (Butt, 1995: pg 10).",

        "There are various questions that need to be answered during the design of a tagset.",
        "The granularity of the tagset is the first problem in this regard.",
        "A tagset may consist either of general parts of speech only or it may consist of additional morpho-syntactic categories such as number, gender and case.",
        "In order to facilitate the tagger training and to reduce the lexical and syntactic ambiguity, we decided to concentrate on the syntactic categories of the language.",
        "Purely syntactic categories lead to a smaller number of tags which also improves the accuracy of manual tagging2 (Marcus et al., 1993).",
        "Urdu is influenced from Arabic, and can be considered as having three main parts of speech, namely noun, verb and particle (Platts, 1909; Javed, 1981; Haq, 1987).",
        "However, some grammarians proposed ten main parts of speech for Urdu (Schmidt, 1999).",
        "The work of Urdu grammar writers provides a full overview of all the features of the language.",
        "However, in the perspective of the tagset, their analysis is lacking the computational grounds.",
        "The semantic, morphological and syntactic categories are mixed in their distribution of parts of speech.",
        "For example, Haq (1987) divides the common nouns into situational (smile, sadness, darkness), locative (park, office, morning, evening), instrumental (knife, sword) and collective nouns (army, data).",
        "In 2003, Hardie proposed the first computational part of speech tagset for Urdu (Hardie,",
        "2003a).",
        "It is a morpho-syntactic tagset based on the EAGLES guidelines.",
        "The tagset contains 350 different tags with information about number, gender, case, etc.",
        "(van Halteren, 2005).",
        "The EAGLES guidelines are based on three levels, major word classes, recommended attributes and optional attributes.",
        "Major word classes include thirteen tags: noun, verb, adjective, pronoun/determiner, article, adverb, adposition, conjunction, numeral, interjection, unassigned, residual and punctuation.",
        "The recommended attributes include number, gender, case, finiteness, voice, etc.3 In this paper, we will focus on purely syntactic distributions thus will not go into the details of the recommended attributes of the EAGLES guidelines.",
        "Considering the EAGLES guidelines and the tagset of Hardie in comparison with the general parts of speech of Urdu, there are no articles in Urdu.",
        "Due to the phrase level and semantic differences, pronoun and demonstrative are separate parts of speech in Urdu.",
        "In the Hardie tagset, the possessive pronouns like /mera/ (my), /tumhara/ (your), /humara/ (our) are assigned to the category of possessive adjective.",
        "Most of the Urdu grammarians consider them as pronouns (Platts, 1909; Javed, 1981; Haq, 1987).",
        "However, all these possessive pronouns require a noun in their noun phrase, thus show a similar behavior as demonstratives.",

        "and, the locative and temporal nouns ( /subah/ (morning), /sham/ (evening), /gher/ (home)) appear in a very similar syntactic context.",
        "In order to keep the structure of pronoun and noun consistent, locative and temporal adverbs are treated as pronouns.",
        "The tense and aspect of a verb in Urdu is represented by a sequence of auxiliaries.",
        "Consider the example4:",
        "/kerta/ (doing) is represented by two separate words /ja/ and /raha/ and the last word of the sen",
        "The above considerations lead to the following tagset design for Urdu.",
        "The general parts of speech are noun, pronoun, demonstrative, verb, adjective, adverb, conjunction, particle, number and punctuation.",
        "The further refinement of the tagset is based on syntactic properties.",
        "The morphologically motivated features of the language are not encoded in the tagset.",
        "For example, an Urdu verb has 60 forms which are morphologically derived from its root form.",
        "All these forms are annotated with the same category i.e. verb.",
        "During manual tagging, some words are hard for the linguist to disambiguate reliably.",
        "In order to keep the training data consistent, such words are assigned a separate tag.",
        "For instance, the semantic marker /se/ gets a separate tag due to its various confusing usages such as locative and instrumental (Platts, 1909).",
        "The tagset used in the experiments reported in this paper contains 42 tags including three special tags.",
        "Nouns are divided into noun (NN) and proper name (PN).",
        "Demonstratives are divided into personal (PD), KAF (KD), adverbial (AD) and relative demonstratives (RD).",
        "All four categories of demonstratives are ambiguous with four categories of pronouns.",
        "Pronouns are divided into six types i.e. personal (PP), reflexive (RP), relative (REP), adverbial (AP), KAF (KP) and adverbial KAF (AKP) pronouns.",
        "Based on phrase level differences, genitive reflexive (GR) and genitive (G) are kept separate from pronouns.",
        "The verb phrase is divided into verb, as-pectual auxiliaries and tense auxiliaries.",
        "Numerals are divided into cardinal (CA), ordinal (OR), fractional (FR) and multiplicative (MUL).",
        "Conjunctions are divided into coordinating (CC) and subordinating (SC) conjunctions.",
        "All semantic markers except /se/ are kept in one category.",
        "Adjective (ADJ), adverb (ADV), quantifier (Q), measuring unit (U), intensifier (I), interjection (INT), negation (NEG) and question words (QW) are handled as separate categories.",
        "Adjectival particle (A), KER (KER), SE (SE) and WALA (WALA) are ambiguous entities which are annotated with separate tags.",
