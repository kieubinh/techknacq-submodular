        "The expectations within that framework are based upon two different aspects.",
        "Firstly, it is expected that, since all exemplars are stored, exemplars of a type that occur often, offer the speaker a wider selection of exemplars to choose from during production (Schweitzer and Mobius, 2004), i.e. the realisations are expected to be more variable than those of a rare type.",
        "However, another aspect of Exemplar Theory has to be considered, namely entrenchment (Pierrehumbert, 2001; Bybee, 2006).",
        "The central idea here is that frequently occurring behaviours undergo processes of entrenchment, they become in some sense routine.",
        "Therefore realisations of a very frequent type are expected to be realised similar to each other.",

However, it is important to note that while tokens of L*H are not particularly similar to each other (the bulk of the distribution is around zero (see figure 1)), they are not too dissimilar either.",

        "This is not at odds with the idea of entrenchment.",
        "As productions of a pitch accent type become more frequent, the distribution of similarity spreads from the right side of the graph (where infrequent and highly similar H* tokens lie) leftwards (through H* L) to the point where the L*H distribution is found.",
        "Beyond this point tokens are excessively different.",
        "The second question posed in section 1, and addressed in Experiment 2, sought to ascertain the impact, if any, information status has on pitch accent realisation.",
        "Distributions of given and new H*L similarity scores differed significantly, as did distributions of given and new L*H similarity scores, indicating that information status affects realisation.",
        "In other words, for both pitch accent types, given and new tokens behave differently.",
        "Concerning the frequency of occurrence of the information status categories, certainly in the case of H*L the higher frequency new tokens exhibited more variability.",

        "Once again sensitivity to frequency of occurrence seems to be present, in line with exemplar-theoretic predictions.",
        "The final question concerns the possibility of a combined effect of pitch accent frequency of occurrence and information status frequency of occurrence.",
        "Figures 4 and 5 depict a clear compounding effect of both information status categories across the different pitch accent types (and their inherent frequencies) when compared to figure 1.",
        "Interestingly, the less frequently occurring given appears to have a greater impact, particularly on high frequency L*H.",
        "Figure 6 displays all possible combinations of L* H, H*L, given and new.",
        "H* is omitted in this graph because of the small number of tokens (10 given, 21 new) and the resulting lack of explanatory power.",
        "It is evident that an overall frequency of occurrence effect can be observed: \"given L*H\" and \"new L*H\", which have a similar number of instances (114 vs. 102 tokens) both centre around zero and are thus the most leftward skewed curves in the graph.",
        "The distribution of \"new H*L\" (87 tokens) shows a trend towards the right hand side of the graph and thus represents greater similarity of the tokens.",
        "The distribution of similarity values for the least frequent combination of pitch accent and information status, \"given H*L\" (44 tokens), centres between 0.5 and 1.0 and is thus the most rightward curve in the graph, reflecting the highest similarity between the tokens.",
        "These results highlight an intricate relationship between pitch accent production and information status.",
        "The information status of the word influences not only the type and shape of the pitch accent (Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg, 1990; Baumann, 2006; Kugler and Fery, 2008; Schweitzer et al., 2008) but also the similarity of tokens within a pitch accent type.",
        "Moreover, this effect is well explainable within the framework of Exemplar Theory as it is subject to frequency of occurrence: tokens of rare types are produced more similar to each other than tokens of frequent types.",
        "In the context of speech technology, unfortunately the high variability in highly frequent pitch accents has a negative consequence, as the correlation between a certain pitch accent or a certain information status category and the F0 contour is not a one-to-one relationship.",
