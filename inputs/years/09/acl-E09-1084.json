        "Authors of biomedical publications often utilize images and other illustrations to convey information essential to the article and to support and reinforce textual content.",
        "These images are useful in support of clinical decisions, in rich document summaries, and for instructional purposes.",
        "The task of delivering these images, and the publications in which they are contained, to biomedical clinicians and researchers in an accessible way is an information retrieval problem.",
        "Current research in the biomedical domain (e.g., Antani et al., 2008; Florea et al., 2007), has investigated hybrid approaches to image retrieval, combining elements of content-based image retrieval (CBIR) and annotation-based image retrieval (ABIR).",
        "ABIR, compared to the imageonly approach of CBIR, offers a practical advantage in that queries can be more naturally specified by a human user (Inoue, 2004).",
        "However, manually annotating biomedical images is a laborious and subjective task that often leads to noisy results.",
        "Automatic image annotation is a more robust approach to ABIR than manual annotation.",
        "Unfortunately, automatically selecting the most appropriate indexing terms is an especially challenging problem for biomedical images because of the domain-specific nature of these images and the many vocabularies used in the biomedical sciences.",
        "For example, the term \"sweat gland adenocarcinoma\" could be a useful indexing term for an image found in a dermatology publication, but it is less likely to have much relevance in describing an image from a cardiology publication.",
        "On the other hand, the term \"mitral annular calcification\" may be of great relevance for cardiology images, but of little relevance for dermatology ones.",
        "Our problem may be summarized as follows: Given an image, its caption, its discussion in the article text (henceforth the image mention), and a list of potential indexing terms, select the terms that are most effective at describing the content of the image.",
        "For example, assume the image shown in Figure 1, obtained from the article \"Metastatic Hidradenocarcinoma: Efficacy of Capecitabine\" by Thomas et al.",
        "(2006) in Archives of Dermatology, has the following potential indexing terms,",
        "Histopathology finding Reviewed Confirmation Diagnosis aspect Diagnosis Eccrine",
        "Sweat gland adenocarcinoma which have been extracted from the image mention.",
        "While most of these do not uniquely identify",

        "Mention: Histopathologic findings were reviewed and confirmed a diagnosis of eccrine hidradenocarci-noma for all lesions excised (Figure 1).",
        "Figure 1: Example Image.",
        "We index an image with concepts generated from its caption and discussion in the document text (mention).",
        "This image is from \"Metastatic Hidradenocarcinoma: Efficacy of Capecitabine\" by Thomas et al.",

        "the image, we would like to automatically select \"sweat gland adenocarcinoma\" and \"eccrine\" for indexing because they clearly describe the content and purpose of the image – supporting a diagnosis of hidradenocarinoma, an invasive cancer of sweat glands.",
        "Note that effective indexing terms need not be exact lexical matches of the text.",
        "Even though \"diagnosis\" is an exact match, its meaning is too broad in this context to be a useful term.",
        "In a machine learning approach to image annotation, training data based on lexical features alone is not sufficient for finding salient indexing terms.",
        "Indeed, we must classify terms that are not encountered while training.",
        "Therefore, we hypothesize that non-lexical features, which have been successfully used for speech and genre classification tasks, among others (see Section 5 for related work), may be useful in classifying text associated with images.",
        "While this approach is broad enough to apply to any retrieval task, given the goals of our ongoing research, we restrict ourselves to studying its feasibility in the biomedical domain.",
        "In order to achieve this, we make use of the previously developed MetaMap (Aronson, 2001) tool, which maps text to concepts contained in the Unified Medical Language System'® (UMLS) Metathesaurus® (Lindberg et al., 1993).",
        "The UMLS is a compendium of several controlled vocabularies in the biomedical sciences that provides a semantic mapping relating concepts from the various vocabularies (Section 2).",
        "We then use a supervised machine learning approach, described in Section 3, to classify the UMLS concepts as useful indexing terms based on their non-lexical features, gleaned from the article text and MetaMap output.",
        "Experimental results, presented in Section 4, indicate that ineffective indexing terms can be reduced using this classification technique.",
        "We conclude that ABIR approaches to biomedical image retrieval as well as hybrid CBIR/ABIR approaches, which rely on both image content and annotations, can benefit from an automatic annotation process utilizing non-lexical features to aid in the selection of useful indexing terms."

        "This implies that it is possible to use training data from particular subdomains of the biomedical sciences (cardiology and plastic surgery) to classify potential indexing terms in other subdomains (dermatology).",
        "Overall, the classifier performed best when verified with reviewer A, with an F1-score of 0.326.",
        "Although this is relatively low for a classification task, these results improve upon the baseline classification scheme (all extracted terms are useful for indexing) with an F1-score of 0.182 (Demner-Fushman et al., 2008).",
        "Thus, non-lexical features can be leveraged, albeit to a small degree with our current features and classifier, in automatically selecting useful image indexing terms.",
        "In future work, we intend to explore additional features and alternative tools for mapping text to the UMLS."

        "While our specific retrieval task relates to the biomedical domain, our results indicate that ABIR approaches to image retrieval in any domain can benefit from an automatic annotation process utilizing non-lexical features to aid in the selection of indexing terms or the reduction of ineffective terms from a set of potential ones."
