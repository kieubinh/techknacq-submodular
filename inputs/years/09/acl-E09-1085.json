        "This paper describes a fully incremental dialogue system that can engage in dialogues in a simple domain, number dictation.",
        "Because it uses incremental speech recognition and prosodic analysis, the system can give rapid feedback as the user is speaking, with a very short latency of around 200ms.",
        "Because it uses incremental speech synthesis and self-monitoring, the system can react to feedback from the user as the system is speaking.",
        "A comparative evaluation shows that naïve users preferred this system over a non-incremental version, and that it was perceived as more human-like."

        "A traditional simplifying assumption for spoken dialogue systems is that the dialogue proceeds with strict turn-taking between user and system.",
        "The minimal unit of processing in such systems is the utterance, which is processed in whole by each module of the system before it is handed on to the next.",
        "When the system is speaking an utterance, it assumes that the user will wait for it to end before responding.",
        "(Some systems accept barge-ins, but then treat the interrupted utterance as basically unsaid.)",
        "Obviously, this is not how natural human-human dialogue proceeds.",
        "Humans understand and produce language incrementally - they use multiple knowledge sources to determine when it is appropriate to speak, they give and receive backchannels in the middle of utterances, they start to speak before knowing exactly what to say, and they incrementally monitor the listener's reactions to what they say (Clark, 1996).",
        "This paper presents a dialogue system, called NUMBERS, in which all components operate incrementally.",
        "We had two aims: First, to explore technical questions such as how the components of a modularized dialogue system should be arranged and made to interoperate to support incremental processing, and which requirements incremental processing puts on dialogue system components (e.g., speech recognition, prosodic analysis, parsing, discourse modelling, action selection and speech synthesis).",
        "Second, to investigate whether incremental processing can help us to better model certain aspects of human behaviour in dialogue systems - especially turn-taking and feedback - and whether this improves the user's experience of using such a system."

      "heading": "2. Incremental dialogue processing",
      "text": [
        "All dialogue systems are 'incremental', in some sense - they proceed in steps through the exchange of 'utterances'.",
        "However, incremental processing typically means more than this; a common requirement is that processing starts before the input is complete and that the first output increments are produced as soon as possible (e.g., Kilger & Finkler, 1995).",
        "Incremental modules hence are those where \"Each processing component will be triggered into activity by a minimal amount of its characteristic input\" (Levelt, 1989).",
        "If we assume that the 'characteristic input' of a dialogue system is the utterance, this principle demands that 'minimal amounts' of an utterance already trigger activity.",
        "It should be noted though, that there is a trade-off between responsiveness and output quality, and that an incremental process therefore should produce output only as soon as it is possible to reach a desired output quality criterion.",
        "The claim that humans do not understand and produce speech in utterance-sized chunks, but rather incrementally, can be supported by an impressive amount of psycholinguistic literature on the subject (e.g., Tanenhaus & Brown-Schmidt, 2008; Levelt, 1989).",
        "However, when it comes to spoken dialogue systems, the dominant minimal unit of processing has been the utterance.",
        "Moreover, traditional systems follow a very strict sequential processing order of utterances - interpretation, dialogue management, generation - and there is most often no monitoring of whether (parts of) the generated message is successfully delivered.",
        "Allen et al.",
        "(2001) discuss some of the shortcomings of these assumptions when modelling more conversational human-like dialogue.",
        "First, they fail to account for the frequently found mid-utterance reactions and feedback (in the form of acknowledgements, repetition of fragments or clarification requests).",
        "Second, people often seem to start to speak before knowing exactly what to say next (possibly to grab the turn), thus producing the utterance incrementally.",
        "Third, when a speaker is interrupted or receives feedback in the middle of an utterance, he is able to continue the utterance from the point where he was interrupted.",
        "Since a non-incremental system needs to process the whole user utterance using one module at a time, it cannot utilise any higher level information for deciding when the user's turn or utterance is finished, and typically has to rely only on silence detection and a time-out.",
        "Silence, however, is not a good indicator: sometimes there is silence but no turn-change is intended (e.g., hesitations), sometimes there isn't silence, but the turn changes (Sacks et al., 1974).",
        "Speakers appear to use other knowledge sources, such as prosody, syntax and semantics to detect or even project the end of the utterance.",
        "Attempts have been made to incorporate such knowledge sources for turn-taking decisions in spoken dialogue systems (e.g., Ferrer et al., 2002; Raux & Eskenazi, 2008).",
        "To do so, incremental dialogue processing is clearly needed.",
        "Incremental processing can also lead to better use of resources, since later modules can start to work on partial results and do not have to wait until earlier modules have completed processing the whole utterance.",
        "For example, while the speech recogniser starts to identify words, the parser can already add these to the chart.",
        "Later modules can also assist in the processing and for example resolve ambiguities as they come up.",
        "Stoness et al.",
        "(2004) shows how a reference resolution module can help an incremental parser with NP suitability judgements.",
        "Similarly, Aist et al.",
        "(2006) shows how a VP advisor could help an incremental parser.",
        "On the output side, an incremental dialogue system could monitor what is actually happening to the utterance it produces.",
        "As discussed by Raux & Eskenazi (2007), most dialogue managers operate asynchronously from the output components, which may lead to problems if the dialogue manager produces several actions and the user responds to one of them.",
        "If the input components do not have any information about the timing of the system output, they cannot relate them to the user's response.",
        "This is even more problematic if the user reacts (for example with a backchannel) in the middle of system utterances.",
        "The system must then relate the user's response to the parts of its planned output it has managed to realise, but also be able to stop speaking and possibly continue the interrupted utterance appropriately.",
        "A solution for handling mid-utterance responses from the user is proposed by Dohsaka & Shimazu (1997).",
        "For incremental generation and synthesis, the output components must also cope with the problem of revision (discussed in more detail below), which may for example lead to the need for the generation of speech repairs, as discussed by Kilger & Finkler (1995).",
        "As the survey above shows, a number of studies have been done on incrementality in different areas of language processing.",
        "There are, however, to our knowledge no studies on how the various components could or should be integrated into a complete, fully incremental dialogue system, and how such a system might be perceived by naïve users, compared to a non-incremental system.",
        "This we provide here.",
        "The NUMBERS system presented in this paper can be seen as a specific instance (with some simplifying assumptions) of a more general, abstract model that we have developed (Schlangen & Skantze, 2009).",
        "We will here only briefly describe the parts of the general model that are relevant for the exposition of our system.",
        "We model the dialogue processing system as a collection of connected processing modules.",
        "The smallest unit of information that is communicated along the connections is called the incremental unit (IU), the unit of the \"minimal amount of characteristic input\".",
        "Depending on what the module does, IUs may be audio frames, words, syntactic phrases, communicative acts, etc.",
        "The processing module itself is modelled as consisting of a Left Buffer (LB), the Processor proper, and a Right Buffer (RB).",
        "An example of two connected modules is shown in Figure 1.",
        "As IUi enters the LB of module A, it may be consumed by the processor.",
        "The processor may then produce new IUs, which are posted on the RB (IU2 in the example).",
        "As the example shows, the modules in the system are connected so that an IU posted on the RB in one module may be consumed in the LB of another module.",
        "One RB may of course be connected to many other LB's, and vice versa, allowing a range of different network topologies.",
        "module A left buffer processor right buffer",
        "In the NUMBERS system, information is only allowed to flow from left to right, which means that the LB may be regarded as the input buffer and the RB as the output buffer.",
        "However, in the general model, information may flow in both directions.",
        "A more concrete example is shown in Figure 2, which illustrates a module that does incremental speech recognition.",
        "The IUs consumed from the LB are audio frames, and the IUs posted in the RB are the words that are recognised.",
        "We identify three different generic module operations on IUs: update, purge and commit.",
        "First, as an IU is added to the LB, the processor needs to update its internal state.",
        "In the example above, the speech recogniser has to continuously add incoming audio frames to its internal state, and as soon as the recogniser receives enough audio frames to decide that the word \"four\" is a good-enough candidate, the IU holding this word will be put on the RB (time-point t;).",
        "If a processor only expects IUs that extend the rightmost IU currently produced, we can follow Wiren (1992) in saying that it is only left-to-right incremental.",
        "A fully incremental system (which we aim at here), on the other hand, also allows insertions and/or revisions.",
        "An example of revision is illustrated at time-point t2 in Figure 2.",
        "As more audio frames are consumed by the recogniser, the word \"four\" is no longer the best candidate for this stretch of audio.",
        "Thus, the module must now revoke the IU holding the word \"four\" (marked with a dotted outline) and add a new IU for the word \"forty\".",
        "All other modules consuming these IUs must now purge them from their own states and possibly revoke other IUs.",
        "By allowing revision, a module may produce tentative results and thus make the system more responsive.",
        "As more audio frames are consumed in the example above, a new word \"five\" is identified and added to the RB (time-point t3).",
        "At time-point t4, no more words are identified, and the module may decide to commit to the IUs that it has produced (marked with a darker shade).",
        "A committed IU is guaranteed to not being revoked later, and can hence potentially be removed from the processing window of later modules, freeing up resources."

        "The best results were obtained with a J.48 decision tree, and are shown in Table 2.",

        "While the performance of 80.8% is significantly above baseline, it could certainly be better.",
        "We do not know yet whether the suboptimal performance is due to the fact that the speakers did not always use these prosodic cues, or whether there is room for improvement in the pitch extraction and parameterization.",

        "This class is not really needed here, since the digits within installments are followed by no or only very short pauses.)",

        "The use of prosodic analysis in combination with incremental processing allows the NUMBERS system to give feedback after mid-sequence installments in about 200 ms.",

        "If the discourse model gets updated during this time, the AM may revoke previous CAs and replace them with new ones.",
        "A diphone MBROLA text-to-speech synthesiser (TTS) is used in the system (Dutoit et al., 1996), and a wrapper for handling incremental processing has been implemented.",
        "The TTS consumes words linked to CAs from the LB, as produced by the AM.",
        "As described above, each CA has a timestamp.",
        "The TTS places them on a queue, and prepares to synthesise and start sending the audio to the speakers.",
        "When the system utterance has been played, the corresponding semantic concepts for the CA are sent to GALATEA.",
        "If the TTS is interrupted, the semantic fragments of the CA that corresponds to the words that were spoken are sent.",
        "This way, GALATEA can monitor what the system actually says and provide the AM with this information.",
        "Since the TTS only sends (parts of) the CAs that have actually been spoken, these are always marked as committed.",
        "There is a direct link from the ASR to the TTS as well (not shown in Figure 3), informing the",
        "TTS of start-of-speech and end-of-speech events.",
        "As soon as a start-of-speech event is detected, the TTS stops speaking.",
        "If the TTS does not receive any new CAs from the AM as a consequence of what the user said, it automatically resumes from the point of interruption.",
        "(This implements a \"reactive behaviour\" in the sense of (Brooks, 1991), which is outside of the control of",
        "An example of this is shown in Table 1.",
        "After U.09, the AM decides to repeat the whole number sequence and sends a series of CAs to the TTS for doing this.",
        "After S.10, the user gives feedback in the form of an acknowledgement (U.11).",
        "This causes the TTS to make a pause.",
        "When GALATEA receives the user feedback, it uses the timestamps to find out that the feedback is related to the number group in S.10 and the grounding status for this group is boosted.",
        "When the AM receives the updated discourse model, it decides that this does not call for any revision to the already planned series of actions.",
        "Since the TTS does not receive any revisions, it resumes the repetition of the number sequence in S.12.",
        "The TTS module is fully incremental in that it can stop and resume speaking in the middle of an utterance, revise planned output, and can inform other components of what (parts of utterances) has been spoken.",
        "However, the actual text-to-speech processing is done before the utterance starts and not yet incrementally as the utterance is spoken, which could further improve the efficiency of the system.",
        "This is a topic for future research, together with the generation of hidden and overt repair as discussed by Kilger & Finkler (1995)."

        "It is difficult to evaluate complete dialogue systems such as the one presented here, since there are so many different components involved (but see Moller et al.",
        "(2007) for methods used).",
        "In our case, we're interested in the benefits of a specific aspect, though, namely incrementality.",
        "No evaluation is needed to confirm that an incremental system such as this allows more flexible turn-taking and that it can potentially respond faster - this is so by design.",
        "However, we also want this behaviour to result in an improved user experience.",
        "To test whether we have achieved this, we implemented for comparison a non-incremental version of the system, very much like a standard number dictation dialogue in a commercial application.",
        "In this version, the user is asked to read out the whole number sequence in one go.",
        "After a certain amount of silence, the system confirms the whole sequence and asks a yes/no question whether it was correct.",
        "If not, the user has to repeat the whole sequence.",

        "(The subjects were native speakers of German with a good command of English.)",
        "Half of the subjects used the incremental version first and the other half started with the non-incremental version.",
        "They were asked to dictate eight number sequences to each version, resulting in 128 dialogues.",
        "For each sequence, they were given a time limit of 1 minute.",
        "After each sequence, they were asked whether they had succeeded in dictating the sequence or not, as well as to mark their agreement (on a scale from 0-6) with statements concerning how well they had been understood by the system, how responsive the system was, if the system behaved as expected, and how human-like the conversational partner was.",
        "After using both versions of the system, they were also asked whether they preferred one of the versions and to what extent (1 or 2 points, which gives a maximum score of 16 to any version, when totalling all subjects).",
        "There was no significant difference between the two versions with regard to how many of the tasks were completed successfully.",
        "However, the incremental version was clearly preferred in the overall judgement (9 points versus 1).",
        "Only one of the more specific questions yielded any significant difference between the versions: the incremental version was judged to be more human-like for the successful dialogues (5,2 on average vs. 4,5; Wilcoxon signed rank test; p<0.05).",
        "The results from the evaluation are in line with what could be expected.",
        "A non-incremental system can be very efficient if the system understands the number sequence the first time, and the ASR vocabulary is in this case very limited, which explains why the success-rate was the same for both systems.",
        "However, the incremental version was experienced as more pleasant and human-like.",
        "One explanation for the better rating of the incremental version is that the acknowledgements encouraged the subjects to package the digits into installments, which helped the system to better read back the sequence using the same installments."

        "To sum up, we have presented a dialogue system that through the use of novel techniques (incremental prosodic analysis, reactive connection between ASR and TTS, fully incremental architecture) achieves an unprecedented level of reac-tiveness (from a minimum latency of 750ms, as typically used in dialogue systems, down to one of 200ms), and is consequently evaluated as more natural than more typical setups by human users.",
        "While the domain we've used is relatively simple, there are no principled reasons why the techniques introduced here should not scale up.",
        "In future user studies, we will explore which factors contribute to the improved experience of using an incremental system.",
        "Such factors may include improved responsiveness, better installment packaging, and more elaborate feedback.",
        "It would also be interesting to find out when rapid responses are more important (e.g. acknowledgements), and when they may be less important (e.g., answers to task-related questions).",
        "We are currently investigating the transfer of the prosodic analysis to utterances in a larger domain, where similarly instructions by the user can be given in installments.",
        "But even within the currently used micro-domain, there are interesting issues still to be explored.",
        "In future versions of the system, we will let the modules pass parallel hypotheses and also improve the incremental generation and synthesis.",
        "Since the vocabulary is very limited, it would also be possible to use a limited domain synthesis (Black & Lenzo, 2000), and explore how the nuances of different backchannels might affect the dialogue.",
        "Another challenge that can be researched within this microdomain is how to use the prosodic analysis for other tasks, such as distinguishing correction from dictation (for example if U.14 in Table 1 would not begin with a \"no\").",
        "In general, we think that this paper shows that narrowing down the domain while shifting the focus to the modelling of more low-level, conversational dialogue phenomena is a fruitful path."
