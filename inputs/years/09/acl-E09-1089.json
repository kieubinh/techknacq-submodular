        "Automatic text summarization is one of the tasks that have long been studied in natural language processing.",
        "This task is to create a summary, or a short and concise document that describes the content of a given set of documents (Mani, 2001).",
        "One well-known approach to text summarization is the extractive method, which selects some linguistic units (e.g., sentences) from given documents in order to generate a summary.",
        "The extractive method has an advantage that the grammaticality is guaranteed at least at the level of the linguistic units.",
        "Since the actual generation of linguistic expressions has not achieved the level of the practical use, we focus on the extractive method in this paper, especially the method based on the sentence extraction.",
        "Most of the extractive summarization methods rely on sequentially solving binary classification problems of determining whether each sentence should be selected or not.",
        "In such sequential methods, however, the viewpoint regarding whether the summary is good as a whole, is not taken into consideration, although a summary conveys information as a whole.",
        "We represent text summarization as an optimization problem and attempt to globally solve the problem.",
        "In particular, we represent text summarization as a maximum coverage problem with knapsack constraint (MCKP).",
        "One of the advantages of this representation is that MCKP can directly model whether each concept in the given documents is covered by the summary or not, and can dispense with rather counter-intuitive approaches such as giving penalty to each pair of two similar sentences.",
        "By formally apprehending the target problem, we can use a lot of knowledge and techniques developed in the combinatorial mathematics, and also analyse results more precisely.",
        "In fact, on the basis of the results of the experiments, we augmented the summarization model.",
        "The contributions of this paper are as follows.",
        "We are not the first to represent text summarization as MCKP.",
        "However, no researchers have exploited the decoding algorithms for solving MCKP in the summarization task.",
        "We conduct comprehensive comparative experiments of those algorithms.",
        "Specifically, we test the greedy algorithm, the greedy algorithm with performance guarantee, the stack decoding, the linear relaxation problem with randomized decoding, and the branch-and-bound method.",
        "On the basis of the experimental results, we then propose an augmented model that takes into account the relevance to the document cluster.",
        "We empirically show that the augmented model is superior to the best-performing method of DUC'04 on ROUGE-1 without stopwords."
