        "Full parsing analyzes the phrase structure of a sentence and provides useful input for many kinds of high-level natural language processing such as summarization (Knight and Marcu, 2000), pronoun resolution (Yang et al., 2006), and information extraction (Miyao et al., 2008).",
        "One of the major obstacles that discourage the use of full parsing in large-scale natural language processing applications is its computational cost.",
        "For example, the MEDLINE corpus, a collection of abstracts of biomedical papers, consists of 70 million sentences and would require more than two years of processing time if the parser needs one second to process a sentence.",
        "Generative models based on lexicalized PCFGs enjoyed great success as the machine learning framework for full parsing (Collins, 1999; Char-niak, 2000), but recently discriminative models attract more attention due to their superior accuracy (Charniak and Johnson, 2005; Huang, 2008) and adaptability to new grammars and languages (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006).",
        "A traditional approach to discriminative full parsing is to convert a full parsing task into a series of classification problems.",
        "Ratnaparkhi (1997) performs full parsing in a bottom-up and left-to-right manner and uses a maximum entropy classifier to make decisions to construct individual phrases.",
        "Sagae and Lavie (2006) use the shift-reduce parsing framework and a maximum entropy model for local classification to decide parsing actions.",
        "These approaches are often called history-based approaches.",
        "A more recent approach to discriminative full parsing is to treat the task as a single structured prediction problem.",
        "Finkel et al.",
        "(2008) incorporated rich local features into a tree CRF model and built a competitive parser.",
        "Huang (2008) proposed to use a parse forest to incorporate non-local features.",
        "They used a perceptron algorithm to optimize the weights of the features and achieved state-of-the-art accuracy.",
        "Petrov and Klein (2008) introduced latent variables in tree CRFs and proposed a caching mechanism to speed up the computation.",
        "In general, the latter whole-sentence approaches give better accuracy than history-based approaches because they can better trade off decisions made in different parts in a parse tree.",
        "However, the whole-sentence approaches tend to require a large computational cost both in training and parsing.",
        "In contrast, history-based approaches are less computationally intensive and usually produce fast parsers.",

        "Although our parsing model falls into the category of history-based approaches, it is one step closer to the whole-sentence approaches because the parser uses a whole-sequence model (i.e. CRFs) for individual chunking tasks.",
        "In other words, our parser could be located somewhere between traditional history-based approaches and whole-sentence approaches.",
        "One of our motivations for this work was that our parsing model may achieve a better balance between accuracy and speed than existing parsers.",
        "It is also worth mentioning that our approach is similar in spirit to supertagging for parsing with lexicalized grammar formalisms such as CCG and HPSG (Clark and Curran, 2004; Ninomiya et al., 2006), in which significant speed-ups for parsing time are achieved.",
        "In this paper, we show that our approach is indeed appealing in that the parser runs very fast and gives competitive accuracy.",

        "One of the obvious ways to improve the accuracy of our parser is to improve the accuracy of individual CRF models.",
        "As mentioned earlier, we were not able to use second-order features on state transitions, which would have been very useful, due to the problem of computational cost.",
        "Incremental feature selection methods such as grafting (Perkins et al., 2003) may help us to incorporate such higher-order features, but the problem of decreased efficiency of dynamic programming in the CRF would probably need to be addressed.",
        "In this work, we treated the chunking problem as a sequence labeling problem by using the BIO representation for the chunks.",
        "However, semi-Markov conditional random fields (semi-CRFs) can directly handle the chunking problem by considering all possible combinations of subsequences of arbitrary length (Sarawagi and Cohen, 2004).",
        "Semi-CRFs allow one to use a richer set of features than CRFs, so the use of semi-CRFs in our parsing framework should lead to improved accuracy.",
        "Moreover, semi-CRFs would allow us to incorporate some useful restrictions in producing chunking hypotheses.",
        "For example, we could naturally incorporate the restriction that every chunk has to contain at least one symbol that has just been created in the previous level.",
        "It is hard for the normal CRF model to incorporate such restrictions.",
        "Introducing latent variables into the CRF model may be another promising approach.",
        "This is the main idea of Petrov and Klein (2008), which significantly improved parsing accuracy.",
        "A totally different approach to improving the accuracy of our parser is to use the idea of \"self-training\" described in (McClosky et al., 2006).",
        "The basic idea is to create a larger set of training data by applying an accurate parser (e.g. rerank-ing parser) to a large amount of raw text.",
        "We can then use the automatically created treebank as the additional training data for our parser.",
        "This approach suggests that accurate (but slow) parsers and fast (but not-so-accurate) parsers can actually help each other.",
        "Also, since it is not difficult to extend our parser to produce N-best parsing hypotheses, one could build a fast reranking parser by using the parser as the base (hypotheses generating) parser."

        "build a competitive parser if we use CRF models for each level of chunking and a depth-first search algorithm to search for the highest probability parse.",
        "Like other discriminative learning approaches, one of the advantages of our parser is its generality.",
        "The design of our parser is very generic, and the features used in our parser are not particularly specific to the Penn Treebank.",
        "We expect it to be straightforward to adapt the parser to other projective grammars and languages.",
        "This parsing framework should be useful when one needs to process a large amount of text or when real time processing is required, in which the parsing speed is of top priority.",
        "In the deterministic setting, our parser only needed about 10 msec to parse a sentence."
