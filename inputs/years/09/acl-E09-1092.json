        "We present an approach to deriving stronger, more general claims by abstracting over large sets of factoids.",
        "Our goal is to coalesce the observed nominals for a given predicate argument into a few predominant types, obtained as WordNet synsets.",

      "text": [
        "Our interest is ultimately in building systems with commonsense reasoning and language understanding abilities.",
        "As is widely appreciated, such systems will require large amounts of general world knowledge.",
        "Large text corpora are an attractive potential source of such knowledge.",
        "However, current natural language understanding (NLU) methods are not general and reliable enough to enable broad assimilation, in a formalized representation, of explicitly stated knowledge in encyclopedias or similar sources.",
        "As well, such sources typically do not cover the most obvious facts of the world, such as that ice cream may be delicious and may be coated with chocolate, or that children may play in parks.",
        "Methods currently exist for extracting simple \"factoids\" like those about ice cream and children just mentioned (see in particular (Schubert, 2002; Schubert and Tong, 2003)), but these are quite weak as general claims, and - being unconditional - are unsuitable for inference chaining.",
        "Consider however the fact that when something is said, it is generally said by a person, organization or text source; this a conditional statement dealing with the potential agents of saying, and could enable useful inferences.",
        "For example, in the sentence, \"The tires were worn and they said I had to replace them\", they might be mistakenly identified with the tires, without the knowledge that saying is something done primarily by persons, organizations or text sources.",
        "Similarly, looking into the future one can imagine telling a household robot, \"The cat needs to drink something\", with the expectation that the robot will take into account that if a cat drinks something, it is usually water or milk (whereas people would often have broader options).",
        "The work reported here is aimed at deriving generalizations of the latter sort from large sets of weaker propositions, by examining the hierarchical relations among sets of types that occur in the argument positions of verbal or other predicates.",
        "The generalizations we are aiming at are certainly not the only kinds derivable from text corpora (as the extensive literature on finding isa-relations, partonomic relations, paraphrase relations, etc.",
        "attests), but as just indicated they do seem potentially useful.",
        "Also, thanks to their grounding in factoids obtained by open knowledge extraction from large corpora, the propositions obtained are very broad in scope, unlike knowledge extracted in a more targeted way.",
        "In the following we first briefly review the method developed by Schubert and collaborators to abstract factoids from text; we then outline our approach to obtaining strengthened propositions from such sets of factoids.",
        "We report positive results, while making only limited use of standard corpus statistics, concluding that future endeavors exploring knowledge extraction and WordNet should go beyond the heuristics employed in recent work."

        "Schubert (2002) presented an approach to acquiring general world knowledge from text corpora based on parsing sentences and mapping syntactic forms into logical forms (LFs), then gleaning simple propositional factoids from these LFs through abstraction.",
        "Logical forms were based on Episodic Logic (Schubert and Hwang, 2000), a formalism designed to accommodate in a straightforward way the semantic phenomena observed in all languages, such as predication, logical compounding, generalized quantification, modification and reification of predicates and propositions, and event reference.",
        "An example from Schubert and Tong (2003) of factoids obtained from a sentence in the Brown corpus by their Knext system is the following:",
        "Rilly or Glendora had entered her room while she slept, bringing back her washed clothes.",
        "A NAMED-ENTITY MAY ENTER A ROOM.",
        "A FEMALE-INDIVIDUAL MAY HAVE A ROOM.",
        "A FEMALE-INDIVIDUAL MAY SLEEP.",
        "A FEMALE-INDIVIDUAL MAY HAVE CLOTHES.",
        "CLOTHES CAN BE WASHED.",
        "(:Q DET NAMED-ENTITY) ENTER[V]",
        "Here the upper-case sentences are automatically generated verbalizations of the abstracted LFs shown beneath them.",
        "The initial development of Knext was based on the hand-constructed parse trees in the Penn Treebank version of the Brown corpus, but subsequently Schubert and collaborators refined and extended the system to work with parse trees obtained with statistical parsers (e.g., that of Collins (1997) or Charniak (2000)) applied to larger corpora, such as the British National Corpus (BNC), a 100 million-word, mixed genre collection, along with Web corpora of comparable size (see work of Van Durme et al.",
        "(2008) and Van Durme and Schubert (2008) for details).",
        "The BNC yielded over 2 factoids per sentence on average, resulting in a total collection of several million.",
        "Human judging of the factoids indicates that about 2 out of 3 factoids are perceived as reasonable claims.",
        "The goal in this work, with respect to the example given, would be to derive with the use of a large collection of Knext outputs, a general statement such as If something may sleep, it is probably either an animal or a person."

        "While the community continues to make gains in the automatic construction of reliable, general ontologies, the WordNet sense hierarchy (Fellbaum, 1998) continues to be the resource of choice for many computational linguists requiring an ontology-like structure.",
        "In the work discussed here we explore the potential of WordNet as an underlying concept hierarchy on which to base generalization decisions.",
        "The use of WordNet raises the challenge of dealing with multiple semantic concepts associated with the same word, i.e., employing WordNet requires word sense disambiguation in order to associate terms observed in text with concepts (synsets) within the hierarchy.",
        "In their work on determining selectional preferences, both Resnik (1997) and Li and Abe (1998) relied on uniformly distributing observed frequencies for a given word across all its senses, an approach later followed by Pantel et al.",
        "(2007).",
        "Others within the knowledge acquisition community have favored taking the first, most dominant sense of each word (e.g., see Suchanek et al.",
        "(2007) and Paşca (2008)).",
        "As will be seen, our algorithm does not select word senses prior to generalizing them, but rather as a byproduct of the abstraction process.",
        "Moreover, it potentially selects multiple senses of a word deemed equally appropriate in a given context, and in that sense provides coarse-grained disambiguation.",
        "This also prevents exaggeration of the contribution of a term to the abstraction, as a result of being lexicalized in a particularly finegrained way.",
        "While the procedure given here is not tied to a particular formalism in representing semantic context, in our experiments we make use of propositional templates, based on the verbalizations arising from Knext logical forms.",
        "Specifically, a proposition F with m argument positions generates m templates, each with one of the arguments replaced by an empty slot.",
        "Hence, the statement, a man may give a speech, gives rise to two templates, a man may give a __, and a___may give a speech.",
        "Such templates match statements with identical structure except at the template's slots.",
        "Thus, the factoid a politician may give a speech would match the second template.",
        "The slot-fillers from matching factoids (e.g., man and politician form the input lemmas to our abstraction algorithm described below.",
        "Additional templates are generated by further weakening predicate argument restrictions.",
        "Nouns in a template that have not been replaced by a free slot can be replaced with an wild-card, indicating that anything may fill its position.",
        "While slots accumulate their arguments, these do not, serving simply as relaxed interpretive constraints on the original proposition.",
        "For the running example we would have; a __ may give a ?, and, a ?",
        "may give a __, yielding observation sets pertaining to things that may give, and things that may be given.",
        "We have not restricted our focus to two-argument verbal predicates; examples such as a be magical, can be seen in Section 5.",

        "Our method for type derivation assumes access to a word sense taxonomy, providing:",
        "W : set of words, potentially multi-token",

        "L: N x N – q-° : path length function",
        "L is a distance function based on P that gives the length of the shortest path from a node to a dominating node, with base case: L(n, n) = 1.",
        "When appropriate, we write L(w,n) to stand for the arithmetic mean over L(n', n) for all senses n'",

        "Figure 1: Algorithm for deriving slot type restrictions, with S representing a fixed step size.",
        "of w that are dominated by n. In the definition of S, (N+) stands for an ordered list of nodes.",
        "We refer to a given predicate argument position for a specified propositional template simply as a slot.",
        "W C W will stand for the set of words found to occupy a given slot (in the corpus employed), and D: N – W * is a function mapping a node to the words it (partially) sense dominates.",
        "That is, for all n e N and w e W, if w e D(n) then there is at least one sense n' e S(w) such that n is an ancestor of n' as determined through use of P. For example, we would expect the word bank to be dominated by a node standing for a class such as company as well as a separate node standing for, e.g., location.",
        "Based on this model we give a greedy search algorithm in Figure 1 for deriving slot type restrictions.",
        "The algorithm attempts to find a set of dominating word senses that cover at least one of each of a majority of the words in the given set of observations.",
        "The idea is to keep the number of nodes in the dominating set small, while maintaining high coverage and not abstracting too far upward.",
        "For a given slot we start with a set of observed words W, an upper bound m on the number of types allowed in the result R, and a parameter p setting a lower bound on the fraction of items in W that a valid solution must dominate.",
        "For example, when m = 3 and p = 0.9, this says we require the solution to consist of no more than 3 nodes, which together must dominate at least 90% of W.",
        "The search begins with initializing the cover set C, and the result set R as empty, with the variable a set to 1.",
        "Observe that at any point in the execution of DeriveTypes, C represents the set of all words from W with at least one sense having as an ancestor a node in R. While C continues to be smaller than the percentage required for a solution, nodes are added to R based on whichever element of N has the smallest score.",
        "The Score function first computes the modified coverage of n, setting C' to be all words in W that are dominated by n that haven't yet been \"spoken for\" by a previously selected (and thus lower scoring) node.",
        "Score returns the sum of the path lengths between the elements of the modified set of dominated nodes and n, divided by that set's size, scaled by the exponent a.",
        "Note when a = 1, Score simply returns the average path length of the words dominated by n.",
        "If the size of the result grows beyond the specified threshold, R and C are reset, a is incremented by some step size 5, and the search starts again.",
        "As a grows, the function increasingly favors the coverage of a node over the summed path length.",
        "Each iteration of DeriveTypes thus represents a further relaxation of the desire to have the returned nodes be as specific as possible.",
        "Eventually, a will be such that the minimum scoring nodes will be found high enough in the tree to cover enough of the observations to satisfy the threshold p, at which point R is returned.",
        "As can be observed, our approach makes no use of the relative or absolute frequencies of the words in W, even though such frequencies could be added as, e.g., relative weights on length in Score.",
        "This is a purposeful decision motivated both by practical and theoretical concerns.",
        "Practically, a large portion of the knowledge observed in Knext output is infrequently expressed, and yet many tend to be reasonable claims about the world (despite their textual rarity).",
        "For example, a template shown in Section 5, a __ may wear a crash_helmet, was supported by just two sentences in the BNC.",
        "However, based on those two observations we were able to conclude that usually If something wears a crash helmet, it is probably a male person.",
        "Initially our project began as an application of the closely related MDL approach of Li and Abe (1998), but was hindered by sparse data.",
        "We observed that our absolute frequencies were often too low to perform meaningful comparisons of relative frequency, and that different examples in development tended to call for different trade-offs between model cost and coverage.",
        "This was due as much to the sometimes idiosyncratic structure of WordNet as it was to lack of evidence.",
        "Theoretically, our goal is distinct from related efforts in acquiring, e.g., verb argument selectional preferences.",
        "That work is based on the desire to reproduce distributional statistics underlying the text, and thus relative differences in frequency are the essential characteristic.",
        "In this work we aim for general statements about the real world, which in order to gather we rely on text as a limited proxy view.",
        "E.g., given 40 hypothetical sentences supporting a man may eat a taco, and just 2 sentences supporting a woman may eat a taco, we would like to conclude simply that a person may eat a taco, remaining agnostic as to relative frequency, as we've no reason to view corpus-derived counts as (strongly) tied to the likelihood of corresponding situations in the world; they simply tell us what is generally possible and worth mentioning."

        "Our method assumes that if multiple words occurring in the same slot can be subsumed under the same abstract class, then this information should be used to bias sense interpretation of these observed words, even when it means not picking the first sense.",
        "In general this bias is crucial to our approach, and tends to select correct senses of the words in an argument set W. But an example where this strategy errs was observed for the template a __ may bark, which yielded the generalization that If something barks, then it is probably a person.",
        "This was because there were numerous textual occurrences of various types of people \"barking\" (speaking loudly and aggressively), and so the occurrences of dogs barking, which showed no type variability, were interpreted as involving the unusual sense of dog as a slur applied to certain people.",
        "The template, a _ can be whiskered, had observations including both face and head.",
        "This prompted experiments in allowing part holonym relations (e.g., a face is part of a head) as part of the definition of P, with the final decision being that such relations lead to less intuitive generalizations rather than more, and thus these relation types were not included.",
        "The remaining relation types within WordNet were individually examined via inspection of randomly selected examples from the hierarchy.",

        "While we were able to successfully generalize to female person, there were a number of words observed which unexpectedly fell outside that associated synset.",
        "For example, a queen and a duchess may each be a female aristocrat, a mum may be a female parent, and a fiancee has the exclusive interpretation as being synonymous with the gender entailing bride-to-be."
