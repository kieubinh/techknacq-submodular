      "text": [
        "Thematic fit (or semantic role plausibility) is the plausibility of a noun phrase referent playing a specific semantic role (like agent or patient) in the event denoted by a verbal predicate, e.g. the plausibility that a judge sentences someone (which makes the judge the agent of the sentencing event) or that a judge is sentenced him-or herself (which makes the judge the patient).",
        "Thematic fit has been an important concept in psycholinguistics as a predictor variable in models of human sentence comprehension, either to discriminate between possible structural analyses during initial processing in constraint-based models (see MacDonald and Seidenberg (2006) for a recent overview), or after initial syntactic processing in modular models (e.g. Frazier (1987)).",
        "In fact, thematic fit is at the core of the most-studied of all structural ambiguity phenomena, the ambiguity between a main clause or a reduced relative clause interpretation of an NP verb-ed sequence (the MV/RR ambiguity), which is essentially a semantic role ambiguity.",
        "If the temporarily ambiguous sentence The judge sentenced ... is continued as a main clause (e.g.",
        "The judge sentenced him to 10 years in prison), the noun phrase the judge would be the agent of the verb sentenced, while it would be the patient of sentenced in a reduced relative clause continuation (e.g.",
        "The judge sentenced to 4 years in prison for indecent exposure could also lose his state pension).",
        "Apart from its importance in psycholinguistics, the concept of thematic fit is also relevant for computational linguistics in general (see Padó et al.",
        "(2007) for some examples).",
        "A number of models that try to capture human thematic fit preferences have been developed in recent years (Resnik, 1996; Padó et al., 2006; Padó et al., 2007).",
        "These previous approaches rely on the linguistic notion of verb selectional preferences.",
        "The plausibility that an argument plays a specific semantic role in the event denoted by a verb – in other words, that a verb, role and argument occur together – is predicted by how well the argument head fits the restrictions that the verb imposes on the argument candidates for the semantic role slot under consideration (e.g. eat prefers edible arguments to fill its patient slot).",
        "Therefore, what these models capture is actually not semantic role plausibility, but argument plausibility.",
        "The model presented here takes a different approach.",
        "Instead of predicting the plausibility of an argument given a verb-role pair (e.g. the plausibility of judge given sentence-patient), it predicts the plausibility of a semantic role given a verbargument pair (e.g. the plausibility of patient given sentence-judge), through similarity-based generalization from previously seen verb-argument pairs.",
        "In the context of modeling thematic fit as a con straint in the resolution of sentence-level ambiguity problems like the MV/RR ambiguity, predicting role fit instead of argument fit seems to be the most straightforward approach.",
        "After all, when thematic fit is approached in this way, the model directly captures the semantic role ambiguity that is at stake during the analysis of sentences that are temporarily ambiguous between a main clause and a reduced relative interpretation.",
        "This means that our model of thematic fit should be very easy to extend into a full-blown model of the resolution of any sentence-level ambiguity that crucially revolves around a semantic role ambiguity.",
        "In addition, the fact that it generalizes from previously seen verb-argument pairs, based on their similarity to the target pair, should make it more robust than previous approaches.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: in the next section, we briefly discuss two state-of-the-art thematic fit models, the performance of which will be compared to that of our model.",
        "Section 3 introduces three different instantiations of our model.",
        "The evaluation of the model and the comparison of its performance with that of the models discussed in Section 2 is presented in Section 4.",
        "Section 5 ties everything together with some general conclusions."

        "Exemplar-based models of cognition (also known as Memory-Based Learning or instance/case-based reasoning/learning models) (Fix and Hodges, 1951; Cover and Hart, 1967; Daelemans and van den Bosch, 2005) are classification models that extrapolate their behavior from stored representations of earlier experiences to new situations, based on the similarity of the old and the new situation.",
        "These models keep a database of stored exemplars and refer to that database to guide their behavior in new situations.",
        "Models can extrapolate from only one similar memory exemplar, a group of similar exemplars (a nearest neighbor set), or even the whole exemplar memory, using some decay function to give less weight to less similar exemplars.",
        "Applied to our model of thematic fit, this means that the model should have a database in which semantic representations of verb-argument pairs are stored together with the semantic roles of the arguments.",
        "The plausibility of a semantic role given a new verb-argument pair is then determined by the support for that role among the verb-argument pairs in memory that are semantically most similar to the target pair.",
        "An immediately obvious advantage of this approach should be its potential robustness for data sparsity, since similarity-based smoothing is an intrinsic part of the model.",
        "Even if neither the verb nor the argument of a verb-argument pair occur in the exemplar memory, role plausibilities can be predicted, as long as the similarity of the target exemplar's semantic representation with the semantic representations in the exemplar memory can be calculated.",
        "An additional advantage of similarity-based smoothing is that it does not involve the estimation of an exponential number of smoothing parameters, as is the case for backed-off smoothing methods (Zavrel and Daelemans, 1997).",
        "For this study, we will implement three different kinds of exemplar-based models.",
        "The first model is a basic k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) model.",
        "In this model, the plausibility rating for a semantic role given a verb-argument pair is simply determined by the (relative) frequency with which that semantic role is assigned to the k verb-argument pairs that are nearest (i.e. most similar) to the target verb-argument pair (these exemplars constitute the nearest neighbor set).",
        "The second model adds a decay function to this simple k-NN model, so that not only the role frequency, but also the absolute semantic distance between the target item and the neighbors in the nearest neighbor set determine the plausibility rating.",
        "In the third model, a normalization factor ensures that distance of the exemplars in the nearest neighbor set to the target item determines their weight in the calculation of the plausibility rating while factoring out an effect of absolute distance.",
        "The semantic distance between two verbargument exemplars is determined by the semantic distance between the verbs and between the nouns.",
        "In all models described below, the distance between two exemplars i and j (dij) is given by the sum of the weighted distances (5) between the semantic representations of the exemplars' nouns (n) and verbs (v):",
        "We are not theoretically committed to any specific semantic representation or similarity metric for the computation of 5(vi, vj) and 5(ni, nj).",
        "The only requirement is that they should be able to distinguish nouns that typically occur in the same contexts, but in different roles (like writer and book), which probably excludes all vector-based approaches that do not take into account syntactic information (see also Padó et al.",
        "(2007)).",
        "In the next three sections, each of the three exemplar-based models is discussed in more detail.",
        "The most basic of all exemplar-based models is a k-NN model in which the preference strength of a class upon presentation of a stimulus is simply the relative frequency of that class among the nearest neighbors of the stimulus.",
        "In the context of thematic fit, this means that the preference strength (PS) for a semantic role response J given a verbargument stimulus i is found by summing the frequencies of all exemplars with semantic role J among the k nearest neighbors of i (CJ) and dividing this by the total number of exemplars in the k-nearest neighbor set, with k (the number of nearest neighbors taken into consideration) being a free parameter:",
        "We will call this model the k-NN frequency model (henceforth kNNf).",
        "The kNNf model uses the similarity between the target exemplar and the memory exemplars only to determine which items belong to the nearest neighbor set.",
        "Whether these nearest neighbors are very similar or only slightly similar to the target exemplar, or whether there are some very similar items but also some very dissimilar items among those neighbors does not have any influence on the class's preference strength; only relative frequency within the nearest neighbor set counts.",
        "Only relying on the relative frequency of semantic roles within the nearest neighbor set to predict their plausibilities might indeed be a reasonable approach to modeling thematic fit in a lot of cases.",
        "Being a good agent for a given verb often entails being a bad patient for that same verb (or even in general), and the other way around.",
        "For example, judge is a very plausible agent of the verb sentence, while at the same time it is a rather unlikely patient of the same verb, while it is exactly the other way around for criminal, as the mean participant ratings (on a 7-point scale) in Table 1 show (these were taken from McRae et al.",
        "(1998)).",
        "The relative frequencies of the agent and patient roles in the nearest neighbor set could in theory perfectly explain these ratings: a high relative frequency of the agent role among the nearest neighbors of the verb-argument pair (sentence, judge) should correspond to a high rating for the role, and implies low relative frequencies for other roles such as the patient role, which means the patient role should receive a low rating.",
        "For (sentence, criminal) this works in exactly the opposite way.",
        "Solely relying on the the relative semantic role frequencies in the nearest neighbor set might not always work, though, since it implies that plausibility ratings for different roles are always completely dependent on and therefore perfectly predictable from each other: high plausibility for a certain semantic role given a verb-argument pair always implies low plausibility for the other roles in the nearest neighbor set, and low plausibility for one semantic role invariably means higher plausibility for the other ones.",
        "However, nouns can also be more or less equally good as agents and patients for a given verb – one is hopefully as likely to be helped by a friend as to help a friend oneself – or equally bad – houses only kill in horror movies, and 'to kill a house' can only be made sense of in a metaphorical way.",
        "Therefore, we also implement a model that takes distance into account for its plausibility ratings.",
        "The basic idea is that a semantic role will receive a lower rating as the nearest neighbors supporting that role become less similar to the target item.",
        "The plausibility rating for a semantic role given a verb-argument pair in this model is a joint function of:",

        "We presented an exemplar-based model of thematic it that is founded on the idea that semantic role plausibility can be predicted by similarity-based generalization over verb-argument pairs.",
        "In contrast to previous models, this model does not implement semantic role plausibility as 'fit with verb selectional preferences', but directly captures the semantic role ambiguity problem comprehen-ders have to solve when confronted with sentences that contain structural ambiguities like the MV/RR ambiguity, namely deciding which semantic role a noun has in the event denoted by the verb.",
        "Therefore, the model should be easily extensible towards a complete model of any sentence-level ambiguity that revolves around a semantic role ambiguity.",
        "We have shown that our model can account very well for human semantic role plausibility judgments, attaining both high correlations with human ratings and high coverage overall, and improving on two state-of-the-art models, the performance of which deteriorates when there is a small overlap between the verbs in the training corpus and in the test data, or when the test nouns have low frequencies in the training corpus.",
        "We suggest that this improvement is due to the fact that our model applies similarity-based smoothing over both nouns and verbs.",
        "Generally, one can say that the exemplar-based model's architecture makes it very robust for data sparsity.",
        "We also found that a non-normalized version of our model that takes distance into account to weight the memory exemplars seems to perform somewhat better than a simple nearest neighbor model or a normalized distance decay model.",
        "However, these performance differences are not statistically signiicant, and we did not ind the predicted advantage of the non-normalized distance decay model on the Padó data set.",
        "In future work, we will test our claim of straightforward extensibility of the model by indeed extending our model to account for reading time patterns in the online processing of sentences exemplifying temporary semantic role ambiguities, more speciically the MV/RR ambiguity.",
        "Another avenue for future research is to see how our approach to thematic it can be used to augment existing semantic role labeling systems."
