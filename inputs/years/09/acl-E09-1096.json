        "The problem of document alignment is described as the task of aligning documents, news articles for instance, across two corpora based on content similarity.",
        "The groups of corpora can be in the same or in different languages, depending on the purpose of one's task.",
        "In our study, we attempt to align similar documents across comparable corpora which are bilingual, each set written in a different language but having similar content and domain coverage for different communication needs.",
        "Previous works on monolingual document alignment focus on automatic alignment between documents and their presentation slides or between documents and their abstracts.",
        "Kan (2007) uses two similarity measures, Cosine and Jac-card, to calculate the candidate alignment score in his SlideSeer system, a digital library software that retrieves documents and their narrated slide presentations.",
        "Daumé and Marcu (2004) use a phrase-based HMM model to mine the alignment between documents and their human-written abstracts.",
        "The main purpose of this work is to increase the size of the training corpus for a statistical-based summarization system.",
        "The research on similarity calculation for multilingual comparable corpora has attracted more attention than monolingual comparable corpora.",
        "However, the purpose and scenario of these works are rather varied.",
        "Steinberger et al.",
        "(2002) represent document contents using descriptor terms of a multilingual thesaurus EUROVOC, and calculate the semantic similarity based on the distance between the two documents' representations.",
        "The assignment of descriptors is trained by log-likelihood test and computed by TFIDF, Cosine, and Okapi.",
        "Similarly, Pouliquen et al.",
        "(2004) use a linear combination of three types of knowledge: cognates, geographical place names reference, and map documents based on the EUROVOC.",
        "The major limitation of these works is the use of EUROVOC, which is a specific resource workable only for European languages.",
        "Aligning documents across parallel corpora is another area of interest.",
        "Patry and Langlais (2005) use three similarity scores, Cosine, Normalized Edit Distance, and Sentence Alignment Score, to compute the similarity between two parallel documents.",
        "An Adaboost classifier is trained on a list of scored text pairs labeled as parallel or nonparallel.",
        "Then, the learned classifier is used to check the correctness of each alignment candidate.",
        "Their method is simple but effective.",
        "However, the features used in this method are only suitable for parallel corpora as the measurement is mainly based on structural similarity.",
        "One goal of document alignment is for parallel sentence extraction for applications like statistical machine translation.",
        "Cheung and Fung (2004) highlight that most of the current sentence alignment models are applicable for parallel documents, rather than comparable documents.",
        "In addition, they argue that document alignment should be done before parallel sentence extraction.",
        "Tao and Zhai (2005) propose a general method to extract comparable bilingual text without using any linguistic resources.",
        "The main feature of this method is the frequency correlation of words in different languages.",
        "They assume that those words in different languages should have similar frequency correlation if they are actually translations of each other.",
        "The association between two documents is then calculated based on this information using Pearson's correlation together with two monolingual features BM25, a term frequency normalization (Stephan et al., 1994), and IDF.",
        "The main advantages of this approach are that it is purely statistical-based and it is language-independent.",
        "However, its performance may be compromised due to the lack of linguistic knowledge, particularly across corpora which are linguistically very different.",
        "Recently, Munteanu (2006) introduces a rather simple way to get the group of similar content document in multilingual comparable corpus by using the Lemur IR Toolkit (Ogilvie and Callan, 2001).",
        "This method first pushes all the target documents into the database of the Lemur, and then uses a word-byword translation of each source document as a query to retrieve similar content target documents.",
        "This paper will leverage on previous work, and propose and explore diverse range of features in our system.",
        "Our document alignment system consists of three stages: candidate generation, feature extraction and feature combination.",
        "We verify our method on two set of bilingual news comparable corpora English-Chinese and English-Malay.",
        "Experimental results show that1) when only using Fourier Transform-based term frequency, our method outperforms our reimplementation of Tao (2005)'s method by 4.1% and 8% for the top 100 alignment candidates and,",
        "2) when using all features, our method significantly outperforms our implementation of Mun-teanu's (2006) method by 23.2% and 15.3%.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "In section 2, we describe the overall architecture of our system.",

        "Architecture for Document Alignment Model.",
        "Like many other text processing systems, the system first defines two filtering criteria to prune out \"clearly bad\" candidates.",
        "This will dramatically reduce the search space.",
        "We implement the following filers for this purpose:",
        "Date-Window Filter: As mentioned earlier, the data used for the present work are news corpora – a text genre that has very strong links with the time element.",
        "The published date of document is available in data, and can easily be used as an indicator to evaluate the relation between two articles in terms of time.",
        "Similar to Muntea-nu's (2006), we aim to constrain the number of candidates by assuming that documents with similar content should have publication dates which are fairly close to each other, even though they reside in two different sets of corpora.",
        "By imposing this constraint, both the complexity and the cost in computation can be reduced tremendously as the number of candidates would be significantly reduced.",
        "For example, when a 1-day window size is set, this means that for a given source document, the search for its target candidates is set within 3 days of the source document: the same day of publication, the day after, and the day before.",
        "With this filter, using the data of one-month in our experiment, a reduction of 90% of all possible alignments can be achieved (section 5.1).",
        "Moreover, with our evaluation data, after filtering out document pairs using a 1-day window size, up to 81.6% for English-Chinese and 80.3% for English-Malay of the golden alignments are covered.",
        "If the window size is increased to 5, the coverage is 96.6% and 95.6% for two language pairs respectively.",
        "Title-n-Content Filter: previous date window filter constrains the number of candidates based purely on temporal information without exploiting any knowledge of the documents' contents.",
        "The number of candidates to be generated is thus dependent on the number of published articles per day, instead of the candidates' potential content similarity.",
        "For this reason, we introduce another filter which makes use of document titles to gauge content-wise cross document similarity.",
        "As document titles are available in news data, we capitalize on words found in these document titles, favoring alignment candidates where at least one of the title-words in the source document has its translation found in the content of the other target document.",
        "This filter can reduce a further 47.9% (English-Chinese) and 26.3% (English-Malay) of the remaining alignment candidates after applying the date-window filter.",
        "The second step extracts all the features for each candidate and computes the score for each individual feature function.",
        "In our model, the feature set is composed of the Title-n-Content score (TNC), Linguistic-Independent-Unit score (LIU), and Monolingual Term Distribution similarity (MTD).",
        "We will discuss all three features in sections 3 and 4.",
        "The final score for each alignment candidate is computed by combining all the feature function scores into a unique score.",
        "In literature, there are many methods concerning the estimation of the overall score for a given feature set, which vary from supervised to unsupervised method.",
        "Supervised methods such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Maximum Entropy (ME) estimate the weight of each feature based on training data which are then used to calculate the final score.",
        "However, these supervised learning-based methods may not be applicable to our proposed issue as we are motivated to build a language independent unsupervised system.",
        "We simply take a product of all normalized features to obtain one unique score.",
        "This is because our features are probabilistically independent.",
        "In our implementation, we normalize the scores to make them less sensitive to the absolute value by taking the logarithm ln(.)",

        "(e – T) is a threshold for x to contribute positively to the unique score.",
