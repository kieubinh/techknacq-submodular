        "If we take a dialogue perspective on Lewis' (1979) notion of accommodation and assume that the state of a dialogue is changed by the acts performed by the dialogue participants, it is natural to interpret Lewis' broad notion of accommodation as tacit (or implicit) dialogue acts.",
        "This is the approach adopted by Kreutel and Matheson (2003) who formalize the treatment of tacit dialogue acts in the information state update framework.",
        "According to them, accommodation is ruled by the following principle:",
        "Context Accommodation (CA): For any move m that ocurrs in a given scenario sc^: if assignment of a context-dependent interpretation to m in sc fails, try to accommodate sc to a new context sci+i in an appropriate way by assuming implicit dialogue acts performed in m, and start interpretation of m again in sci+1.",
        "The authors concentrate on the treatment of implicit acceptance acts but suggest that the CA principle can be seen as a general means of context-dependent interpretation.",
        "This principle opens up the question of how to find the appropriate tacit dialogue acts.",
        "Finding them is an inference problem that is addressed using special-purpose algorithms in (Thomason et al., 2006), where the authors present a unified architecture for both context-dependent interpretation and context-dependent generation.",
        "In Frolog, we investigate how this inference process can be implemented using recent tools from artificial intelligence planning.",
        "The resulting framework naturally lends itself to studying the pressing problem for current theories of accommodation called missing accommodation (Beaver and Zeevat, 2007).",
        "These theories can neither explain why accommodation is sometimes easier and sometimes much more difficult, nor how cases of missing accommodation relate to clarification subdialogues in conversation.",
        "We review what Frolog has to offer to the understanding of accommodation in general and missing accommodation in particular in Section 3.",
        "But first, we have to introduce Frolog and describe its components, and we do so in Section 2."

        "The architecture is organized in three natural language understanding (NLU) modules and three natural language generation (NLG) modules, and the state of the interaction is represented in two knowledge bases (KBs).",

        "The arguments show the thematic roles of the verb (for instance, the verb open requires a patient and an agent), the preconditions indicate the conditions that the game world must satisfy so that the action can be executed (for instance, in order to open the chest, it has to be accessible, unlocked and closed); the effects determine how the action changes the game world when it is executed (after opening the chest, it will be open).",

        "In the previous section we presented the execution of the system when everything \"goes well\", that is (to come back to the terminology used in Section 1) when the assignment of a context-dependent interpretation to the player's move succeeds.",
        "However, during the interaction with Frolog, it often happens that the player issues a command that cannot be directly executed in the current state of the game but needs accommodation or clarification.",
        "This is the topic of the next two subsections.",
        "3.1 Tacit acts are inferable and executable: accommodation succeeds",
        "Suppose that the player has just locked the little chest and left its key on the table when she realizes that she forgot to take the sword from it, so she utters \"open the chest\".",
        "If Frolog is in its non-accommodating mode then it answers \"the chest is locked\" because the precondition not(locked(P)) does not hold in the game world.",
        "In this mode, the interactions with the game can get quite long and repetitive as illustrated below.",
        "Non-accommodating mode Accommodating mode P: open the chest P: open the chest",
        "F: the chest is locked F: the chest is open",
        "P: unlock it",
        "F: you don't have the key",
        "In its accommodating mode, Frolog tries to accommodate the current state sci of the game to a new state sci+1 in which the precondition hold, by assuming tacit dialogue acts performed, and starts the interpretation of the command again in sci+1.",
        "That is, the game assumes that \"take the key and unlock the chest with it\" are tacit acts that are performed when the player says \"open the chest\".",
        "The inference of such tacit dialogue acts is done using artificial intelligence planners.",
        "The planning problems are generated on the fly during a game each time a precondition does not hold; the initial state being the player KB, the goal being the precondition that failed, and the action schemas those actions available in the action database.",
        "The size of the plans can be configured, when the length is zero we say that Frolog is in its non-accommodating mode.",
        "For detailed discussion of the subtleties involved in the kind of information that has to be used to infer the tacit acts see (Benotti, 2007).",
        "Two planners have been integrated in Frolog (the player can decide which one to use): Blackbox (Kautz and Selman, 1999) which is fast and deterministic and PKS (Petrick and Bacchus, 2004) which can reason over non-deterministic actions.",
        "For detailed discussion and examples including non-deterministic actions see (Benotti, 2008).",
        "Tacit acts are inferred using the information available to the player (the player KB) but their execution is verified with respect to the accurate and complete state of the world (the game KB).",
        "So",
        "Frolog distinguishes three ways in which accommodation can fail: there is no plan, there is more than one plan, or there is a plan which is not executable in the game world.",
        "For reasons of space we will only illustrate the last case here.",
        "Suppose that the golden key, which was lying on the table, was taken by a thief without the player knowing.",
        "As a consequence, the key is on the table in the player KB, but in the game KB the thief has it.",
        "In this situation, the player issues the command \"Open the chest\" and the sequence of tacit acts inferred (given the player beliefs) is \"take the key from the table and unlock the chest with it\".",
        "When trying to execute the tacit acts, the game finds the precondition that does not hold and verbalizes it with \"the key is not on the table, you don't know where it is\".",
        "Such answer can be seen as a clarification request (CR), it has the effect of assigning to the player the responsability of finding the key before trying to open the chest.",
        "The same responsability that would be assigned by more commonly used CR that can happen in this scenario, namely \"Where is the key?",
        "\".",
        "In the game, such clarifications vary according to the knowledge that is currently available to the player.",
        "If the player knows that the dragon has the key and she can only take it while the dragon is asleep an answer such as \"the dragon is not sleeping\" is generated in the same fashion."
