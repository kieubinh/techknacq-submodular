        "The system is flexible enough to produce opinion oriented summaries by accommodating techniques to mine documents that express different views or commentaries.",
        "The very competitive results obtained during the last Text Evaluation Conference (TAC 2008) show that our approach is efficient.",
        "This short paper is structured as follows: we first give a quick overview of the state of the art.",
        "We then describe our system, focusing on the most important novel features implemented.",
        "Lastly, we give the details of the results obtained on the TAC 2008 Opinion Pilot task."

        "Interest in creating automatic summaries has begun in the 1950s (Luhn, 1958).",
        "(Edmundson and Wyllys, 1961) proposed features to assign a score to each sentence of a corpus in order to rank these sentences.",
        "The ones with the highest scores are kept to produce the summary.",
        "The features they used were sentence position (in a news article for example, the first sentences are the most important), proper names and keywords in the document title, indicative phrases and sentence length.",
        "Later on, summarizers aimed at eliminating redundancy, especially for multi-documents summarizing purpose.",
        "Identifying redundancy is a critical task, as information appearing several times in different documents can be qualified as important.",
        "Among recent approaches, the \"centroid-based summarization\" method developed by (Radev et al., 2004) consists in identifying the centroid of a cluster of documents, in other words the terms which best suit the documents to summarize.",
        "Then, the sentences to be extracted are the ones that contain the greatest number of centroids.",
        "Radev implemented this method in an online multi-document summarizer, MEAD.",
        "Radev further improved MEAD using a different method to extract sentences: \"Graph-based centrality\" extractor (Erkan and Radev, 2004).",
        "It consists in computing similarity between sentences, and then selecting sentences which are considered as \"central\" in a graph where nodes are sentences and edges are similarities.",
        "Sentence selection is then performed by picking the sentences which have been visited most after a random walk on the graph.",
        "The last two systems are dealing with redundancy as a post-processing step.",
        "(Zhu et al., 2007), assuming that redundancy should be the concept on what is based multi-document summarization, offered a method to deal with redundancy at the same time as sentence selection.",
        "For that purpose, the authors used a \"Markov absorbing chain random walk\" on a graph representing the different sentences of the corpus to summarize.",
        "MMR-MD, introduced by Carbonnel in (Car-bonell and Goldstein, 1998), is a measure which needs a passage clustering: all passages considered as synonyms are grouped into the same clusters.",
        "MMR-MD takes into account the similarity to a query, coverage of a passage (clusters that it belongs to), content in the passage, similarity to passages already selected for the summary, belonging to a cluster or to a document that has already contributed a passage to the summary.",
        "The problem of this measure lies in the clustering method: in the literature, clustering is generally fulfilled using a threshold.",
        "If a passage has a similarity to a cluster centroid higher than a threshold, then it is added to this cluster.",
        "This makes it a supervised clustering method; an unsupervised clustering method is best suited for automatic summarization, as the corpora we need to summarize are different from one to another.",
        "Moreover, sentence synonymy is also dependent on the corpus granularity and on the user compression requirement.",
        "3 CBSEAS: A Clustering-Based Sentence Extractor for Automatic Summarization",
        "We assume that, in multi-document summarization, redundant pieces of information are the single most important element to produce a good summary.",
        "Therefore, the sentences which carry those pieces of information have to be extracted.",
        "Detecting these sentences conveying the same information is the first step of our approach.",
        "The developed algorithm first establishes the similarities between all sentences of the documents to summarize, then applies a clustering algorithm – fast global k-means (Lopez-Escobar et al., 2006) – to the similarity matrix in order to create clusters in which sentences convey the same information.",
        "First, our system ranks all the sentences according to their similarity to the documents centroid.",
        "We have chosen to build up the documents centroid with the m most important terms, their importance being reflected by the tf/idf of each term.",
        "We then select the n best ranked sentences to create a n sentences long summary.",
        "We do so because the clustering algorithm we use to detect sentences",
        "for all ej inE",
        "Ci – ej for i from 1 to k do center(Cj) – em \\emmaximizes ^\"\"^ sim(em,en) for all ej in E",

        "It initially contains only its center, the worst represented element in its cluster.",
        "done",
        "conveying the same information, fast global k-means, behaves better when it has to group nelements into n clusters.",
        "The similarity with the centroid is a weighted sum of terms appearing in both centroid and sentence, normalized by sentence length.",
        "Similarity between sentences is computed using a variant of the \"Jaccard\" measure.",
        "If two terms are not equal, we test their synonymy/hyperonymy using the Wordnet taxonomy (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "In case they are synonyms or hyperonym/hyponym, these terms are taken into account in the similarity calculation, but weighted respectively half and quarter in order to reflect that term equality is more important than term semantic relation.",
        "We do this in order to solve the problem pointed out in (Erkan and Radev, 2004) (synonymy was not taken into account for sentence similarity measures) and so to enhance sentence similarity measure.",
        "It is crucial to our system based on redundancy location as redundancy assumption is dependent on sentence similarities.",
        "Once the similarities are computed, we cluster the sentences using fast global k-means (description of the algorithm is in figure 1) using the similarity matrix.",
        "It works well on a small data set with a small number of dimensions, although it has not yet scaled up as well as we would have expected.",
        "This clustering step completed, we select one sentence per cluster in order to produce a summary that contains most of the relevant information/ideas in the original documents.",
        "We do so by choosing the central sentence in each cluster.",
        "The central sentence is the one which maximizes the sum of similarities with the other sentences of its cluster.",
        "It should be the one that characterizes best the cluster in terms of information vehicled."

        "The other problem with blogs is the noise due to the use of unusual language.",
        "We had to clean the blogs in a preprocessing step: sentences with a ratio number of frequent words/total number of words below a given threshold (0.35) were deemed too noisy and discarded.",
        "Frequent words are the one hundred most frequent words in the English language which on average make up approximately half of written texts (Fry et al., 2000).",
        "Our system, CBSEAS, is a \"standard\" summarization system.",
        "We had to adapt it in order to deal with the specific task of summarizing opinions.",
        "All sentences from the set of documents to summarize were tagged following the opinion detected in the blog post they originated from.",
        "We used for that purpose a two-class (positive or negative) SVM classifier trained on movie reviews.",
        "The idea behind the opinion classifier is to improve summaries by selecting sentences having the same opinionated polarity as the query, which were tagged using a SVM trained on the manually tagged queries from the training data provided earlier in TAC.",
        "As the Opinion Summarization Task was to produce a query-oriented summary, the sentence preselection was changed, using the user query instead of the documents centroid.",
        "We also changed the sentence pre-selection ranking measure by weighting terms according to their lexical category; we have chosen to give more weight to proper names than verbs adjectives, adverbs and nouns.",
        "Indeed, opinions we had to summarize were mostly on products or people.",
        "While experimenting our system on TAC 2008 training data, we noticed that extracting sentences which are closest to their cluster center was not satisfactory.",
        "Some other sentences in the same cluster were best fitted to a query-oriented summary.",
        "We added the sentence ranking used for the sentence pre-selection to the final sentence extractor.",

        "Participants were classified into two different groups: one for those who did not use snippets, and one for those who did.",
        "We did not use snippets at all, as it is a more realistic challenge to look directly at the blogs with no external help.",
        "The results we present here are those of the participants that were not using snippets.",
        "Indeed, systems using snippets obtained much higher scores than the other systems.",

        "As one can see, our responsiveness scores are low compared to the others (responsiveness score corresponds to the following question: \"How much would you pay for that summary?\").",
        "We suppose that despite the grammaticality, fluency and pyramid scores of our summaries, judges gave a bad responsiveness score to our summaries because they are too long: we made the choice to produce summaries with a compression rate of 10% when it was possible, the maximum length authorized otherwise."
