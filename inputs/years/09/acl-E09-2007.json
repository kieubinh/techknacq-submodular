        "In written German newspaper text, clausal coordination occurs in about 14% of the sentences, and coordinate ellipsis (e.g. (1)) in about 7% (see a corpus study by Harbusch and Kempen, 2007).",
        "Studies of ellipsis in Estonian are hardly available (cf. Erelt, 2003).",
        "(1) Monopole sollen geknackt werden und Monopolies should shattered be and Märkte sollen getrennt werden markets should split be 'Monopolies should be shattered and markets split'",
        "In order to deal with these relatively frequent phenomena, we develop an Estonian coordinate-ellipsis generator based on ELLEIpo, the software module written in JAVA that generates clausal coordinate ellipsis in German and Dutch (Harbusch and Kempen, 2006; 2009).",
        "Given the fact that the two target languages belong to two rather different language families (German is an Indo-European, Estonian a Finno-Ugric language) we expected the two target languages to differ considerably with respect to the rules for generating coordinate elisions; however, this expectation was falsified.",
        "As we will detail below, a pairwise comparison of a heterogeneous set of elliptical constructions in the target languages reveals that the German rules we had implemented in Elleipo also generate the Estonian structures.",
        "We only needed to adapt the lexicon and some syntax rules unrelated to coordination.",
        "The core algorithm worked language-independently for both languages.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "In section 2, we first define the four main groups of clausal coordinate ellipsis phenomena, and show that the elisions in the two target languages obey basically the same rules.",
        "This implies that the Estonian version of the software system ELLEIPO can use the same core algorithm as the German and Dutch version.",
        "In section 3, we discuss other linguistic theories for clausal coordinate ellipsis, especially focussing on implementations for generation.",
        "In final section 4, we draw some conclusions and address options for future work."

      "text": [
        "In the literature, one often distinguishes four major types of clause-level coordinate ellipsis (which can become combined; cf. example (1)).",
        "• Gapping, with three special variants called Long Distance Gapping (LDG), Sub-gapping, and Stripping,",
        "• Forward Conjunction Reduction (FCR),",
        "• Backward Conjunction Reduction (BCR;",
        "also called Right Node Raising), and • Subject Gap in clauses with Finite/",
        "Fronted verbs (SGF).",
        "They are illustrated in the English sentences (2) through (8).",
        "The subscripts denote the elliptical mechanism at work: g stands for Gapping, Sub-gapping, and Stripping, respectively; g(g)+is recursively added for LDG; /= FCR; s = SGF; b = BCR.",
        "(2) Gapping: Juri lives in Tallinn and his children Oveg in Tartu",
        "(3) LDG: My wife wants to buy a car and my son wantsg[to buy]gg a motorcycle",
        "(4) Subgapping: The driver was killed and the passengers wereg severely wounded",
        "(5) Stripping: My sister lives in Narva and my brother [lives in Narva]g too",
        "(6) FCR: Pdrnu is the city [S where Ainar lives and wheref Peeter works]",
        "(7) BCR: Riina arrived before three [o'clock]b and Terje left after six o'clock",
        "(8) SGF: Into the wood went the hunter and [the hunter]s shot a hare",
        "in the theoretical framework by Kempen (2009) and its implementation for German and Dutch in ELLEIPO, the elision process is guided by constraints on lemma-and wordform-identity constraints and, to some extent, linear order.",
        "Elleipo's functioning is based on the assumption that coordinate ellipsis does not result from the application of declarative grammar rules for clause formation but from a procedural component that interacts with the sentence generator and may block the overt expression of certain constituents.",
        "Thus, the rules apply to assembled non-elliptical (unreduced) tree structures in the final stage of generation.",
        "Due to this feature, Elleipo can be combined, at least in principle, with various lexicalized-grammar formalisms.",
        "However, this advantage does not come entirely for free: The module needs a formalism-dependent interface that converts generator output to a canonical form consisting of \"flat\" syntactic trees where all major clause constituents are represented at the same hierarchical level (see Harbusch and Kempen 2006; 2007).",
        "In the following, we introduce ELLEIPO's elision rules only in an informal manner (for the pseudocode of the algorithm, see Harbusch and Kempen, 2006; 2009).",
        "The rules described in the following can be applied in any order to unreduced syntactic structures in canonical form.",
        "In case of a successful rule application, the elidable constituents (and its non-elided counterpart in the other conjunct) is adorned with a subscript indicating the ellipsis type (as illustrated in (2) through (8)).",
        "Elleipo's final step executes all possible elliptical combinations (e.g., for example (1), it also realizes a version with Subgapping and LDG, respectively, i.e.: Monopole sollen geknackt werden und Märkte solleng getrennt werdengg).",
        "In Gapping (see examples (9) and (10)), lemma-identical verbs can be elided from the second conjunct, if and only if a contrast is expressed, i.e. each remaining constituent in this conjunct has a counterpart with the same grammatical function in the first conjunct (cf. (11)).",
        "(9) Mari loeb artikleid ja tema pojad _g pakse raa-matuid Mari liest Artikel und ihre Söhne _g dicke Bücher Mari reads articles and her sons thick books",

        "*Mari kauft Birnen und Jüri _g auf dem Markt Mari buys pears and Jüri on the market",
        "In Long-Distance Gapping (LDG), the remnants, i.e. the non-elided constituents in the posterior conjunct, include constituents whose anterior counterparts belong to different clauses.",
        "My wife in (12) (translation of (3)) belongs to the main clause whereas a car is part of the infinitival complement clause.",
        "Notice that LDG does not require adjacency of the elided verbs (cf. the German example in (12)).",

        "In Forward-Conjunction Reduction (FCR), a left-peripheral string of major constituents in the right conjunct is elided under wordform-identity with its counterpart in the right conjunct.",
        "In FCR example (15), the left-peripheral string comprising complementizer, subject and direct object are elided from the right-hand conjunct.",
        "If modifiers that are neither lemma-nor wordform-identical, are placed in between subject and object – as in (16) – , then elision of the object is blocked.",
        "(Actually, example (16) is not ill-formed but its right-hand conjunct cannot be interpreted as cleaning the bike.)",
        "In main-clause variant (17), elision of the direct object is blocked for similar reasons.",

        "However, unlike FCR's mirror image, BCR may cut into major constituents of the clause.",
        "In BCR example",
        "(18) , the direct object can be elided in the first conjunct whereas in word-order variant (19), the verb blocks this elision.",
        "Example (20) illustrates that BCR, unlike the three other ellipsis types, may cut into major clausal constituents and only checks lemma-identity.",
        "Varying the objects to 'new bike'/'old bikes' , and the second subject 'Peter' to 'his brothers' does not rule out ellipsis as long as peripheral access is guaranteed.",

        "SGF (Subject Gap in clauses with Finite/Fronted verb) licenses elision of the subject of the right conjunct if in the left conjunct the subject follows the verb; however, the first constituent of the unreduced right-hand clausal conjunct must meet certain special requirements.",
        "In particular, it should be the subject of this clause (as in (24), translation of (S)) or a modifier (2S), but not an argument other than the subject, e.g. neither complement nor (in)direct object (26).",
        "Additionally, if FCR is also possible, it should actually be realized in order to license SGF (for additional discussion of these restrictions, see Harbusch and Kempen, 2009).",

        "For the sake of completeness, we should add here that we have not been able to find types of clausal coordinate ellipsis in Estonian that go beyond the above four types; hence, as far as we can tell, Estonian does not require additional rules over and above those we needed for German and Dutch."
