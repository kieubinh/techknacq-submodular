        "1 Introduction",
        "Until very recently, most NLP tasks (e.g., parsing, tagging, etc.)",
        "have been confined to a very limited number of languages, the so-called majority languages.",
        "Now, as the field moves into the era of developing tools for Resource Poor Languages (RPLs) – a vast majority of the world's 7,000 languages are resource poor – the discipline is confronted not only with the algorithmic challenges of limited data, but also the sheer difficulty of locating data in the first place.",
        "In this demo, we present a resource which taps the large body oflinguis-tically annotated data on the Web, data which can be re-purposed for NLP tasks.",
        "Because the field of linguistics has as its mandate the study of human language – in fact, the study of all human languages – and has wholeheartedly embraced the Web as a means for disseminating linguistic knowledge, the consequence is that a large quantity of analyzed language data can be found on the Web.",
        "In many cases, the data is richly annotated and exists for many languages for which there would otherwise be very limited annotated data.",
        "The resource, the Online Database of INterlinear text (ODIN), makes this data available and provides additional annotation and structure, making the resource useful to the Computational Linguistic audience.",
        "In this paper, after a brief discussion of the previous work on ODIN, we report our recent work on extending ODIN by applying machine learning methods to the task of data extraction and language identification, and on using ODIN to \"discover\" linguistic knowledge.",
        "Then we outline a plan for the demo presentation."

        "ODIN is a collection of Interlinear Glossed Text (IGT) harvested from scholarly documents.",
        "In this section, we describe the original ODIN system (Lewis, 2006), and the IGT enrichment algorithm (Xia and Lewis, 2007).",
        "These serve as the starting point for our current work, which will be discussed in the next section.",
        "In recent years, a large part of linguistic scholarly discourse has migrated to the Web, whether it be in the form of papers informally posted to scholars' websites, or electronic editions of highly respected journals.",
        "Included in many papers are snippets of language data that are included as part of this linguistic discourse.",
        "The language data is often represented as Interlinear Glossed Text (IGT), an example of which is shown in (1).",
        "gave-3sg the teacher book to-the boy yesterday \"The teacher gave a book to the boy yesterday\" (Bailyn, 2001)",
        "The canonical form of an IGT consists of three lines: a language line for the language in question, a gloss line that contains a word-by-word or morpheme-by-morpheme gloss, and a translation line, usually in English.",
        "The grammatical annotations such as 3sg on the gloss line are called grams.",
        "ODIN was built in three steps.",
        "First, linguistic documents that may contain instances of IGT are harvested from the Web using metacrawls.",
        "Metacrawling involves throwing queries against an existing search engine, such as Google and Live Search.",
        "Second, IGT instances in the retrieved documents are identified using regular expression \"templates\", effectively looking for text that resembles IGT.",
        "An example RegEx template is shown in (2), which matches any three-line instance (e.g., the IGT instance in (1)) such that the first line starts with an example number (e.g., (1) ) and the third line starts with a quotation mark.",
        "The third step is to determine the language of the language line in an IGT instance.",
        "Our original work in language ID relied on TextCat, an implementation of (Cavnar and Trenkle, 1994).",
        "As of January 2008 (the time we started our current work), ODIN had 41,581 instances of IGT for 731 languages extracted from nearly 3,000 documents.",
        "Since the language line in IGT data does not come with annotations (e.g., POS tags, phrase structures), Xia and Lewis (2007) proposed to enrich the original IGT and then extract syntactic information (e.g., context-free rules) to bootstrap NLP tools such as POS taggers and parsers.",
        "The enrichment algorithm has three steps: (1) parse the English translation with an English parser, (2) align the language line and the English translation via the gloss line, and (3) project syntactic structure from English to the language line.",
        "The algorithm was tested on 538 IGTs from seven languages and the word alignment accuracy was 94.1% and projection accuracy (i.e., the percentage of correct links in the projected dependency structures) was 81.5%."

      "heading": "3. Our recent work",
      "text": [
        "We extend the previous work in three areas: (1) improving IGT detection and language identification, (2) testing the usefulness of the enriched IGT by answering typological questions, and (3) enhancing ODIN's search facility by allowing structural and \"construction\" searches.",
        "The canonical form of IGT, as presented in Section 2.1, consists of three parts and each part is on a single line.",
        "However, many IGT instances, 53.6% of instances in ODIN, do not follow the canonical format for various reasons.",
        "For instance, some IGT instances are missing gloss or translation lines as they can be recovered from context (e.g., other neighboring examples or the text surrounding the instance); other IGT instances have multiple translations or language lines (e.g., one part in the native script, and another in a Latin transliteration).",
        "Because of the irregular structure of IGT instances, the regular expression templates used in the original ODIN system performed poorly.",
        "We apply machine learning methods to the task.",
        "In particular, we treat the IGT detection task as a sequence labeling problem: we train a classifier to tag each line with a predefined tag set, use the learner to tag new documents, and convert the best tag sequence into a span sequence.",
        "When trained on 41 documents (with 1573 IGT instances) and tested on 10 documents (with 447 instances), the F-score for exact match (i.e., two spans match iff they are identical) is 88.4%, and for partial match (i.e., two spans match iff they overlap) is 95.4%.",
        "In comparison, the F-score of the RegEx approach on the same test set is 51.4% for exact match and 74.6% for partial match.",
        "The language ID task here is very different from a typical language ID task.",
        "For instance, the number oflan-guages in ODIN is more than a thousand and could potentially reach several thousand as more data is added.",
        "Furthermore, for most languages in ODIN, our training data contains few to no instances of IGT.",
        "Because of these properties, applying existing language ID algorithms to the task does not produce satisfactory results.",
        "As IGTs are part of a document, there are often various cues in the document (e.g., language names) that can help predict the language ID of the IGT instances.",
        "We designed a new algorithm that treats the language ID task as a pronoun resolution task, where IGT instances are \"pronouns\", language names are \"antecedents\", and finding the language name of an IGT is the same as linking a pronoun (i.e., the IGT) to its antecedent (i.e., the language name).",
        "The algorithm outperforms existing, general-purpose language identification algorithms significantly.",
        "The detail of the algorithm and experimental results is described in (Xia et al., 2009).",
        "Running the new IGT detection on the original three thousand ODIN documents, the number of IGT instances increases from 41,581 to 189,244.",
        "We then ran the new language ID algorithm on the IGTs, and Table 1 shows the language distribution of the IGTs in ODIN according to the output of the algorithm.",
        "For instance, the third row says that 122 languages each have 100 to 999 IGT instances, and the 40,260 instances in this bin account for 21.27% of all instances in ODIN.",
        "Linguistic typology is the study of the classification of languages, where a typology is an organization of languages by an enumerated list of logically possible types, most often identified by one or more structural features.",
        "One of the most well known and well studied typological types, or parameters, is that of canonical word order, made famous by Joseph Greenberg (Greenberg, 1963).",

        "In these experiments, we tested not only the potential of IGT to provide knowledge that could be useful to NLP, but also for IGT to overcome biases inherent to the opportunistic nature of its collection: (1) What we call the IGT-bias, that is, the bias produced by the fact that IGT examples are used by authors to demonstrate a particular fact about a language, causing the collection of IGT for a language to suffer from a potential lack of representativeness.",
        "(2) What we call the English-bias, an English-centrism in the examples brought on by the fact that most IGT examples provide a translation in English, which can potentially affect subsequent enrichment of IGT data, such as through structural projection.",
        "In one experiment, we automatically found the answer to the canonical word order question for about 100 languages, and the accuracy was 99% for all the languages with at least 40 IGT instances.",

        "Additional search facilities allow users to search across potentially linguistically salient structures and return results in the form of language profiles.",
        "Although language profiles are by no means complete – they are subject to the availability of data to fill in the answers within the profiles – they provide a summary of automatically available knowledge about that language as found in IGT (or enriched IGT)."
