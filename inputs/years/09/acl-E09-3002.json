        "One of its striking features is the combinatory operations that allow coordination of incomplete constituents.",
        "CCG is nearly context-free yet powerful enough for natural languages as it, as well as TAG, LIG, and HG, exhibits the lowest generative power in the mildly context-sensitive grammar class (Vijay-Shanker and Weir, 1994).",

        "In case of gapping, a specialized rule called decomposition is used to handle with forward gapping (Steedman, 1990) by extracting the filler required by a gap from a complete constituent.",
        "However, serial verb construction is a challenging topic in CCG when we expand our attention to more analytic languages, such as Chinese and Thai, whose degree of pro-dropping is more free.",
        "In this paper, I explain how we can deal with serial verb construction with CCG by incorporating memory mechanism and how we can restrict the generative power of the resulted hybrid.",

        "Each of the verbs is marked or understood to have the same grammatical categories (such as tense, aspect, and modality), and shares at least one argument, i.e. a grammatical subject.",

        "Pro-drops occur at the object positions of the verbs V1, V2, and V3.",
        "On the other hand, we can also consider the SVC V1 to V3 and the SVC V4 to V5 as adjoining construction (Muan-suwan, 2002) which indicates resultative events in Thai (Thepkanjana, 1986) as exemplified in (18).",
        "(18) piti ti: rju: tok nam Piti hit snake fall water 'Piti hits a snake and it falls into the water.'",
        "In this case, the pro-drop occurs at the subject position of the SVC V4 to V5, and can therefore be treated as object control (Muansuwan, 2002).",

        "I then assume that the first analysis is correct and will follow it throughout this paper.",

        "As exemplified in (19), the decomposition rule fails to parse the Thai SVC whose object of the left conjunct is pro-dropped, since the right conjunct cannot be decomposed by (11).",
        "To tackle a broader coverage of intra-sentential ellipses, the grammar should rely on not only decomposition but also a supplement memory mechanism.",
        "Second, the decomposition rule allows arbitrary decomposition which leads to over-generation.",
        "From their definitions the variable Y can be arbitrarily substituted by any syntactic categories resulting in ungrammatical sentences generated.",
        "For example we can derive the ungrammatical sentence *Mary eats noodles and quickly by means of the decomposition rule in (20).",
        "The issues of handling ellipses in SVC and overgeneration of the decomposition rule can be resolved by replacing the decomposition rule with a memory mechanism that associates fillers to their gaps.",

        "As I have elaborated in the last section, CCG needs a memory mechanism (1) to resolve intra-sentential ellipses in serial verb construction ofan-alytic languages, and (2) to improve resource management for over-generation avoidance.",
        "To do so, such memory mechanism has to extend the generative power of the decomposition rule and improve the ease of resource management in parallel.",
        "The memory mechanism used in this paper is motivated by a wide range of previous work from computer science to symbolic logics.",
        "The notion of memory mechanism in natural language parsing can be traced back to HOLD registers in ATN (Woods, 1970) in which fillers (antecedents) are held in registers for being filled to gaps found in the rest of the input sentence.",
        "These registers are too powerful since they enable ATN to recognize the full class of context-sensitive grammars.",
        "In Type Logical Grammar (TLG) (Morrill, 1994; Jager, 1997; Jager, 2001; Oehrle, 2007), Gentzen's sequent calculus was incorporated with variable quantification to resolve pro-forms and VP ellipses to their antecedents.",
        "The variable quantification in TLG is comparable to the use of memory in storing antecedents and anaphora.",
        "In Categorial Type Logic (CTL) (Hendriks, 1995; Moortgat, 1997), gap induction was incorporated.",
        "Syntactic categories were modified with modalities which permit or prohibit gap induction in derivation.",
        "However, logical reasoning obtained from TLG and CTL are an NP-complete problem.",
        "In CCG, Jacobson (1999) attempted to explicitly denote non-local anaphoric requirement whereby she introduced the anaphoric slash (|) and the anaphoric connective (Z) to connect anaphors to their antecedents.",
        "However, this framework does not support anaphora whose argument is not its antecedent, such as possessive adjectives.",
        "Recently, a filler-gap memory mechanism was again introduced to Categorial Grammar, called Memory-Inductive Categorial Grammar (MICG) (Boonkwan and Supnithi, 2008).",
        "Fillers and gaps, encoded as memory modalities, are modified to syntactic categories, and they are associated by the gap-resolution connective when coordination and serialization take place.",
        "Though their framework is successful in resolving a wide variety of gapping, its generative power falls between LIG and Indexed Grammar, theoretically too powerful for natural languages.",
        "The memory mechanism introduced in this paper deals with fillers and gaps in SVC.",
        "It is similar to anaphoric resolution in ATN, Jacobson's model, TLG, and CTL.",
        "However, it also has prominent distinction from them: The anaphoric mechanisms mentioned earlier are dealing with unbounded dependency or even inter-sentential ellipses, while the memory mechanism in this paper is dealing only with intra-sentential bounded dependency in SVC as generalized in (13).",
        "Moreover, choices of filler-gap association can be pruned out by the use of combinatory directionality because the word order of analytic languages is fixed.",
        "It is noticeable that we can simply determine the grammatical function (subject or object) of arbitrary np's in (13) from the directionality (the subject on the left and the object on the right).",
        "With these reasons, I therefore adapted the notions of MICG's memory modalities and gap-resolution connective (Boonkwan and Supnithi, 2008) for the backbone of the memory mechanism.",
        "In CCG with Memory Mechanism (CCG-MM), syntactic categories are modalized with memory modalities.",
        "For each functional application, a syntactic category can be stored, or memorized, into the filler storage and the resulted category is modalized with the filler □.",
        "A syntactic category can also be induced as a gap in a unary derivation called induction and the resulted category is modalized with the gap O.",
        "There are two constraint parameters in each modality: the combinatory directionality d G {< , >} and the syntactic category c, resulting in the filler and the gap denoted in the forms □f and Of, respectively.",
        "For example, the syntactic category □<pO>ps has a filler of type np on the left side and a gap of type np on the right side.",
        "The filler □f and the gap Of of the same directionality and syntactic categories are said to be symmetric under the gap-resolution connective ©; that is, they are matched and canceled in the gap resolution process.",
        "Apart from MICG, I restrict the associative power of © to match only a filler and a gap, not between two gaps, so that the generative power can be preserved linear.",
        "This topic will be discussed in §5.",
        "Given two strings of modalities m1 and m2, the gap-resolution connective © is defined in (21).",
        "The notation e denotes an empty string.",
        "It means that a syntactic category modalized with an empty modality string is simply unmodalized; that is, any modalized syntactic categories eX are equivalent to the unmodalized ones X.",
        "Since the syntactic categories are modalized by a modality string, all combinatory operations in canonical CCG must preserve the modalities after each derivation step.",
        "However, there are two conditions to be satisfied:",
        "Condition A: At least one operands of functional application must be unmodalized.",
        "Condition B: Both operands of functional composition, disharmonic functional composition, and type raising must be unmodalized.",

        "This topic will be discussed in §5.",
        "As adopted from MICG, there are two memory operations: memorization and induction.",

        "Let m be a modality string, the induction operation is defined in (23).",
        "Because the use of memory mechanism elucidates fillers and gaps hidden in the derivation, we can then replace the decomposition rule of the canonical CCG with the gap resolution process of MICG.",

        "For any given m1; m2, if m1 © m2exists then always m1 © m2 = e. Given two modality strings m1 and m2 such that m1 © m2 exists, the coordination rule ($) and serialization rule (£) are redefined on © in (24).",
        "At present, the memory mechanism was developed in Prolog for the sake of unification mechanism.",

        "Finally, the left and the right conjuncts are coordinated yielding that X2 is unified with s and X1 with s\\np.",
        "For convenience of type-setting, let us suppose that we can always choose the right type in each induction step and suppress the unification process.",
