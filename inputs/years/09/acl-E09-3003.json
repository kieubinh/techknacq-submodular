        "The measurement of the reading difficulty of texts has been a major concern in the English-speaking literature since the 1920s and the first formula developed by Lively and Pressey (1923).",
        "The field of readability has since produced many formulae based on simple lexical and syntactic measures such as the average number of syllables per word, the average length of sentences in a piece of text (Flesch, 1948; Kincaid et al., 1975), or the percentage of words not on a list combined with the average sentence length (Chall and Dale, 1995).",
        "French-speaking researchers discovered the field of readability in 1956 through the work of Andre Conquet, La lisibilité (1971), and the first two formulae for French were adapted from Flesch (1948) by Kandel and Moles (1958) and de Landsheere (1963).",
        "Both of these researchers stayed quite close to the Flesch formula, and in so doing they failed to take into account some specificities of the French language.",
        "Henry (1975) was the first to introduce specific formulae for French.",
        "He used a larger set of variables to design three formulae : a complete, an automatic and a short one, each of which was adapted for three different educational levels.",
        "His formulae are by far the best and most frequently used in the French-speaking world.",
        "Later, Richaudeau (1979) suggested a criteria of \"linguistic efficiency\" based on experiments on short-term memory, while Mesnager (1989) coined what is still, to the best of our knowledge, the most recent specific formula for French, with children as its target.",
        "Compared to the mass of studies in English, readability in French has never enthused the research community.",
        "The cultural reasons for this are analysed by Bosse-Andrieu (1993) (who basically argues that the idea of measuring text difficulty objectively seems far too pragmatic for the French spirit).",
        "It follows that there is little current research in this field: in Belgium, the Flesch formula is still used to assess the readability of articles in journalism studies.",
        "This example also shows that the French-specific formulae are not much used, probably because of their complexity (Bosse-Andrieu, 1993).",
        "Of course, if there is little work on French readability, there is even less on French as a foreign language.",
        "We only know the study of Cornaire (1988), which tested the adaptation of Henry's short formula to French as a foreign language, and that of Uitdenbogerd (2005), which developed a new measure for English-speaking learners of French, stressing the importance of cognates when developing a new formula for a related language.",
        "Therefore, we had to draw our inspiration from the English-speaking world, which has recently experienced a revival of interest in research on readability.",

        "In the development of a new readability formula, the first step is to collect a corpus labelled by reading-difficulty level, a task that implies agreement on the difficulty scale.",
        "In the US, a common choice is the 12 American grade levels corresponding to primary and secondary school.",
        "However, this scale is less relevant for FFL education in Europe.",
        "So, we looked for another scale.",
        "Given that we are looking for an automatic way of measuring text complexity for FFL learners participating in an educational programme, an obvious choice was the difficulty scale used for assessing students' levels in Europe, that is the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) (Council of Europe, 2001) .",
        "The CEFR has six levels: A1 (Breakthrough); A2 (Waystage); B1 (Threshold); B2 (Vantage); C1 (Effective Operational Proficiency) and C2 (Mastery).",
        "However differences in learners' skills can be quite substantial at lower levels, so we divided each of the A1, A2 and B1 grades in two, thus obtaining a total of nine levels.",
        "We still needed to find a corpus labelled according to these nine classes.",
        "Unlike traditional approaches, based on a limited set of texts usually standardised by applying a closure test to a target population, our NLP-oriented approach required a large number of texts on which the statistical models could be trained.",
        "For that reason we opted for FFL textbooks as a corpus.",
        "With the appearance of the CEFR, FFL textbooks have undergone a kind of standardisation and their levels have been clarified.",
        "It is thus feasible to gather a large number of documents already labelled in terms of the CEFR scale by experts with an educational background.",
        "However, not every textbook can be used as a document source.",
        "Likewise, not all the material from FFL textbooks is appropriate.",
        "We established the following criteria for selecting textbooks and texts:",
        "textbooks published since then were considered.",
        "This restriction also ensures that the language resembles present-day spoken French.",
        "• The target population for our formula is young people and adults.",
        "Therefore, only textbooks intended for this public were used.",
        "• We retained only those texts made up ofcom-plete sentences, linked to a reading comprehension task.",
        "So, all the transcriptions of listening comprehension tasks were ignored.",
        "Similarly, all instructions to the students were excluded, because there is no guarantee the language employed there is the same as the rest of the textbook material (metalinguistic terms and so on can be found there).",
        "Up to now, using these criteria, we have gathered more than 1,500 documents containing about 440,000 tokens.",
        "Texts cover a wide variety of subjects ranging from French literature to newspaper articles, as well as numerous dialogues, extracts from plays, cooking recipes, etc.",
        "The goal is to have as wide a coverage as possible, to achieve maximum generalisability ofthe formula, and also to check what sort of texts it does not fit (e.g. statistical descriptive analyses have considered songs and poems as outliers)."

        "These independent variables must correlate as strongly as possible with the dependent variable representing difficulty in order to explain the text's complexity, and they should also account for the various dimensions of the readability phenomenon.",
        "Traditional approaches to readability have been sharply criticised with respect to this second requirement by Kintsch and Vipond (1979) and Kemper (1983), who both insist on the importance of including the conceptual properties of texts (such as the relations between propositions and the \"inference load\").",
        "However, these new approaches have not resulted in any easily reproducible computational models, leading current researchers to continue to use the classic semantic and grammatical variables, enhancing them with NLP techniques.",
        "Because this research only spans the last year, attempts to discover interesting variables are still at an early stage.",
        "We explored the efficiency of some traditional features such as the type-token ratio, the number of letters per word, and the average sentence length, and found that, on our corpus, only the word length and sentence length correlated significantly with difficulty.",
        "Then, we add two NLP-oriented features, as described below: a statistical language model and a measure of tense difficulty.",
        "The lexical difficulty of a text is quite an elaborate phenomenon to parameterise.",
        "The logistic regression models we used in this study require us to reduce this complex reality to just one number, the challenge being to achieve the most informative number.",
        "Some psychological work (Howes and Solomon, 1951; Gerhand and Barry, 1998; Brys-baert et al., 2000) suggests that there is a strong relationship between the frequency of words and the speed with which they are recognised.",
        "We therefore opted to model the lexical difficulty for reading as the global probability of a text T (with N tokens) occurring:",
        "This equation raises two issues :",
        "1.",
        "Estimating the conditional probabilities.",
        "It is well-known that it is impossible to train such a model on a corpus, even the largest one, because some sequences in this equation are unlikely to be encountered more than once.",
        "However, following Collins-Thompson and Callan (2005), we found that a simple smoothed unigram model could give good results for readability.",
        "Thus, we assumed that the global probability of a text T could be reduced to:",
        "where p(ti) is the probability of meeting the token ti in French; and n is the number of tokens in a text.",
        "2.",
        "Deciding what is the best linguistic unit to consider.",
        "The equations introduced above use tokens, as is traditional in readability formulae, but the inflected nature of French suggests that lemmas may be a better alternative.",
        "Using tokens means that words taking numerous inflected forms (such as verbs), have their overall probability split between these different forms.",
        "Consequently, compared to seldom - or never - inflected words (such as adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions), they seem less frequent than they really are.",
        "Second, using tokens presupposes a theoretical position according to which learners are not able to link an inflected form with its lemma.",
        "Such a view seems highly questionable for the majority of regular forms.",
        "In order to settle this issue, we trained three language models: one with lemmas (LM1), another with inflected forms disambiguated according to their tags (LM2), and a third one with inflected forms (LM3).",
        "The experiment was not very conclusive, since the models all correlated with the dependent variable to a similar extent, having Pearson's r coefficients of – 0.58, – 0.58, and – 0.59 respectively.",
        "However, three factors militate in favour of the lemma model: as well as theoretical likelihood, it is the model which is most sensitive to outliers and most prone to measurement error.",
        "This suggests that, if we can reduce this error, the lemma model may prove to be the best predictor of the three.",
        "As a consequence of these considerations, we decided to compute the difficulty of the text by using Equation 2 adapted for lemmas and, for computational reasons, the logarithm of the probabilities:",
        "The resulting value is still correlated with the length of the text, so it has to be normalised by dividing it by N (the number of words in the text).",
        "These operations give in a final value suitable for the logistic regression model.",
        "More information about the origin and smoothing ofthe probabilities is given in Section 6.",
        "Having considered the complexity of a text's syntactic structures through the traditional factor of the \"mean number of words per sentence\", we decided to also take into account the difficulty of the conjugation of the verbs in the text.",
        "For this purpose, we created 11 variables, each representing one tense or class of tenses: conditional, future, imperative, imperfect, infinitive, past participle, present participle, present, simple past, subjunctive present and subjunctive imperfect.",
        "The question then arose as to whether it would be better to treat these variables as binary or continuous.",
        "Theoretical justifications for a binary pa-rameterisation lie in the fact that a text becomes more complex for a L2 language learner when there is a large variety of tenses, especially difficult ones.",
        "The proportion of each tense seems less significant.",

        "From a statistical perspective, this variable may be considered as a nominal, ordinal, or interval variable, each level of measurement being linked to a particular regression technique: multiple linear regression for interval data; a popular cumulative logit model called proportional odds for ordinal data; and multinomial logistic regression for nominal variables.",

        "From a theoretical perspective, viewing the levels of difficulty as an interval scale would imply that they are ordered and evenly spaced.",
        "However, most FFL teachers would disagree with this assumption: it is well known that the higher levels take longer to complete than the earlier ones.",
        "So, a more realistic position is to consider text difficulty as an ordinal variable (since the CEFR levels are ordered).",
        "The third alternative, treating the levels as a nominal scale, is not intuitively obvious to a language teacher, because it suggests that there is no particular order to the CEFR levels.",

        "This assumption needs to be tested with the chi-squared form of the score test (Agresti, 2002).",
        "The lower the chi-squared value, the better the PO model fits the data.",

        "Further analysis showed that the tense contributed significantly to the adjacent accuracy of classifying the C1 and C2 texts.",
        "As stated above, it is not easy to compare our results with those of previous studies, since the scale, population of interest and often the language are different.",
        "Furthermore, up till now, we have not been able to run the classical formulae for French (such as de Landsheere (1963) or Henry (1975)) on our corpus.",
        "So we are limited to comparing our evaluation measures with those in the published literature.",
        "With multinomial logistic regression, we obtained a mean adjacent accuracy of 71% for 9 classes.",
        "This result seems quite good compared to similar research on L1 English by Heilman et al.",
        "(2008).",
        "Using more complex syntactic features, they obtained an adjacent accuracy of 52% with a PO model, and 45% with a MLR model.",
        "However, they worked with 12 levels, which may explain their lower percentage.",
        "For French, Collins-Thompson and Callan (2005) reported a Pearson's R coefficient of 0.64 for a 5-classes naive Bayes classifier while we obtained 0.77 for 9 levels with MLR.",
        "This difference might be explained by the tagging or the use of better-estimated probabilities for the language model.",
        "Further research on this point to determine the specificities of an efficient approach to French readability appears very promising.",

        "A new scale to assess FFL texts within the CECR framework, and a new criteria for the corpus involving the use of textbooks, have also been proposed.",
        "The two logistic models applied to a 440-text corpus gave results consistent with the literature.",
        "They also showed the superiority of the MLR model over the PO model.",
        "Since Heilman et al.",
        "(2008) found the opposite, and the intuitive view is that levels should be described by an ordinal scale of measurement, this issue clearly needs further investigation.",
        "This research is still in progress, and further analyses are planned.",
        "The predictive capacity of some other lexical and grammatical features will be explored.",
        "At the lexical level, statistical language models seems to be best, and tagging the texts to work with lemmas turned out to be efficient for French, although it has not been shown to be superior to disambiguated inflected forms.",
        "Moreover, due to their higher sensibility to context, smoothed n-grams might represent an alternative to lemmas.",
        "Once the best unit has been selected, some other issues remain: it is not clear whether a model using the probabilities of this unit in the whole language or probabilities per level (Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2005) would be more efficient.",
        "We also wonder whether the L1 frequencies of words are similar to those in L2 ?",
        "FFL textbooks use a controlled vocabulary, linked to specific situational tasks, which suggests that it is highly possible that the frequencies of words in FFL differ from those in mother-tongue French.",
        "Grammatical features have been taken into account through simple parameterisation.",
        "More complex measures (such as the presence of some syntactic structures (Heilman et al., 2007) or the characteristics of a syntactic-parsing tree) have been explored in the literature.",
        "We hope that including such factors may result in improved accuracy for our model.",
        "However, these techniques are probably dependent on the quality of the parser's results.",
        "Parsers for French are less accurate than those for English, which may generate some noise in the analysis.",
        "Finally, we intend to explore the performance of other classification techniques.",
        "Logistic regression was the most efficient of the statistical models we tested, but as our corpus grows, more and more data is becoming available, and data mining approaches may become applicable to the text-categorization problem for FFL readability.",
        "Support vector machines have already been shown to be useful for readability purposes (Schwarm and Ostendorf, 2005).",
        "We also want to try aggregating approaches such as boosting, bagging, and random forests (Breiman, 2001), since they claim to be effective when the sample is not perfectly representative of the population (which could be true for our data).",
        "These analyses would aim to illuminate some of the assets and flaws of each of the statistical models considered."
