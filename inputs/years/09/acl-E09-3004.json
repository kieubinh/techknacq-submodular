        "We show that the output of a distributional similarity system baseline can be filtered to obtain terms that are not simply similar but frequently substitutable.",
        "Our filter relies on the fact that when two terms are in a common entailment relation, it should be possible to substitute one for the other in their most frequent surface contexts.",
        "Using the Google 5-gram corpus to find such characteristic contexts, we show that for the given task, our filter improves the precision of a distributional similarity system from 41% to 56% on a test set comprising common transitive verbs."

      "text": [
        "Let us also assume a simple querying facility, where the user can enter a word and be presented with all statements containing that word, in a typical search engine fashion.",
        "If we want to return all acquisition events present in the knowledge base above (as opposed to nationalisation events), we might search for 'acquire'.",
        "This will return the first statement (about the acquisition of Merrill Lynch) but not the second statement about HBOS.",
        "Ideally, we would like a system able to generate words similar to our query, so that a statement containing the verb 'buy' gets returned when we search for 'acquire'.",
        "This problem is closely related to the clustering of semantically similar terms, which has received much attention in the literature.",
        "Systems that perform such clustering usually do so under the assumption of distributional similarity (Harris, 1954) which state that two words appearing in similar contexts will be close in meaning.",
        "This observation is statistically useful and has contributed to successful systems within two approaches: the pattern-based approach and the feature vector approach (we describe those two approaches in the next section).",
        "The definition of similarity used by those systems is fairly wide, however.",
        "Typically, a query on the verb 'produce' will return verbs such as 'export', 'import' or 'sell', for instance (see DIRT demo from",
        "http://demo.patrickpantel.com/Content/Lex Sem/paraphrase.htm, Lin and Pantel, 2001.)",
        "This fairly wide notion of similarity is not fully appropriate for our word substitutions task: although cats and dogs are similar types of entities, querying a knowledge base for 'cat' shouldn't return statements about dogs; statements about Siamese, however, should be acceptable.",
        "So, following Dagan and Glickman (2004), we refine our concept of similarity as that of entailment, defined here as the relation whereby the meaning of a word w1 is 'included' in the meaning of word w2 (practically speaking, we assume that the 'meaning' of a word is represented by the contexts in which it appears and require that if wi entails w2, the contexts of w2 should be a subset of the contexts of wi ).",
        "Given an input term w, we therefore attempt to extract words which either entail or are entailed by w. (We do not extract directionality at this stage.)",
        "The definition of entailment usually implies that an entailing word must be substitutable for the entailed one, in some contexts at least.",
        "Here, we consider word substitution queries in cases where no additional contextual information is given, so we cannot assume that possible, but rare, substitutions will fit the query intended by the user ('believe' correctly entails 'buy' in some cases but we can be reasonably sure that the query 'buy' is meant in the 'purchase' sense.)",
        "We thus require that our output will fit the most common contexts.",
        "For instance, given the query 'kill', we want to return 'murder' but not 'stop'.",
        "Given 'produce', we want to return both 'release' and 'generate' but not 'fabricate' or 'hatch'.",
        "Taking this into account, we generally define substitutability as the ability of a word to replace another one in a given sentence without changing the meaning or acceptability of the sentence, and this in the most frequent cases.",
        "(By acceptability, we mean whether the sentence is likely to be uttered by a native speaker of the language under consideration.)",
        "In order to achieve both entailment and general substitutability, we propose to filter the output of a conventional distributional similarity system using a check for lexical substitutability in frequent contexts.",
        "The idea of the filter relies on the observation that entailing words tend to share more frequent immediate contexts than just related ones.",
        "For instance, when looking at the top 200 most frequent Google 3-gram contexts (Brants and Franz, 2006) appearing after the terms 'kill', 'murder' and 'abduct', we find that 'kill' and 'murder' share 54 while 'kill' and 'abduct' only share 2, giving us the indication that as far as usage is concerned, 'murder' is closer to 'kill' than 'abduct'.",
        "Additionally, context frequency provides a way to identify substitutability for the most common uses of the word, as required.",
        "In what follows, we briefly present related work, and introduce our corpus and algorithm, including a discussion of our 'immediate context overlap' filter.",
        "We then review the results of an experiment on the extraction of entailment pairs for 30 input verbs."

      "text": [
        "Systems using distributional similarity usually fall under two approaches:",
        "1.",
        "The pattern-based approach (e.g. Ravichad-ran and Hovy, 2002).",
        "The most significant contexts for an input seed are extracted as features and those features used to discover words related to the input (under the assumption that words appearing in at least one significant context are similar to the seed word).",
        "There is also a non-distributional strand of this approach: it uses Hearst-like patterns (Hearst, 1992) which are supposed to indicate the presence of two terms in a certain relation - most often hyponymy or meronymy (see Chklovski and Pantel, 2004).",
        "2.",
        "The feature vector approach (e.g. Lin and Pantel, 2001).",
        "This method fully embraces the definition of distributional similarity by making the assumption that two words appearing in similar sets of features must be related.",
        "The problems of the distributional similarity assumption are well-known: the facts that 'a bank lends money' and 'Smith's brother lent him money' do not imply that banks and brothers are similar entities.",
        "This effect becomes particularly evident in cases where antonyms are returned by the system; in those cases, a very high distributional similarity actually corresponds to opposite meanings.",
        "Producing an output ranked according to distributional similarity scores (weeding out anything under a certain threshold) is therefore not sufficient to retain good precisions for many tasks.",
        "Some work has thus focused on a re-ranking strategies (see Geffet and Dagan, 2004 and Gef-fet and Dagan, 2005, who improve the output of a distributional similarity system for an entailment task using a web-based feature inclusion check, and comment that their filtering produces better outputs than cutting off the similarity pairs with the lowest ranking.)",
        "Prominent entailment rule acquisition systems include DIRT (Lin and Pantel, 2001), which uses distributional similarity on a 1 GB corpus to identify semantically similar words and expressions, and TEASE (Szpektor et al., 2004), which extracts entailment relations from the web for a given word by computing characteristic contexts for that word.",
        "Recently, systems that combine both pattern-based and feature vector approaches have also been presented.",
        "Lin et al.",
        "(2003) and Pantel and Ravichandran (2004) have proposed to classify the output of systems based on feature vectors using lexico-syntactic patterns, respectively in order to remove antonyms from a related words list and to name clusters of related terms.",
        "Even more related to our work, Mirkin et al.",
        "(2006) integrate both approaches by constructing features for the output of both a pattern-based and a vector-based systems, and by filtering incorrect entries with a supervised SVM classifier.",
        "(The pattern-based approach uses a set of manually-constructed patterns applied to a web search.)",
        "In the same vein, Geffet and Dagan (2005) filter the result of a pattern-based system using feature vectors.",
        "They get their features out of an 18 million word corpus augmented by a web search.",
        "Their idea is that for any pair of potentially similar words, the features of the entailed one should comprise all the features of the entailing one.",
        "The main difference between our work and the last two quoted papers is that we add a new layer of verification: we extract pairs of verbs using automatically derived semantic patterns, perform a first stage of filtering using the semantic signatures of each word and apply a final stage of filtering relying on surface substitutability, which we name 'immediate context overlap' method.",
        "We also experiment with a smaller size corpus to produce our distributional similarity baseline (a subset of Wikipedia) in an attempt to show that a good semantic parse and adequate filtering can provide reasonable performance even on domains where data is sparse.",
        "Our method does not need manually constructed patterns or supervised classifier training.",
        "The evaluation of KB or ontology extraction systems is typically done by presenting human judges with a subset of extracted data and asking them to annotate it according to certain correctness criteria.",
        "For entailment systems, the annotation usually relies on two tests: whether the meaning of one word entails the other one in some senses of those words, and whether the judges can come up with contexts in which the words are directly substitutable.",
        "Szpektor et al.",
        "(2007) point out the difficulties in applying those criteria.",
        "They note the low inter-annotator agreements obtained in previous studies and propose a new evaluation method based on precise judgement questions applied to a set of relevant contexts.",
        "Using their methods, they evaluate the DIRT (Lin and Pantel, 2001) and",
        "TEASE (Szpektor et al., 2004) algorithms and obtain upper bound precisions of 44% and 38% respectively on 646 entailment rules for 30 transitive verbs.",

        "The RMRS representation consists of trees (or tree fragments when a complete parse is not possible) which comprise, for each phrase in the sentence, a semantic head and its arguments.",

        "Note that any tree can be transformed into a feature for a particular lexical item by replacing the slot containing the word with a hole: lemma:rescue arg:ARG2 var:bank becomes lemma:hole_ arg:ARG2 var:bank, a potentially characteristic context for 'rescue'.",
        "All the experiments reported in this paper concern transitive verbs.",
        "In order to speed up processing, we reduced the RMRS corpus to a list of relations with a verbal head and at least two arguments: lemma:verb-query arg:ARG1 var:subject arg:ARG2 var:object.",
        "Note that we did not force noun phrases in the second argument of the relations and for instance, the verb 'say' was both considered as taking a noun or a clause as second argument ('to say a word', 'to say that the word is...')."

        "However, as pointed out in the introduction, there is still a gap between general similarity and entailment: 'coast' and 'hill' are indeed similar in some way but never substitutable.",

        "Our main result is that the immediate context overlap step dramatically increases our precision (from 41% to 56%), showing that a more stringent notion of similarity can be achieved when adequately filtering the output of a distributional similarity system.",
        "However, it also turns out that looking at the most frequent contexts of the word to substitute does not fully solve the issue of surface acceptability (leading to a high number of 'right-hand side not entailed' annotations).",
        "We argue, though, that the issue of producing an acceptable English sentence is a generation problem separate from the extraction task.",
        "Some systems, in fact, are dedicated to related problems, such as identifying whether the senses of two synonyms are the same in a particular lexical context (see Dagan et al., 2006).",
        "As far as our needs are concerned in the task of KB querying, we only require accurate searching capabilities as opposed to generational capabilities: the expansion of search terms to include impossible strings is not a problem in terms of result.",
        "Looking at the immediate context overlaps returned for each pair by the system, we find that the overlap (the similarity) can be situated at various linguistic layers:",
        "‚Ä¢ in the semantics of the verb's object: 'a new album' is something that one would frequently 'record' or 'release'.",
        "The phrase boosts the similarity score between 'record' and 'release' in their music sense.",
        "‚Ä¢ in the clausal information of the right context: a context starting with a clause introduced by 'that' is likely to be preceded by a verb expressing cognition or discourse.",
        "The tri-gram 'that there is' increases the similarity of pairs such as 'say - argue'.",
        "‚Ä¢ in the prepositional information of the right context: 'about' is the preposition of choice after cognition verbs such as 'think' or 'wonder'.",
        "The context 'about the future' helps the score of the pair 'think - speculate' in the cognitive sense (note that 'speculate' in a financial sense would take the preposition 'on'.)",
        "Some examples of overlaps are shown in Table 5.",
        "We also note that the system returns a fair proportion of vacuous contexts such as 'one of the' or 'part of the' which contribute to the score of many pairs.",
        "Our precision would probably benefit from excluding such contexts.",
        "We note that as expected, using a larger set of contexts leads to better recall and decreased precision.",
        "The best precision is obtained by returning the inclusion set of both left and right contexts results, but at a high cost in recall.",
        "Interestingly, we find that the right context of the verb is far more telling than the left one (potentially, objects are more important than subjects).",
        "This is in line with results reported by Alfonseca and Manandhar (2002).",
        "Our best results yield an average of 3.4 relations for each input term.",
        "It is in the range reported by the authors of the TEASE system (Szpektor et al., 2004) but well below the extrapolated figures of over 20 relations in Szpektor et al., 2007.",
        "We point out, however, that we only search for single word substitutions, as opposed to single and multi-word substitutions for Szpektor et al..",
        "Furthermore, our experiments are performed on 500 MB of text only, against 1 GB of news data for the DIRT system and the web for the TEASE algorithm.",
        "More data may help our recall, as well as bootstrapping over our best precision system.",

        "We have presented here a system for the extraction of word substitutions in the context of KB querying.",
        "We have shown that the output of a distributional similarity baseline can be improved by filtering it using the idea that two words in an entailment relation are substitutable in immediate surface contexts.",
        "We obtained a precision of 56% (52% using our most stringent evaluation) on a test set of 30 transitive verbs, and a yield of 3.4 relations per verb.",
        "We also point out that relatively good precisions can be obtained on a parsed medium-sized corpus of 500 MB, although recall is certainly affected.",
        "We note that our current implementation does not always satisfy the requirement for substitutability for generation tasks and point out that the system is therefore limited to our intended use, which involves search capabilities only.",
        "We would like to concentrate in the future on providing a direction for the entailment pairs extracted by the system.",
        "We also hope that recall could possibly improve using a larger set of features in the pattern-based step (this is suggested also by Szpektor et al., 2004), together with appropriate bootstrapping.",
