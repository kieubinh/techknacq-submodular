        "Many current, effective natural language processing systems are based on supervised Machine Learning techniques.",
        "The parameters of such systems are estimated to best reflect the characteristics of the training data, at the cost of portability: a system will be successful only as long as the training material resembles the input that the model gets.",
        "Therefore, whenever we have access to a large amount of labeled data from some \"source\" (out-of-domain), but we would like a model that performs well on some new \"target\" domain (Gildea, 2001; Daumé III, 2007), we face the problem of domain adaptation.",
        "The need for domain adaptation arises in many NLP tasks: Part-of-Speech tagging, Sentiment Analysis, Semantic Role Labeling or Statistical Parsing, to name but a few.",
        "For example, the performance of a statistical parsing system drops in an appalling way when a model trained on the Wall Street Journal is applied to the more varied Brown corpus (Gildea, 2001).",
        "The problem itself has started to get attention only recently (Roark and Bacchiani, 2003; Hara et al., 2005; Daumé III and Marcu, 2006; Daumé III, 2007; Blitzer et al., 2006; McClosky et al., 2006; Dredze et al., 2007).",
        "We distinguish two main approaches to domain adaptation that have been addressed in the literature (Daumé III, 2007): supervised and semi-supervised.",
        "In supervised domain adaptation (Gildea, 2001; Roark and Bacchiani, 2003; Hara et al., 2005; Daumé III, 2007), besides the labeled source data, we have access to a comparably small, but labeled amount of target data.",
        "In contrast, semi-supervised domain adaptation (Blitzer et al., 2006; McClosky et al., 2006; Dredze et al., 2007) is the scenario in which, in addition to the labeled source data, we only have unlabeled and no labeled target domain data.",
        "Semi-supervised adaptation is a much more realistic situation, while at the same time also considerably more difficult.",
        "Studies on the supervised task have shown that straightforward baselines (e.g. models based on source only, target only, or the union of the data) achieve a relatively high performance level and are \"surprisingly difficult to beat\" (Daumé III, 2007).",
        "Thus, one conclusion from that line of work is that as soon as there is a reasonable (often even small) amount of labeled target data, it is often more fruitful to either just use that, or to apply simple adaptation techniques (Daumé III, 2007; Plank and van Noord, 2008)."

        "While several authors have looked at the supervised adaptation case, there are less (and especially less successful) studies on semi-supervised domain adaptation (McClosky et al., 2006; Blitzer et al., 2006; Dredze et al., 2007).",
        "Of these, McClosky et al.",
        "(2006) deal specifically with self-training for data-driven statistical parsing.",
        "They show that together with a re-ranker, improvements are obtained.",
        "Similarly, Structural Correspondence Learning (Blitzer et al., 2006; Blitzer et al., 2007; Blitzer, 2008) has proven to be successful for the two tasks examined, PoS tagging and Sentiment Classification.",
        "In contrast, Dredze et al.",
        "(2007) report on \"frustrating\" results on the CoNLL 2007 semi-supervised adaptation task for dependency parsing, i.e. \"no team was able to improve target domain performance substantially over a state of the art baseline\".",
        "In the same shared task, an attempt was made to apply SCL to domain adaptation for data-driven dependency parsing (Shimizu and Nakagawa, 2007).",
        "The system just ended up at rank 7 out of 8 teams.",
        "However, based on annotation differences in the datasets (Dredze et al., 2007) and a bug in their system (Shimizu and Nakagawa, 2007), their results are inconclusive.",
        "Thus, the effectiveness of SCL is rather unexplored for parsing.",
        "So far, most previous work on domain adaptation for parsing has focused on data-driven systems (Gildea, 2001; Roark and Bacchiani, 2003; McClosky et al., 2006; Shimizu and Nakagawa, 2007), i.e. systems employing (constituent or dependency based) treebank grammars (Charniak, 1996).",
        "Parse selection constitutes an important part of many parsing systems (Johnson et al., 2005; McClosky et al., 2006).",
        "Yet, the adaptation of parse selection models to novel domains is a far less studied area.",
        "This may be motivated by the fact that potential gains for this task are inherently bounded by the underlying grammar.",
        "The few studies on adapting disambiguation models (Hara et al., 2005; Plank and van Noord, 2008) have focused exclusively on the supervised scenario.",
        "Therefore, the direction we explore in this study is semi-supervised domain adaptation for parse disambiguation.",
        "We examine the effectiveness of Structural Correspondence Learning (SCL) (Blitzer et al., 2006) for this task, a recently proposed adaptation technique shown to be effective for PoS tagging and Sentiment Analysis.",
        "The system used in this study is Alpino, a wide-coverage Stochastic Attribute Value Grammar (SAVG) for Dutch (van Noord and Malouf, 2005; van Noord, 2006).",
        "For our empirical evaluation we explore Wikipedia as primary test and training collection.",

        "SCL (Structural Correspondence Learning) (Blitzer et al., 2006; Blitzer et al., 2007; Blitzer, 2008) is a recently proposed domain adaptation technique which uses unlabeled data from both source and target domain to learn correspondences between features from different domains.",
        "Before describing the algorithm in detail, let us illustrate the intuition behind SCL with an example, borrowed from Blitzer et al.",
        "(2007).",
        "Suppose we have a Sentiment Analysis system trained on book reviews (domain A), and we would like to adapt it to kitchen appliances (domain B).",
        "Features such as \"boring\" and \"repetitive\" are common ways to express negative sentiment in A, while \"not working\" or \"defective\" are specific to B.",
        "If there are features across the domains, e.g. \"don't buy\", with which the domain specific features are highly correlated with, then we might tentatively align those features.",
        "Therefore, the key idea of SCL is to identify automatically correspondences among features from different domains by modeling their correlations with pivot features.",
        "Pivots are features occurring frequently and behaving similarly in both domains (Blitzer et al., 2006).",
        "They are inspired by auxiliary problems from Ando and Zhang (2005).",
        "Non-pivot features that correspond with many of the same pivot-features are assumed to correspond.",
        "Intuitively, if we are able to find good correspondences among features, then the augmented labeled source domain data should transfer better to a target domain (where no labeled data is available) (Blitzer et al., 2006).",
        "The outline of the algorithm is given in Figure 1.",
        "The first step is to identify m pivot features occurring frequently in the unlabeled data of both domains.",
        "Then, a binary classifier is trained for each pivot feature (pivot predictor) of the form: \"Does pivot feature l occur in this instance?\".",
        "The pivots are masked in the unlabeled data and the aim is to predict them using non-pivot features.",
        "In this way, we obtain a weight vector w for each pivot predictor.",
        "Positive entries in the weight vector indicate that a non-pivot is highly correlated with the respective pivot feature.",
        "Step 3 is to arrange the m weight vectors in a matrix W, where a column corresponds to a pivot predictor weight vector.",
        "Applying the projection WTx (where x is a training instance) would give us m new features, however, for \"both computational and statistical reasons\" (Blitzer et al., 2006; Ando and Zhang, 2005) a low-dimensional approximation of the original feature space is computed by applying Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on W (step 4).",
        "Let 9 = UTxn be the top h left singular vectors of W (with h a dimension parameter and n the number of non-pivot features).",
        "The resulting 9 is a projection onto a lower dimensional space Rh, parameterized by h.",
        "The final step of SCL is to train a linear predictor on the augmented labeled source data (x, 9x).",
        "In more detail, the original feature space x is augmented with h new features obtained by applying the projection 9x.",
        "In this way, we can learn weights for domain-specific features, which otherwise would not have been observed.",
        "If 9 contains meaningful correspondences, then the predictor trained on the augmented data should transfer well to the new domain.",
        "A property of the pivot predictors is that they can be trained from unlabeled data, as they represent properties of the input.",
        "So far, pivot features on the word level were used (Blitzer et al., 2006; Blitzer et al., 2007; Blitzer, 2008), e.g. \"Does the bigram not buy occur in this document?\"",
        "(Blitzer, 2008).",
        "Pivot features are the key ingredient for SCL, and they should align well with the NLP task.",
        "For PoS tagging and Sentiment Analysis, features on the word level are intuitively well-related to the problem at hand.",
        "For the task ofparse disambiguation based on a conditional model this is not the case.",
        "Hence, we actually introduce an additional and new layer of abstraction, which, we hypothesize, aligns well with the task of parse disambiguation: we first parse the unlabeled data.",
        "In this way we obtain full parses for given sentences as produced by the grammar, allowing access to more abstract representations of the underlying pivot predictor training data (for reasons of efficiency, we here use only the first generated parse as training data for the pivot predictors, rather than n-best).",
        "Thus, instead of using word-level features, our features correspond to properties of the generated parses: application of grammar rules (r1,r2 features), dependency relations (dep), PoS tags (f1,f2), syntactic features (s1), precedence (mf), bilexical preferences (z), apposition (appos) and further features for unknown words, temporal phrases, coordination (hjn.year and pi, respectively).",
        "This allows us to get a possibly noisy, but more abstract representation of the underlying data.",
        "The set of features used in Alpino is further described in van Noord and Malouf (2005).",
        "Selection of pivot features As pivot features should be common across domains, here we restrict our pivots to be ofthe type r1,p1,s1 (the most frequently occurring feature types).",
        "In more detail, r1 indicates which grammar rule applied, p1 whether coordination conjuncts are parallel, and s1 whether topicalization or long-distance dependencies occurred.",
        "We count how often each feature appears in the parsed source and target domain data, and select those r1,p1,s1 features as pivot features, whose count is > t, where t is a specified threshold.",
        "In all our experiments, we set t = 5000.",
        "In this way we obtained on average 360 pivot features, on the datasets described in Section 5.",
        "Predictive features As pointed out by Blitzer et al.",
        "(2006), each instance will actually contain features which are totally predictive of the pivot features (i.e. the pivot itself).",
        "In our case, we additionally have to pay attention to 'more specific' features, e.g. r2 is a feature that extends r1, in the sense that it incorporates more information than its parent (i.e. which grammar rules applied in the construction of daughter nodes).",
        "It is crucial to remove these predictive features when creating the training data for the pivot predictors.",
        "Matrix and SVD Following Blitzer et al.",
        "(2006) (which follow Ando and Zhang (2005)), we only use positive entries in the pivot predictors weight vectors to compute the SVD.",
        "Thus, when constructing the matrix W, we disregard all negative entries in W and compute the SVD (W = UDVT) on the resulting non-negative sparse matrix.",
        "This sparse representation saves both time and space.",
        "In practice, there are more free parameters and model choices (Ando and Zhang, 2005; Ando, 2006; Blitzer et al., 2006; Blitzer, 2008) besides the ones discussed above.",

        "The results show a (sometimes) small but consistent increase in absolute performance on all testsets over the baseline system (up to +0.26 absolute CA score), as well as an increase in 0 measure (absolute error reduction).",
        "This corresponds to a relative error reduction ofup to 7.29%.",
        "Thus, our first instantiation of SCL for parse disambiguation indeed shows promising results.",
        "We can confirm that changing the dimensionality parameter h has rather little effect (Table 4), which is in line with previous findings (Ando and Zhang, 2005; Blitzer et al., 2006).",
        "Thus we might fix the parameter and prefer smaller dimensionalities, which saves space and time.",
        "Note that these results were obtained without any of the additional normalization, rescaling, feature-specific regularization, or block SVD issues, etc.",
        "(discussed in section 4.2).",
        "We used the same Gaussian regularization term (<r=1000) for all features (original and new features), and did not perform any feature normalization or rescaling.",
        "This means our current instantiation of SCL is an actually simplified version of the original SCL algorithm, applied to parse disambiguation.",
        "Of course, our results are preliminary and, rather than warranting many definite conclusions, encourage further exploration of SCL and related semi-supervised adaptation techniques.",
        "In the following, we describe additional results obtained by extensions and/or refinements of our current SCL instantiation.",
        "Feature normalization.",
        "We also tested feature normalization (as described in Section 4.2).",
        "While Blitzer et al.",
        "(2006) found it necessary to normalize (and scale) the projection features, we did not observe any improvement by normalizing them (actually, it slightly degraded performance in our case).",
        "Thus, we found this step unnecessary, and currently did not look at this issue any further.",
        "A look at 9 To gain some insight of which kind of correspondences SCL learned in our case, we started to examine the rows of 9.",
        "Recall that applying a row of the projection matrix 9j to a training instance x gives us a new real-valued feature.",
        "If features from different domains have similar entries (scores) in the projection row, they are assumed to correspond (Blitzer, 2008).",
        "Figure 4 shows example of correspondences that SCL found in the Prince dataset.",
        "The first column represents the score of a feature.",
        "The labels wiki and alp indicate the domain of the features, respectively.",
        "For readability, we here grouped the features obtaining similar scores.",
        "SCL clustered information about 'Chaka Khan', an 'Afro-Amerikaanse' 'zangeres' (afro-american singer) whose real name is 'Yvette Marie Stevens'.",
        "She had close connections to Prince, who even wrote one of her singles.",
        "These features got aligned to the Alpino feature 'leraar' (teacher).",
        "Moreover, SCL finds that 'tournee', 'regisseur' and 'pop_rock' in the Prince domain behave like 'voorsprong' (advance), 'wetenschap' (research) and 'plan' as possible heads in a subject relation in the newspaper domain.",
