        "In a number of applications such as humancomputer interfaces, smart call centres, etc.",
        "it is important to be able to recognise people's emotional state.",
        "An aim of a speech emotion recognition (SER) engine is to produce an estimate of the emotional state of the speaker given a speech fragment as an input.",
        "The standard way to do SER is through a supervised machine learning procedure (Sidorova et al., 2008).",
        "It also should be noted that a number of alternative classification strategies has been offered recently, such as unsupervised learning (Liu et al., 2007) and numeric regression (Grimm et al., 2007) etc, and which are preferable under certain conditions.",
        "Our contribution is a new algorithm of a mixed design with syntactic and statistical learning, which we borrowed from optical character recognition (Sempere, Lopez, 2003), extended, and adapted for SER.",
        "The syntactic part implements tree grammar inference (Sakakibara, 1997), and the statistical part implements C4.5 (Quinlan, 1993).",
        "The intuitive reasons underlying this solution are as follows.",
        "We would like to have a classification approach that enjoys the representational power of a syntactic method and efficiency of statistical classification.",
        "First we model the objects by means of a syntactic method, i.e. we map samples into their representations.",
        "A representation of a sample is a set of seven numeric values, signifying to which degree a given sample resembles the averaged pattern of each of seven classes.",
        "Second, we learn to classify the mappings of samples, rather than feature vectors of samples, with a powerful statistical method.",
        "We called the classifier TGI+, which stands for Tree Grammar Inference and the plus is for the statistical learning enhancement.",
        "In this paper we present the second version of TGI+, which extends TGI+.1 (Sidorova et al., 2008) and the difference is that we have added various edit costs to penalise more important features with higher edit costs for being outside the interval, which tree automata learned at the inference stage.",
        "We evaluated TGI+ against a state of the art classifier.",
        "To obtain a state of the art performance, we constructed a speech emotion recogniser, following the classical supervised learning approach with a top performer out of more than 20 classifiers from the weka package, which turned out to be multilayer perceptron (MLP) (Witten, Frank, 2005).",
        "Experimental results showed that TGI+ outperforms MLP by 4.68%.",
        "The structure of this paper is as follows: in this section below we explain construction of a classical speech emotion recognizer, in Section 2 we explain TGI+; Section 3 reports testing results for both, the state of the art recogniser and TGI+.",
        "Section 4 and 5 is discussion and conclusions.",
        "A classical speech emotion recognizer is comprised of three modules: Feature Extraction, Feature Selection, and Classification.",
        "Their performance will serve as a baseline for TGI+ recognizer.",
        "In the literature there is a consensus that global statistics features lead to higher accuracies compared to the dynamic classification of multivariate time-series (Schuller et al., 2003).",
        "The feature extraction module extracts 116 global statistical features, both prosodic and segmental, a full list and explanations for which can be found in (Sidorova, 2007).",
        "The feature selection module implements a wrapper approach with forward selection (Witten, Frank, 2005) in order to automatically select the most relevant features extracted by the previous module.",
        "The classification module takes an input as a feature vector created by the feature selector, and applies the Multilayer Perceptron classifier (MLP) (Witten, Frank, 2005), in order to assign a class label to it.",
        "The labels are the emotional states to discriminate among.",
        "For our data, MLP turned out to be the top performer among more than 20 other different classifiers; details of this comparative testing can be found in (Sidorova, 2007)."

        "We put trees from one class into one set.",
        "In our dataset we have the following seven classes to recognise among: fear, disgust, happiness, boredom, neutral, sadness and anger.",

        "Step 2: Apply tree grammar inference to learn seven automata accepting a different type ofemo-tional utterance each.",
        "Grammar inference is a method to learn a grammar from examples.",
        "In our case, it is tree grammar inference, because we deal with trees representing utterances.",
        "The result of this step is seven automata, one for each of seven emotions to be recognised.",
        "Step 3: Calculate edit distances between obtained tree automata and trees in the training set.",
        "Edit distances are then calculated between each automaton obtained at step two and each tree representing utterances from the training set (T1UT2).",
        "The calculated edit distances are put into a matrix of size: (cardinality of the training set) x 7 (the number of classes).",
        "Step 4: Run C4.5 over the matrix to obtain a decision tree.",
        "The C4.5 algorithm is run over this matrix in order to obtain a decision tree, classifying each utterance into one of the seven emotions, according to edit distances between a given utterance and the seven tree automata.",

        "If a feature value is outside the interval the automaton has learnt for it, the acceptance cost of the sample processed is incremented by one.",
        "In TGI+.2 some edit costs have a coefficient greater than 1 (1.5 in the current version).",

        "Concluding the algorithm description, let us explain how TGI+ classiiers an input sample, which is fed to the automata in the form a 116 dimensional feature vector.",
        "Firstly TGI+ calculates distances from the sample to seven tree automata (the automata learnt 116 feature intervals at the inference step).",
