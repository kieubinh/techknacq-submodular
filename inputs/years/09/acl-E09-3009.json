        "The use of semantic information into text retrieval or text classification has been controversial.",
        "For example in Mavroeidis et al.",
        "(2005) it was shown that a GVSM using WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) senses and their hypernyms, improves text classification performance, especially for small training sets.",
        "In contrast, Sanderson (1994) reported that even 90% accurate WSD cannot guarantee retrieval improvement, though their experimental methodology was based only on randomly generated pseudowords of varying sizes.",
        "Similarly, Voorhees (1993) reported a drop in retrieval performance when the retrieval model was based on WSD information.",
        "On the contrary, the construction of a sense-based retrieval model by Stokoe et al.",
        "(2003) improved performance, while several years before, Krovetz and Croft (1992) had already pointed out that resolving word senses can improve searches requiring high levels of recall.",
        "In this work, we argue that the incorporation of semantic information into a GVSM retrieval model can improve performance by considering the semantic relatedness between the query and document terms.",
        "The proposed model extends the traditional VSM with term to term relatedness measured with the use ofWordNet.",
        "The success of the method lies in three important factors, which also constitute the points of our contribution: 1) a new measure for computing semantic relatedness between terms which takes into account relation weights, and senses' depth; 2) a new GVSM retrieval model, which incorporates the aforementioned semantic relatedness measure; 3) exploitation of all the semantic information a thesaurus can offer, including semantic relations crossing parts of speech (POS).",
        "Experimental evaluation in three TREC collections shows that the proposed model can improve in certain cases the performance of the standard TF-IDF VSM.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents preliminary concepts, regarding VSM and GVSM.",
        "Section 3 presents the term semantic relatedness measure and the proposed GVSM.",

        "The VSM has been a standard model of representing documents in information retrieval for almost three decades (Salton and McGill, 1983; Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999).",
        "Let D be a document collection and Q the set of queries representing users' information needs.",
        "Let also U symbolize term i used to index the documents in the collection, with i = 1, The VSM assumes that for each term ti there exists a vector q in the vector space that represents it.",
        "It then considers the set of all term vectors {ti} to be the generating set of the vector space, thus the space basis.",
        "If each dk,(for k = 1, denotes a document of the collection, then there exists a linear combination of the term vectors {^} which represents each dk in the vector space.",
        "Similarly, any query q can be modelled as a vector q that is a linear combination of the term vectors.",
        "In the standard VSM, the term vectors are considered pairwise orthogonal, meaning that they are linearly independent.",
        "But this assumption is unrealistic, since it enforces lack of relatedness between any pair of terms, whereas the terms in a language often relate to each other.",
        "Provided that the orthogonality assumption holds, the similarity between a document vector dk and a query vector qq in the VSM can be expressed by the cosine measure given in equation 1.",
        "cos(dk ,q) = .",
        "E n j=1 akj qj",
        "where akj, qj are real numbers standing for the weights of term j in the document dk and the query q respectively.",
        "A standard baseline retrieval strategy is to rank the documents according to their cosine similarity to the query.",
        "Wong et al.",
        "(1987) presented an analysis of the problems that the pairwise orthogonality assumption of the VSM creates.",
        "They were the first to address these problems by expanding the VSM.",
        "They introduced term to term correlations, which deprecated the pairwise orthogonality assumption, but they kept the assumption that the term vectors are linearly independent, creating the first GVSM model.",
        "More specifically, they considered a new space, where each term vector tqi was expressed as a linear combination of 2n vectors mr, r = 1..2n.",
        "The similarity measure between a document and a query then became as shown in equation 2, where U and tj are now term vectors in a 2n dimensional vector space, dk, q are the document and the query vectors, respectively, as before, aki, qj are the new weights, and n the new space dimensions.",
        "vEn=i a'kiYIj=\\ qj j",
        "From equation 2 it follows that the term vectors tqi and tqj need not be known, as long as the correlations between terms ti and tj are known.",
        "If one assumes pairwise orthogonality, the similarity measure is reduced to that of equation 1.",
        "Since the introduction of the first GVSM model, there are at least two basic directions for embedding term to term relatedness, other than exact keyword matching, into a retrieval model: (a) compute semantic correlations between terms, or (b) compute frequency co-occurrence statistics from large corpora.",
        "In this paper we focus on the first direction.",
        "In the past, the effect of WSD information in text retrieval was studied (Krovetz and Croft, 1992; Sanderson, 1994), with the results revealing that under circumstances, senses information may improve IR.",
        "More specifically, Krovetz and Croft (1992) performed a series of three experiments in two document collections, CACM and TIMES.",
        "The results of their experiments showed that word senses provide a clear distinction between relevant and nonrelevant documents, rejecting the null hypothesis that the meaning of a word is not related to judgments of relevance.",
        "Also, they reached the conclusion that words being worth of disambiguation are either the words with uniform distribution of senses, or the words that in the query have a different sense from the most popular one.",
        "Sanderson (1994) studied the influence of disambiguation in IR with the use of pseudowords and he concluded that sense ambiguity is problematic for IR only in the cases of retrieving from short queries.",
        "Furthermore, his findings regarding the WSD used were that such a WSD system would help IR if it could perform with very high accuracy, although his experiments were conducted in the Reuters collection, where standard queries with corresponding relevant documents (qrels) are not provided.",
        "Since then, several recent approaches have incorporated semantic information in VSM.",
        "Mavroeidis et al.",
        "(2005) created a GVSM kernel based on the use of noun senses, and their hypernyms from WordNet.",
        "They experimentally showed that this can improve text categorization.",
        "Stokoe et al.",
        "(Stokoe et al., 2003) reported an improvement in retrieval performance using a fully sense-based system.",
        "Our approach differs from the aforementioned ones in that it expands the VSM model using the semantic information of a word thesaurus to interpret the orthogonality of terms and to measure semantic relatedness, instead of directly replacing terms with senses, or adding senses to the model."

        "We can now obtain a contradiction to the above to prove the theorem.",
        "Because sy occurs before sf on the path from ss to sf and all edge weights are nonnegative and in (0, 1) we have 5(ss,sy) > £(ss,sf), and thus d[sy] = £(ss,sy) > 5(ss,sf) > d[sf].",
        "But both syand sf were in V – S when sf was chosen, so we have d[sf] > d[sy].",
        "Thus, d[sy] = £(ss,sy) = 5(ss,sf) = d[sf ].",
        "Consequently, d[sf ] = £(ss, sf) which contradicts our choice of sf.",
        "We conclude that at the time each vertex sf is inserted into S, d[sf ] = £(ss, sf).",
        "Next, to prove that the returned maximum product is the SCM(S, O) • SPE(S,O), let the path between ss and sf with the maximum edge weight product have k edges.",

        "The reader will have noticed that our model computes the SR between two terms ti,tj, based on the pair of senses si,sj of the two terms respectively, which maximizes the product SCM SPE.",
        "Alternatively, a WSD algorithm could have disambiguated the two terms, given the text fragments where the two terms occurred.",
        "Though interesting, this prospect is neither addressed, nor examined in this work.",
        "Still, it is in our next plans and part of our future work to embed in our model some of the interesting WSD approaches, like knowledge-based (Sinha and Mihalcea, 2007; Brody et al., 2006), corpus-based (Mihalcea and Csomai, 2005; McCarthy et al., 2004), or combinations with very high accuracy (Montoyo et al., 2005).",

        "We estimate their inner product by equation 3, where si and sj are the senses of terms ti and tj respectively, maximizing SCM SPE.",

        "There are many aspects though in the GVSM that we think require further investigation, like for example the fact that we have not conducted WSD so as to map each document and query term occurrence into its correct sense, or the fact that the weighting scheme of the edges used in SR generates from the distribution of each edge type in WordNet, while there might be other more sophisticated ways to compute edge weights.",
