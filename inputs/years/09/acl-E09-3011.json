        "Definition extraction can be relevant in different areas.",
        "It is most times used in the domain of question answering to answer 'What-is'-questions.",
        "The context in which we apply definition extraction is the automatic creation of glossaries within elearning.",
        "This is a new area and provides its own requirements to the task.",
        "Glossaries can play an important role within this domain since they support the learner in decoding the learning object he is confronted with and in understanding the central concepts which are being conveyed in the learning material.",
        "Different approaches for the detection of definitions can be distinguished.",
        "We use a sequential combination of a rule-based approach and machine learning to extract definitions.",
        "As a first step a grammar is used and thereafter, machine learning techniques are applied to filter the incorrectly extracted data.",
        "Our approach has different innovative aspects compared to other research in the area of definition extraction.",
        "The first aspect is that we address less common definition patterns also.",
        "Second, we compared a common classification algorithm with an algorithm designed specifically to deal with imbalanced datasets (experiment 1), which seems to be more appropriate for us because we have some data sets in which the proportion of \"yes\"-cases is extremely low.",
        "A third innovative aspect is that we examined the influence of the type of grammar used in the first step (sophisticated or basic) on the final machine learning results (experiment1) .",
        "The sophisticated grammar aims at getting the best balance between precision and recall whereas the basic grammar only focuses at getting a high recall.",
        "We investigated to which extent machine learning can improve the low precision obtained with the basic grammar while keeping the recall as high as possible and then compare the results to the performance of the sophisticated grammar in combination with machine learning.",
        "As a last point, we investigated the influence of definition structure on the classification results (experiment",
        "2) .",
        "We expect this information to be especially useful when a basic grammar is used in the first step, because the patterns matched with such a grammar can have very diverse structures.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 introduces some relevant work in definition extraction.",
        "Section 3 explains the data used in the experiments and the definition categories we distinguish.",
        "Section 4 discusses the way in which grammars have been applied to extract definitions and the results obtained with them.",
        "Section 5 then talks about the machine learning approach, covering issues such as the classifiers, the features and the experiments.",

        "Their approach relies entirely on manually crafted patterns.",
        "An important difference with our approach is that they start with the concept and then search for a definition of it, whereas in our approach we search for complete definitions.",
        "A lot of research on definition extraction has been pursued in the area of question-answering, where the answers to 'What is'-questions usually are definitions of concepts.",
        "In this area, they most times start with a known concept (extracted from the question) and then search the corpus for snippets or sentences explaining the meaning of this concept.",
        "The texts used are often well structured, which is not the case in our approach where any text can be used.",
        "Research in this area initially relied almost totally on pattern identification and extraction (cf. (Tjong Kim Sang et al., 2005)) and only later, machine learning techniques have been employed (cf. (Blair-Goldensohn et al., 2004; Fahmi and Bouma, 2006; Miliaraki and Androutsopoulos, 2004)).",

        "Thereafter, machine learning methods are applied on the set of candidate definitions to distinguish definitions from non-definitions; to this end a combination of attributes has been exploited which refer to text properties, document properties, and syntactic properties of the sentences.",
        "They show that the application of standard machine learning methods for classification tasks (Naive Bayes, SVM and RBF) considerably improves the accuracy of definition extraction based only on syntactic patterns.",
        "However, they only applied their approach on the most common definition type, that are the definitions with a copular verb.",
        "In our approach we also distinguish other, less common definition types.",
        "Because the patterns of the other types are more often also observed in non-definitions, the precision with a rule-based approach will be lower.",
        "As a consequence, the dataset for machine learning will be less balanced.",
        "In our approach we applied - besides a standard classification algorithm (Naive Bayes) - also a classification algorithm designed specifically to deal with imbalanced datasets.",
        "In the domain of automatic glossary creation, Kobylinski and Przepiorkowski (2008) describe an approach in which a machine learning algorithm specifically developed to deal with unbalanced datasets is used to extract definitions from Polish texts.",
        "They compared the results obtained with this approach to results obtained on the same data in which hand crafted grammars were used (Przepiorkowski et al., 2007) and to results with standard classifiers (Degorski et al., 2008).",
        "The best results were obtained with their new approach.",
        "The differences with our approach are that (1) they use either only machine learning or only a grammar and not a combination of the two and (2) they do not distinguish different definition types.",
        "The advantage of using a combination of a grammar and machine learning, is that the dataset on which machine learning needs to be applied is much smaller and less imbalanced.",
        "A second advantage of applying a grammar first, is that the grammar can be used to add information to the candidate definitions which can be used in the machine learning features.",
        "Besides, applying the grammar first, gives us the opportunity to separate the four definition types."

        "The accuracy is in all cases higher when the NB classifier is used, due to the fact that this classifier scores better on the majority part with non-definitions.",
        "The inevitable counter effect of using the BRF method is that the scores on this part are lower, because the two classes now get the same weight.",
        "The answer to the question which grammar should be used in the first step can be viewed from different perspectives, by looking either at the goal or the definition type.",
        "When aiming at getting the highest possible recall, the BRF method in combination with the basic grammar gives the best overall results.",
        "However, when using these settings, the precision is quite low.",
        "When the goal is to obtain the best balance between recall and precision, this might therefore not be the best choice.",
        "In this case, the best option would be to use a combination of the sophisticated grammar and the BRF method, in which the recall is slightly lower than when the basic grammar is used, but the precision is much higher.",
        "We can also view the question which grammar should be used from a different perspective, namely by looking at the definition type.",
        "To get the best result for each of the separate types, we would need to use different approaches for the different types.",
        "When the BRF method is used, for two types the recall is considerably higher when the basic grammar is used, whereas for the other two types the recall scores are comparable for the two grammars.",
        "However, again this goes with a lower precision score, and therefore this may not be the favourable solution in a practical application.",

        "Especially the bad precision for these types gives reasons to have a closer look at these patterns to discover the reason for these low scores.",
        "The bad results might be caused by the amount of training data, which might be too low.",
        "Another reason might be that the patterns are more diverse than the patterns of the other types, and therefore more difficult to detect.",

        "The added value of a sophisticated grammar is also confirmed by the fact that the results Kobylinski and Przepiorkowski (2008) obtained without using a grammar are lower then our results with the sophisticated grammar.",
        "A second lesson learned is that it is useful to distinguish different definition types.",
        "As the results vary depending on which type has to be extracted, adapting the approach to the type to be extracted will result in a better overall performance.",
        "Third, the degree to which the dataset is imbalanced influences the choice for a classifier, where the BRF performs better on less balanced datasets.",
        "As there are many other NLP problems in which there is an interesting minority class, the BRF method might be applied to those problems also.",
        "From the second experiment, we can conclude that taking definition structure into account helps to get better classification results.",
        "This information has not been implemented in other approaches yet and other work on definition extraction can thus profit from this new insight.",
        "The results obtained so far clearly indicate that a combination of a rule-based approach and machine learning is a good way to extract definitions from texts.",
        "However, there is still room for improvement, and we will work on this in the next months.",
        "In near future, we will investigate whether our results improve when more linguistic information is added in the features.",
        "Especially for the basic grammar, we expect it to be possible to get a better recall when more information is added.",
        "We can make use of the grammar rules implemented in the sophisticated grammar to see there which information might be relevant.",
        "To improve the precision scores obtained with the sophisticated grammar, we will also look at linguistic information that might be relevant.",
        "However, improving this score using linguistic information will be more difficult, because the grammar already filtered out a lot of incorrect patterns.",
        "To improve results obtained with this grammar, we will therefore look at different features, such as features based on document structure, keywordi-ness of definiendum and similarity measures."
