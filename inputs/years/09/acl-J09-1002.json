        "Research in the field of machine translation (MT) aims to develop computer systems which are able to translate text or speech without human intervention.",
        "However, present translation technology has not been able to deliver fully automated high-quality translations.",
        "Typical solutions to improving the quality of the translations supplied by an MT system require manual post-editing.",
        "This serial process prevents the MT system from taking advantage of the knowledge of the human translator, and the human translator cannot take advantage of the adaptive ability of the MT system.",
        "An alternative way to take advantage of the existing MT technologies is to use them in collaboration with human translators within a computer-assisted translation (CAT) or interactive framework (Isabelle and Church 1997).",
        "Historically, CAT and MT have been considered different but close technologies (Kay 1997) and more so for one of the most popular CAT technologies, namely, translation memories (Bowker 2002; Somers 2003).",
        "Interactivity in CAT has been explored for a long time.",
        "Systems have been designed to interact with human translators in order to solve different types of (lexical, syntactic, or semantic) ambiguities (Slocum 1985; Whitelock et al.",
        "1986).",
        "Other interaction strategies have been considered for updating user dictionaries or for searching through dictionaries (Slocum 1985; Whitelock et al.",
        "1986).",
        "Specific proposals can be found in Tomita (1985), Zajac (1988), Yamron et al.",
        "(1993), and Sen, Zhaoxiong, and Heyan (1997), among others.",
        "An important contribution to CAT technology, carried out within the TransType project, is worth mentioning (Foster, Isabelle, and Plamondon 1997; Langlais, Foster, and Lapalme 2000; Foster 2002; Langlais, Lapalme, and Loranger 2002).",
        "It entailed an interesting focus shift in which interaction is directly aimed at the production of the target text, rather than at the disambiguation of the source text, as in earlier interactive systems.",
        "The idea proposed in that work was to embed data-driven MT techniques within the interactive translation environment.",
        "The hope was to combine the best of both paradigms: CAT, in which the human translator ensures high-quality output, and MT, in which the machine ensures a significant gain in productivity.",
        "Following these TransType ideas, the innovative embedding proposed here consists in using a complete MT system to produce full target sentence hypotheses, or portions thereof, which can be accepted or amended by a human translator.",
        "Each correct text segment is then used by the MT system as additional information to achieve further, hopefully improved, suggestions.",
        "More specifically, in each iteration, a prefix of the target sentence is somehow fixed by the human translator and, in the next iteration, the system predicts a best (or n-best) translation suffix(es) to complete this prefix.",
        "We will refer to this process as interactive-predictive machine translation (IPMT).",
        "This approach introduces two important requirements: First, the models have to provide adequate completions and, second, this has to happen efficiently.",
        "Taking these requirements into account, stochastic finite-state transducers (SFSTs), alignment templates (ATs), and phrase-based models (PBMs) are compared in this work.",
        "In previous works these models have proven adequate for conventional MT (Vidal 1997; Amengual et al.",
        "2000; Ney et al.",

        "1 The terms prefix and suffix are used here to denote any substring at the beginning and end (respectively) of a string of characters (including spaces and punctuation), with no implication of morphological significance as is usually implied by these terms in linguistics.",
        "Statistical Computer-Assisted Translation",
        "existing efficient searching algorithms can be adapted in order to provide completions (rather than full translations) also in a very efficient way.",
        "The work presented here has been carried out in the TransTypel (TT2) project (SchlumbergerSema S.A. et al.",
        "2001), which is considered as a follow-up to the interactive MT concepts introduced in the precursory TransType project cited previously.",
        "We should emphasize the novel contributions of the present work with respect to TransType.",
        "First, we show how fully fledged statistical MT (SMT) systems can be extended to handle IPMT.",
        "In particular, the TT2 systems always produce complete sentence hypotheses on which the human translator can work.",
        "This is an important difference to previous work, in which the use of basic MT techniques only allowed the prediction of single tokens (c.f., Section 2.2).",
        "Second, using fully fledged SMT systems, we have performed systematic offline experiments to simulate the specific conditions of interactive translation and we report and study the results of these experiments.",
        "Thirdly, the IPMT systems presented in this article were successfully used in several field trials with professional translators (Macklovitch, Nguyen, and Silva 2005; Macklovitch 2006).",
        "We should finally mention that the work developed in TT2 has gone beyond conventional keyboard-and-mouse interaction, leading to the development of advanced multi-modal interfaces.",
        "Speech is the most natural form of human communication and its use as feedback in the IPMT framework has been explored by Vidal et al.",
        "(2006).",
        "On the other hand, human translators can be faster dictating the translation text rather than typing it, thus it has also been investigated how to improve system performance and usability when the user dictates the translation first and then edits the recognized text (Khadivi, Zolnay, and Ney 2005; Khadivi, Zens, and Ney 2006).",
        "The rest of the article is structured as follows.",
        "The next section introduces the general setting for SMT and IPMT.",
        "In Section 3, AT, PBM, and SFST are briefly surveyed along with the corresponding learning procedures.",
        "In Section 4, general search procedures for the previous models are outlined and a detailed description of the extension of these procedures to IPMT scenarios is presented.",
        "Section 5 is devoted to introducing the tasks used for the assessment of the proposal presented in the previous sections: the pairs of languages, corpora, and assessment procedures.",
        "The results are reported in Section 6.",
        "A discussion of these results and the conclusions which can be drawn from this work are presented in the final section."

        "The probability Pr(t) represents the well-formedness of t and it is generally called the language model probability (n-gram models are usually adopted [Jelinek 1998]).",
        "On the other hand, Pr(s| t) represents the relationship between the two sentences (the source and its translation).",
        "It should be of a high value if the source is a good translation of the target and of a low value otherwise.",
        "Note that the translation direction is inverted from what would be normally expected; correspondingly the models built around this equation are often called inverted translation models (Brown et al.",
        "1990,1993).",
        "As we will see in Section 3, these models are based on the notion of alignment.",
        "It is interesting to note that if we had perfect models, the use of Equation (1) would suffice.",
        "Given that we have only approximations, the use of Equation (2) allows the language model to correct deficiencies in the translation model.",
        "In practice all of these models (and possibly others) are often combined into a log-linear model for Pr(t | s) (Och and Ney 2004):",
        "where f;(t,s) can be a model for Pr(s|t), a model for Pr(t|s), a target language model for Pr(t), or any model that represents an important feature for the translation.",
        "N is the number of models (or features) and A; are the weights of the log-linear combination.",

        "These transducers have an implicit target language model (which can be obtained from the finite-state transducer by dropping the source symbols of each transition (Vidal et al.",
        "2005)).",

        "If the input is a spoken sentence, instead of a written one, the problem becomes more complex; we will not deal with this here.",
        "The interested reader may consult instance.",
        "Unfortunately, current models and therefore the systems which can be built from them are still far from perfect.",
        "This implies that, in order to achieve good, or even acceptable, translations, manual post-editing is needed.",

        "This produces a new prefix, composed by the prefix from the previous iteration and the accepted and typed text, (a)(k), to be used as tp in the next step.",
        "The process ends when the user enters the special keystroke \"#\".",

        "As previously mentioned, this idea was originally proposed in the TransType project (Foster, Isabelle, and Plamondon 1997; Langlais, Foster, and Lapalme 2000; Langlais, Lapalme, and Loranger 2002).",
        "In that project, the parts proposed by the systems were produced using a linear combination of a target language model (trigrams) and a lexicon model (so-called IBM-1 or -2) (Langlais, Lapalme, and Loranger 2002).",
        "As a result, TransType allowed only single-token completions, where a token could be either a word or a short sequence of words from a predefined set of sequences.",
        "This proposal was extended to complete full target sentences in the TT2 project, as discussed hereafter.",
        "The approach taken in TT2 is exemplified in Figure 1.",
        "Initially, the system provides a possible translation.",
        "From this translation, the user marks a prefix as correct and provides, as a hint, the beginning of the rest of the translation.",
        "Depending on the system or the user preferences, the hint can be the next word or some letters from it (in the figure, hints are assumed to be words and are referred to as k).",
        "Let us use tp for the prefix validated by the user together with the hint.",
        "The system now has to produce (predict) asuffix ts to complete the translation.",

        "(1993) introduced to deal with Pr(s|t)in Equation (2) are based on the concept of alignment between the components of a pair (s, t) (thus they are called statistical alignment models).",

Mapping of source and target words to bilingual word classes is automatically trained using the method described by Och (1999).",

        "As discussed by Pico and Casacuberta (2001), the computation of Equation (4) for SFSTs under a maximum approximation (i.e., using maximization in Equation (17) instead of the sum) amounts to a conventional Viterbi search.",

        "First, given the source sentence, a word graph is extracted from the SFST.",

        "On the one hand, the nodes are deined as partial hypotheses of the search procedure in the AT approach, whereas the nodes in the case of SFSTs can be directly mapped into states in the SFST representing a joint (source word/target string) language model.",
        "On the other hand, the scores associated with the edges in the AT approach are computed from a combination of the language and translation models, whereas in the case of SFSTs these scores simply come from the joint language model estimated by the GIATI technique.",
        "Once the word graph has been generated, the search for the most probable completion as stated in Equation (6) is carried out in two steps, in a similar way to that explained for the AT approach.",
        "In this case, the computation entailed by both the edit-distance (preix error-correcting) and the remaining search is signiicantly accelerated by visiting the nodes in topological order and by the incorporation of the beam-search technique (Amengual and Vidal 1998).",
        "Moreover, the error-correcting algorithm takes advantage of the incremental way in which the user preix is generated, parsing only the new sufix appended by the user in the last interaction.",
        "It may be the case that a user preix ends in an incomplete word during the interactive translation process.",
        "Therefore, it is necessary to start the translation completion with a word whose preix matches this uninished word.",
        "The proposed algorithm thus searches for such a word.",
        "First, it considers the target words of the edges leaving the nodes returned by the error-correcting algorithm.",
        "If this initial search fails, then a matching word is looked up in the word-graph vocabulary.",
        "Finally, as a last resort, the whole transducer vocabulary is taken into consideration to ind a matching word; otherwise this incomplete word is treated as an entire word.",
        "This error-correcting algorithm returns a set of nodes from which the best completion would be selected according to the best backward score.",

        "IPMT results reported in the previous section provide reasonable estimatiows of potential savings of human translator effort, assuming that the goal is to obtain high quality translations.",
        "In real work, however, several practical issues not discussed in this article may significantly affect the actual system usability and overall user productivity.",
        "One of the most obvious issues is that a carefully designed graphical user interface (GUI) is needed to let the users actually be in command of the translation process, so that they really feel the system is assisting them rather than the other way around.",
        "In addition, an adequate GUI has to provide adequate means for the users to easily and intuitively change at will IPMT engine parameters that may have an impact on their way of working with the system.",
        "To name just a few: The maximum length of system hypotheses, the value of w for w-best suggestions, or the \"interaction step granularity\"; that is, whether the system should react at each user keystroke, or at the end of each complete typed word, or after a sufficiently long typing pause, and so on.",
        "Clearly, all these important issues are beyond the scope of the present article.",
        "But we can comment that, in the TT2 project, complete prototypes of some of the systems presented in this article, including the necessary GUI, were actually implemented and thoroughly evaluated by professional human translators in their working environment (Macklovitch, Nguyen, and Silva 2005; Macklovitch 2006).",
        "The results of these field tests showed that the actual productivity depended not only on the individual translators, but also on the given test texts.",
        "In cases where these texts were quite unrelated to the training data, the system did not significantly help the human translators to increase their productivity.",
        "However, when the test texts were reasonably well related to the training data, high productivity gains were registered – close to what could be expected according to the KSR/MAR empirical results."

      "text": [
        "The IPMT paradigm proposed in this article allows for a close collaboration between a human translator and a machine translation system.",
        "This paradigm entails an iterative process where, in each iteration, a data-driven machine translation engine suggests a completion for the current prefix of a target sentence which a human translator can accept, modify, or ignore.",
        "This idea was originally proposed in the TransType project (Langlais, Foster, and Lapalme 2000), where a simple engine was used which only supported single-token suggestions.",
        "Furthering these ideas, in the TransType2 project (SchlumbergerSema S.A. et al.",
        "2001), state-of-the-art statistical machine translation systems have been developed and integrated in the IPMT framework.",
        "In a laboratory environment, results on two different tasks suggest that the proposed techniques can reduce the typing effort needed to produce a high-quality translation of a given source text by as much as 80% with respect to the effort needed to simply type the whole translation.",
        "In real conditions, a high productivity gain was achieved in many cases.",
        "We have studied here IPMT from the point of view of a standalone CAT tool.",
        "Nevertheless, IPMT can of course be easily and conveniently combined with other popular translator workbench tools.",
        "More specifically, IPMT lends itself particularly",
        "Statistical Computer-Assisted Translation",
        "well to addressing the typical lack of generalization capabilities of translation memories.",
        "When used as a CAT tool, translation memories allow the human translator to keep producing increasingly long segments of correct target text.",
        "Clearly, these segments can be used by an IPMT engine to suggest to the translator possible translations for source text segments that are not found in the translation memories as exact matches."
