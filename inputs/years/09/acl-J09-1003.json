        "Information ordering (Barzilay and Lee 2004), that is, deciding in which sequence to present a set of preselected information-bearing items, has received much attention in recent work in automatic text generation.",
        "This is because text generation systems need to organize the content in a way that makes the output text coherent, that is, easy to read and understand.",
        "The easiest way to exemplify coherence is by arbitrarily reordering the sentences of a comprehensible text.",
        "This process very often gives rise to documents that do not make sense although the information content is the same before and after the reordering (Hovy 1988; Marcu 1997; Reiter and Dale 2000).",
        "Entity coherence, which is based on the way the referents of noun phrases (NPs) relate subsequent clauses in the text, is an important aspect of textual organization.",
        "Since the early 1980s, when it was first introduced, centering theory has been an influential framework for modelling entity coherence.",
        "Seminal papers on centering such as Brennan, Friedman [Walker], and Pollard (1987, page 160) and Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1995, page 215) suggest that centering may provide solutions for information ordering.",
        "Indeed, following the pioneering work of McKeown (1985), recent work on text generation exploits constraints on entity coherence to organize information (Mellish et al.",

        "Although these approaches often make use of heuristics related to centering, the features of entity coherence they employ are usually defined informally.",
        "Additionally, centering-related features are combined with other coherence-inducing factors in ways that are based mainly on intuition, leaving many equally plausible options unexplored.",
        "Thus, the answers to the following questions remain unclear: (i) How appropriate is centering for information ordering in text generation?",
        "(ii) Which aspects of centering are most useful for this purpose?",
        "These are the issues we investigate in this paper, which presents the first systematic evaluation of centering for information ordering.",
        "To do this, we define centering-based metrics of coherence which are compatible with several extant information ordering approaches.",
        "An important insight of our work is that centering can give rise to many such metrics of coherence.",
        "Hence, a general methodology for identifying which of these metrics represent the most promising candidates for information ordering is required.",
        "We adopt a corpus-based approach to compare the metrics empirically and demonstrate the portability and generality of our evaluation methods by experimenting with several corpora.",
        "Our main result is that the simplest metric (which relies exclusively on NOCB transitions) sets a baseline that cannot be outperformed by other metrics that make use of additional centering-related features.",
        "Thus, we provide substantial insight into the role of centering as an information ordering constraint and offer researchers working on text generation a simple, yet robust, baseline to use against their own information ordering approaches during system development.",
        "The article is structured as follows: In Section 2 we discuss our information ordering approach in relation to other work on text generation.",
        "After a brief introduction to centering in Section 3, Section 4 demonstrates how we derived centering data structures from existing corpora.",
        "Section 5 discusses how centering can be used to define various metrics of coherence suitable for information ordering.",

        "Additionally, the metrics are further specified by combining these features with other coherence-inducing factors such as rhetorical relations (Mann and Thompson 1987).",
        "However, as acknowledged in most of this work, these are preliminary computational investigations of the complex interactions between different types of coherence which leave many other equally plausible combinations unexplored.",
        "Clearly, one would like to know what centering can achieve on its own before devising more complicated metrics.",
        "To address this question, we define metrics which are purely centering-based, placing any attempt to specify a more elaborate model of coherence beyond the scope of this article.",
        "This strategy is similar to most work on centering for text interpretation in which additional constraints on coherence are not taken into account (the papers in Walker, Joshi, and Prince [1998] are characteristic examples).",
        "This simplification makes it possible to assess for the first time how useful the employed centering features are for information ordering.",
        "Work on text generation which is solely based on rhetorical relations (Hovy 1988; Marcu 1997, among others) typically masks entity coherence under the ELABORATION relation.",
        "However, ELABORATION has been characterized as \"the weakest of all rhetorical relations\" (Scott and de Souza 1990, page 60).",
        "Knott et al.",
        "(2001) identified several theoretical problems all related to ELABORATION and suggested that this relation be replaced by a theory of entity coherence for text generation.",
        "Our work builds on this suggestion by investigating how appropriate centering is as a theory of entity coherence for information ordering.",
        "McKeown (1985, pages 60-75) also deployed features of entity coherence to organize information for text generation.",
        "McKeown's \"constraints on immediate focus\" (which are based on the model of entity coherence that was introduced by Sidner [1979] and precedes centering) are embedded within the schema-driven approach to generation which is rather domain-specific (Reiter and Dale 2000).",

        "Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1995, page 215) also take Rule 2 to suggest that text generation systems should attempt to avoid unfavorable transitions such as SHIFTs.",
        "The second claim, which is implied by the definition of the CB (Poesio et al.",
        "2004), is that CF(Un) should contain at least one member of CF(Un_1).",

        "This measure does not take into account that the OSOs differ in length.",
        "However, this information is necessary to estimate reliably the performance of an information ordering approach, as we discuss in Karamanis and Mellish (2005a) in more detail.",
        "Barzilay and Lapata (2005) overcome this difficulty by introducing a performance measure called ranking accuracy which expresses the percentage of alternative orderings that are ranked lower than the OSO.",

        "On the other hand, Barzilay and Lee (2004) enumerate exhaustively each possible ordering, which might become impractical as the search space grows factorially.",
        "We overcame these problems by using a large random sample for the texts which consist of more than 10 sentences as suggested in Karamanis (2003, Chapter 5).",
        "Equally important is the emphasis we placed on the use of statistical tests, which were not deployed by either Barzilay and Lee or Barzilay and Lapata.",
        "Lapata (2003) presented a methodology for automatically evaluating generated orderings on the basis of their distance from observed sentence orderings in a corpus.",
        "A measure of rank correlation (called Kendall's t), which was subsequently shown to correlate reliably with human ratings and reading times (Lapata 2006), was used to estimate the distance between orderings.",
        "16 Neither Barzilay and Lapata (2005) nor Barzilay and Lee (2004) appear to consider the possibility that two orderings may be equally ranked.",
        "Whereas t estimates how close the predictions of a metric are to several original orderings, we measure how likely a metric is to lead to an ordering different than the OSO.",
        "Taking into account more than one OSO for information ordering is the main strength of Lapata's method, but to do this one needs to ask several humans to order the same set of sentences (Madnani et al.",
        "2007).",
        "Karamanis and Mellish (2005b) conducted an experiment in the MPIRO domain using Lapata's methodology which supplements the work reported in this article.",
        "However, such an approach is less practical for much larger collections of texts such as NEWS and ACCS.",
        "This is presumably the reason why Barzilay and Lapata (2005) use ranking accuracy instead of t in their evaluation.",
        "Our work investigates how the coherence score of the OSO compares to the scores of alternative orderings of the sentences that the OSO consists of.",
        "As Kibble (2001, page 582) noticed, this question is crucial from an information ordering viewpoint, but was not taken into account by any previous corpus-based study of centering.",
        "Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1995, page 215) also suggested that Rule 2 should be tested by examining \"alternative multi-utterance sequences that differentially realize the same content.\"",
        "We are the first to have pursued this research objective in the evaluation of centering for information ordering.",
        "Poesio et al.",
        "(2004) observed that there remained a large number of NOCBs under every instantiation of centering they tested and concluded that centering is inadequate as a coherence model.",
        "However, the frequency of NOCBs does not necessarily provide adequate indication of how appropriate NOCBs (and centering in general) are for information ordering.",
        "Although over 50% of the transitions in GNOME-LAB are NOCBs, the average classification error rate of approximately 20% for M.NOCB suggests that the OSO tends to be in greater agreement with the preference to avoid NOCBs than 80% of the alternative orderings.",
        "Thus, it appears that the observed ordering in the corpus does optimize with respect to the number of potential NOCBs to a great extent.",
        "How likely is M.NOCB to come up with the attested ordering in the corpus (the OSO) if it is actually used to guide an algorithm that orders the CF lists in our corpora?",
        "The average classification error rates (Table 7) estimate exactly this variable.",
        "The performance of M.NOCB varies across the corpora from about 15.5% (ACCS) to 30.9% (NEWS).",
        "We attribute this variation to the aforesaid differences between the corpora.",
        "Notice, however, that these differences affect all metrics in a similar way, not allowing for another metric to significantly outperform M.NOCB.",
        "Noticeably, even in ACCS, for which M.NOCB achieves its best performance, approximately one out of six alternative orderings on average are taken to be more coherent than the OSO.",
        "Given the average number of sentences per text in this corpus",
        "17 We viewed the definition of the centering instantiation as being related to the application domain, as we explained in Section 4.",
        "This is why, unlike Poesio et al., we did not experiment with different instantiations of centering on the same data.",
        "(11.5), this means that several millions of alternative orderings are often taken to be more coherent than the gold standard.",
        "Barzilay and Lapata (2005) report an average ranking accuracy of 87.3% for their best sentence ordering method in ACCS.",
        "This corresponds to an average classification error rate of 12.7% (assuming that there are no equally scoring orderings in their evaluation; see Section 8.1).",
        "This is equal to an improvement of just 2.8% over the performance of our baseline metric (15.5%) using a coherence model which is substantially more elaborate than centering.",
        "However, it is in NEWS (for which M.NOCB returns its worst performance of 30.9%) that this model shows its real strength, approximating an average classification error rate of 9.6%, which corresponds to an improvement of 21.3% over our baseline.",
        "We believe that the experiments reported in this article put the studies of our colleagues in better perspective by providing a reliable baseline to compare their metrics against.",
        "Following McKeown (1985), Kibble and Power argue in favor of an integrated approach for concept-to-text generation in which the same centering features are used at different stages in the generation pipeline.",
        "However, our study suggests that features such as CHEAPNESS and the centering transitions are not particularly relevant to information ordering.",
        "The poor performance of these features can be explained by the fact that they were originally introduced to account for pronoun resolution rather than information ordering.",
        "CONTINUITY, on the other hand, captures a fundamental intuition about entity coherence which constitutes part of several other discourse theories.",

        "In conclusion, our analysis sheds more light on two previously unaddressed questions in the corpus-based evaluation of centering: (i) which aspects of centering are most relevant to information ordering and (ii) to what extent centering on its own can be useful for this purpose.",
        "We have shown that the metric which relies exclusively on NOCB transitions (M.NOCB) sets a baseline that cannot be outperformed by other coherence metrics which make use of additional centering features.",
        "Although this metric does not perform well enough to be used on its own, it constitutes a simple, yet robust, baseline against which more elaborate information ordering approaches can be tested during system development in both text-to-text and concept-to-text generation.",
        "This work can be extended in numerous ways.",
        "For instance, given the abundance of possible centering-based metrics one may investigate whether a different metric can",
        "18 We thank one anonymous reviewer for suggesting this explanation of our results.",
        "outperform M.NOCB in any corpus or application domain.",
        "M.NOCB can also serve as the starting point for the definition of more informed metrics which will incorporate additional coherence-inducing factors.",
        "Finally, given that we used the instantiation of centering which seemed to correspond more closely to the targeted application domains, the extent to which computing the CF list in a different way may affect the performance of the metrics is another question to explore in future work."
