        "The idea behind this project was simple: in order to create artificial intelligence, what was needed first of all was a very large artificial brain; if a big enough set of interconnected modules of neurons could be implemented, then it would be possible to evolve mammalian-level behavior with current computational-neuron technology.",
        "The talk included progress reports on the current size of the artificial brain, its structure, \"update rate,\" and power consumption, and explained how intelligent behavior was going to develop by mechanisms simulating biological evolution.",
        "What the talk didn't mention was what kind of functionality the team had so far managed to evolve, and so the first comment at the end of the talk was inevitably \"nice work, but have you actually done anything with the brain yet?\"",
        "In human language technology (HLT) research, we currently report a range of evaluation scores that measure and assess various aspects of systems, in particular the similarity of their outputs to samples of human language or to human-produced goldstandard annotations, but are we leaving ourselves open to the same question as the billion-neuron artificial brain researchers?"

        "One thing that is striking from today's perspective is the rich diversity of evaluation paradigms – user-oriented and developer-oriented, intrinsic and extrinsic – that were being investigated and discussed on an equal footing * NLTG, University of Brighton, Lewes Road, Brighton BN2 4GJ, UK.",

        "The user-oriented vs. developer-oriented distinction concerns evaluation purpose.",
        "Another common distinction is about evaluation methods: intrinsic evaluations assess properties of systems in their own right, for example, comparing their outputs to reference outputs in a corpus, whereas extrinsic evaluations assess the effect of a system on something that is external to it, for example, the effect on human performance at a given task or the value added to an application (Sparck Jones 1994).",
        "in the context of academic research.",
        "At the same time Sparck Jones described a lack of consolidation and collective progress, noting: \"there is so little control in individual tests and so much variation in method between tests that interpretations of the results of any one test or of their relationships with those of others must be uncertain\" (page 245).",
        "These days, HLT research has many more subfields, most of which devote substantial research effort to evaluation.",

        "What is noticeable by its absence is any form of extrinsic evaluation.",

        "WSD may still be the most notorious \"task in need of an application\" (McCarthy and Navigli 2007), but the case of WSD points to a more general issue: in intrinsic evaluations, the output representation formalism (e.g., tag set, syntactic formalism) is fixed in the form of gold-standard reference annotations, and alternative representations are not subject to evaluation.",
