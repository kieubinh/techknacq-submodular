        "Prepositions – as well as prepositional phrases (PPs) and markers of various sorts – have a mixed history in computational linguistics (CL), as well as related fields such as artificial intelligence, information retrieval (IR), and computational psycholinguistics: On the one hand they have been championed as being vital to precise language understanding (e.g., in information extraction), and on the other they have been ignored on the grounds of being syntactically promiscuous and semantically vacuous, and relegated to the ignominious rank of \"stop word\" (e.g., in text classification and IR).",
        "Although NLP in general has benefitted from advances in those areas where prepositions have received attention, there are still many issues to be addressed.",
        "For example, in machine translation, generating a preposition (or \"case marker\" in languages such as Japanese) incorrectly in the target language can lead to critical semantic divergences over the source language string.",
        "Equivalently in information retrieval and information extraction, it would seem desirable to be able to predict that book on NLP and book about NLP mean largely the same thing, but paranoid about drugs and paranoid on drugs suggest very different things.",
        "Prepositions are often among the most frequent words in a language.",
        "For example, based on the British National Corpus (BNC; Burnard 2000), four out of the top-ten most-frequent words in English are prepositions (of, to, in,and for).",
        "In terms of both parsing and generation, therefore, accurate models of preposition usage are essential to avoid repeatedly making errors.",
        "Despite their frequency, however, they are notoriously difficult to master, even for humans (Chodorow, Tetreault, and Han 2007).",
        "For example, Lindstromberg (2001) estimates that less than 10% of upper-level English as a Second",
        "1 Our discussion will focus primarily on prepositions in English, but many of the comments we make apply equally to adpositions (prepositions and postpositions) and case markers in various languages.",
        "For definitions and general discussion of prepositions in English and other languages, we refer the reader to Lindstromberg (1998), Huddleston and Pullum (2002), and Cheliz (2002), inter alia.",
        "Submission received: 9 December 2008; revised submission received: 17 January 2009; accepted for publication: 17 January 2009.",
        "Language (ESL) students can use and understand prepositions correctly, and Izumi et al.",
        "(2003) reported error rates of English preposition usage by Japanese speakers of up to 10%.",
        "The purpose of this special issue is to showcase recent research on prepositions across the spectrum of computational linguistics, focusing on computational syntax and semantics.",
        "More importantly, however, we hope to reignite interest in the systematic treatment of prepositions in applications.",
        "To this end, this article is intended to present a cross-section view of research on prepositions and their use in NLP applications.",
        "We begin by outlining the syntax of prepositions and its relevance to NLP applications, focusing on PP attachment and prepositions in multiword expressions (Section 2).",
        "Next, we discuss formal and lexical semantic aspects of prepositions, and again their relevance to NLP applications (Section 3), and describe instances of applied research where prepositions have featured prominently (Section 4).",
        "Finally, we outline the contributions of the papers included in this special issue (Section 5) and conclude with a discussion of research areas relevant to prepositions which we believe are ripe for further exploration (Section 6).",
        "There has been a tendency for prepositions to be largely ignored in the area of syntactic research as \"an annoying little surface peculiarity\" (Jackendoff 1973, page 345).",
        "In computational terms, the two most important syntactic considerations with prepositions are: (1) selection (Fillmore 1968; Bennett 1975; Tseng 2000; Kracht 2003), and (2) valence (Huddleston and Pullum 2002).",
        "Selection is the property of a preposition being subcategorized/specified by the governor (usually a verb) as part of its argument structure.",
        "An example of a selected preposition is with in dispense with introductions, where introductions is the object of the verb dispense, but must be realized in a prepositional phrase headed by with (c.f.",
        "*dispense introductions).",
        "Conventionally, selected prepositions are specified uniquely (e.g., dispense with) or as well-defined clusters (e.g., chuckle over/at), and have bleached semantics.",
        "Selected prepositions contrast with unselected prepositions, which do not form part of the argument structure of a governor and do have semantic import (e.g., live in Japan).",
        "Unsurprisingly, there is not a strict dichotomy between selected and unselected prepositions (Tseng 2000).",
        "For example, in the case of rely on Kim, on is specified in the argument structure of rely but preserves its directional semantics; similarly, in put it down, put requires a locative adjunct (c.f.",
        "*put it) but is entirely agnostic as to its identity, and the preposition is semantically transparent.",
        "Preposition selection is important in any NLP application that operates at the syntax-semantics interface, that is, that overtly translates surface strings onto semantic representations, or vice versa (e.g., information extraction or machine translation using some form of interlingua).",
        "It forms a core component of subcategorization learning (Manning 1993; Briscoe and Carroll 1997; Korhonen 2002), and poses considerable challenges when developing language resources with syntactico-semantic mark-up (Kipper, Snyder, and Palmer 2004).",
        "Prepositions can occur with either intransitive or transitive valence.",
        "Intransitive prepositions (often referred to as \"particles\") are valence-saturated, and as such do not take arguments.",
        "They occur most commonly as: (a) components of larger multiword expressions (e.g., verb particle constructions, such as pick it up), (b) copular predicates (e.g., the doctor is in), or (c) prenominal modifiers (e.g., an off day).",
        "Transitive prepositions,",
        "A Survey of Prepositions in Applications",
        "on the other hand, select for (usually noun phrase) complements to form PPs (e.g., at home).",
        "The bare term \"preposition\" traditionally refers to a transitive preposition, but in this article is used as a catch-all for prepositions of all valences.",
        "Preposition valence has received relatively little direct exposure in the NLP literature but has been a latent feature of all work on part of speech (POS) tagging and parsing over the Penn Treebank (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993), as the Penn POStagset distinguishes between transitive prepositions (IN), selected intransitive prepositions (RP), and unselected intransitive prepositions (RB, along with a range of other adverbials).",
        "There have been only isolated cases of research where a dedicated approach has been used to distinguish between these three sub-usages, in the interests of optimizing overall POStagging or parsing performance (Shaked 1993; Toutanova and Manning 2000; Klein and Manning 2003; MacKinlay and Baldwin 2005).",
        "Two large areas of research on the syntactic aspects of prepositions are (a) PP-attachment and (b) prepositions in multiword expressions, which are discussed in the following sections.",
        "Although this article will focus largely on the syntax of prepositions in English, prepositions in other languages naturally have their own challenges.",
        "Notable examples which have been the target of research in computational linguistics are adpositions in Estonian (Muischnek, Miiiirisep, and Puolakainen 2005), adpositions in Finnish (Lestrade 2006), short and long prepositions in Polish (Tseng 2004), and the French a and de (Abeille et al.",

      "text": [
        "PP attachment is the task of finding the governor for a given PP.",
        "For example, in the following sentence:",
        "(1) Kim eats pizza with chopsticks there is syntactic ambiguity, with the PP with chopsticks being governed by either the noun pizza (i.e., as part of the NP pizza with chopsticks, as indicated in Example (2)), or the verb eats (i.e., as a modifier of the verb, as indicated in Example (3)).",
        "chopsticks",
        "2 It also includes the enigmatic TO tag, which is exclusively used for occurrences of to, over all infinitive, transitive preposition, and intransitive preposition usages.",
        "chopsticks pizza with N",
        "Of these, the latter case of verb attachment (i.e., Example (3)) is, of course, the correct analysis.",
        "Naturally the number of PP contexts with attachment ambiguity is theoretically unbounded.",
        "One special case of note is a sequence of PPs such as Kim eats pizza with chopsticks on Wednesdays at Papa Gino's, where the number of discrete analyses for a sequence of n PPs is defined by the corresponding Catalan number Cn (Church and Patil 1982).",
        "The bulk of PP attachment research, however, has focused exclusively on the case of a single PP occurring immediately after an NP, which in turn is immediately preceded by a verb.",
        "As such, we will focus our discussion predominantly on this syntactic context.",
        "To simplify discussion, we will refer to the verb as v, the head noun of the immediately proceeding NP as n1, the preposition as p, and the head noun of the NP object of the preposition as n2.",
        "Returning to our earlier example, the corresponding 4-tuple is (eatv, pizzan1, withp, chopsticksn2).",
        "The high degree of interest in PP attachment stems from it being a common phenomenon when parsing languages such as English, and hence a major cause of parser errors (Lin 2003).",
        "As such, it has implications for any task requiring full syntactic analysis or a notion of constituency, such as prosodic phrasing (van Herwijnen et al.",
        "2003).",
        "Languages other than English with PP attachment ambiguity which have been the target of research include Dutch (van Herwijnen et al.",
        "2003), French (Gaussier and Cancedda 2001; Gala and Lafourcade 2005), German (Hartrumpf 1999; Volk 2001, 2003; Foth and Menzel 2006), Spanish (Calvo, Gelbukh, and Kilgarriff 2005), and Swedish (Kokkinakis 2000; Aasa 2004; Volk 2006).",
        "PP attachment research has undergone a number of significant paradigm shifts over the course of the last three decades, and been the target of interest of theoretical syntax, AI, psycholinguistics, statistical NLP, and statistical parsing.",
        "Early research on PP attachment focused on the development of heuristics intended to model human processing strategies, based on analysis of the competing parse trees independent of lexical or discourse context (Frazier 1979; Schütze 1995).",
        "For example, Minimal Attachment was the strategy of choosing the attachment site which \"minimizes\" the parse tree, as calculated by its node membership; assuming the parse trees provided for Example (1), this would be unable to disambiguate between Examples (2) and (3) as they both contain the same number of nodes.",
        "Late Attachment, on the other hand, was the strategy of attaching \"low\" in the parse tree, corresponding to Example (2).",
        "Ford, Bresnan, and Kaplan (1982) proposed an alternative heuristic strategy, based on the existence of p in a subcategorization frame for v. In later research, Pereira (1985) described a method for incorporating Right Association and Minimal Attachment",
        "A Survey of Prepositions in Applications",
        "into a shift-reduce parser, and Whittemore and Ferrara (1990) developed a rule-based algorithm to combine various attachment preferences on the basis of empirical evaluation of the predictive power of each.",
        "Syntactic preferences were of course a blunt instrument in dealing with PP attachment, and largely ineffectual in predicting the difference in PP attachment between Kim eats pizza with chopsticks (verb attachment) and Kim eats pizza with anchovies (noun attachment), for example.",
        "This led to a shift away from syntactic methods in the 1980s towards AI-inspired techniques which used world knowledge to resolve PP attachment ambiguity.",
        "In the case of Example (1), for example, the knowledge that chopsticks are an eating implement would suggest a preference for verb attachment, and similarly the knowledge that they are not a foodstuff would suggest a dispreference for noun attachment.",
        "Wilks, Huang, and Fass (1985) attempted to capture this type of world knowledge using hand-coded \"preferential semantics\" of each of v, n1, p,andn2.Dahlgrenand McDowell (1986) simplified this analysis to use only p and n2, still in the form of hand-coded rules.",
        "Hirst (1987) used his model of \"commonsense semantics\" to resolve PP attachment ambiguity, based on verb-guided preferences (i.e., valence properties of the verb) and plausibility relative to a knowledge base.",
        "In this same vein, Jensen and Binot (1987) used the dictionary definitions of v and n2 as a \"knowledge base\" to resolve PP attachment based on approximate reasoning, for example, by determining that chopsticks is an instrument which is compatible with eat.",
        "In parallel, in the area of psycholinguistics, Altmann and Steedman (1988) provided experimental evidence to suggest that PP attachment resolution interacts dynamically with discourse context, and that ambiguity is resolved on the basis of the interdependence between structure and the mental representation of that context.",
        "This suggested that computational research on PP attachment resolution needed to take into account the discourse context, in addition to syntax and world knowledge.",
        "Spivey-Knowlton and Sedivy (1995) later used psycholinguistic experiments to demonstrate that verb-specific attachment properties and NP definiteness both play important roles in the human processing of PP attachment.",
        "Importantly, this work motivated the need for verb classes to resolve PP attachment ambiguity.",
        "The next significant shift in NLP research on PP attachment was brought about by Hindle and Rooth (1993), who were the harbingers of statistical NLP and large-scale empirical evaluation.",
        "Hindle and Rooth challenged the prevailing view at the time that lexical semantics and/or discourse modeling were needed to resolve PP attachment, in proposing a distributional approach, based simply on estimation of the probability of p attaching high or low given v and n1 (ignoring n2).",
        "The method uses unambiguous cases of PP attachment (e.g., cases of n1 being a pronoun [high attachment], or the PP post-modifying n1 in subject position [low attachment]) to derive smoothed estimates of P^high(p|v), Pfhigh(NULL\\n) (i.e., the probability of n not being post-modified by a PP), and Pr\\ow(p\\n), which then form the basis of Prhigh(p|v,n) and Pr\\ow(p\\v,n), respectively.",
        "The proposed method was significant in demonstrating the effectiveness of simple co-occurrence probabilities, without explicit semantics or discourse processing, and also in its ability to operate without explicitly annotated training data.",
        "Resnik and Hearst (1993) observed that PP attachment preferences are also conditioned on the semantics of the noun object of the preposition in the PP, as can be seen in our earlier example of Kim eats pizza with chopsticks/anchovies where chopsticks leads to verb attachment and anchovies to noun attachment.",
        "Although they were unable to come up with a model which was empirically superior to existing methods which did not represent the semantics of the noun object, this paved the way for a new wave of research using the full 4-tuple of (v, n1, p, n2).",
        "The first to successfully apply the full 4-tuple were Ratnaparkhi, Reynar, and Roukos (1994), who in the process established a benchmark PP attachment data set upon which most of the subsequent research has been based.",
        "The data set, colloquially known as the \"RRR\" data set, was automatically extracted from the Wall Street Journal section of the Penn Treebank, and is made up of 20,801 training and 3,097 test 4-tuples were able to come up with a \"class\" representation for words, based on distributional similarity, that outperformed a simple word-based model.",
        "The general framework established by Ratnaparkhi, Reynar, and Roukos (1994), and the RRR data set, defined the task of PP attachment for over a decade.",
        "It has been tackled using a variety of smoothing methods and machine learning algorithms, including backed-off estimation (Collins and Brooks 1995), instance-based learning (Zavrel, Daelemans, and Veenstra 1997; Zhao and Lin 2004), log-linear models (Franz 1996), maximum entropy learning (Ratnaparkhi, Reynar, and Roukos 1994), decision trees (Merlo, Crocker, and Berthouzoz 1997), neural networks (Sopena, Lloberas, and Moliner 1998; Alegre, Sopena, and Lloberas 1999), and boosting (Abney, Schapire, and Singer 1999).",
        "In addition to the four lexical and class-based features provided by the 4-tuple class (Stetina and Nagao 1997; Yeh and Vilain 1998; Pantel and Lin 2000; Volk 2002).",
        "The empirical benchmark for the data set was achieved by Stetina and Nagao (1997), who used WordNet (Fellbaum 1998) to explicitly model verb and noun semantics.",
        "In a novel approach to the task, Schwartz, Aikawa, and Quirk (2003) observed that Japanese translations of English verb and noun attachment involve distinct constructions.",
        "This allowed them to automatically identify instances of PP attachment ambiguity in a parallel English-Japanese corpus, complete with attachment information.",
        "They used this data to disambiguate PP attachment in English inputs, and demonstrated that, the quality of English-Japanese machine translation improved significantly as a result.",
        "More recently, Atterer and Schütze (2007) challenged the real-world utility of methods based on the RRR data set, on the grounds that it is based on the availability of a gold-standard parse tree for a given input.",
        "They proposed that, instead, PP attachment be evaluated as a means of post-processing over the raw output of an actual parser, and produced results to indicate: (a) that a state-of-the-art parser (Bikel 2004) does remarkably well at PP attachment without a dedicated PP attachment module; but also (b) that post-processing based on a range of methods developed over the RRR data set (Collins and Brooks 1995; Toutanova, Manning, and Ng 2004; Olteanu and Moldovan 2005) generally improves parser accuracy.",
        "In addition, they developed a variant of the RRR data set (RRR-sent) which contains full sentential contexts of possible PP attachment ambiguity.",
        "Others who have successfully built PP reattachment models for specific parsers are Olteanu (2004) and Foth and Menzel (2006).",
        "Agirre, Baldwin, and Martinez (2008) used the evaluation methodology of Atterer and Schütze (2007) to confirm the finding from the original RRR data set that lexical semantics (in various guises) can enhance PP attachment accuracy relative to a baseline parser.",
        "As part of this effort, they developed a standardized data set for exploration of the interaction between lexical semantics and parsing/PP attachment accuracy.",
        "3 Because it was automatically extracted, the RRR data set is notoriously noisy.",
        "For instance, Pantel and Lin (2000) observed that 133 tuples contain the as either n or n2.",
        "A Survey of Prepositions in Applications",
        "One significant variation on the classic binary PP attachment task which attempts to generate a richer semantic characterisation of the PP is the work of Merlo (2003) and Merlo and Esteve Ferrer (2006), who included classification of the PP as an argument or adjunct, making for a four-way classification task.",
        "In this context, they found that PP attachment resolution for argument PPs is considerably easier than is the case for adjunct PPs.",
        "Returning to our observation that PP attachment can occur in multiple syntactic configurations, Merlo, Crocker, and Berthouzoz (1997) applied backed-off estimation to the problem of multiple PP attachment, in the form of 14 discrete syntactic configurations.",
        "Unsurprisingly, they found the task considerably harder than the basic V NP PP case, due to increased ambiguity and data sparseness.",
        "Mitchell (2004) similarly performed an extensive analysis of the Penn Treebank to investigate the different contexts PP attachment ambiguities occur in, and the relative ability of different PP attachment methods to disambiguate each.",
        "There have also been domain-specific methods proposed for PP attachment, for example, in the area of biomedicine (Hahn, Romacker, and Schulz 2002; Pustejovsky et al.",

      "text": [
        "Prepositions are also often found as part of multiword expressions (MWEs), such as verb-particle constructions (break down), prepositional verbs (rely on), determinerless PPs (in hospital), complex prepositions (by means of) and compound nominals (affairs of state).",
        "MWEs are lexical items which are composed of more than one word and are lexically, syntactically, semantically, pragmatically, and/or statistically idiosyncratic in some way (Sag et al.",
        "2002).",
        "In this section, we present a brief overview of the syntax of the key prepositional MWEs in English, and discuss a cross-section of some of the recent research done in the area.",
        "Prepositional MWEs span the full spectrum of morphosyntactic variation.",
        "Some complex prepositions undergo no inflection, internal modification, or word order variation (e.g., in addition to) and are best analyzed as \"words with spaces\" (Sag et al.",
        "2002).",
        "Others optionally allow internal modification (e.g., with [due/particular/special/...] regard to) or determiner insertion (e.g., on [the] top of) and are considered to be semifixed expressions (Villada Moiron 2005).",
        "Compound nominals are similarly semi-fixed expressions, in that they have rigid constraints on word order and lexical composition, but allow morphological inflection (e.g., part(s) of speech).",
        "The three prepositional MWE types that cause the greatest syntactic problems in English, in terms of their relative frequency and tendency for syntactic variation, are:",
        "1. verb-particle constructions (VPCs), where the verb selects for an intransitive preposition (e.g., chicken out or hand in:Dehe et al.",
        "[2002]);",
        "2. prepositional verbs (PVs), where the verb selects for a transitive preposition (e.g., rely on or refer to: Huddleston and Pullum [2002]);",
        "3. determinerless PPs (PP-Ds), where a PP is made up of a preposition and singular noun without a determiner (e.g., at school, offscreen: Baldwin et al.",
        "[2006]).",
        "All three MWE types undergo limited syntactic variation (Sag et al.",
        "2002).",
        "For example, transitive verb particle constructions generally undergo the particle alternation, whereby the particle may occur either adjacent to the verb (e.g., tear up the letter), or be separated from the verb by the NP complement (e.g., tear the letter up).",
        "Some VPCs readily occur with both orders (like tear up), while others have a strong preference for a particular order (e.g., take off – under the interpretation of having the day off – tends to occur in the particle-final configuration in usages such as take Friday off vs. ?take off Friday).",
        "In addition, many VPCs undergo limited internal modification by adverbials, where the adverb pre-modifies the particle (e.g., come straight over).",
        "The syntactic variability of prepositional verbs is more subtle.",
        "PVs occur in two basic forms: (1) fixed preposition PVs (e.g., come across), where the verb and selected preposition must be strictly adjacent; and (2) mobile preposition PVs (e.g., refer to), where the selected preposition is adjacent to the verb in the canonical word order, but undergoes limited syntactic alternation.",
        "For example, mobile preposition PVs allow limited coordination of PP objects (e.g., refer to the book and to the DVD), and the NP object of the selected preposition can be passivized (e.g., the book they referred to).",
        "Even subtler are the syntactic effects observed for determinerless PPs.",
        "The singular noun in the PP-D is often strictly countable (e.g., offscreen, on break), resulting in syntactic markedness as, without a determiner, the noun does not constitute a saturated NP.",
        "This in turn dictates the need for a dedicated analysis in a linguistically motivated grammar in order to be able to avoid parse failures (Baldwin et al.",
        "2004; van der Beek 2005).",
        "Additionally, there is considerable variation in the internal modifiability of deter-minerless PPs, with some not permitting any internal modification (e.g., of course)and others allowing optional internal modification (e.g., at considerable length).",
        "There are also, however, cases of obligatory internal modification (e.g., at considerable/great expense vs. *at expense) and highly restricted internal modification (e.g., at long last vs. *at great/short last).",
        "Balancing up these different possibilities in terms of over-and undergeneration in a grammar is far from trivial (Baldwin et al.",
        "2006).",
        "Naturally there are other prepositional MWE types in languages other than English with their own syntactic complexities.",
        "Notable examples to have received attention in the computational linguistics literature are Dutch \"collocational prepositional phrases\" (Villada Moiron 2005), German complex prepositions (Trawinski 2003; Trawinski, Sailer, and Soehn 2006), German particle verbs (Schulte im Walde 2004; Rehbein and van Genabith 2006), and Polish preposition-pronoun contractions (Trawinski 2005, 2006).",

        "The syntactic variation of prepositional MWEs leads to difficulties for NLP applications.",
        "To start with, there is the problem of identifying their token occurrences, for example, for semantic indexing purposes.",
        "As with simplex words, a given MWE may appear with different subcategorization frames (e.g., give up vs. give up [something]), but added to that, the order of the elements may be flexible or internally modified (see previous discussion), and some elements may be optional (e.g., out in make a big thing (out) of[something]).",
        "Additionally, they conspire with PP attachment ambiguity to compound structural ambiguity.",
        "For example, hand the paper in today is ambiguous between a V NP PP analysis ([V hand][NP the paper][PP in today]), a VNPanalysis([V hand][NP the paper in today]), and a transitive VPC analysis ([V hand] [NP the paper][P in][NP today]); of these, the final analysis is, of course, correct.",
        "4 The question of whether or not a particle can be separated from the verb depends on factors such as the degree of bonding of the particle with the verb, the size of the NP, and the type of the NP, as discussed by Wasow (2002).",
        "A Survey of Prepositions in Applications",
        "Related to this is the issue of resource development, especially lexicon development for linguistically motivated parsers.",

      "text": [
        "For this special issue we invited submissions that brought a theoretical basis to research on prepositions in lexical resources and NLP tasks.",
        "The number of submissions received reflects the interest in prepositions at this time, with a total of 16 submissions.",
        "On the basis of a rigorous review process, we selected four articles for inclusion in the special issue, covering: the use of semantic resources to disambiguate preposition semantics, for use in lexical acquisition (O'Hara and Wiebe 2009); a crosslingual lexical semantic analysis of prepositions to interpret nominal compounds (Girju 2009); a formal semantic analysis of preposition semantics, and its possible application in Norwegian-English machine translation (Jorgensen and Lonning 2009); and a computational model for preposition semantics for use in a dialogue system (Kelleher and Costello 2009).",
        "We now outline each of these articles.",
        "The first two articles look at the semantic interpretation of prepositions, as they tend to be highly polysemous and have a number of closely related senses.",
        "O'Hara and Wiebe look at the disambiguation of preposition semantics for use in lexical acquisition, in semi-automatically extending lexical resources.",
        "They investigate the utility of information learned from resources such as the Penn Treebank and FrameNet, to perform semantic role disambiguation of PPs.",
        "The proposed methodology is evaluated in a series of experiments, and different sense granularities are contrasted in task-based evaluation.",
        "Prepositions are highly frequent in many languages, but also highly idiomatic in usage in a given language (hence the difficulty of non-native speakers in learning to use prepositions correctly).",
        "However, there are instances of cross-linguistic regularities in their linguistic realizations.",
        "For example, when translating English nominal compounds of the type Noun Preposition Noun (N P N) and Noun Noun (N N) into Romance languages, these are often translated into N P N compounds, where the choice of preposition is (semi-)predictable from the semantics of the compound.",
        "Girju investigates the role of the syntactic and semantic properties of prepositions in English and Romance languages in the automatic semantic interpretation of English nominal compounds.",
        "On the basis of an extensive corpus analysis of the distribution of semantic relations in nominal compounds in English and five Romance languages, she attempts to disambiguate the semantic relations in English nominal compounds.",
        "She focuses on non-equative compositional nominal compounds, and empirically tests the contribution of prepositions to the task of semantic interpretation, using a supervised, knowledgeintensive model.",
        "Identification of crosslinguistic and possibly universal properties of prepositions (or equivalent constructions) could potentially impact on a number of NLP applications.",
        "In machine translation, for example, a formal description of the crosslinguistic semantic properties of prepositions could provide the basis for an interlingua.",
        "This is the topic of the third article in this special issue: Jorgensen and Lonning propose a unification-based grammar implementation of a formal semantic analysis of preposition semantics, and demonstrate its application in Norwegian^English MT.",
        "A correct handling of prepositions, particularly spatial prepositions, is also important in dialogue systems, as prepositions are often used to refer to entities in the physical environment of system interaction.",
        "The last article in this special issue addresses this",
        "A Survey of Prepositions in Applications",
        "topic: Kelleher and Costello present computational models of spatial preposition semantics for use in visually situated dialogue systems.",
        "The proposed models of topological and projective spatial prepositions can be used for both interpretation and generation of prepositional expressions in complex visual environments containing multiple objects, and are able to account for the contextual effect which other distractor objects can have on the region described by a preposition.",
        "The evaluation is done in terms of psycholinguistic tests evaluating the approach to distractor interference on prepositional semantics.",
        "The models are employed in a human-robot dialogue system to interpret locative expressions containing a topological preposition and to generate spatial references in visually situated contexts."

      "heading": "6. Discussion and Conclusion",
      "text": [
        "As we hope to have demonstrated in this introduction, prepositions have led a mixed existence in computational linguistics and related fields, particularly in the context of applications.",
        "In applications requiring spatial interpretation (e.g., situated dialogue systems), they have been the focus of dedicated research, and in applications which incorporate a language generation component such as MT, there have been isolated instances exemplifying the need for dedicated handling of prepositions/case markers.",
        "In general, however, they tend to have been relegated to the sidelines in applied NLP research.",
        "Research on prepositions has tended to concentrate on a specific subset of prepositions in a particular language, often as a one-off research task which has failed to make broader impact in the field of computational linguistics.",
        "PP attachment – especially in English – has been an exception, in the sense that the RRR data set has given rise to an active strand of research centered around prepositions.",
        "We hope that variants of the RRR data set from Atterer and Schütze (2007) and Agirre, Baldwin, and Martinez (2008) will reinvigorate interest in PP attachment, in a situated parsing context.",
        "Similarly, the emergence of resources such as the Preposition Project, and the data set made available for the SemEval 2007 task on the word sense disambiguation of prepositions (Litkowski and Hargraves 2007), provide the means for more detailed analysis of preposition semantics.",
        "In addition to standalone word sense disambiguation tasks, however, there needs to be more research on the interaction of preposition semantics with other semantic tasks, such as semantic role labeling and the word sense disambiguation of content words.",
        "The increasing availability of large-scale parallel corpora paves the way for crosslinguistic research on preposition syntax.",
        "Areas of particular promise in this regard are methods for generating prepositions in MT, and automatic error correction of preposition usage in non-native speaker text.",
        "Following the lead of Saint-Dizier (2006b), Jorgensen and Lonning (2009), and others, we also hope to see more crosslinguistic and typological research on the lexical semantics of prepositions.",
        "Although there has been a steady proliferation of WordNets for different languages, linked variously to English WordNet (e.g., EuroWordNet for several European languages [Vossen 1998], BALKANET for Balkan languages [Stamou et al.",
        "2002], HowNet for Chinese [Dong and Dong 2006], and Japanese WordNet for Japanese [Isahara et al.",
        "2008]), they have tended to follow the lead of English WordNet and focus exclusively on content words.",
        "Given the increasing maturity of resources such as the Preposition Project and PrepNet, the time seems right to develop preposition sense inventories for more languages, linked back to English.",
        "On the basis of currently available resources and future efforts such as these, we believe there will be a steady lowering of the barrier to including a more systematic handling of prepositions in NLP applications.",
        "The purpose of this article has been to highlight the theoretical and applied research that has been done on prepositions in computational linguistics, focusing on computational syntax and semantics.",
        "In particular, we have aimed to highlight applied research which has focused specifically on prepositions.",
        "It is our hope that through this special issue, we will rekindle interest in prepositions and motivate greater awareness of prepositions in various applications."
