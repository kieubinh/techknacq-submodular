        "For sentence 2, the choice is even less clear, though the manner meaning seems preferred.",
        "This article presents a new method for disambiguating prepositions using information learned from annotated corpora as well as knowledge stored in declarative lexical resources.",
        "The approach allows for better coverage and finer distinctions than in previous work in preposition disambiguation.",
        "For instance, a traditional approach would involve manually developing rules for on that specify the semantic type of objects associated with the different senses (e.g., time for temporal).",
        "Instead, we infer this based on lexical associations learned from annotated corpora.",
        "The motivation for preposition disambiguation is to support a system for lexical acquisition (O'Hara 2005).",
        "The focus of the system is to acquire distinguishing information for the concepts serving to define words.",
        "Large-scale semantic lexicons mainly emphasize the taxonomic relations among the underlying concepts (e.g., is-a and part-of), and often lack sufficient differentiation among similar concepts (e.g., via attributes or functional relations such as is-used-for).",
        "For example, in WordNet (Miller et al.",
        "1990), the standard lexical resource for natural language processing, the only relations for beagle and Afghan are that they are both a type of hound.",
        "Although the size difference can be inferred from the definitions, it is not represented in the WordNet semantic network.",
        "In WordNet, words are grouped into synonym sets called synsets, which represent the underlying concepts and serve as nodes in a semantic network.",
        "Synsets are ordered into a hierarchy using the hypernym relation (i.e., is-a).",
        "There are several other semantic relations, such as part-whole, is-similar-to,anddomain-of.",
        "Nonetheless, in version 2.1 of WordNet, about 30% of the synsets for noun entries are not explicitly distinguished from sibling synsets via semantic relations.",
        "To address such coverage problems in lexicons, we have developed an empirical approach to lexical acquisition, building upon earlier knowledge-based approaches in dictionary definition analysis (Wilks, Slator, and Guthrie 1996).",
        "This involves a two-step process: Definitions are first analyzed with a broad-coverage parser, and then the resulting syntactic relationships are disambiguated using statistical classification.",
        "A crucial part of this process is the disambiguation of prepositions, exploiting online resources with semantic role usage information.",
        "The main resources are the Penn Treebank (PTB; Marcus et al.",
        "1994) and FrameNet (Fillmore, Wooters, and Baker 2001), two popular corpora providing rich annotations on English text, such as the semantic roles associated with prepositional phrases in context.",
        "In addition to the semantic role annotations from PTB and FrameNet, traditional knowledge bases (KBs) are utilized to provide training data for the relation classification.",
        "In particular, the Factotum KB (Cassidy 2000) is used to provide additional training data for prepositions that are used to convey particular relationships.",
        "Information on preposition usage is not explicitly encoded in Factotum, so a new corpus analysis technique is employed to infer the associations.",

        "During the shift in emphasis away from systems that work in small, self-contained domains to those that can handle open-ended domains, there has been a trend towards the use of larger sets of semantic primitives (Wilks, Slator, and Guthrie 1996).",

        "Table 19 also shows the per-class statistics, indicating that the means, direction,and part roles are handled poorly by the classifier.",

        "The results in Table 19 also illustrate that the reduced, common-role inventory has an additional advantage of improving performance in the classification, compared to a cascaded approach.",
        "This occurs because several of the miscellaneous roles in FrameNet cover subtle distinctions that are not relevant for definition analysis (e.g., cognizer and addressee).",
        "The common inventory therefore strikes a balance between the overly general roles in PTB, which are easy to classify, and the overly specialized roles in FrameNet, which are quite difficult to classify.",

        "and Jurafsky (2002) instead just select the first sense for their hypernym features for relation classification.",
        "They report marginal improvements using the features, whereas configurations with hypernym collocations usually perform best in our preposition disambiguation experiments.",
        "Mohit and Narayanan (2003) use WordNet hypernyms to generalize patterns for information extraction inferred from FrameNet annotations by distributing support from terms co-occurring in annotations for frame elements to the terms for hypernyms.",
        "However, they do not incorporate a filtering stage, as with our conditional probability test.",
        "Mihalcea (2002) shows how hypernym information can be useful in deriving clues for unsupervised WSD.",
        "Patterns for co-occurring words of a given sense are induced from sense-tagged corpora.",
        "Each pattern specifies templates for the co-occurring words in the immediate context window of the target word, as well as their corresponding synsets if known (e.g., sense tagged or unambiguous), and similarly the hypernym synsets if known.",
        "To disambiguate a word, the patterns for each of its senses are evaluated in the context, and the sense with the most support is chosen.",
        "The work here addresses relation disambiguation specifically with respect to those indicated by prepositional phrases (i.e., preposition word-sense disambiguation).",
        "Until recently, there has been little work on general-purpose preposition disambiguation.",
        "Litkowski (2002) and Srihari, Niu, and Li (2001) present approaches using manually derived rules.",
        "Both approaches account for only a handful of prepositions; in contrast, for FrameNet we disambiguate 32 prepositions via individual classifiers and over 100 prepositions via the combined classifier.",
        "Liu and Soo (1993) present a heuristic approach for relation disambiguation relying upon syntactic clues as well as occurrence of specific prepositions.",
        "They assign roles to constituents of a sentence from corpus data provided that sufficient instances are available.",
        "Otherwise, a human trainer is used to answer questions needed by the system for the assignment.",
        "They report an 86% accuracy rate for the assignment of roles to verbal arguments in about 5,000 processed sentences.",
        "Alam (2004) sketches out how the preposition over might be disambiguated into one of a dozen roles using features based on the head and complement, such as whether the head is a movement verb or whether the complement refers to a duration.",
        "These features form the basis for a manually-constructed decision tree, which is interpreted by hand in an evaluation over sentences from the British National Corpus (BNC), giving a precision of 93.5%.",
        "Boonthum, Toida, and Levinstein (2006), building upon the work of Alam, show how WordNet can be used to automate the determination of similar head and complement properties.",
        "For example, if both the head and complement refer to people, with should be interpreted as accompaniment.",
        "These features form the basis for a disambiguation system using manually constructed rules accounting for ten commonly occurring prepositions.",
        "They report a precision of 79% with a recall of 76% over an inventory of seven roles in a post hoc evaluation that allows for partial correctness.",
        "There have been a few machine-learning approaches that are more similar to the approach used here.",
        "Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) perform relation disambiguation using the FrameNet annotations as training data.",
        "They include lexical features for the headword of the phrase and the predicating word for the entire annotated frame (e.g., the verb corresponding to the frame under which the annotations are grouped).",
        "They also use several features derived from the output of a parser, such as the constituent type of the phrase (e.g., NP), the grammatical function (e.g., subject), and a path feature listing part-of-speech tags from the target word to the phrase being tagged.",
        "They report an accuracy of 78.5% with a baseline of 40.6% over the FrameNet semantic roles.",
        "However, by conditioning the classification on the predicating word, the range of roles for a particular classification instance is more limited than in the experiments presented in this article.",
        "Blaheta and Charniak (2000) use the PTB annotations for relation disambiguation.",
        "They use a few parser-derived features, such as the constituent labels for nearby nodes and part-of-speech for parent and grandparent nodes.",
        "They also include lexical features for the head and alternative head (because prepositions are considered as the head by their parser).",
        "As their classifier tags all adjuncts, they include the nominal and adverbial roles, which are syntactic and more predictable than the roles occurring with prepositional phrases.",
        "There have been recent workshops featuring competitions for semantic role tagging (Carreras and Marquez 2004, 2005; Litkowski 2004).",
        "A common approach is to tag all the semantic roles in a sentence at the same time to account for dependencies, such as via Hidden Markov Models.",
        "To take advantage of accurate Support Vector Machine classification, Pradhan et al.",
        "(2005) instead use a postprocessing phrase based on trigram models of roles.",
        "Their system incorporates a large variety of features, building upon several different preceding approaches, such as including extensions to the path features from Gildea and Jurafsky (2002).",
        "Their lexical features include the predicate root word, headwords for the sentence constituents and PPs, as well as their first and last words.",
        "Koomen et al.",
        "(2005) likewise use a large feature set.",
        "They use an optimization phase to maximize satisfaction of the constraints imposed by the PropBank data set, such as the number of arguments for particular predicates (e.g., just two for stalk, arg0 and arg1).",
        "Lastly, Ye and Baldwin (2006) show how filtering can be used to constrain the hypernyms selected to serve as collocations, building upon our earlier work (O'Hara and Wiebe 2003).",
        "They report 87.7% accuracy in a setup similar to ours over PTB (i.e., a gain of 2 percentage points).",
        "They use a different type of collocation feature than ours: having a binary feature for each potential collocation rather than a single feature per class.",
        "That is, they use Over-Range Binary rather than Per-Class Binary (Wiebe, McKeever, and Bruce 1998).",
        "Moreover, they include several hundred of these features, rather than our seven (benefactive previously included), which is likely the main source of improvement.",
        "Again, the per-class binary organization is a bag of words approach, so it works well only with a limited number of potential collocations.",
        "Follow-up work of theirs (Ye and Baldwin 2007) fared well in the recent preposition disambiguation competition, held as part of SemEval-2007 (Litkowski and Hargraves 2007).",
        "Thus, an immediate area for future work will be to incorporate such improved feature sets.",
        "We will also investigate addressing sentential role constraints as in general semantic role tagging."

        "The Penn Treebank (Marcus et al.",
        "1994) covers general roles for verbal adjuncts and FrameNet (Fillmore, Wooters, and Baker 2001) includes a wide range of domain-specific roles for all verbal arguments.",
        "In addition, semantic role inventories from knowledge bases are investigated.",
        "Cyc (Lehmann 1996) provides fine-grained role distinctions, Factotum (Cassidy 2000) includes a variety of functional relations, and work in Conceptual Graphs (Sowa 1999) emphasizes roles for attributes.",
        "Relations from both types of resources are considered when developing the inventory of relations used for definition analysis, as shown in Table 8.",
        "The disambiguation concentrates on relations indicated by prepositional phrases, and is framed as word-sense disambiguation for the preposition in question.",

        "Exploiting Resources for Preposition Disambiguation",
        "type of feature for word-sense disambiguation is introduced, using WordNet hyper-nyms as collocations rather than just words, as is typically done.",
        "The full feature set is shown in Figure 4.",
        "Various experiments over the PTB and FrameNet data are presented, including prepositions classified separately versus together, and illustrating the effects of filtering.",
        "The main results in Tables 11 and 16 show that the combined use of word and hypernym collocations generally achieves the best performance.",
        "For relationships derived from knowledge bases, the prepositions and other relational markers need to be inferred from corpora.",
        "A method for doing this is demonstrated using Factotum, with results shown in Table 18.",
        "In addition, to account for granularity differences in the semantic role inventories, the relations are mapped into a common inventory that was developed based on the inventories discussed in the article.",
        "This allows for improved classification in cases where inventories provide overly specialized relations, such as those in FrameNet.",
        "Classification results are shown in Table 19.",
        "The recent competitions on semantic relation labeling have highlighted the usefulness of incorporating a variety of clues for general-purpose relation disambiguation (Carreras and Marquez 2005).",
        "Some of the techniques developed here for preposition disambiguation can likely help with relation disambiguation in general.",
        "For instance, there are quite a few lexical features, such as in Pradhan et al.",
        "(2005), which could be extended to use semantic classes as with our hypernym collocations.",
        "In general it seems that, when lexical features are used in supervised machine learning, it is likely that corresponding class-based features based on hypernyms can be beneficial for improved coverage.",
        "Other aspects of this approach are geared specifically to our goal of supporting lexical acquisition from dictionaries, which was the motivation for the emphasis on preposition disambiguation.",
        "Isolating the preposition annotations allows the classifiers to be more readily tailored to definition analysis, especially because predicate frames are not assumed as with other FrameNet relation disambiguation.",
        "Future work will investigate combining the general relation classifiers with preposition disambiguation classifiers, such as is done in Ye and Baldwin (2006).",
        "Future work will also investigate improvements to the application to definition analysis.",
        "Currently, FrameNet roles are always mapped to the same common inventory role (e.g., place to location).",
        "However, this should account for the frame of the annotation and perhaps other context information.",
        "Lastly, we will also look for more resources to exploit for preposition disambiguation (e.g., ResearchCyc)."
