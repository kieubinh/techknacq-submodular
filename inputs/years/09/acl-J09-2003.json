        "Prepositions are an important and frequently used category in both English and Romance languages.",
        "In a corpus study of one million English words, Fang (2000) shows that one in ten words is a preposition.",
        "Moreover, about 10% of the 175 most frequent words in a corpus of 20 million Spanish words were found to be prepositions (Almela et al. 2005).",
        "Studies on language acquisition (Romaine 1995; Celce-Murcia and Larsen-Freeman 1999) have shown that the acquisition and understanding of prepositions in languages such as English and Romance is a difficult task for native speakers, and even more difficult for second language learners.",
        "For example, together with articles, prepositions represent the primary source of grammatical errors for learners of English as a foreign language (Gocsik 2004).",
        "Although the complexity of preposition usage has been argued for and documented by various scholars in linguistics, psycholinguistics, and computational linguistics, very few studies have been done on the function of prepositions in natural language processing (NLP) applications.",
        "The reason is that prepositions are probably the most polysemous category and thus, their linguistic realizations are difficult to predict and their cross-linguistic regularities difficult to identify (Saint-Dizier 2005a).",
        "In this article we investigate the role of prepositions in the task of automatic semantic interpretation of English nominal phrases and compounds.",
        "The problem is simple to define: Given a compositional noun phrase (the meaning of the phrase derives from the meaning of the constituents) constructed out of a pair of nouns, N1 N2, one representing the head and the other the modifier, determine the semantic relationship between the two nouns.",
        "For example, the noun-noun compound family estate encodes a POSSESSION relation, while the nominal phrase the faces of the children refers to PART-WHOLE.",
        "The problem, although simple to state, is difficult for automatic semantic interpretation.",
        "The reason is that the meaning of these constructions is most of the time implicit (it cannot be easily recovered from morphological analysis).",
        "Interpreting nominal phrases and compounds correctly requires various types of information, from world knowledge to lexico-syntactic and discourse information.",
        "This article focuses on nominal phrases of the type N P N and noun compounds (N N) and investigates the problem based on cross-linguistic evidence from a set of six languages: English, Spanish, Italian, French, Portuguese, and Romanian.",
        "The choice of these constructions is empirically motivated.",
        "In a study of 6,200 (Europarl) and 2,100 (CLUVI) English token nominal phrase and compound instances randomly chosen from two English-Romance parallel text collections of different genres, we show that over 80% of their Romance noun phrase translations are encoded by N P N and N N constructions.",
        "For instance, beer glass, an English compound of the form N1 N2, translates into N2 P N1 instances in Romance: tarro de cerveza ('glass of beer') in Spanish, bicchiere da birra ('glass for beer') in Italian, verre a bitre ('glass at/to beer') in French, copo de cerveja ('glass of beer') in Portuguese, and pahar de bere ('glass of beer') in Romanian.",
        "In this article, in addition to the sense translation (in italics), when relevant we also provide the word-by-word gloss (in 'parentheses').",
        "Moreover, we use N1, N2 to denote the two lexical nouns that encode a semantic relation (where N1 is the syntactic modifier and N2 is the syntactic head), and Arg1, Arg2 to denote the semantic arguments of the relation encoded by the two nouns.",
        "For example, beer glass encodes a PURPOSE relation where Arg1 (beer) is the purpose of Arg2 ('glass'; thus 'glass (used) for beer').",
        "We argue here that the syntactic directionality given by the head-modifier relation (N1 N2 in noun compounds and N2 P N1 in nominal phrases) is not always the same as the semantic directionality given by the semantic argument frame of the semantic relation.",
        "Otherwise said, N1 does not always map to Arg1 and N2 to Arg2 for any given relation.",
        "Languages choose different nominal phrases and compounds to encode relationships between nouns.",
        "For example, English nominal phrases and compounds of the 1 http://uuu.isi.edu/koehn/europarl/.",
        "This corpus contains over 20 million words in eleven official languages of the European Union covering the proceedings of the European Parliament from 1996 to 2001.",
        "2 CLUVI - Linguistic Corpus of the University of Vigo Parallel Corpus 2.1; http://sli.uvigo.es/CLUVI/.",
        "CLUVI is an open text repository of parallel corpora of contemporary oral and written texts in some of the Romance languages (such as Galician, French, Spanish, and Portuguese) and Basque parallel text collections.",
        "form N1 N2 (e.g., wood stove)and N2 P1 N1 (e.g., book on the table) usually translate in Romance languages as N2 P2 N1 (e.g., four a bois in French - 'stove at/to wood', and livre sur la table - book on the table').",
        "Romance languages have very few N N compounds and they are of limited semantic categories, such as TYPE (e.g., legge quadro in Italian - 'law framework' - translates as framework law).",
        "Besides the unproductive N N and the productive N P N phrases, Romanian also uses another productive construction: the genitive-marked noun-noun compounds (e.g., frumuse\\ea fetei -beauty-the girl-GEN - translated as the beauty ofthe girl).",
        "Whereas English N N compounds are right-headed (e.g., framework/Modifier law/Head), Romance compounds are left-headed (e.g., legge/Head quadro/Modifier).",
        "Moreover, the Romance preposition used in the translations of English nominal phrase instances of the type N P N is one that comes closest to having overlapping semantic range as intended in the English instance, but may not be the exact counterpart for the whole semantic range.",
        "For example, Committee on Culture translates as Comision de la Cultura (Spanish) ('Committee of the Culture'), Commission de la Culture (French) ('Committee of the Culture'), Commissione per la Cultura (Italian) ('Committee for the Culture'), Comissao para Cultura (Portuguese) ('Committee for Culture'), and Comitet pentru Cultura (Romanian) ('Committee for Culture').",
        "Even those Romance prepositions that are spelled \"de\" are pronounced differently in different Romance languages.",
        "Thus, the focus on nominal phrases and compounds in English and Romance languages is also motivated linguistically.",
        "The extension of this task to natural languages other than English brings forth both new insights and new challenges.",
        "The Romance prepositions used in the translations of English nominal phrases and compounds, may vary in ways that correlate with the semantics.",
        "Thus, Romance language prepositions will give us another source of evidence for disambiguating the semantic relations in English nominal phrases and compounds.",
        "We argue that, in languages with multiple syntactic options such as English (N N and N P N) and Romanian (N N, genitive-marked N N, and N P N), the choice between such constructions in context is governed in part by semantic factors.",
        "For example, the set of semantic relations that can be encoded by pairs of nouns such as teacup and sailor-suit varies with the syntactic construction used.",
        "In English, while the noun-noun compounds tea cup and sailor suit encode only PURPOSE, the N P N constructions cup oftea and suit ofthe sailor encode CONTENT-CONTAINER (a subtype of LOCATION)and MEASURE relations and POSSESSION, respectively.",
        "Similarly, in Romanian both tea cup and cup oftea translate only as the N P N instance cea§ca deceai ('cup of tea'), while sailor suit translates as costum de marinar ( suit of sailor') and the suit ofthe sailor as the genitive-marked N N costumul marinarului ( suit-the sailor-GEN').",
        "Thus, we study the distribution of semantic relations across different nominal phrases and compounds in one language and across all six languages, and analyze the resulting similarities and differences.",
        "This distribution is evaluated over the two different corpora based on two state-of-the-art classification tag sets: Lauer's set of eight prepositions (Lauer 1995) and our list of 22 semantic relations.",
        "A mapping between the two tag sets is also provided.",
        "In order to test their contribution to the task of semantic interpretation, prepositions and other linguistic clues are employed as features in a supervised, knowledgeintensive model.",
        "Furthermore, given a training set of English nominal phrases and compounds along with their translations in the five Romance languages, our algorithm automatically learns classification rules and applies them to unseen test instances for semantic interpretation.",
        "As training and test data we used 3,124 Europarl and 2,023 CLUVI token instances.",
        "These instances were annotated with semantic relations and analyzed for inter-annotator agreement.",
        "The results are compared against two state-of-the-art approaches: a supervised machine learning model, semantic scattering (Moldovan and Badulescu 2005), and a Web-based unsupervised model (Lapata and Keller 2005).",
        "Moreover, we show that the Romanian linguistic features contribute more substantially to the overall performance than the features obtained for the other Romance languages.",
        "This is explained by the fact that the choice of the linguistic constructions (either genitive-marked N N or N P N) in Romanian is highly correlated with their meaning.",
        "The article is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 presents a summary of related work.",
        "In Section 3 we describe the general approach to the interpretation of nominal phrases and compounds and list the syntactic and semantic interpretation categories used along with observations regarding their distribution in the two different cross-linguistic corpora.",
        "Sections 4 and 5 present a learning model and experimental results.",
        "Section 6 presents linguistic observations on the behavior of English and Romanian N N and N P N constructions.",
        "Finally, in Section 7 we provide an error analysis and in Section 8 we offer some discussion and conclusions."

        "Later on, Levi (1978) attempted to give a tight account of noun-noun interpretation, distinguishing two types of noun-noun compounds: (a) compounds interpreted as involving one of nine predicates (CAUSE, HAVE, MAKE, USE, BE, IN, FOR, FROM, ABOUT)(e.g., onion tears encodes CAUSE) and (b) those involving nominalizations, namely, compounds whose heads are nouns derived from a verb, and whose modifiers are interpreted as arguments of the related verb (e.g., a music lover loves music).",
        "Levi's theory was cast in terms of the more general theory of Generative Semantics.",
        "In that theory it was assumed that the interpretation of compounds was available because the examples were derived from underlying relative clauses that had the same meanings.",
        "Thus, honey bee, expressing the relation MAKE, was taken to be derived from a headed relative abee that makes honey.",
        "Levi was committed to the view that a very limited set of predicates constituted all of the relations that could hold between nouns in simple noun-noun compounds.",

        "Although we agree with Downing (1977) that pragmatics plays an important factor in noun-noun interpretation, a large variety of noun-noun meanings can be captured with a well-chosen set of semantic relations.",
        "Our proposed semantic classification set differs from that of Levi (1978) in the sense that it contains more homogenous categories.",
        "Levi's categories, instead, are more heterogeneous, including both prepositions and verbs, some of which are too general (e.g., the prepositions for, in and the verb to have), and thus, too ambiguous.",

        "The automatic interpretation of nominal phrases and compounds is a difficult task for both unsupervised and supervised approaches.",
        "Currently, the best-performing noun-noun interpretation methods in computational linguistics focus mostly on two or three-word noun-noun compounds and rely either on ad hoc, domain-specific, hand-coded semantic taxonomies, or statistical models on large collections of unlabeled data.",
        "Recent results have shown that symbolic noun-noun compound interpretation systems using machine learning techniques coupled with a large lexical hierarchy perform with very good accuracy, but they are most of the time tailored to a specific domain (Rosario and Hearst 2001; Rosario, Hearst, and Fillmore 2002), or are general purpose (Turney 2006) but rely on semantic similarity metrics on WordNet (Fellbaum 1998).",
        "On the other hand, the majority of corpus statistics approaches to noun-noun compound interpretation collect statistics on the occurrence frequency of the noun constituents and use them in a probabilistic model (Lauer 1995).",
        "The problem is that most noun-noun compounds are rare and thus, statistics on such infrequent instances lead in general to unreliable estimates of probabilities.",
        "More recently, Lapata and Keller (2005) showed that simple unsupervised models applied to the noun-noun compound interpretation task perform significantly better when the n-gram frequencies are obtained from the Web (55.71% accuracy), rather than from a large standard corpus.",
        "Nakov and Hearst (2005) improve over Lapata and Keller's method through the use of surface features and paraphrases only for the task of noun-noun compound bracketing (syntactic parsing of three-word noun compounds) without their interpretation.",

        "In the qualia structure representation, for example, the meaning of a lexical concept, such as the modifier in a noun-noun compound, is defined in terms of four elements representing concept attributes along with their use and purpose.",
        "Thus, qualia structure provides a relational structure that enables the compositional interpretation of the modifier in relation to the head noun.",

        "Lauer, for example, classifies the relation between the head and the modifier nouns in a noun-noun compound by making use of a set of eight frequently used prepositions: of, for, with, in, on, at, about,andfrom.",
        "However, according to this classification, the noun-noun compound love story, for instance, can be classified both as story of love and story about love.",
        "The main problem with these abstract categories is that much of the meaning of individual compounds is lost, and sometimes there is no way to decide whether a form is derived from one category or another.",
        "On the other hand, lists of very specific semantic relations are difficult to build as they usually contain a very large number of predicates, such as the list of all possible verbs that can link the noun constituents.",
        "Finin, for example, uses semantic categories such as dissolved in to build interpretations of compounds such as salt water and sugar water.",
        "In this article we experiment with two sets of semantic classification categories defined at different levels of abstraction.",
        "The first is a core set of 22 semantic relations (SRs), a set which was identified by us from the linguistics literature and from various experiments after many iterations over a period of time (Moldovan and Girju 2003).",
        "6 The term dvandva comes from Sanskrit, translates literally as 'two-and-two' and means 'pair'.",
        "7 In the linguistic literature the words \"synthetic\" and \"root\" have been coined for noun-noun compounds.",
        "Because these terms apply also to nominal phrases, we use them in relation to these constructions as well.",
        "Moldovan and Girju proved empirically that this set is encoded by noun-noun pairs in noun phrases; the set is a subset of their larger list of 35 semantic relations used in a large set of semantics tasks.",
        "This list, presented in Table 1 along with examples and semantic argument frames, is general enough to cover a large majority of text semantics while keeping the semantic relations to a manageable number.",
        "A semantic argument frame is defined for each semantic relation and indicates the position of each semantic argument in the underlying relation.",
        "For example, \"Arg2 is part of (whole) Argi\" identifies the part (Arg2) and the whole (Argi) entities in this relation.",
        "This representation is important because it allows us to distinguish between different arrangements of the arguments for given relation instances.",
        "For example, most of the time, in N N compounds Argi precedes Arg2, whereas in N P N constructions the position is reversed (Arg2 P Argi).",
        "However, this is not always the case as shown by N N instances such as ham/Arg2sandwich/Arg1 and spoon/Arg1 handle/Arg2, both encoding PART-WHOLE.",
        "More details on subtypes of PART-WHOLE relations are presented in Section 6.2.",
        "A special relation here is KINSHIP, which is encoded only by N P N constructions and whose argument order is irrelevant.",
        "Thus, the labeling of the semantic arguments for each relation as Arg1 and Arg2 is just a matter of convention and they were introduced to provide a consistent guide to the annotators to easily test the goodness-of-fit of the relations.",
        "The examples in column 4 are presented with their WordNet senses identified in context from the CLUVI and Europarl text collections, where the specific sense is represented as the sense number preceded by a \"#\" sign.",
        "The second set is Lauer's list of eight prepositions (exemplified in Table 2) and can be applied only to noun-noun compounds, because in N P N instances the preposition is explicit.",
        "We selected these two state-of-the-art sets as they are of different size and contain semantic classification categories at different levels of abstraction.",
        "Lauer's list is more abstract and thus capable of encoding a large number of noun-noun compound instances found in a corpus (e.g., many N1 N2 instances can be paraphrased as N2 of",

        "Columns 3 and 4 in Table 4 show the number of N N and N P N translation instances in each Romance language.",
        "Out of these, we considered only 3,!24 Europarl and 2,023 CLUVI token instances representing the examples encoded by N N and N P N in all languages considered, after inter-annotator agreement.",
        "B.",
        "Cross-linguistic distribution of semantic relations and their mapping to nominal phrases and compounds",
        "A closer look at the N N and N P N translation instances in Table 4 shows that their syntactic distribution is influenced by the text genre and the semantics of the instances.",
        "For example, in Europarl most of the N N instances were naming noun-noun compounds referring to entities such as member states and framework law which were repeated in many sentences.",
        "Many of them encoded TYPE relations (e.g., member state, framework law) which, most of the time, are encoded by N N patterns in the target languages (stato membro and legge quadro in Italian, respectively).",
        "In the CLUVI corpus, on the other hand, the N N Romance translations represented only !% of the data.",
        "A notable exception here is Romanian (64.68% of Europarl and 32.8% of CLUVI).",
        "This is explained by the fact that, in Romanian, many noun phrases are represented as genitive-marked noun compounds (N!",
        "N2).",
        "In Romanian the genitive case is realized either as a suffix attached to the modifier noun N2 or as one of the genitival articles a/al/ale.",
        "If the modifier noun N2 is determined by an indefinite article then the genitive mark is applied to the article, not to the noun, for example ofata - unei fete ( 'a girl - of/to a girl') and un baiat - unui baiat ( ' a boy - of/to a boy').",
        "Similarly, if the modifier noun is determined by the definite article (which is enclitic in Romanian), the genitive mark is added at the end of the noun together with the article.",
        "For example, fata-fetei (the girl -girl-GEN), cartea-cHrtii (the book - book-GEN).",
        "Thus, the noun phrase the beauty of the girl, for instance, is translated as frumusetea fetei ( 'beauty-the girl-GEN'), and the beauty of agirl as frumusetea unei fete ( 'beauty-the of/to a girl').",
        "In general, in Romanian the choice between the N de N and the genitive-marked N N constructions depends on the specificity of the instance.",
        "Some noun-noun instances refer to a specific entity (existential interpretation), in which case the construction preferred is the genitive-marked N N, or they can refer in general to the category of those entities (generic interpretation),!!",
        "thus using N de N.",
        "For example, the instance the bite of the scorpion (AGENT) translates into muscatura scorpionului ( 'bite-the scorpion-GEN'), whereas a scorpion bite (AGENT) translates into muscatura descorpion ( 'bite of scorpion').",
        "Many semantic relations that allow both the generic and the existential interpretations can be encoded by both N P N and genitive-marked N N constructions as shown by the example above.",
        "However, there are situations when the generic and the existential interpretations change the meaning of the noun-noun pair.",
        "One such example is thesuitofthe sailor (POSSESSION) translated as costumul marinarului ('suit-the sailor-GEN'), and sailor suit (PURPOSE) translated as costum de marinar ( 'suit of sailor').",
        "!!",
        "The words existential and generic are borrowed here from the vast linguistic literature on definite and indefinite descriptions.",
        "Here, nouns such as firemen can have different readings in various contexts: Firemen are available (existential reading), vs. Firemen are altruistic (generic reading).",
        "At the other extreme there are relations which prefer either the generic or the existential interpretation.",
        "For example, some possession-encoding instances such as the budget of the University translate as 'bugetul Universitatii' (budget-the University-gen) and not as 'bugetul de Universitate' (budget-the of University).",
        "Other relations such as purpose and source identify generic instances.",
        "For example, (a) olive oil (source) translates as 'ulei de masline' (oil of olive), and not as ' uleiul maslinei (oil-the olivegen), and (b) the milk glass (purpose) translates as paharul de lapte' (glass-the of milk) and not as paharul laptelui' (glass-the milk-gen).",
        "Other examples include cause and topic.",
        "This observation is very valuable for the interpretation of nominal phrases and compounds and is used in the learning model to discriminate among the possible interpretations.",
        "Tables 6 and 7 show the semantic distribution of the instances on both text corpora.",
        "This distribution is represented both in number of tokens (the total number of instances per relation) and types (the unique number of instances per relation).",
        "In Europarl, the most frequently occurring relations are type and theme that together represent about 50% of the data with an equal distribution.",
        "The next most frequent relations are topic, purpose, agent,and property with an average coverage of about 8%.",
        "Moreover, eight relations of the 22-SR set (kinship, depiction, cause, instrument, source, manner, measure,and beneficiary) did not occur in this corpus.",
        "The 9.61% of the other-sr relation represents the ratio of those instances that did not encode any of the 22 semantic relations.",
        "It is interesting to note here the large difference between the number of types versus tokens for the type relation in Europarl.",
        "This is accounted for by various N N instances such as member states that repeat across the corpus.",
        "This semantic distribution contrasts with the one in CLUVI.",
        "Here, the most frequent relation by far is part-whole (40.53%), followed by location (8.95%), agent (6.23%), and is-a (5.93%).",
        "The missing relations are kinship, manner and benefi-ciary.",
        "A larger percentage of other-sr instances (12.95%) did not encode any of the 22 semantic relations.",
        "Moreover, in CLUVI 256 instances were tagged with more than one semantic relation with the following distribution: 46.8% measure/part-whole (e.g., a couple of cigarettes), 28.2% part-whole/location (e.g., bottom of the sea), 10.9% measure/location (e.g., cup of chocolate), 8.2% purpose/location (e.g., waste garden), and 5.9% theme/make-produce (e.g., makers ofsongs).",
        "In Europarl, on the other hand, there were only 97 such cases: 81.4% theme/make-produce (e.g., bus manufacturers) and 18.6% measure/part-whole (e.g., number of states).",
        "One way to study the contribution of both the English and Romance prepositions to the interpretation task is to look at their distribution over the set of semantic relations on two reasonably large text corpora of different genres.",
        "Of course, this approach does not provide an analysis that generates an exhaustive generalization over the properties of the language.",
        "However, as Tables 6 and 7 show, there are dependencies between the structure of the Romance language translations and the semantic relations encoded by the nominal phrases and compounds, although the most frequently occurring prepositions are de and its English equivalent of.",
        "Here we use the preposition de to represent a set of translation equivalents in Romance languages (e.g., the Italian counterpart is di).",
        "These prepositions are semantically underspecified, encoding a large set of semantic relations.",
        "The many-to-many mappings of the prepositions to the semantic classes adds to the complexity of the interpretation task.",
        "For example, in the Europarl corpus location is encoded in French by de, sur, devant,and a pres de, while topic is encoded in English by of, for, on, about and noun compounds, and in Spanish by de, sobre, en materia de."

        "In this article we measured the contribution of a set of five Romance languages to the task of semantic interpretation of English nominal phrases and compounds.",
        "More specifically, we showed that the Romanian linguistic features contribute more substantially to the overall performance than the features obtained for the other Romance languages.",
        "The choice of the Romanian linguistic constructions (either N N or N P N) is highly correlated with their meaning.",
        "This distinct behavior of Romanian constructions is also explained by the Slavic and Balkanic influences.",
        "An interesting future research direction would be to consider other Indo- and non Indo-European languages and measure their contribution to the task of interpreting nominal phrases and compounds in particular, and noun phrases in general."
