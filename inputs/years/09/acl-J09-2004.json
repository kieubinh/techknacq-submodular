        "Syntax: Are locative PPs complements or adjuncts?",
        "If we want our grammar to have compositional semantics, this question is closely related to the previous one.",
        "Analyzing locative PPs as adjuncts is hard to combine with the referential interpretation of locatives, as this either requires that the modified phrase also denotes a location, or that some additional machinery is introduced to map the location to a property.",
        "Q3.",
        "How is the distinction between static and directional locatives handled?",
        "Static and directional locatives differ both in syntactic distribution and truth conditions, and as we have observed, occurrences of locatives may be ambiguous between the two.",
        "A prominent question in the literature on locative prepositions is the geometric structure of particular prepositions: for example, what geometric relationship between the ball and the cup has to be realized for an expression like theballisinthecupto be true (e.g., Herskovits 1986)?",
        "As interesting as these questions are, we think they belong to the lexicon and the lexical semantic domain and fall outside the scope of this article.",
        "There is also interesting work which relates the meaning ofindividual prepositions to various types of psychological studies; in particular, studies of under which conditions the various prepositions are used (see, e.g., many of the references in Bloom et al.",
        "[1996] and in van der Zee and Slack [2003]).",
        "But again this plays a complementary role to our work.",
        "One particular question in the lexical semantics of prepositions is the distinction between what Zwarts and Winter (2000), following Herskovits (1986), call projective and non-projective prepositions.",
        "A non-projective preposition, like outside,requires only spatial knowledge of the location of the two objects, while a projective preposition, like behind, requires some further information about directions from the reference object.",
        "Levinson (1996) makes a further distinction between three types of reference frames called (i) intrinsic, where behind the house means on the other side of the house than what would be classified as the front side of the house, (ii) extrinsic, where behind the house is on the opposite side of the house than the speaker, and (iii) absolute, which applies to expressions like north ofthe house.",

        "For example, whereas behind or left of is dependent on the point of view, under is not, according to Hjelmslev.",
        "Hjelmslev's theory of cases relates to all three questions, and it has formed the basis of much of the later work done on locatives.",
        "Even though we will focus on languages where locatives are expressed by prepositions in adpositions, and ignore languages where locatives are expressed through inflectional case, it is a point for us to base our approach on formalisms that also extend to languages where locatives are expressed by case.",

        "We believe incorporating the optional modifier's semantics into the verb's lexical entry leads to a very elaborate and inflexible semantics, and would prefer to avoid this, if possible.",

        "Unless there is provided syntactic evidence for this distinction, this violates the autonomy of syntax, as the semantics of the construction (whether it is the event or its participants being located) governs the syntactic analysis (whether the construction is analyzed as an adjunct or a complement).",
        "There are of course different syntactic restrictions on what kind of verbs static and directional PPs can modify, but this applies to many modifying PPs, and is not in itself sufficient to warrant different syntactic analyses.",
