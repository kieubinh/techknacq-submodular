        "Returning to the architecture described in Section 3, the basic steps triggering the interpretation of a locative are: (1) the user utters a command, such as pick up the ball near the red box, (2) the speech recognition module processes the speech signal and passes the resulting string to the parser, (3) the parser constructs a formal representation of the meaning of the utterance, (4) the dialog manager categorizes the utterance to be a command and, also, recognizes the needto resolve the referring expression the ball near the red box.At this point the reference resolution module is triggered.",
        "The first stage in reference resolution is to retrieve the context against which the reference is to be resolved.",
        "This involves accessing the context model and retrieving the set of currently accessible objects.",
        "This set is then subdivided into the set of objects fulfilling the landmark description, the set of objects fulfilling the description of the target object, andthe set of objects fulfilling neither description.",

        "For this we iterate over each point in the scene, andcompare the competing absolute proximity scores at each point.",
        "If the primary landmark's (i.e., the landmark with the highest relative proximity at the point) relative proximity exceeds the next highest relative proximity score at a given point by more than a predefined confidence interval, the point is in the proximity region anchoredaroundthe primary landmark.",
        "Otherwise, we take it as ambiguous andnot in the proximal region that is being interpreted.",
        "The motivation for the confidence interval is to capture situations where the difference in relative proximity scores between the primary landmark and one or more landmarks at a given point is relatively small.",

        "The length of this list will be a constant; call it R. For each candidate relation, the number of times the incremental algorithm runs is equal to the number of TL objects (the number of objects which don't fulfill the description of the target created by the current run of the incremental algorithm, and which the target object stands under the currently selected relation to).",
        "Call the number of TL objects nTL andnote that nTL must be less than, andproportional to, n (the total number of objects).",
        "The number of times the basic incremental algorithm can run, in our system, is then proportional to NTL x R; replacing with nTL with n gives n x R runs of the basic incremental algorithm.",
        "Inserting the complexity of the basic incremental algorithm into this, we get an overall complexity of n x n x R = n x R, which although worse than the basic incremental algorithm's n complexity, is still polynomial.",
        "This algorithm cannot generate embedded locative descriptions, such as the bag on the chair near the window, because it does not use spatial relations as properties to describe the landmark.",
        "However, these descriptions can be generated if needed by replacing the call to the basic incremental algorithm for the landmark object with a call to the whole locative expression algorithm, using the target landmark as the target object and the set of distractor landmarks as the distractors.",
        "A nice consequence of this approach to generating embedded locative descriptions is that infinite descriptions (e.g., the bag on the chair supporting the bag on the chair ... ) will not be generatedas the target object is excluded from the context that the landmark's description is generated in.",
        "However, the cost of being able to generate these embedded descriptions is a higher exponential complexity.",
        "8.2.2 An Example.",
        "We can illustrate the framework using the visual context provided by the scene on the left of Figure 29.",
        "This context consists of two redboxes R1 and",
        "A visual scene andthe topological analysis of R1 andR2.",
        "R2 andtwo blue balls B1 andB2.",
        "Imagine that we want to refer to B1.",
        "We begin by calling the locative incremental algorithm, Algorithm 2.",
        "This in turn calls the basic incremental algorithm, Algorithm 1, which will return the property ball.",
        "However, this is not sufficient to create a distinguishing description as B2 is also a ball.",
        "In this context the set of candidate landmarks equals {R1,R2} andthe first relation in the hierarchy is topological proximity, which we model as described in Section 6.1.",
        "The image on the right of Figure 29 illustrates the analysis of the scene using this framework: The green region on the left defines the area deemed to be proximal to R1, and the yellow region on the right defines the area deemed to be proximal to R2.",
        "It is evident that B1 is in the area proximal to R1; consequently R1 is classifiedas a target landmark.",
        "As none of the distractors (i.e., B2) are located in a region that is proximal to a candidate landmark there are no distractor landmarks.",
        "As a result when the basic incremental algorithm is called to create a distinguishing description for the target landmark R1 it will return box and this will be deemed to be a distinguishing locative description.",
        "The overall algorithm will then return the vector {ball, proximal, box} which wouldresult in the realizer generating a reference of the form: the ball near the box."

        "In this article we have described the application of computational models of spatial prepositions to visually situated dialog systems.",
        "These computational models allow systems to both interpret andgenerate expressions which refer to topological andprojective relations between objects in the visual environment.",
        "The computational models of spatial prepositions we present are designed to handle reference resolution and generation in complex visual environments containing multiple objects.",
        "In particular, these models are designed to account for the contextual influence which the presence of multiple objects has on the semantics of topological andprojective prepositions.",
        "In this respect our computational models move beyond other accounts of the semantics of spatial prepositions, which typically do not model the contextual influence of other objects on spatial semantics.",
        "Because most real-worldvisual scenes are complex andcontain multiple objects, our computational models for the semantics of spatial prepositions are important for visually situated dialog systems intended to operate successfully in the real world.",
        "Clearly there are many interesting areas for future work.",
        "To date our research has focusedon a small number of static topological andprojective prepositions.",
        "We feel, however, that our framework will apply usefully to a range of other more complex static anddynamic prepositions, for example: between, among, within, along, beside, around.",
        "These prepositions either involve several objects or multiple areas and, consequently, our account of the effect of distractor objects on the target-landmark relationship could provide a worthwhile perspective on their semantics.",
        "This leads to another promising area for future work.",
        "Although our current model was designed to accommodate multiple distractor objects, our empirical studies have focusedon cases where there is only one distractor.",
        "An important aim for future research is to extend these studies and test the model in situations with multiple distractors.",
        "From a theoretical point of view, we feel that our approach to the semantics of spatial prepositions illustrates an important point for researchers working on the semantics of natural language in general: that it is possible to investigate andmodel semantics not solely as a linguistic phenomenon, but also in terms of non-linguistic factors such as the visual environment in which language is used.",
        "For example, in the psychological evaluations described in Section 7 we found that the semantic applicability of \"near\" to",
        "andCostello",
        "the relationship between a target anda landmark object was reliably influencedby the presence and location of a third, distractor, object, which was not part of the linguistic context.",
        "That the semantics of language is influencedby non-linguistic factors is an old point andan obvious one: however, we think that our research on visually-situated dialog systems makes a useful contribution by showing that these systems provide ideal testbeds for investigating the interaction between language and vision, and for developing detailed and useful computational models of how those interactions work."
