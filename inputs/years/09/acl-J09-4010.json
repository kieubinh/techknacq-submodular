        "In contrast, when matching a request to a request, or a request to a request-response pair, term frequency would be more indicative of the goodness of the match, as the document also has a request component.",
        "We consider retrieval to be successful only if the similarity score is higher than an applicability threshold, which is currently set empirically (Table 3).",
        "If retrieval is successful, then the response associated with the retrieved document is reused to reply to the user's request.",
        "We carried out a preliminary experiment in order to compare the three variants of the Doc-Ret method.",
        "The evaluation is performed by considering each request email in turn, removing it and its response from the corpus, carrying out the retrieval process, and then comparing the retrieved response with the actual response (if there are several similar responses in the corpus, an appropriate response can still be retrieved).",

        "To illustrate the distinction between prediction probability and SVM reliability (precision), let us return to the request in Figure 3.",
        "SC1 is predicted with high probability for this request, because SC1 includes sentences from responses to many other requests that contain the words repair and faulty.",
        "The word monitor also contributes to this high prediction probability, but not as strongly as repair and faulty.Thisis because SC1 includes sentences from responses whose requests mention different faulty products, for example, monitor, printer,or notebook.",
        "However, if there are more cases of faulty monitors in the corpus than other faulty products, then requests about repairing monitors will have a higher prediction probability than requests about repairing other products.",

        "Thus, the SVM for SC1 has a higher reliability than that for SC3, because it is easier for an SVM to learn when SC1 is appropriate (predominantly from the presence of the words faulty and repair).",
        "In order to ensure the relevance of the generated replies, we have placed tight restrictions on prediction probability and cluster cohesion (Table 3), which cause the Sent-Pred method to often return partial responses.",

        "Specifically, given a sentence skin cluster SCi which contains a sentence with a higher or equal score, the contribution of SCi to Score(sk)(= Pr(SQ) x Pr(sk|SQ)) is subtracted from Score(sk).",
        "After applying these penalties, we retain only the sentences whose adjusted score is greater than zero (for a highly cohesive cluster, typically only one sentence remains).",
        "9 For each feature in the input (i.e., lemmatized words), the centroid of the cluster contains a frequency-based estimate of the probability that an item with this feature value appears in this cluster.",
        "Calculating the confidence of an automated response.",
        "The calculation of sentence scores described previously determines which sentences should be included in an automatically generated response.",
        "In order to decide whether this response should be used, we need an overall measure of the confidence in it.",
        "Our confidence measure aggregates into a single number the values of the attributes used to assign a score to the individual sentences in a response, as follows.",
        "â€¢ usable SCs are those that satisfy the cohesion and prediction probability thresholds mentioned for sentence scoring, and also satisfy a further threshold for SC precision (Table 3).",
        "â€¢ possible SCs are those that satisfy a minimum prediction probability threshold (Table 3).",
        "This measure combines our confidence in the SCs selected to generate response sentences with the completeness of the resultant response.",
        "Confidence is represented by the thresholds employed to select suitable SCs; and completeness is represented by the ratio of the number of SCs that were deemed suitable, and the number of SCs that could possibly be used to generate a response.",
        "These are SCs whose prediction probability is greater than 0 (i.e., there is some evidence in the corpus for their use in the generation of a response sentence for the current request).",
        "We also use a minimal applicability threshold of 0 for the confidence measure (Table 3).",
        "This threshold reflects our notion that a partial response, even a response with one sentence, may still be useful.",
        "3.2.3 Sentence Prediction-Retrieval Hybrid (Sent-Hybrid).",
        "As seen in cluster SC2 in Figure 3, it is possible for an SC to be strongly predicted without it being sufficiently cohesive for a confident selection of a representative sentence.",
        "However, sometimes the ambiguity can be resolved through cues in the request.",
        "In this example, one of the sentences in SC2 matches the request terms better than the other sentences, as it contains the word monitor.",
        "In order to capture such situations, we combine prediction confidence with retrieval score to guide sentence selection (as for Sent-Pred, we use a recall measure with TF = 1; the values for the thresholds mentioned herein appear in Table 3).",
        "â€¢ For highly cohesive SCs predicted with high confidence, we select representative sentences as described in Section 3.2.2.",
        "â€¢ For SCs with medium cohesion that were predicted with high confidence, we attempt to match the candidate response sentences with the request sentences.",
        "We can use a liberal (low) recall threshold here, because the high prediction confidence guarantees that the sentences in the cluster are suitable for the request, so there is no need for a conservative (high) recall threshold.",
        "The role of retrieval in this situation is to select the sentence whose content terms best match the request, regardless of how good the match is.",
        "For instance, in the example in Figure 3, the sentence in SC2 that best matches the request only matches on one word (monitor), but this is sufficient to distinguish the winning sentence from the other sentences in SC2.",
        "Empirical Study of Response Automation Methods",
        "â€¢ For uncohesive clusters or clusters predicted with low confidence, we can rely only on retrieval.",
        "Now we must use a more conservative recall threshold to ensure that only sentences that are a good match for the request sentences are included in the response.",
        "SC3 in Figure 3 is an example of an SC for which there is insufficient evidence to form strong correlations between it and request terms.",
        "However, one of its sentences is a very good match for the second sentence in the request.",
        "In fact, all the content lemmas in that request sentence are matched, resulting in a perfect recall score of 1.0 (the non-matching words are stop words), which means that this response sentence is likely to be informative.",
        "Once we have a set of candidate response sentences that satisfy the appropriate recall thresholds, we remove redundant sentences as follows.",
        "Redundant sentences are removed from cohesive clusters as described in Section 3.2.2; for SCs with medium cohesion, we retain the sentence with the highest recall; and for uncohesive SCs, we retain all the sentences.",
        "The rationale for this policy is that the sentences in an SC with medium cohesion are sufficiently similar to each other, so the selection of more than one sentence may introduce redundancy.",
        "In contrast, sentences that belong to uncohesive SCs are deemed sufficiently dissimilar to each other, so we can select all the sentences that satisfy the recall criterion.",
        "As for Sent-Pred, the Sent-Hybrid method produces a response if it can return at least one response sentence.",
        "This happens when (a) the confidence in the highly cohesive SCs exceeds an applicability threshold; or (b) the confidence in one of the SCs with medium or low cohesion exceeds an applicability threshold, and the number of sentences retrieved for this SC exceeds an applicability threshold.",
        "As for Sent-Pred, confidence is calculated using Equation (6).",
        "Both applicability thresholds (confidence and number of retrieved sentences) are set to 0 (Table 3).",
        "The focus of our work is on the general applicability of the different response automation methods, rather than on comparing the performance of particular implementation techniques.",
        "Hence, throughout the course of this project, the different methods had minor implementational variations, which do not affect the overall insights of this research.",
        "Specifically, we used Decision Graphs (Oliver 1993) for Doc-Pred, and SVMs (Vapnik 1998) for Sent-Pred.",
        "Additionally, we used unigrams for clustering documents and sentences, and unigrams and bigrams for predicting document clusters and sentence clusters (Sections 3.1.2 and 3.2.2).",
        "Because this variation was uniformly implemented for both approaches, it does not affect their relative performance.",
        "These methodological variations are summarized in Table 2.",
        "As indicated at the beginning of this section, the implementation of these methods requires the selection of different thresholds, which are subjective and application dependent.",
        "Table 3 summarizes the thresholds required for the different methods, the",
        "10 We also experimented with the retention of sentences with high F-scores and with different weights for recall and precision.",
        "Our results were insensitive to these variations.",
        "11 This change of technique had a practical motivation: As seen in Section 3.2.2, we generated many predictive models for sentence clusters.",
        "This process could be automated with SVMs, but would have to be done manually if Decision Graphs had been used.",
        "range of values we considered, and the values we selected.",

        "We were hoping to account for significant differences between groups of dialogues on the basis of their topic.",
        "In addition, there was a practical motivation to break up this large sub-corpus into smaller chunks for ease of handling.",
        "We therefore applied Snob to automatically cluster the sub-corpus into separate topic-based data sets.",

        "There are very few reported attempts at corpus-based automation of help-desk responses (Carmel, Shtalhaim, and Soffer 2000; Lapalme and Kosseim 2003; Bickel and Scheffer 2004; Malik, Subramaniam, and Kaushik 2007).",
        "eResponder, the system developed by Carmel, Shtalhaim, and Soffer (2000), retrieves a list of request-response pairs and presents a ranked list of responses to the user.",
        "If the user is unsatisfied with this list, an operator is asked to generate a new response.",
        "The operator is assisted in this task by the retrieval results: The system highlights the request-relevant sentences in the ranked responses.",
        "However, there is no attempt to automatically generate a single response.",
        "Bickel and Scheffer (2004) compared the performance of document retrieval and document prediction for generating help-desk responses.",
        "Their retrieval technique, which is similar to our request-to-request Doc-Ret method, matches user questions to the questions in a database of question-answer pairs.",
        "Their prediction method, which is similar to Doc-Pred, is based on clustering the responses in the corpus into semantically equivalent answers, and then training a classifier to match a query with one of these classes.",
        "The generated response is the answer that is closest to the centroid of the cluster.",
        "Bickel and Scheffer's results are consistent with ours, in the sense that the performance of the Doc-Ret method is significantly worse than that of Doc-Pred.",
        "However, it is worth noting that their corpus is significantly smaller than ours (805 question-answer pairs), their questions seem to be much simpler and shorter than those in our corpus, and the replies shorter and more homogeneous.",
        "Malik, Subramaniam, and Kaushik (2007) developed a system that builds question-answer pairs from help-center e-mails, and then maps new questions to existing questions in order to retrieve an answer.",
        "This part of their approach resembles our Doc-Ret method, but instead of retrieving entire response documents, they retrieve individual sentences.",
        "In addition, rather than including actual response sentences in a reply, their system matches response sentences to pre-existing templates and returns the templates.",
        "Lapalme and Kosseim (2003) investigated three approaches to the automatic generation of response e-mails: text classification, case-based reasoning, and question answering.",
        "Text classification was used to group request emails into broad categories, some of which, such as requests for financial reports, can be automatically addressed.",
        "The question-answering approach and the retrieval component of the case-based reasoning approach were data driven, using word-level matches.",
        "However, the personalization component of the case-based reasoning approach was rule-based (e.g., rules were applied to substitute names of individuals and companies in texts).",
        "With respect to these systems, the contribution of our work lies in the consideration of different kinds of corpus-based approaches (namely, retrieval and prediction) applied at different levels of granularity (namely, document and sentence).",
        "Two applications that, like help-desk, deal with question-answer pairs are: summarization of email threads (Dalli, Xia, and Wilks 2004; Shrestha and McKeown 2004), and answer extraction in FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions) (Berger and Mittal 2000;",
        "Empirical Study of Response Automation Methods",
        "Berger et al.",
        "2000; Jijkoun and de Rijke 2005; Soricut and Brill 2006).",
        "An important difference between these applications and help-desk is that help-desk request emails are not simple queries.",
        "In fact, some emails do not contain any queries at all, and even if they do, it is not always straightforward to distinguish the queries from the text that provides background information.",
        "Therefore, the generation of a help-desk response needs to consider a request email in its entirety, and ensure that there is sufficient evidence to match the request with a response or parts of responses.",
        "In e-mail-thread summarization, Dalli, Xia, and Wilks (2004) applied a procedural approach where they recognized named entities and performed anaphora resolution prior to applying ranking metrics to select sentences for inclusion in a thread summary.",
        "However, their approach does not specifically address the question-answer aspect of an email thread, potentially omitting important information.",
        "This problem was addressed by Shrestha and McKeown (2004), who performed supervised learning in order to match questions with answers in email threads, as a first step in the summarization of such threads.",
        "A significant difference between our approach and theirs is in our use of unsupervised learning, which is necessitated by the size of our data set.",
        "Also, Shrestha and McKeown used high-level features for machine learning, as well as word-based features.",
        "As indicated in Section 3.2.2, our Sent-Pred experiments with high-level features (specifically syntactic features) did not improve our results.",
        "Finally, Shrestha and McKeown used paragraphs as a unit of information â€“ an approach we tried late in our project with encouraging results.",
        "This suggests that there are situations where one can generalize a response that is longer than a sentence but shorter than a whole document.",
        "Unfortunately, we could not pursue this avenue of research owing to time limitations.",
        "In FAQs, Berger and Mittal (2000) employed a sentence retrieval approach based on a language model where the entire response to an FAQ is considered a sentence, and the questions and answers are embedded in an FAQ document.",
        "They complemented this approach with machine learning techniques that automatically learn the weights of different retrieval models.",
        "Berger et al.",
        "(2000) compared two retrieval approaches (TF.IDF and query expansion) and two predictive approaches (statistical translation and latent variable models).",
        "Jijkoun and de Rijke (2005) compared different variants of retrieval techniques.",
        "Soricut and Brill (2006) compared a predictive approach (statistical translation), a retrieval approach based on a language-model, and a hybrid approach which combines statistical chunking and traditional retrieval.",
        "Two significant differences between help-desk and FAQs are the following.",
        "â€¢ The responses in the help-desk corpus are personalized, which means that on one hand, we must abstract from them sufficiently to obtain meaningful regularities, and on the other hand, we must be careful not to abstract away specific information that addresses particular issues.",
        "â€¢ Help-desk responses have much more repetition than FAQs, because the corpus is made up of individual dialogues, rather than typical request-response pairs.",
        "This motivates the use of multi-document summarization techniques, rather than question-answering approaches, to extract individual answers.",
        "These issues also differentiate the help-desk application from other types of question-answering applications, specifically those found in the field of restricted domain question answering (Molla and Vicedo 2007).",
        "In addition to the different response-generation methods, we have proposed a metalevel strategy to combine them.",
        "This kind of meta-learning is referred to as stacking by the Data Mining community (Witten and Frank 2000).",
        "Lekakos and Giaglis (2007) implemented a supervised version of this approach for a recommender system, as opposed to our unsupervised version.",
        "They also proposed two major categories of meta-learning approaches for recommender systems, merging and ensemble, each subdivided into the more specific subclasses suggested by Burke (2002) as follows.",
        "The merging category corresponds to techniques where the individual methods affect each other in different ways (this category encompasses Burke's feature combination, cascade, feature augmentation,and meta-level sub-categories).",
        "The ensemble category corresponds to techniques where the predictions of the individual methods are combined to produce a final prediction (this category encompasses Burke's weighted, switching,and mixed sub-categories).",
        "Our system falls into the ensemble category, because it combines the results of the various methods into a single outcome.",
        "More specifically, it belongs to Burke's switching sub-category, where a single method is selected on a case-by-case basis.",
        "A similar approach is taken in Rotaru and Litman's (2005) reading comprehension system, but their system does not perform any learning.",
        "Instead it uses a voting mechanism to select the answer given by the majority of methods.",
        "The question answering system developed by Chu-Carroll et al.",
        "(2003) belongs to the merging category of approaches, where the output of an individual method can be used as input to a different method (this corresponds to Burke's cascade sub-category).",
        "Because the results of all the methods are comparable, no learning is required: At each stage of the \"cascade of methods,\" the method that performs best is selected.",
        "In contrast to these two systems, our system employs methods that are not comparable, because they use different metrics.",
        "Therefore, we need to learn from experience when to use each method."

      "text": [
        "Despite its theoretical importance and commercial impact, the generation of e-mail-based help-desk responses has received scant attention to date.",
        "In this article, we have investigated complementary corpus-based, information-gathering methods for automatically addressing help-desk requests.",
        "Our results show that a large corpus of request-response email pairs supports the automation of a significant portion of the help-desk task with data-driven techniques that reuse responses or parts thereof.",
        "These techniques are particularly suitable for repetitive, non-technical issues, allowing help-desk operators to focus on more challenging, technical requests.",
        "Our results also show that different methods are applicable to different situations that arise in the help-desk domain, and that the performance of different methods varies for different data sets.",
        "This suggests that there must be an underlying relationship between methods and features of data sets that needs to be accounted for (Section 4.3).",
        "Additionally, our results yield insights regarding the following issues.",
        "â€¢ Retrieval versus prediction - Some situations warrant a retrieval approach, whereas others require a predictive approach.",
        "The former applies when the content of a request matches previous cases in the corpus.",
        "The latter applies when requests and responses do not match on content, but correlations exist between a few predictive words in a request and a response, which is often generic in these cases.",
        "A hybrid prediction-retrieval approach was also investigated.",
        "Our hybrid method",
        "Empirical Study of Response Automation Methods extracts generalizations at the sentence level, and employs a retrieval component that tailors the selection of sentences to the specific issues raised in a request e-mail.",
        "Although this appears to be a sensible approach, the results of our evaluation are not conclusive, and further investigation is required.",
        "â€¢ Levels of granularity - Although simple document-level reuse methods are sufficient in many cases, more complex sentence-level reuse methods, which involve extractive multi-document summarization, provide a viable alternative when a complete response document cannot be reused.",
        "This happens when there is insufficient evidence for the reuse of such a document, but there is enough evidence for a partial response.",
        "We have also performed a small user study, which highlighted issues regarding the evaluation of a large corpus such as ours.",
        "Despite its modest size, our user study was useful, as it provided a subjective evaluation of the methods considered, and linked the results of our automatic evaluation with these subjective assessments.",
        "Our work also provides a unified solution to help-desk response automation via the meta-learning component.",
        "Although our comparative investigation demonstrates the applicability of the different methods, the meta-learning component provides a way to automatically select a method.",
        "We have offered an unsupervised approach that learns which is the most promising method based on previous experience.",
        "It does so by learning the relationship between the value of the confidence (applicability) measure of each method and its subsequent performance.",
        "This eliminates the need to set subjective thresholds on these confidence values, and instead transfers subjective decision-making to a more intuitive part of the system, namely, the actual performance of the methods, measured by the quality of the generated responses.",
        "In this way, help-desk managers can decide how strict the system should be, for example, on the precision of responses.",
        "We are encouraged by the fact that we have achieved a reasonable level of performance using only a simple, low-level bag-of-words representation.",
        "One avenue for future research is to investigate more sophisticated representations, such as incorporating word-based similarity metrics into the bag-of-words representation, employing query expansion during retrieval, and taking into account syntactic features during retrieval and prediction (recall that we incorporated grammatical and sentence-based syntactic features into the Sent-Pred method without significantly affecting performance, Section 3).",
        "Another avenue for future research is the investigation of intermediate levels of granularity, such as paragraphs.",
        "Ideally there should be a mechanism that determines dynamically the most suitable level of granularity for capturing the regularities in a collection of e-mails.",
        "An information-theoretic approach, such as the MML criterion (Wallace and Boulton 1968; Wallace 2005), may be a promising way to address this problem."
