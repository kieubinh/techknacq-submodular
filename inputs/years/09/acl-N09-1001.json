        "There is considerable academic and commercial interest in processing subjective content in text, where subjective content refers to any expression of a private state such as an opinion or belief (Wiebe et al., 2005).",
        "Important strands of work include the identification of subjective content and the determination of its polarity, i.e. whether a favourable or unfavourable opinion is expressed.",
        "Automatic identification of subjective content often relies on word indicators, such as unigrams (Pang et al., 2002) or predetermined sentiment lex-ica (Wilson et al., 2005).",
        "Thus, the word positive in the sentence \"This deal is a positive development for our company.\"",
        "gives a strong indication that the sentence contains a favourable opinion.",
        "However, such word-based indicators can be misleading for two reasons.",
        "First, contextual indicators such as irony and negation can reverse subjectivity or polarity indications (Polanyi and Zaenen, 2004).",
        "Second, different word senses of a single word can actually be of different subjectivity or polarity.",
        "A typical subjectivity-ambiguous word, i.e. a word that has at least one subjective and at least one objective sense, is positive, as shown by the two example senses given below.",
        "(1) positive, electropositive – having a positive electric charge;\"protons are positive\" (objective)",
        "(2) plus, positive – involving advantage or good; \"a plus (or positive) factor\" (subjective)",
        "We concentrate on this latter problem by automatically creating lists of subjective senses, instead of subjective words, via adding subjectivity labels for senses to electronic lexica, using the example of WordNet.",
        "This is important as the problem of subjectivity-ambiguity is frequent: We (Su and Markert, 2008) find that over 30% of words in our dataset are subjectivity-ambiguous.",
        "Information on subjectivity of senses can also improve other tasks such as word sense disambiguation (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006).",
        "Moreover, Andreevskaia and Bergler (2006) show that the performance of automatic annotation of subjectivity at the word level can be hurt by the presence of subjectivity-ambiguous words in the training sets they use.",
        "We propose a semi-supervised approach based on minimum cut in a lexical relation graph to assign subjectivity (subjective/objective) labels to word senses.",
        "Our algorithm outperforms supervised minimum cuts and standard supervised, non-graph classification algorithms (like SVM), reducing the error rate by up to 40%.",
        "In addition, the semi-supervised approach achieves the same results as the supervised framework with less than 20% of the training data.",
        "Our approach also outperforms prior approaches to the subjectivity recognition of word senses and performs well across two different data sets.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 discusses previous work.",
        "Section 3 describes our proposed semi-supervised minimum cut framework in detail.",

        "However, Kim and Hovy (2004) and Andreevskaia and Bergler (2006) show that subjectivity recognition might be the harder problem with lower human agreement and automatic performance.",

      "text": [
        "Binary classification with minimum cuts (Mincuts) in graphs is based on the idea that similar items should be grouped in the same cut.",
        "All items in the training/test data are seen as vertices in a graph with undirected weighted edges between them specifying how strong the similarity/association between two vertices is.",
        "We use minimum s-t cuts: the graph contains two particular vertices s (source, corresponds to subjective) and t (sink, corresponds to objective) and each vertex u is connected to s and t via a weighted edge that can express how likely u is to be classified as s or t in isolation.",
        "Binary classification of the vertices is equivalent to splitting the graph into two disconnected subsets of all vertices, S and T with s e S and t e T. This corresponds to removing a set of edges from the graph.",
        "As similar items should be in the same part of the split, the best split is one which removes edges with low weights.",
        "In other words, a minimum cut problem is to find a partition of the graph which minimizes the following formula, where w(u, v) expresses the weight of an edge between two vertices.",
        "Globally optimal minimum cuts can be found in polynomial time and near-linear running time in practice, using the maximum flow algorithm (Pang and Lee, 2004; Cormen et al., 2002).",
        "We propose semi-supervised mincuts for subjectivity recognition on senses for several reasons.",
        "First, our problem satisfies two major conditions necessary for using minimum cuts.",
        "It is a binary classification problem (subjective vs. objective senses) as is needed to divide the graph into two components.",
        "Our dataset also lends itself naturally to s-t Mincuts as we have two different views on the data.",
        "Thus, the edges of a vertex (=sense) to the source/sink can be seen as the probability of a sense being subjective or objective without taking similarity to other senses into account, for example via considering only the sense gloss.",
        "In contrast, the edges between two senses can incorporate the WordNet relation hierarchy, which is a good source of similarity for our problem as many WordNet relations are subjectivity-preserving, i.e. if two senses are connected via such a relation they are likely to be both subjective or both objective.",
        "An example here is the antonym relation, where two antonyms such as good – morally admirable and evil, wicked – morally bad or wrong are both subjective.",
        "Second, Mincuts can be easily expanded into a semi-supervised framework (Blum and Chawla, 2001).",
        "This is essential as the existing labeled datasets for our problem are small.",
        "In addition, glosses are short, leading to sparse high dimensional vectors in standard feature representations.",
        "Also, WordNet connections between different parts of the WordNet hierarchy can also be sparse, leading to relatively isolated senses in a graph in a supervised framework.",
        "Semi-supervised Mincuts allow us to import unlabeled data that can serve as bridges to isolated components.",
        "More importantly, as the unla-beled data can be chosen to be related to the labeled and test data, they might help pull test data to the right cuts (categories).",
        "The formulation of our semi-supervised Mincut for sense subjectivity classification involves the following steps, which we later describe in more detail.",
        "1.",
        "We define two vertices s (source) and t (sink), which correspond to the \"subjective\" and \"objective\" category, respectively.",
        "Following the definition in Blum and Chawla (2001), we call the vertices s and t classification vertices, and all other vertices (labeled, test, and unlabeled data) example vertices.",
        "Each example vertex corresponds to one WordNet sense and is connected to both s and t via a weighted edge.",
        "The latter guarantees that the graph is connected.",
        "2.",
        "For the test and unlabeled examples, we see the edges to the classification vertices as the probability of them being subjective/objective disregarding other example vertices.",
        "We use a supervised classifier to set these edge weights.",
        "For the labeled training examples, they are connected by edges with a high constant weight to the classification vertices that they belong to.",
        "3.",
        "WordNet relations are used to construct the edges between two example vertices.",
        "Such edges can exist between any pair of example vertices, for example between two unlabeled examples.",
        "4.",
        "After graph construction we then employ a maximum-flow algorithm to find the minimum s-t cuts of the graph.",
        "The cut in which the source vertex s lies is classified as \"subjective\", and the cut in which the sink vertex t lies is \"objective\".",
        "We now describe the above steps in more detail.",
        "Selection of unlabeled data: Random selection of unlabeled data might hurt the performance of Mincuts, as they might not be related to any sense in our training/test data (denoted by A).",
        "Thus a basic principle is that the selected unlabeled senses should be related to the training/test data by WordNet relations.",
        "We therefore simply scan each sense in A, and collect all senses related to it via one of the WordNet relations in Table 1.",
        "All such senses that are not in A are collected in the unlabeled data set.",
        "Weighting of edges to the classification vertices: The edge weight to s and t represents how likely it is that an example vertex is initially put in the cut in which s (subjective) or t (objective) lies.",
        "For unlabeled and test vertices, we use a supervised classifier (SVM) with the labeled data as training data to assign the edge weights.",
        "The SVM is also used as a baseline and its features are described in Section 4.3.",
        "As we do not wish the Mincut to reverse labels of the labeled training data, we assign a high constant weight of 5 to the edge between a labeled vertex and its corresponding classification vertex, and a low weight of 0.01 to the edge to the other classification vertex.",
        "Assigning weights to WordNet relations: We connect two vertices that are linked by one of the ten WordNet relations in Table 1 via an edge.",
        "Not all WordNet relations we use are subjectivity-preserving to the same degree: for example, hy-ponyms (such as simpleton) of objective senses (such as person) do not have to be objective.",
        "However, we aim for high graph connectivity and we can assign different weights to different relations to reflect the degree to which they are subjectivity-preserving.",
        "Therefore, we experiment with two methods of weight assignment.",
        "Method 1 (NoSL) assigns the same constant weight of 1.0 to all WordNet relations.",
        "Method 2 (SL) reflects different degrees of preserving subjectivity.",
        "To do this, we adapt an unsupervised method of generating a large noisy set of subjective and objective senses from our previous work (Su and Markert, 2008).",
        "This method uses a list of subjective words (SL) to classify each WordNet sense with at least two subjective words in its gloss as subjective and all other senses as objective.",
        "We then count how often two senses related via a given relation have the same or a different subjectivity label.",
        "The weight is computed by #same/(#same+#different).",
        "Results are listed in",
        "Table 1.",
        "Example graph: An example graph is shown in Figure 1.",
        "The three example vertices correspond to the senses religious – extremely scrupulous and conscientious, scrupulous – having scruples; arising from a sense of right and wrong; principled; and flicker, spark, glint – a momentary flash of light respectively.",
        "The vertex \"scrupulous\" is unlabeled data derived from the vertex \"religious\"(a test item) by the relation \"similar-to\"."
