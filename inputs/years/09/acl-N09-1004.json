        "In many natural languages, a word can represent multiple meanings/senses, and such a word is called a homograph.",
        "Word sense disambiguation(WSD) is the process of determining which sense of a homograph is used in a given context.",
        "WSD is a long-standing problem in Computational Linguistics, and has significant impact in many real-world applications including machine translation, information extraction, and information retrieval.",
        "Generally, WSD methods use the context of a word for its sense disambiguation, and the context information can come from either annotated/unannotated text or other knowledge resources, such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), SemCor (SemCor, 2008), Open Mind Word Expert (Chklovski and Mihal-cea, 2002), extended WordNet (Moldovan and Rus, 2001), Wikipedia (Mihalcea, 2007), parallel corpora (Ng, Wang, and Chan, 2003).",
        "In (Ide and Veronis, 1998) many different WSD approaches were described.",
        "Usually, WSD techniques can be divided into four categories (Agirre and Edmonds, 2006),",
        "• Dictionary and knowledge based methods.",
        "These methods use lexical knowledge bases such as dictionaries and thesauri, and hypothesize that context knowledge can be extracted from definitions of words.",
        "For example, Lesk disambiguated two words by finding the pair of senses with the greatest word overlap in their dictionary definitions (Lesk, 1986).",
        "• Supervised methods.",
        "Supervised methods mainly adopt context to disambiguate words.",
        "A supervised method includes a training phase and a testing phase.",
        "In the training phase, a sense-annotated training corpus is required, from which syntactic and semantic features are extracted to create a classifier using machine",
        "learning techniques, such as Support Vector Machine (Novischi et al., 2007).",
        "In the following testing phase, a word is classified into senses (Mihalcea, 2002) (Ng and Lee, 1996).",
        "Currently supervised methods achieve the best disambiguation quality (about 80% precision and recall for coarse-grained WSD in the most recent WSD evaluation conference SemEval since training corpora are manually annotated and expensive, supervised methods are often brittle due to data scarcity, and it is hard to annotate and acquire sufficient contextual information for every sense of a large number of words existing in natural languages.",
        "• Semi-supervised methods.",
        "To overcome the knowledge acquisition bottleneck problem suffered by supervised methods, these methods make use of a small annotated corpus as seed data in a bootstrapping process (Hearst, 1991) (Yarowsky, 1995).",
        "A word-aligned bilingual corpus can also serve as seed data (Ng, Wang,",
        "and Chan, 2003).",
        "• Unsupervised methods.",
        "These methods acquire contextual information directly from unanno-tated raw text, and senses can be induced from text using some similarity measure (Lin, 1997).",
        "However, automatically acquired information is often noisy or even erroneous.",
        "In the most",
        "best unsupervised systems only achieved about 70% precision and 50% recall.",
        "Disambiguation of a limited number of words is not hard, and necessary context information can be carefully collected and hand-crafted to achieve high disambiguation accuracy as shown in (Yarowsky, 1995).",
        "However, such approaches suffer a significant performance drop in practice when domain or vocabulary is not limited.",
        "Such a \"cliff-style\" performance collapse is called brittleness, which is due to insufficient knowledge and shared by many techniques in Artificial Intelligence.",
        "The main challenge of a WSD system is how to overcome the knowledge acquisition bottleneck and efficiently collect the huge amount of context knowledge.",
        "More precisely, a practical WSD need figure out how to create and maintain a comprehensive, dynamic, and up-to-date context knowledge base in a highly automatic manner.",
        "The context knowledge required in WSD has the following properties:",
        "1.",
        "The context knowledge need cover a large number of words and their usage.",
        "Such a requirement of broad coverage is not trivial because a natural language usually contains thousands of words, and some popular words can have dozens of senses.",
        "For example, the Oxford English Dictionary has approximately 301,100 main entries (Oxford, 2003), and the average polysemy of the WordNet inventory is 6.18 (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "Clearly acquisition of such a huge amount of knowledge can only be achieved with automatic techniques.",
        "2.",
        "Natural language is not a static phenomenon.",
        "New usage of existing words emerges, which creates new senses.",
        "New words are created, and some words may \"die\" over time.",
        "It is estimated that every year around 2,500 new words appear in English (Kister, 1992).",
        "Such dynamics requires a timely maintenance and updating of context knowledge base, which makes manual collection even more impractical.",
        "Taking into consideration the large amount and dynamic nature of context knowledge, we only have limited options when choosing knowledge sources for WSD.",
        "WSD is often an unconscious process to human beings.",
        "With a dictionary and sample sentences/phrases an average educated person can correctly disambiguate most polysemous words.",
        "Inspired by human WSD process, we choose an electronic dictionary and unannotated text samples of word instances as context knowledge sources for our WSD system.",
        "Both sources can be automatically accessed, provide an excellent coverage of word meanings and usage, and are actively updated to reflect the current state of languages.",
        "In this paper we present a fully unsupervised WSD system, which only requires WordNet sense inventory and unannotated text.",
        "In the rest of this paper, section 2 describes how to acquire and represent the context knowledge for WSD.",

        "However, factual errors in Web pages will not hurt the performance of WSD.",

        "Based on our experience these kind of errors are negligible when using popular Web search engines to retrieve relevant Web pages.",
        "To start the acquisition process, words that need to be disambiguated are compiled and saved in a text file.",

        "API's to retrieve up to 1,000 Web pages for each to-be-disambiguated word.",
        "Collected Web pages are cleaned first, e.g., control characters and HTML tags are removed.",

        "Sentences that contain the instances of a specific word are extracted and saved into a local repository.",
        "Sentences organized according to each word are sent to a dependency parser, Minipar.",
        "Dependency parsers have been widely used in Computational Linguistics and natural language processing.",
        "An evaluation with the SUSANNE corpus shows that Minipar achieves 89% precision with respect to dependency relations (Lin, 1998).",
        "After parsing sentences are converted to parsing trees and saved in files.",
        "Neither our simple sentence segmentation approach nor Minipar parsing is 100% accurate, so a small number of invalid dependency relations may exist in parsing trees.",
        "The impact of these erroneous relations will be minimized in our WSD algorithm.",
        "Comparing with tagging or chunking, parsing is relatively expensive and time-consuming.",

        "are parsed only once to extract dependency relations, then these relations are merged and saved in a local knowledge base for the following disambiguation.",
        "Hence, parsing will not affect the speed of disambiguation at all.",
        "After parsing, dependency relations from different sentences are merged and saved in a context knowledge base.",
        "The merging process is straightforward.",
        "A dependency relation includes one head word/node and one dependent word/node.",
        "Nodes from different dependency relations are merged into one as long as they represent the same word.",
