        "A central problem in diachronic linguistics is the reconstruction of ancient languages from their modern descendants (Campbell, 1998).",
        "Here, we consider the problem of reconstructing phonological forms, given a known linguistic phylogeny and known cognate groups.",
        "For example, Figure 1 (a) shows a collection of word forms in several Oceanic languages, all meaning to cry.",
        "The ancestral form in this case has been presumed to be /tarjis/ in Blust (1993).",
        "We are interested in models which take as input many such word tuples, each representing a cognate group, along with a language tree, and induce word forms for hidden ancestral languages.",
        "The traditional approach to this problem has been the comparative method, in which reconstructions are done manually using assumptions about the relative probability of different kinds of sound change (Hock, 1986).",
        "There has been work attempting to automate part (Durham and Rogers, 1969; Eastlack, 1977; Lowe and Mazaudon, 1994; Covington, 1998;",
        "Kondrak, 2002) or all of the process (Oakes, 2000; Bouchard-Cote et al., 2008).",
        "However, previous automated methods have been unable to leverage three important ideas a linguist would employ.",
        "We address these omissions here, resulting in a more powerful method for automatically reconstructing ancient protolanguages.",
        "First, linguists triangulate reconstructions from many languages, while past work has been limited to small numbers of languages.",
        "For example, Oakes (2000) used four languages to reconstruct Proto-Malayo-Javanic (PMJ) and Bouchard-Cote et al.",
        "(2008) used two languages to reconstruct Classical Latin (La).",
        "We revisit these small datasets and show that our method significantly outperforms these previous systems.",
        "However, we also show that our method can be applied to a much larger data set (Greenhill et al., 2008), reconstructing Proto-Oceanic (POc) from 64 modern languages.",
        "In addition, performance improves with more languages, which was not the case for previous methods.",
        "Second, linguists exploit knowledge of phonological universals.",
        "For example, small changes in vowel height or consonant place are more likely than large changes, and much more likely than change to arbitrarily different phonemes.",
        "In a statistical system, one could imagine either manually encoding or automatically inferring such preferences.",
        "We show that both strategies are effective.",
        "Finally, linguists consider not only how languages change, but also how they are internally consistent.",
        "Past models described how sounds do (or, more often, do not) change between nodes in the tree.",
        "To borrow broad terminology from the Optimality Theory literature (Prince and Smolensky, 1993), such models incorporated faithfulness features, capturing the ways in which successive forms remained similar to one another.",
        "However, each language has certain regular phonotactic patterns which constrain these changes.",
        "We encode such patterns using markedness features, characterizing the internal phonotactic structure of each language.",
        "Faithfulness and markedness play roles analogous to the channel and language models of a noisy-channel system.",
        "We show that markedness features improve reconstruction, and can be used efficiently."

        "Neither approach scales well to large datasets.",
        "In the first case, the bottleneck is the complexity ofcomputing multi-alignments without guide trees and the vanishing probability that independent reconstructions agree.",
        "In the second case, the problem comes from the unregularized proliferation of parameters and slow mixing of the inference algorithm.",
        "For this reason, we built a third baseline that scales well in large datasets.",
        "This third baseline, centroid, computes the centroid of the observed word forms in Leven-shtein distance.",
        "Let L(x,y) denote the Lev-enshtein distance between word forms x and y.",
        "Ideally, we would like the baseline to return argminx€St y€O L(x,y), where O = (y1;... ,y|O|} is the set of observed word forms.",
        "Note that the optimum is not changed if we restrict the minimization to be taken on x £ £(O)* such that m < |x| < M where m = min |yi|,M = maxj |yj| and £(O) is the set of characters occurring in O.",
        "Even with this restriction, this optimization is intractable.",
        "As an approximation, we considered only strings built by at most k contiguous substrings taken from the word forms in O.",
        "If k = 1, then it is equivalent to taking the min over x £ O.",
        "At the other end of the spectrum, if k = M, it is exact.",
        "This scheme is exponential in k, but since words are relatively short, we found that k = 2 often finds the same solution as higher values of k. The difference was in all the cases not statistically significant, so we report the approximation k = 2 in what follows.",
        "We also compared against an oracle, denoted ORACLE, which returns argminy€OL(y, x*), where x* is the target reconstruction.",

        "This is superior to picking a single closest language to be used for all word forms, but it is possible for systems to perform better than the oracle since it has to return one of the observed word forms.",

        "The PMJ dataset was compiled by Nothofer (1975), who also reconstructed the corresponding protolanguage.",
        "Since PRAGUE is not guaranteed to return a reconstruction for each cognate set, only 55 word forms could be directly compared to our system.",
        "We restricted comparison to this subset of the data.",
        "This favors PRAGUE since the system only proposes a reconstruction when it is certain.",
        "Still, our system outperformed PRAGUE, with an average distance of 1.60 compared to 2.02 for PRAGUE.",
        "The difference is marginally significant, p = 0.06, partly due to the small number of word forms involved.",
        "We also exceeded the performance of bclkg on the Romance dataset.",

        "However, this difference was not significant (p = 0.15).",
        "We think this is because of the high level of noise in the data (the Romance dataset is the only dataset we consider that was automatically constructed rather than curated by linguists).",
        "A second factor contributing to this small difference may be that the the experimental setup of bclkg used very few languages, while the performance of our system improves markedly with more languages.",
