        "An attractive property of probabilistic grammars is that they permit the use of well-understood parameter estimation methods for learning – both from labeled and unlabeled data.",
        "Here we tackle the unsupervised grammar learning problem, specifically for unlexicalized context-free dependency grammars, using an empirical Bayesian approach with a novel family of priors.",
        "There has been an increased interest recently in employing Bayesian modeling for probabilistic grammars in different settings, ranging from putting priors over grammar probabilities (Johnson et al., 2007) to putting non-parametric priors over derivations (Johnson et al., 2006) to learning the set of states in a grammar (Finkel et al., 2007; Liang et al., 2007).",

        "Because probabilistic grammars are built out of multinomial distributions, the Dirichlet family (or, more precisely, a collection of Dirichlets) is a natural candidate for probabilistic grammars because of its conjugacy to the multinomial family.",
        "Conjugacy implies a clean form for the posterior distribution over grammar probabilities (given the data and the prior), bestowing computational tractability.",

        "Second, from the experimental perspective, we show how such flexibility in parameter tying can help in unsupervised grammar learning in the well-known monolingual setting and in a new bilingual setting where grammars for two languages are learned at once (without parallel corpora).",
        "Our method is based on a distribution which we call the shared logistic normal distribution, which is a distribution over a collection of multinomials from different probability simplexes.",
        "We provide a variational EM algorithm for inference.",

        "(2008) in our experiments also described in §3.1.",
        "For each treebank, we divide the tags into twelve disjoint tag families.The covariance matrices for all dependency distributions were initialized with 1 on the diagonal, 0.5 between tags which belong to the same family, and 0 otherwise.",
        "This initializer has been shown to be more successful than an identity covariance matrix.",
        "We begin our experiments with a monolingual setting, where we learn grammars for English and Chinese (separately) using the settings described above.",
        "The attachment accuracy for this set of experiments is described in Table 1.",
        "The baselines include right attachment (where each word is attached to the word to its right), MLE via EM (Klein and Manning, 2004), and empirical Bayes with Dirichlet and LN priors (Cohen et al., 2008).",
        "We also include a \"ceiling\" (DMV trained using supervised MLE from the training sentences' trees).",
        "For English, we see that tying nouns, verbs or adjectives improves performance compared to the LN baseline.",
        "Tying both nouns and verbs improves performance a bit more.",
        "Table 1: Attachment accuracy of different models, on test data from the Penn Treebank and the Chinese Treebank of varying levels of difficulty imposed through a length filter.",
        "Attach-Right attaches each word to the word on its right and the last word to $.",
        "Bold marks best overall accuracy per length bound, and | marks figures that are not significantly worse (binomial sign test, p < 0.05).",
        "Leveraging information from one language for the task of disambiguating another language has received considerable attention (Dagan, 1991; Smith and Smith, 2004; Snyder and Barzilay, 2008; Bur-kett and Klein, 2008).",
        "Usually such a setting requires a parallel corpus or other annotated data that ties between those two languages.",
        "Our bilingual experiments use the English and Chinese treebanks, which are not parallel corpora, to train parsers for both languages jointly.",
        "Sharing information between those two models is done by softly tying grammar weights in the two hidden grammars.",
        "We first merge the models for English and Chinese by taking a union of the multinomial families of each and the corresponding prior parameters.",
        "We then add a normal expert that ties between the parts of speech in the respective partition structures for both grammars together.",
        "Parts of speech are matched through the single coarse tagset (footnote 4).",
        "For example, with TI EV, let V = VEng U Vchi be the set of part-of-speech tags which belong to the verb category for either treebank.",
        "Then, we tie parameters for all part-of-speech tags in V. We tested this joint model for each of TIEV, TIEN, TIEV&N, and TIEA.",
        "After running the inference algorithm which learns the two models jointly, we use unseen data to test each learned model separately.",
        "Table 1 includes the results for these experiments.",
        "The performance on English improved significantly in the bilingual setting, achieving highest performance with TIEV&N. Performance with Chinese is also the highest in the bilingual setting, with TIEA and TIEV&N."
