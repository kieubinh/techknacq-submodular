        "In this paper we investigate the problem of unsupervised part-of-speech tagging when unannotated parallel data is available in a large number of languages.",
        "Our goal is to develop a fully joint multilingual model that scales well and shows improved performance for individual languages as the total number of languages increases.",
        "Languages exhibit ambiguity at multiple levels, making unsupervised induction of their underlying structure a difficult task.",
        "However, sources of linguistic ambiguity vary across languages.",
        "For example, the word fish in English can be used as either a verb or a noun.",
        "In French, however, the noun poisson (fish) is entirely distinct from the verbal form pecher (to fish).",
        "Previous work has leveraged this idea by building models for unsupervised learning from aligned bilingual data (Snyder et al., 2008).",
        "However, aligned data is often available for many languages.",
        "The benefits of bilingual learning vary markedly depending on which pair of languages is selected, and without labeled data it is unclear how to determine which supplementary language is most helpful.",
        "In this paper, we show that it is possible to leverage all aligned languages simultaneously, achieving accuracy that in most cases outperforms even optimally chosen bilingual pairings.",
        "Even in expressing the same meaning, languages take different syntactic routes, leading to variation in part-of-speech sequences.",
        "Therefore, an effective multilingual model must accurately model common linguistic structure, yet remain flexible to the idiosyncrasies of each language.",
        "This tension only becomes stronger as additional languages are added to the mix.",
        "From a computational standpoint, the main challenge is to ensure that the model scales well as the number of languages increases.",
        "Care must be taken to avoid an exponential increase in the parameter space as well as the time complexity of inference procedure.",
        "We propose a non-parametric Bayesian model for joint multilingual tagging.",
        "The topology of our model connects tagging decisions within a language as well as across languages.",
        "The model scales linearly with the number of languages, allowing us to incorporate as many as are available.",
        "For each language, the model contains an HMM-like substructure and connects these substructures to one another by means of cross-lingual latent variables.",
        "These variables, which we refer to as superlingual tags, capture repeated multilingual patterns and thus reduce the overall uncertainty in tagging decisions.",
        "We evaluate our model on a parallel corpus of eight languages.",
        "The model is trained once using all languages, and its performance is tested separately for each on a held-out monolingual test set.",
        "When a complete tag lexicon is provided, our unsupervised model achieves an average accuracy of 95%, in comparison to 91% for an unsupervised monolingual Bayesian HMM and 97.4% for its supervised counterpart.",
        "Thus, on average, the gap between unsupervised and supervised monolingual performance is cut by nearly two thirds.",
        "We also examined scenarios where the tag lexicon is reduced in size.",
        "In all cases, the multilingual model yielded substantial performance gains.",
        "Finally, we examined the performance of our model when trained on all possible subsets of the eight languages.",
        "We found that performance improves steadily as the number of available languages increases."

        "Bilingual Part-of-Speech Tagging Early work on multilingual tagging focused on projecting annotations from an annotated source language to a target language (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001; Feldman et al., 2006).",
        "In contrast, we assume no labeled data at all; our unsupervised model instead symmetrically improves performance for all languages by learning cross-lingual patterns in raw parallel data.",
        "An additional distinction is that projection-based work utilizes pairs of languages, while our approach allows for continuous improvement as languages are added to the mix.",
        "In recent work, Snyder et al.",
        "(2008) presented a model for unsupervised part-of-speech tagging trained from a bilingual parallel corpus.",
        "This bilingual model and the model presented here share a number of similarities: both are Bayesian graphical models building upon hidden Markov models.",
        "However, the bilingual model explicitly joins each aligned word-pair into a single coupled state.",
        "Thus, the state-space of these joined nodes grows exponentially in the number of languages.",
        "In addition, crossing alignments must be removed so that the resulting graph structure remains acyclic.",
        "In contrast, our multilingual model posits latent cross-lingual tags without explicitly joining or directly connecting the part-of-speech tags across languages.",
        "Besides permitting crossing alignments, this structure allows the model to scale gracefully with the number of languages.",
        "Beyond Bilingual Learning While most work on multilingual learning focuses on bilingual analysis, some models operate on more than one pair of languages.",
        "For instance, Genzel (2005) describes a method for inducing a multilingual lexicon from a group of related languages.",
        "His model first induces bilingual models for each pair of languages and then combines them.",
        "Our work takes a different approach by simultaneously learning from all languages, rather than combining bilingual results.",
        "A related thread of research is multi-source machine translation (Och and Ney, 2001; Utiyama and Isahara, 2006; Cohn and Lapata, 2007) where the goal is to translate from multiple source languages to a single target language.",
        "Rather than jointly training all the languages together, these models train bilingual models separately, and then use their output to select a final translation.",
        "The selection criterion can be learned at training time since these models have access to the correct translation.",
        "In unsupervised settings, however, we do not have a principled means for selecting among outputs of different bilingual models.",
        "By developing a joint multilingual model we can automatically achieve performance that rivals that of the best bilingual pairings."

        "The core idea of our model is that patterns of ambiguity vary across languages and therefore even unannotated multilingual data can serve as a learning signal.",

        "This goal is achieved by designing a single graphical model that connects tagging decisions within a language as well as across languages.",

        "Edges radiate outward from superlingual tags to language-specific part-of-speech nodes.",

        "See Figure 1 for an example structure.",
        "The particular model structure for each set of parallel sentences (i.e. the configuration of superlingual tags and their edges) is determined by bilingual lexical alignments and – like the text itself – is considered an observed variable.",

        "Our model design has several benefits.",
        "Crossing and many-to-many alignments may be used without creating cycles in the graph, as all cross-lingual information emanates from the hidden superlingual tags.",
        "Furthermore, the model scales gracefully with the number of languages, as the number of new edges and nodes will be proportional to the number of words for each additional language.",
        "Each superlingual tag value specifies a set of distributions – one for each language's part-of-speech tagset.",
        "In order to learn repeated cross-lingual patterns, we need to constrain the number of superlingual tag values and thus the number of distributions they provide.",
        "For example, we might allow the superlingual tags to take on integer values from 1 to K, with each integer value indexing a separate set of distributions.",
        "Each set of distributions should correspond to a discovered cross-lingual pattern in the data.",
        "For example, one set of distributions might favor nouns in each language and another might favor verbs.",
        "Rather than fixing the number of superlingual tag values to an arbitrary and predetermined size 1,..., K, we allow them to range over the entire set of integers.",
        "In order to encourage the desired multilingual clustering behavior, we use a Dirichlet process prior for the superlingual tags.",

        "The two sequences (wf,..., wfn), (w2^,..., w2n)... and n1,n2 ... now define the distribution over superlingual tags and their associated distributions on parts-of-speech.",
        "That is, each superlingual tag z G N is drawn with probability nz, and indexes the set of distributions (wZ,..., wZn).",

        "For each such node there may be multiple incoming edges.",
        "There will always be an incoming transition edge from the previous tag (in the same language).",
        "In addition, there may be incoming edges from zero or more superlingual tags.",
        "Each edge carries with it a distribution over parts-of-speech and these distributions must be combined into the single distribution from which the tag is ultimately drawn.",

        "We provide results for three scenarios.",
        "In the first case, a tag dictionary is provided for all words, limiting them to a restricted set of possible tags.",
        "In the other two scenarios, dictionary entries are limited to words that appear more than five or ten times in the corpus.",
        "All other words can be assigned any tag, increasing the overall difficulty of the task.",
        "In the full lexicon scenario, our model achieves an average tagging accuracy of 95%, compared to 91% for the monolingual baseline and 93.2% for the bilingual baseline when averaged over all pairings.",
        "This accuracy (95%) comes close to the performance of the bilingual model when the best pairing for each language is chosen by an oracle (95.4%).",
        "This demonstrates that our multilingual model is able to effectively learn from all languages.",
        "In the two reduced lexicon scenarios, the gains are even more striking.",
        "In both cases the average multilingual performance outpaces even the best performing pairs.",
        "Looking at individual languages, we see that in all three scenarios, Czech, Estonian, Romanian, and Slovene show their best performance with the multilingual model.",
        "Bulgarian and Serbian, on the other hand, give somewhat better performance with their optimal pairings under the bilingual model, but their multilingual performance remains higher than their average bilingual results.",
        "The performance of English under the multilingual model is somewhat lower, especially in the full lexicon scenario, where it drops below monolingual performance.",
        "One possible explanation for this decrease lies in the fact that English, by far, has the lowest trigram tag entropy of all eight languages (Snyder et al., 2008).",
        "It is possible, therefore, that the signal it should be getting from its own transitions is being drowned out by less reliable information from other languages.",
        "In order to test the performance of our model as the number of languages increases, we ran the full lexicon experiment with all possible subsets of the eight languages.",
        "Figure 2 plots the average accuracy as the number of languages varies.",
        "For comparison, the monolingual and average bilingual baseline results are given, along with supervised monolingual performance.",
        "Our multilingual model steadily gains in accuracy as the number of available languages in-",
        "Figure 2: Performance of the multilingual model as the number of languages varies.",
        "Performance of the monolingual and average bilingual baselines as well as a supervised monolingual performance are given for comparison.",
        "creases.",
        "Interestingly, it even outperforms the bilingual baseline (by a small margin) when only two languages are available, which may be attributable to the more flexible non-parametric dependencies employed here.",
        "Finally, notice that the gap between monolingual supervised and unsupervised performance is cut by nearly two thirds under the unsupervised multilingual model."
