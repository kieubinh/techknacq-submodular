        "They offer what they call a \"harmonic initializer\" which initializes the attachment probabilities to favor arguments that appear more closely in the data.",
        "This starts EM in a state preferring shorter attachments.",
        "Since our goal is to expand the model to incorporate lexical information, we want an initialization scheme which does not depend on the details of DMV.",
        "The method we use is to create M sets of B random initial settings and to run VB some small number of iterations (40 in all our experiments) for each initial setting.",
        "For each of the M sets, the model with the best free energy of the B runs is then run out until convergence (as measured by likelihood of a held-out data set); the other models are pruned away.",
        "In this paper we use B = 20 and M = 50.",
        "For the bth setting, we draw a random sample from the prior 9(b).",
        "We set the initial Q(t) = P(t\\s,9(b)) which can be calculated using the Expectation-Maximization E-Step.",
        "Q(9) is then initialized using the standard VB M-step.",
        "For the Lexicalized-EVG, we modify this procedure slightly, by first running MB smoothed EVG models for 40 iterations each and selecting the best model in each cohort as before; each L-EVG distribution is initialized from its corresponding EVG distribution.",

        "We present a smoothing technique for unsupervised PCFG estimation which allows us to explore more sophisticated dependency grammars.",
        "Our method combines linear interpolation with a Bayesian prior that ensures the backoff distribution receives probability mass.",
        "Estimating the smoothed model requires running the standard Variational Bayes on an extended PCFG.",
        "We used this technique to estimate a series of dependency grammars which extend DMV with additional valence and lexical information.",
        "We found that both were helpful in learning English dependency grammars.",
        "Our L-EVG model gives the best reported accuracy to date on the WSJ10 corpus.",
        "Future work includes using lexical information more deeply in the model by conditioning argument words and valence on the lexical head.",
        "We suspect that successfully doing so will require using much larger datasets.",
        "We would also like to explore using our smoothing technique in other models such as HMMs.",
        "For instance, we could do unsupervised HMM part-of-speech induction by smooth a tritag model with a bitag model.",
        "Finally, we would like to learn the parts-of-speech in our dependency model from text and not rely on the gold-standard tags."
