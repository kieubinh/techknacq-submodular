        "We have introduced context-dependent Model 1 and HMM alignment models, which use context information in the source language to improve estimates of word-to-word translation probabilities.",
        "Estimation of parameters using these contexts without smoothing leads to data sparsity problems; therefore we have developed decision tree clustering algorithms to cluster source word contexts based on optimisation of the EM auxiliary function.",
        "Context information is incorporated by the use of part-of-speech tags in both languages of the parallel text, and the EM algorithm is used for parameter estimation.",
        "We have shown that these improvements to the model lead to decreased AER compared to context-independent models.",
        "Finally, we compare machine translation systems built using our context-dependent alignments.",
        "For both Arabic-and Chinese-to-English translation, we report an increase in translation quality measured by BLEU score compared to a system built using context-independent alignments.",
        "This paper describes an initial investigation into context-sensitive alignment models, and there are many possible directions for future research.",
        "Clustering the probability distributions of infrequently occurring may produce improvements in alignment quality, different model training schemes and extensions of the context-dependence to more sophisticated alignment models will be investigated.",
        "Further translation experiments will be carried out."
