        "Current phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) systems commonly operate at the sentence level – each sentence is translated in isolation, even when the test data consists of internally coherent paragraphs or stories, such as news articles.",
        "For each sentence, SMT systems choose the translation hypothesis that maximizes a combined log-linear model score, which is computed independently of all other sentences, using globally optimized combination weights.",
        "Thus, similar input strings may be translated in very different ways, depending on which component model happens to dominate the combined score for that sentence.",
        "This is illustrated by the following example (from the IWSLT 2007",
        "Arabic-English translation task):",
        "Source 1: Asf lA ymknk *lk hnAk klfp HwAly vmAnyn dwlAr lAlsAEp AlwAHdp Ref: sorry you can't there is a cost the charge is eighty dollars per hour 1-best: i'm sorry you can't there in the cost about eighty dollars for a one o'clock Source 2: E*rA lA ymknk t$gyl AltlfAz HtY tqlE AlTA}rp Ref: sorry you cannot turn the tv on until the plane has taken off 1-best: excuse me i you turn tv until the plane departs",
        "The phrase lA ymknk (you may not/you cannot) is translated differently (and wrongly in the second case) due to different segmentations and phrase translations chosen by the decoder.",
        "Though different choices may be sometimes appropriate, the lack of constraints enforcing translation consistency often leads to suboptimal translation performance.",
        "It would be desirable to counter this effect by encouraging similar outputs for similar inputs (under a suitably defined notion of similarity, which may include e.g. a context specification for the phrase/sentence).",
        "In machine learning, the idea of forcing the outputs of a statistical learner to vary smoothly with the underlying structure of the inputs has been formalized in the graph-based learning (GBL) framework.",
        "In GBL, both labeled (train) and unlabeled (test) data samples are jointly represented as vertices in a graph whose edges encode pairwise similarities between samples.",
        "Various learning algorithms can be applied to assign labels to the test samples while en-swing that the classification output varies smoothly along the manifold defined by the graph.",
        "GBL has been successfully applied to a range of problems in computer vision, computational biology, and natural language processing.",
        "However, in most cases, the learning tasks consisted of unstructured classification, where the input was represented by fixed-length feature vectors and the output was one of a finite set of discrete labels.",
        "In machine translation, by contrast, both inputs and outputs consist of word strings of variable length, and the number of possible outputs is not fixed and practically unlimited.",
        "In this paper we propose a new graph-based learning algorithm with structured inputs and outputs to improve consistency in phrase-based statistical machine translation.",
        "We define a joint similarity graph over training and test data and use an iterative label propagation procedure to regress a scoring function over the graph.",
        "The resulting scores for unlabeled samples (translation hypotheses) are then combined with standard model scores in a log-linear translation model for the purpose of reranking.",
        "Our contributions are twofold.",
        "First, from a machine translation perspective, we design and evaluate a global consistency model enforcing that similar inputs receive similar translations.",
        "Second, from a machine learning perspective, we apply graph-based learning to a task with structured inputs and outputs, which is a novel contribution in itself since previous applications of GBL have focused on predicting categorical labels.",
        "We evaluate our approach on two machine translation tasks, the IWSLT 2007 Italian-to-English and Arabic-to-English tasks, and demonstrate significant improvements over the baseline."

        "Our goal is to exploit graph-based learning for improving consistency in statistical phrase-based machine translation.",
        "Intuitively, a set of similar source sentences should receive similar target-language translations.",
        "This means that similarities between training and test sentences should be taken into account, but also similarities between different test sentences, which is a source ofinformation currently not exploited by standard SMT systems.",
        "To this end we define a graph over the training and test sets with edges between test and training sentences as well as between different test sentences.",
        "In cases where a test sentence does not have any connections to training sentences but is connected to other test sentences, helpful information about preferred translations can be propagated via these edges.",
        "As mentioned above, the problem of machine translation does not neatly fit into the standard GBL framework.",
        "Given that our samples consist of variable-length word strings instead of feature vectors, the standard cosine or Euclidean-distance based similarity measures cannot be used meaningfully, and the number of possible \"labels\" – correct translations – is unbounded and practically very large.",
        "We thus need to modify both the graph construction and the label propagation algorithms.",
        "First, we handle the problem of unlimited outputs by applying GBL to rescoring only.",
        "In most SMT systems, an N-best list (generated by a first decoding pass) approximates the search space of good hypotheses reasonably well, provided N is large enough.",
        "For all hypotheses of all sentences in the test set (set we denote with H), the system learns a ranking function r : H – [0,1].",
        "Larger values of r indicate better hypotheses.",
        "The corresponding loss functional is",
        "L(r) measures the smoothness of r over the graph by penalizing highly similar clusters of nodes that have a high variance of r (in other words, similar input sentences that have very different translations).",
        "The smaller L(r), the \"smoother\" r is over the graph.",
        "Thus, instead of directly learning a classification function, we learn a regression function – similar to (Goldberg and Zhu, 2006) – that is then used for ranking the hypotheses.",
        "Each graph node represents a sentence pair (consisting of source and target strings), and edge weights represent the combined similarity scores computed from comparing both the source sides and target sides of a pair of nodes.",

        "The synthetic nodes and edges need to be added to prevent the label propagation algorithm from converging to the trivial solution that assigns r = 1 to all points in the graph.",
        "This choice is theoretically motivated – a similarity graph for regression should have not only \"sources\" (good nodes with high value of r) but also \"sinks\" (counterparts for the sources).",
        "Figure 1 illustrates the connections of a test node.",
        "Similarity Measure The similarity measure used for comparing source and target sides is of prime importance, as it determines the structure of the graph.",
        "This has consequences for both computational efficiency (denser graphs require more computation and memory) and the accuracy of the outcome.",
        "A low similarity threshold results in a rich graph with a large number of edges but possibly introduces noise.",
        "A higher threshold leads to a small graph emphasizing highly similar samples but with too many disconnected components.",
        "The similarity measure is also the means by which domain knowledge can be incorporated into the graph construction process.",
        "Similarity may be defined at the level of surface word strings, but may also include linguistic information such as morphological features, part-of-speech tags, or syntactic structures.",
        "Here, we compare two similarity measures: the familiar BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002) and a score based on string kernels.",
        "In using BLEU we treat each sentence as a complete document.",
        "BLEU is not symmetric – when comparing two sentences, different results are obtained depending on which one is considered the reference and which one is the hypothesis.",
        "For computing similarities between train and test translations, we use the train translation as the reference.",
        "For computing similarity between two test hypotheses, we compute BLEU in both directions and take the average.",
        "We note that more appropriate distance measures are certainly possible.",
        "Many previous studies, such as (Callison-Burch et al., 2006), have pointed out drawbacks of BLEU, and any other similarity measure could be utilized instead.",
        "In particular, similarity measures that model aspects of sentences that are ill handled by standard phrase-based decoders (such as syntactic structure or semantic information) could be useful here.",
        "A more general way of computing similarity between strings is provided by string kernels (Lodhi et al., 2002; Rousu and Shawe-Taylor, 2005), which have been extensively used in bioinformatics and email spam detection.",
        "String kernels map strings into a feature space defined by all possible substrings of the string up a fixed length k, and computing the dot product between the resulting feature vectors.",
        "Several variants of basic string kernels exist, notably those allowing gaps or mismatches, and efficient implementations have been devised even for large scale applications.",
        "Formally, we define a sentence s as a concatenation of symbols from a finite alphabet £ (the vocabulary of the language) and an embedding function from strings to feature vectors, 0 : £* – H. A kernel function K(s,t) computes the distance between the resulting vectors for two sentences s and t. In our case, the embedding function is defined as where k is the maximum length of substrings, |i| is the length of i, and A is a penalty parameter for each gap encountered in the substring.",
        "K is defined as where w is a weight dependent on the length of the substring u.",
        "Finally, the kernel score is normalized by \\jK(s,s) ■ JC(t,t) to discourage long sentences from being favored.",
        "Thus, our similarity measure is a gapped, normalized string kernel, which is a more general measure than BLEU in that is considers noncontiguous substrings.",
        "We use a dynamic programming implementation of string kernels (Rousu and Shawe-Taylor, 2005).",
        "For the combination of source-side and targetside similarity scores (the function we denoted as k) we test two simple schemes, using either the geometric or the arithmetic mean of the individual scores.",
        "In the first case, large edge weights only result when both source and target are close to each other; the latter may produce high edge weights when only one of them (typically the source score) is high.",
        "More sophisticated combination schemes, using e.g. weighted combination, could be used but were not investigated in this study.",
        "Scalability Poor scalability is often mentioned as a drawback of graph-based learning.",
        "Straightforward implementations of GBL algorithms often represent the joint training and test data in working memory and therefore do not scale well to large data sets.",
        "However, we have developed several techniques to improve scalability without impeding accuracy.",
        "First, we construct separate graphs for each test sentence without losing global connectivity information.",
        "The graph for a test sentence is computed as the transitive closure of the edge set E over the nodes containing all hypotheses for that test sentence.",
        "This smaller graph does not affect the outcome of the learning process for the chosen sentence because in label propagation the learned value r(xi) can be influenced by that of another node xj if and only if xj is reachable from xi.",
        "In the worst theoretical case, the transitive closure could comprehend the entire graph, but in practice the edge set is never that dense and can be easily pruned based on the heuristic that faraway nodes connected through low-weight edges have less influence on the result.",
        "We use a simple embodiment of this heuristic in a work-list approach: starting from the nodes of interest (hypotheses for the focal sentence), we expand the closure starting with the direct neighbors, which have the largest influence; then add their neighbors, which have less influence, and so forth.",
        "A threshold on the number of added vertices limits undue expansion while capturing either the entire closure or a good approximation of it.",
        "Another practical computational advantage of portioning work is that graphs for different hypothesis sets can be trivially created and used in parallel, whereas distributing large matrix-vector multiplication is much more difficult (Choi, 1998).",
        "The disadvantage is that overall",
        "Figure 1: Connections for hypothesis node xh.",
        "Similarity edges with weights Wth link the node with train sentences xt, for which r(xt ) = 1.",
        "For each of these edges we define a dissimilarity edge of weight 1 - Wth, linking the node with node xXt for which r(x't ) =0.",
        "The vertex is also connected to other test vertices (the dotted edges).",
        "redundant computations are being made: incomplete estimates of r are computed for the ancillary nodes in the transitive closure and then discarded.",
        "Second, we obtain a reduction in graph size of orders of magnitude by collapsing all training vertices of the same r that are connected to the same test vertex into one and sum the edge weights.",

        "The new baseline performance (shown in Table 4) is much better than before, due to the improved training data.",
        "We then added GBL to this system by keeping the model combination weights trained for the previous system, using the N-best lists generated by the new system, and using the combined train+dev07 set as a train set for selecting similar sentences.",
        "We used the GBL parameters that yielded the best performance in the experiments described above.",
        "As can be seen from Table 4, GBL again yields an improvement of up to 1.2% absolute in both BLEU and PER.",
        "For the AE task we used 9 = 0.5; however, this threshold was not tuned extensively.",
        "Results using BLEU similarity are shown in Table 5.",
        "The best result on the eval set yields an improvement of 1.2 BLEU points though only 0.2% reduction in PER.",
        "Overall, results seem to vary with parameter settings and nature of the test set (e.g. on dev5, used as a test set, not for optimization, a surprisingly larger improvement in BLEU of 2.7 points is obtained!",
        ").",
        "Overall, sentence similarities were observed to be lower for this task.",
        "One reason may be that the AE system includes statistical tokenization ofthe source side, which is itself error-prone in that it can split the same word in different ways depending on the context.",
        "Since our similarity measure is word-based, this may cause similar sentences to fall below the threshold.",
        "The string kernel does not yield any improvement over the BLEU-based similarity measure on this task.",

        "We have presented a graph-based learning scheme to implement a consistency model for SMT that encourages similar inputs to receive similar outputs.",
        "Evaluation on two small-scale translation tasks showed significant improvements of up to 2.6 points in BLEU and 2.8% PER.",
        "Future work will include testing different graph construction schemes, in particular better parameter optimization approaches and better string similarity measures.",
        "More gains can be expected when using better domain knowledge in constructing the string kernels.",
        "This may include e.g. similarity measures that accommodate POS tags or morphological features, or comparisons of the syntax trees of parsed sentence.",
        "The latter could be quite easily incorporated into a string kernel or the related tree kernel similarity measure.",
