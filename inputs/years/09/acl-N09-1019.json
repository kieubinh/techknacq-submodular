        "Named entity clustering is a classic task in NLP, and one for which both supervised and semi-supervised systems have excellent performance (Mikheev et al., 1998; Chinchor, 1998).",
        "In this paper, we describe a fully unsupervised system (using no \"seed rules\" or initial heuristics); to our knowledge this is the best such system reported on the MUC-7 dataset.",
        "In addition, the model clusters the words which appear in named entities, discovering groups of words with similar roles such as first names and types of organization.",
        "Finally, the model defines a notion of consistency between different references to the same entity; this component of the model yields a significant increase in performance.",
        "The main motivation for our system is the recent success of unsupervised generative models for coreference resolution.",
        "The model of Haghighi and Klein (2007) incorporated a latent variable for named entity class.",
        "They report a named entity score of 61.2 percent, well above the baseline of 46.4, but still far behind existing named-entity systems.",
        "We suspect that better models for named entities could aid in the coreference task.",
        "The easiest way to incorporate a better model is simply to run a supervised or semi-supervised system as a preprocess.",
        "To perform joint inference, however, requires an unsupervised generative model for named entities.",
        "As far as we know, this work is the best such model.",
        "Named entities also pose another problem with the Haghighi and Klein (2007) coreference model; since it models only the heads of NPs, it will fail to resolve some references to named entities: (\"Ford Motor Co.\", \"Ford\"), while erroneously merging others: (\"Ford Motor Co.\", \"Lockheed Martin Co.\").",
        "Ng (2008) showed that better features for matching named entities-exact string match and an \"alias detector\" looking for acronyms, abbreviations and name variants-improve the model's performance substantially.",
        "Yet building an alias detector is non-trivial (Uryupina, 2004).",
        "English speakers know that \"President Clinton\" is the same person as \"Bill Clinton\" , not \"President Bush\".",
        "But this cannot be implemented by simple substring matching.",
        "It requires some concept of the role of each word in the string.",
        "Our model attempts to learn this role information by clustering the words within named entities."

        "Co-training (Riloff and Jones, 1999; Collins and Singer, 1999) begins with a small set of labeling heuristics and gradually adds examples to the training data.",
        "Various co-training approaches presented in Collins and Singer (1999) all score about 91% on a dataset of named entities; the inital labels were assigned using 7 handwritten seed rules.",

        "Like Collins and Singer (1999), we assume that the named entities have already been correctly extracted from the text, and our task is merely to label them.",
        "We assume that all entities fit into one of the three MUC-7 categories, LOC (locations), ORG (organizations), and PER (people).",
        "This is an oversimplification; Collins and Singer (1999) show that about 12% of examples do not fit into these categories.",
        "However, while using the MUC-7 data, we have no way to evaluate on such examples.",
        "As a framework for our models, we adopt adaptor grammars (Johnson et al., 2007), a framework for non-parametric Bayesian inference over context-free grammars.",
        "Although our system does not require the full expressive power of PCFGs, the adaptor grammar framework allows for easy development of structured priors, and supplies a flexible generic inference algorithm.",
        "An adaptor grammar is a hierarchical Pitman-Yor process (Pitman and Yor, 1997).",
        "The grammar has two parts: a base PCFG and a set of adapted nonterminals.",
        "Each adapted nonterminal is a Pitman-Yor process which expands either to a previously used subtree or to a sample from the base PCFG.",
        "The end result is a posterior distribution over PCFGs and over parse trees for each example in our dataset.",
        "Each of our models is an adaptor grammar based on a particular base PCFG where the top nonterminal of each parse tree represents a named entity class.",
        "We begin our analysis by reducing each named-entity reference to the contiguous substring of Word ^ Bill...",

        "(Parentheses) mark optional nonterminals.",
        "*Starred nonterminals are adapted.",
        "proper nouns which surrounds its head, which we call the core (Figure 1).",
        "To analyze the core, we use a grammar with three main symbols (NEx), one for each named entity class x.",
        "Each class has an associated set of lexical symbols, which occur in a strict order (NEX is the ith symbol for class x).",
        "We can think of the NEi as the semantic parts of a proper name; for people, NE°PER might generate titles and NE Per first names.",
        "Each NEi is adapted, and can expand to any string of words; the ability to generate multiple words from a single symbol is useful both because it can learn to group collocations like \"New York\" and because it allows the system to handle entities longer than four words.",
        "However, we set the prior on multi-word expansions very low, to avoid degenerate solutions where most phrases are analyzed with a single symbol.",
        "The system learns a separate probability for each ordered subset of the NEi (for instance the rule NEo – NEo NEo NE), so that it can represent constraints on possible references; for instance, a last name can occur on its own, but not a title.",
        "This system captures some of our intuitions about core phrases, but not all: our representation for \"Bill Clinton\" does not share any information with \"President Bill Clinton\" except the named-entity class.",
        "To remedy this, we introduce a set of \"entity\" nonterminals Ek, which enforce a weak notion of consistency.",
        "We follow Charniak (2001) in assuming that two names are consistent (can be references to the same entity) if they do not have different expansions for any lexical symbol.",

        "The resulting grammar is shown in Figure 2; the prior parameters for the entity-specific symbols Elxkare fixed so that, with overwhelming probability, only one expansion occurs.",
        "We can represent any fixed number of entities Ek with a standard adaptor grammar, but since we do not know the correct number, we must extend the adaptor model slightly to allow for an unbounded number.",
        "We generate the Ek from a Chinese Restaurant process prior.",
        "(General grammars with infinite numbers of nonterminals were studied by (Liang et al., 2007b)).",
        "Next, we introduce two types of context information derived from Collins and Singer (1999): nominal modifiers and prepositional information.",
        "A nominal modifier is either the head of an appositive phrase (\"Maury Cooper, a vice president\") or a non-proper prenominal (\"spokesman John Smith\").",
        "If the entity is the complement of a preposition, we extract the preposition and the head of the governing NP (\"a federally funded sewage plant in Georgia\").",
        "These are added to the grammar at the named-entity class level (separated from the core by a special punctuation symbol).",
        "Finally, we add information about pronouns and wh-complementizers (Figure 3).",

        "This algorithm uses EM to learn a generative model with syntactic, number and gender parameters.",
        "Like Haghighi and Klein (2007), we give our model information about the basic types of pronouns in English.",
        "By setting up the base grammar so that each named-entity class prefers to associate to a single type of pronoun, we can also determine the correspondence between our named-entity symbols and the actual named-entity labels-for the models without pronoun information, this matching is arbitrary and must be inferred during the evaluation process.",
        "To prepare data for clustering with our system, we first parse it with the parser of Charniak and Johnson (2005).",
        "We then annotate pronouns with Charniak and Elsner (2009).",
        "For the evaluation set, we use the named entity data from MUC-7.",
        "Here, we extract all strings in <ne> tags and determine their cores, plus any relevant modifiers, governing prepositions and pronouns, by examining the parse trees.",
        "In addition, we supply the system with additional data from the North American News Corpus (NANC).",
        "Here we extract all NPs headed by proper nouns.",
        "We then process our data by merging all examples with the same core; some merged examples from our dataset are shown in Figure 4.",
        "When two examples are merged, we concatenate their lists of attack airlift airlift rescu # wing # of-commander of-command with-run # # spokesman bird bird bird director bird ford clinton director bird # johnson # before-hearing to-happened of-cartoon on-pressure under-medicare to-according to-allied with-stuck of-government of-photographs of-daughter of-photo for-embarrassing under-instituted about-allegations for-worked before-hearing to-secretary than-proposition of-typical # he he his he my himself his he he he he i he his his i i i he his # modifiers, prepositions and pronouns (capping the length of each list at 20 to keep inference tractable).",
        "For instance, \"air-india\" has no features outside the core, while \"wing\" has some nominals (\"attack\" &c.) and some prepositions (\"commander-of\" &c.).",
        "This merging is useful because it allows us to do inference based on types rather than tokens (Goldwa-ter et al., 2006).",
        "It is well known that, to interpolate between types and tokens, Hierarchical Dirich-let Processes (including adaptor grammars) require a deeper hierarchy, which slows down inference and reduces the mobility of sampling schemes.",
        "By merging examples, we avoid using this more complicated model.",
        "Each merged example also represents many examples from the training data, so we can summarize features (such as modifiers) observed throughout a large input corpus while keeping the size of our input file small.",
        "To create an input file, we first add all the MUC-7 examples.",
        "We then draw additional examples from NANC, ranking them by how many features they have, until we reach a specified number (larger datasets take longer, but without enough data, results tend to be poor).",
        "Our implementation of adaptor grammars is a modified version of the Pitman-Yor adaptor grammar sampler, altered to deal with the infinite number of entities.",
        "It carries out inference using a Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm (Johnson et al., 2007), in which it repeatedly parses each input line using the CYK algorithm, samples a parse, and proposes this as the new tree.",
        "To do Gibbs sampling for our consistency-enforcing model, we would need to sample a parse for an example from the posterior over every possible entity.",
        "However, since there are thousands of entities (the number grows roughly linearly with the number of merged examples in the data file), this is not tractable.",
        "Instead, we perform a restricted Gibbs sampling search, where we enumerate the posterior only for entities which share a word in their core with the example in question.",
        "In fact, if the shared word is very common (occuring in more than .001 of examples), we compute the posterior for that entity only .05 of the time.",
        "These restrictions mean that we do not compute the exact posterior.",
        "In particular, the actual model allows entities to contain examples with no words in common, but our search procedure does not explore these solutions.",
        "For our model, inference with the Gibbs algorithm seems to lack mobility, sometimes falling into very poor local minima from which it does not seem to escape.",
        "This is because, if there are several references to the same named entity with slightly different core phrases, once they are all assigned to the wrong class, it requires a low-probability series of individual Gibbs moves to pull them out.",
        "Similarly, the consistency-enforcing model generally does not fully cluster references to common entities; there are usually several \"Bill Clinton\" clusters which it would be best to combine, but the sequence of moves that does so is too improbable.",
        "The data-merging process described above is one attempt to improve mobility by reducing the number of duplicate examples.",
        "In addition, we found that it was a better use of CPU time to run multiple samplers with different initialization than to perform many iterations.",
        "In the experiments below, we use 20 chains, initializing with 50 iterations without using consistency, then 50 more using the consistency model, and evaluate the last sample from each.",
        "We discard the 10 samples with worst log-likelihood and report the average score for the other 10.",
        "In addition to the base PCFG itself, the system requires a few hyperparameter settings: Dirichlet priors for the rule weights of rules in the base PCFG.",
        "Pitman-Yor parameters for the adapted nonterminals are sampled from vague priors using a slice sampler (Neal, 2003).",
        "The prior over core words was set to the uniform distribution (Dirichlet 1.0) and the prior for all modifiers, prepositions and pronouns to a sparse value of .01.",
        "Beyond setting these parameters to a priori reasonable values, we did not optimize them.",
        "To encourage the system to learn that some lexical symbols were more common than others, we set a sparse prior over expansions to symbols.",
        "There are two really important hyperparameters: an extremely biased prior on class-to-pronoun-type probabilities (1000 for the desired class, .0001 for everything else), and a prior of .0001 for the Word – Word Words rule to discourage symbols expanding to multiword strings."

        "Modifiers were Porter-stemmed; for clarity a reconstructed stem is shown in brackets.",
        "on dev, 25% people).",
        "When the pronoun features are added, our system's performance increases to 86%, significantly better than the EM system.",
        "One motivation for our use of a structured model which defined a notion of consistency between entities was that it might allow the construction of an unsupervised alias detector.",
        "According to the model, two entities are consistent if they are in the same class, and do not have conflicting assignments of words to lexical symbols.",
        "Results here are at best equivocal.",
        "The model is reasonable at passing basic tests \"Dr. Seuss\" is not consistent with \"Dr. Strangelove\", \"Dr. Quinn\" etc, despite their shared title, because the model identifies the second element of each as a last name.",
        "Also correctly, \"Dr. William F. Gibson\" is judged consistent with \"Dr. Gibson\" and \"Gibson\" despite the missing elements.",
        "But mistakes are commonplace.",
        "In the \"Gibson\" case, the string \"William F.\" is misana-lyzed as a multiword string, making the name inconsistent with \"William Gibson\"; this is probably the result of a search error, which, as we explained, Gibbs sampling is unlikely to correct.",
        "In other cases, the system clusters a family group together under a single \"entity\" nonterminal by forcing their first names into inappropriate states, for instance assigning Pers Bruce, Pers Ellen, Pers Jarvis, where Pers (usually a middle name) actually contains the first name of a different individual.",
        "To improve this aspect of our system, we might incorporate name-specific features into the prior, such as abbreviations and the concept of a family name.",
        "The most critical improvement, however, would be integration with a generative coreference system, since the document context probably provides hints about which entities are and are not coreferent.",
        "The other key issue with our system is inference.",
        "Currently we are extremely vulnerable to falling into local minima, since the complex structure of the model can easily lock a small group of examples into a poor configuration.",
        "(The \"William F. Gibson\" case above seems to be one of these.)",
        "In addition to the block sampler used by Bhattacharya and Getoor (2006), we are investigating general-purpose split-merge samplers (Jain and Neal, 2000) and the permutation sampler (Liang et al., 2007a).",
        "One interesting question is how well these samplers perform when faced with thousands of clusters (entities).",
        "Despite these issues, we clearly show that it is possible to build a good model of named entity class while retaining compatibility with generative systems and without supervision.",
        "In addition, we do a reasonable job learning the latent structure of names in each named entity class.",
        "Our system improves over the latent named-entity tagging in Haghighi and Klein (2007), from 61% to 87%.",
        "This suggests that it should indeed be possible to improve on their coreference results without using a supervised named-entity model.",
        "How much improvement is possible in practice, and whether joint inference can also improve named-entity performance, remain interesting questions for future work."
