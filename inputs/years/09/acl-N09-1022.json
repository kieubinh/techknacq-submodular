        "Japanese Query Alteration Based on Semantic Similarity",
        "Nagoya University Furo-cho, Chikusa-ku Nagoya 464-8603, Japan",
        "We propose a unified approach to web search query alterations in Japanese that is not limited to particular character types or orthographic similarity between a query and its alteration candidate.",
        "Our model is based on previous work on English query correction, but makes some crucial improvements: (1) we augment the query-candidate list to include orthographically dissimilar but semantically similar pairs; and (2) we use kernel-based lexical semantic similarity to avoid the problem of data sparseness in computing query-candidate similarity.",
        "We also propose an ef-icient method for generating query-candidate pairs for model training and testing.",
        "We show that the proposed method achieves about 80% accuracy on the query alteration task, improving over previously proposed methods that use semantic similarity."

        "Web search query correction is an important problem to solve for robust information retrieval given how pervasive errors are in search queries: it is said that more than 10% of web search queries contain errors (Cucerzan and Brill, 2004).",
        "English query correction has been an area of active research in recent years, building on previous work on generalpurpose spelling correction.",
        "However, there has been little investigation of query correction in languages other than English.",
        "In this paper, we address the issue of query correction, and more generally, query alteration in Japanese.",
        "Japanese poses particular challenges to the query correction task due to its complex writing system, summarized in Fig. 1.",
        "There are four",
        "Hiragana",
        "Roman Alphabet",
        "Katakana",
        "main character types, including two types of kana (phonetic alphabet - hiragana and katakana), kanji (ideographic - characters represent meaning) and Roman alphabet; a word can be legitimately spelled in multiple ways, combining any of these character sets.",
        "For example, the word for 'protein' can be spelled as fcÀvfïX Lo (all in hiragana), py/p St (katakana+kanji), gSSt (all in kanji) or tfhS St (hiragana+kanji), all pronounced in the same way (tanpakushitsu).",
        "Some examples of these spelling variants are shown in Fig. 1 with the prefix Sp: as is observed from the figure, spelling variation occurs within and across different character types.",
        "Resolving these variants will be essential not only for information retrieval but practically for all NLP tasks.",
        "A particularly prolific source of spelling variations in Japanese is katakana.",
        "Katakana characters are used to transliterate words from English and other foreign languages, and as such, the variations in the source language pronunciation as well as the ambiguity in sound adaptation are reflected in the katakana spelling.",
        "For example, Masuyama et al.",
        "(2004) report that at least six distinct transliterations of the word 'spaghetti' (^^^yr^, T./^ x-f – , etc.)",
        "are attested in the newspaper corpus they studied.",
        "Normalizing katakana spelling variations has been the subject of research by itself (Ara-maki etal., 2008; Masuyama et al., 2004).",
        "Similarly, English-to-katakana transliteration (e.g., 'fedex' as 7ify^T fedekkusu in Fig. 1) and katakana-to-",
        "English back-transliteration (e.g., 7iry 9 ^ back into 'fedex') have also been studied extensively (Bi-lac and Tanaka, 2004; Brill et al., 2001; Knight and Graehl, 1998), as it is an essential component for machine translation.",
        "To our knowledge, however, there has been no work that addresses spelling variation in Japanese generally.",
        "In this paper, we propose a general approach to query correction/alteration in Japanese.",
        "Our goal is to find precise rewrite candidates for a query, be it a correction of a spelling error, normalization of a spelling variant, or inding a strict synonym including abbreviations (e.g., MS v^7n77 F 'Microsoft', prefixed by Abbr in Fig. 1) and true synonyms (e.g., ffijffi (translation of 'seat ' ) is – F (transliteration of 'seat ' , indicated by Syn in Fig. 1).",
        "Our method is based on previous work on English query correction in that we use both spelling and semantic similarity between a query and its alteration candidate, but is more general in that we include alteration candidates that are not similar to the original query in spelling.",
        "In computing semantic similarity, we adopt a kernel-based method (Kandola et al., 2002), which improves the accuracy of the query alteration results over previously proposed methods.",
        "We also introduce a novel approach to creating a dataset of query and alteration candidate pairs efi-ciently and reliably from query session logs."

        "The key difference between traditional generalpurpose spelling correction and search query correction lies in the fact that the latter cannot rely on a lexicon: web queries are replete with valid out-of-dictionary words which are not misspellings of in-vocabulary words.",
        "Cucerzan and Brill (2004) pioneered the research of query spelling correction, with an excellent description of how a traditional dictionary-based speller had to be adapted to solve the realistic query correction problem.",
        "The model they proposed is a source-channel model, where the source model is a word bigram model trained on query logs, and the channel model is based on a weighted Damerau-Levenshtein edit distance.",
        "Brill and Moore (2000) proposed a general, improved source model for general spelling correction, while Ahmad and Kondrak (2005) learned a spelling error model from search query logs using the Expectation Maximization algorithm, without relying on a training set of misspelled words and their corrections.",

        "(2006) proposed to include semantic similarity between the query and its correction candidate.",
        "They point out that adventura is a common misspelling of aventura, not adventure, and this cannot be captured by a simple string edit distance, but requires some knowledge of distributional similarity.",
        "Distributional similarity is measured by the similarity of the context shared by two terms, and has been successfully applied to many natural language processing tasks, including semantic knowledge acquisition (Lin, 1998).",
        "Though the use of distributional similarity improved the query correction results in Li et al.",
        "s work, one problem is that it is sparse and is not available for many rarer query strings.",

      "text": [
        "We employ a formulation of query alteration model that is similar to conventional query correction models.",
        "Given a query string q as input, a query correction model finds a correct alteration c* within the confusion set of q, so that it maximizes the posterior probability:",
        "where C is the set of all white-space separated words and their bigrams in query logs in our case, and",
        "CF(q) C C is the confusion set of q, consisting of the candidates within a certain edit distance from q, i.e., CF(q) = {c e C|ED(q, c) < 6).",
        "We set 6 = 24 using an unnormalized edit distance.",
        "The detail of the edit distance ED(q, c) is described in Section 3.2.",
        "The query string q itself is contained in CF(q), and if the model output is different from q, it means the model suggests a query alteration.",
        "Formulated in this way, both query error detection and alteration are performed in a uniied way.",
        "After computing the posterior probability of each candidate in CF(q) by the source channel model (Section 3.2), an N-best list is obtained as the initial candidate set Co, which is then augmented by the bootstrapping method Tchai (Section 3.4) to create the inal candidate list C(q).",
        "The candidates in C(q) are re-ranked by a maximum entropy model (Section 3.5) and the candidate with the highest posterior probability is selected as the output.",
        "Source channel models are widely used for spelling and query correction (Brill and Moore, 2000; Cucerzan and Brill, 2004).",
        "Instead of directly computing Eq.",
        "(1), we can decompose the posterior probability using Bayes rule as:",
        "where the source model P(c) measures how probable the candidate c is, while the error model P(q|c) measures how similar q and c are.",
        "For the source model, an n-gram based statistical language model is the standard in previous work n-gram models are simple to create for English, which is easy to tokenize and to obtain word-based statistics, but this is not the case with Japanese.",
        "Therefore, we simply considered the whole input string as a candidate to be altered, and used the relative frequency of candidates in the query logs to build the language model:",
        "For the error model, we used an improved channel model described in (Brill and Moore, 2000),",
        "used to separate words in Japanese search queries, due to their keyword-based nature.",
        "which we call the alpha-beta model in this paper.",
        "The model is a weighted extension of the normal Damerau-Levenshtein edit distance which equally penalizes single character insertion, substitution, or deletion operations (Damerau, 1964; Levenshtein, 1966), and considers generic edit operations of the form a – ß, where a and ß are any (possibly null) strings.",
        "From misspelled/correct word pairs, alpha-beta trains the probability P(a – ß|PSN), conditioned by the position PSN of a in a word, where PSN e {start of word, middle of word, end of word}.",
        "Under this model, the probability of rewriting a string w to a string s is calculated as:",
        "which corresponds to finding best partitions R and T in all possible partitions Part(w) and Part(s).",
        "Brill and Moore (2000) reported that this model gave a significant improvement over conventional edit distance methods.",
        "Brill et al.",
        "(2001) applied this model for extracting katakana-English transliteration pairs from query logs.",
        "They trained the edit distance between character chunks of katakana and Roman alphabets, after converting katakana strings to Roman script.",
        "We also trained this model using 59,754 katakana-English pairs extracted from aligned Japanese and English Wikipedia article titles.",
        "In this paper we allowed |a|, |ß| < 3.",
        "The resulting edit distance is obtained as the negative logarithm of the alpha-beta probability, i.e., ED„ß(q|c) = - logPaß(q|c).",
        "Since the edit operations are directional and c and q can be any string consisting of katakana and English, distance in both directions were considered.",
        "We also included a modified edit distance EDhd for simple kana-kana variations after converting them into Roman script.",
        "The distance EDhd is essentially the same as the normal Damerau-Levenshtein edit distance, with the modification that it does not penalize character halving (aa – a) and doubling (a – aa), because a large part of katakana variants only differ in halving/doubling (e.g. ^/^/f7 4 (supageti) vs ^^^'74- (supagetii).",
        "The final error probability is obtained from the minimum of these three distances:",
        "where every edit distance is normalized to [0, 1] by multiplying by a factor of 2/(|q||c|) so that it does not depend on the length of the input strings.",
        "3.3 Kernel-based Lexical Semantic Similarity 3.3.1 Distributional Similarity",
        "The source channel model described in Section 3.2 only considers language and error models and cannot capture semantic similarity between the query and its correction candidate.",
        "To address this issue, we use distributional similarity (Lin, 1998) estimated from query logs as additional evidence for query alteration, following Li et al.",
        "(2006).",
        "For English, it is relatively easy to define the context of a word based on the bag-of-words model.",

        "(2006) and Komachi and Suzuki (2008) did for their information extraction tasks.",
        "This formulation does not involve any segmentation or boundary detection, which makes this method fast and robust.",
        "On the other hand, this may cause additional sparseness in the vector representation; we address this issue in the next two sections.",
        "Once the context of a candidate c is defined as the patterns that the candidate co-occurs with, it can be represented as a vector c = [pmi(ci,pi),..., pmi(ci,pM)]', where M denotes the number of context patterns and x' is the transposition of a vector (or possibly a matrix) x.",
        "The elements of the vector are given by pointwise mutual information between the candidate cj and the pattern Pj, computed as:",
        "where | cj, Pj| is the frequency of the pattern Pj instantiated with the candidate cj, and '* ' denotes a wildcard, i.e., |cj; *| = J2p |cj,p| and |*,Pj| = J2c |c, Pj |.",
        "With these defined, the distributional similarity can be calculated as cosine similarity.",
        "Let cj be the L2-normalized pattern vector of the candidate cj, and X = {Cj) be the candidate-pattern cooccurrence matrix.",
        "The candidate similarity matrix K can then be obtained as K = X'X.",
        "In the following, the (i, j)-element of the matrix K is denoted as Kjj, which corresponds to the cosine similarity between candidates cj and cj.",
        "Although distributional similarity serves as strong evidence for semantically relevant candidates, directly applying the technique to query logs faces the sparseness problem.",
        "Because context patterns are drawn from query logs and can also contain spelling errors, alterations, and word permutations as much as queries do, context differs so greatly in representations that even related candidates might not have sufficient contextual overlap between them.",
        "For example, a candidate \"YouTube\" matched against the patterns \"YouTube+movie\", \"movie+YouTube\" and \"You-Tube+movii\" (with a minor spelling error) will yield three distinct patterns \"#+movie\", \"movie+#\" and \"#+movii\", which will be treated as three separate dimensions in the vector space model.",
        "This sparseness problem can be partially addressed by considering the correlation between patterns.",
        "Kandola et al.",
        "(2002) proposed new kernelbased similarity methods which incorporate indirect similarity between terms for a text retrieval task.",
        "Although their kernels are built on a document-term co-occurrence model, they can also be applied to our candidate-pattern co-occurrence model.",
        "The proposed kernel is recursively defined as:",
        "where G = XX' is the correlation matrix between patterns and / is the factor to ensure that longer range effects decay exponentially.",
        "This can be interpreted as augmenting the similarity matrix K through indirect similarities of patterns G and vice versa.",
        "Semantically related pairs of patterns are expected to be given high correlation in the matrix G and this will alleviate the sparseness problem.",
        "By solving the above recursive definition, one obtains the von Neumann kernel:",
        "This can also be interpreted in terms of a random walk in a graph where the nodes correspond to all the candidates and the weight of an edge (i, j) is given by Kjj.",
        "A simple calculation shows that Kjj equals the sum of the products of the edge weights over all possible paths between the nodes corresponding cj and cj in the graph.",
        "Also, Kjj corresponds to the probability that a random walk beginning at node cj ends up at node cj after t steps, assuming that the entries are all positive and the sum of the connections is 1 at each node.",
        "Following this notion, Kandola et al.",
        "(2002) proposed another kernel called exponential kernel, with alternative faster decay factors:",
        "K exp{PK ).",
        "They showed that this alternative kernel achieved a better performance for their text retrieval task.",
        "We employed these two kernels to compute distributional similarity for our query correction task.",
        "Although semantic relatedness can be partially captured by the semantic kernels introduced in the previous section, they may still have difficulties computing correlations between candidates and patterns especially for only sparsely connected graphs.",
        "Take the graph (a) in Fig. 2 for example, which is a simplified yet representative graph topology for candidate-pattern co-occurrence we often encounter.",
        "In this case K = X'X equals I, meaning that the connections between candidates and patterns are too sparse to obtain sufficient correlation even when semantic kernels are used.",
        "Source channel model",
        "Pattern induction",
        "In order to address this issue, we propose to augment the graph by weakly connecting the candidate and pattern nodes as shown in the graph (b) of Fig. 2 based on prior knowledge of orthographic similarity about candidates and patterns.",
        "This can be achieved using the following candidate similarity matrix K+ instead of K:",
        "where SC = {sc(i, j)} is the orthographical similarity matrix of candidates in which the (i, j)-element is given by the edit distance based similarity, i.e., sc(i, j) = exp [ – ED(cj, cj)].",
        "The orthographical similarity matrix of patterns SP = {sP(i, j)} is defined similarly, i.e., sP(i, j) = exp[ – ED(pj,pj-)].",
        "Note that using this similarity matrix K + can be interpreted as a random walk process on a bipartite graph as follows.",
        "Let C and P as the sets of candidates and patterns.",
        "K + corresponds to a single walking step from C to C, by either remaining within C with a probability of Y or moving to \"the other side\" P of the graph with a probability of 1 – y.",
        "When the walking remains in C, it is allowed to move to another candidate node following the candidate orthographic similarity SC.",
        "Otherwise it moves to P by the matrix X, chooses either to move within P with a probability ySp or to stay with a probability 1 – y, and finally comes back to C by the matrix X'.",
        "Multiplication (K+)* corresponds to repeating this process t times.",
        "Using this similarity, we can define two orthographically augmented semantic kernels which differ in the decaying factors, augmented von Neumann kernel and exponential kernel:",
        "Now that we have a semantic model, our query correction model can cover query-candidate pairs which are only semantically related.",
        "However, previous work on query correction all used a string distance function and a threshold to restrict the space of potential candidates, allowing only the orthographically similar candidates.",
        "To collect additional candidates, the use of context-based semantic extraction methods would be effective because semantically related candidates are likely to share context with the initial query q, or at least with the initial candidate set Co.",
        "Here we used the Tchai algorithm (Komachi and Suzuki, 2008), a modified version of Espresso (Pan-tel and Pennacchiotti, 2006) to collect such candidates.",
        "This algorithm starts with initial seed instances, then induces reliable context patterns co-occurring with the seeds, induces instances from the patterns, and iterates this process to obtain categories of semantically related words.",
        "Using the candidates in Co as the seed instances, one bootstrapping iteration of the Tchai algorithm is executed to obtain the semantically related set of instances C1.",
        "The seed instance reliabilities are given by the source channel probabilities P(c)P(q|c).",
        "Finally we take the union C0 U C1 to obtain the candidate set C(q).",
        "This process is outlined in Fig. 3.",
        "In order to build a unified probabilistic query alteration model, we used the maximum entropy approach of (Beger et al., 1996), which Li et al.",
        "(2006) also employed for their query correction task and showed its effectiveness.",
        "It defines a conditional probabilistic distribution P(c| q) based on a set of feature functions f1,..., fK:",
        "P(c|q) = exp£*iAjfj(c,q) , (13) Ec expE i=1 Aj/j(c,q) where A1;..., AK are the feature weights.",
        "The optimal set of feature weights A* can be computed by maximizing the log-likelihood of the training set.",
        "We used the Generalized Iterative Scaling (GIS) algorithm (Darroch and Ratcliff, 1972) to optimize the feature weights.",
        "GIS trains conditional probability in Eq.",
        "(13), which requires the normalization over all possible candidates.",
        "However, the number of all possible candidates C obtained from a query log can be very large, so we only calculated the sum over the candidates in C(q).",
        "This is the same approach that Och and Ney (2002) took for statistical machine translation, and Li et al.",

        "For all the experiments conducted in this paper, we used a subset of the Japanese search query logs submitted to Live Search (www.live.com) in November and December of 2007.",
        "Queries submitted less than eight times were deleted.",
        "The query log we used contained 83,080,257 tokens and 1,038,499 unique queries.",
        "Models of query correction in previous work were trained and evaluated using manually created query-candidate pairs.",
        "That is, human annotators were given a set of queries and were asked to provide a correction for each query when it needed to be rewritten.",
        "As Cucerzan and Brill (2004) point out, however, this method is seriously flawed in that the intention of the original query is completely lost to the annotator, without which the correction is often impossible: it is not clear if gogle should be corrected to google or goggle, or neither – gogle may be a brand new product name.",
        "Cucerzan and Brill therefore performed a second evaluation, where the test data was drawn by sampling the query logs for successive queries (qi, q2) by the same user where the edit distance between q1 and q2 are within a certain threshold, which are then submitted to annotators for generating the correction.",
        "While this method makes the annotation more reliable by relying on user (rather than annotator) reformulation, the task is still overly difficult: going back to the example in Section 1, it is unclear which spelling of 'protein' produces the best search results – it can only be empirically determined.",
        "Their method also eliminates all pairs of candidates that are not orthographically similar.",
        "We have therefore improved their method in the following manner, making the process more automated and thus more reliable.",
        "We first collected a subset of the query log that contains only those pairs (q1, q2) that are issued successively by the same user, q2 is issued within 3 minutes of q1 , and q2 resulted in a click of the resulting page while q1 did not.",
        "The last condition adds the evidence that q2 was a better formulation than q1 .",
        "We then ranked the collected query pairs using log-likelihood ratio (LLR) (Dunning, 1993), which measures the dependence between q1 and q2 within the context of web queries (Jones et al., 2006b).",
        "We randomly sampled 10,000 query pairs with LLR > 200, and submitted them to annotators, who only confirm or reject a query pair as being synonymous.",
        "For example, q1 = nikon and q2 = canon are related but not synonymous, while we are reasonably sure q1 = ipot and q2 = ipod are synonymous, given that this pair has a high LLR value.",
        "This verification process is extremely fast and consistent across annotators: it takes less than 1 hour to go through 1,000 query pairs, and the inter-annotator agreement rate of two annotators on 2,000 query pairs was 95.7%.",
        "We annotated 10,000 query pairs consisting of alphanumerical and kana characters in this manner.",

        "The model with the cosine similarity (ME-Cos) in addition to the basic set of features yielded higher recall compared to ME-NoSim, but decreased accuracy and precision, which are more important than recall for our purposes because a false alteration does more damage than no alteration.",
        "This is also the case when the kernel-based methods, ME-vN (the von Neumann kernel) and ME-Exp (the exponential kernel), are used in place of the cosine similarity.",
        "This shows that using semantic similarity does not always help, which we believe is due to the sparseness of the contextual information used in computing semantic similarity.",
        "On the other hand, ME-vN+ (with augmented von Neumann kernel) and ME-Exp+ (with augmented exponential kernel) increased both accuracy and precision with a slight decrease of recall, compared to the distributional similarity baseline and the non-augmented kernel-based methods.",
        "ME-Exp+ was significantly better than ME-Exp (p < 0.01).",
        "Note that the accuracy values appear lower than some of the previous results on English (e.g., more than 80% in (Li et al., 2006)), but this is because the dataset creation method we employed tends to over-represent the pairs that lead to alteration: the simplest baseline (= always propose no alteration) performs 67.3% accuracy on our data, in contrast to 83.4% on the data used in (Li et al., 2006).",
        "Manually examining the suggestions made by the system also confirms the effectiveness of our model.",
        "For example, the similarity-based models altered the query ipot to ipod, while the simple ME-NoSim model failed, because it depends too much on the edit distance-based features.",
        "We also observed that many of the suggestions made by the system were actually reasonable, even though they were different from the annotated gold standard.",
        "For example, ME-vN+ suggests a rewrite of the query 2tyann as 2 h^hfaS ('2-channel'), while the gold standard was an abbreviated form 2 ('2-chan').",
        "To incorporate such possibly correct candidates into account, we conducted a follow-up experiment where we considered multiple reference alterations, created automatically from our data set in the following manner.",
        "Suppose that a query q1 is corrected as q2, and q2 is corrected as q3 in our annotated data.",
        "If this is the case, we considered qi – q3 as a valid alteration as well.",
        "By applying this chaining operation up to 5 degrees of separation, we recreated a set of valid alterations for each input query.",
        "Note that directionality is important – in the above example, q1 – q3 is valid, while q3 – q1 is not.",
        "Table 2 shows the results of evaluation with multiple references.",
        "The numbers substantially improved over the single reference cases, as expected, but did not affect the relative performance of each model.",
        "Again, the differences in accuracy between the SC and ME models, and ME-Exp and ME-Exp+ were statistically significant (p < 0.01)."
