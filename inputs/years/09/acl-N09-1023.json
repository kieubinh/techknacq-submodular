        "Conversational media such as the text messages found in Internet Relay Chat presents both new opportunities and new challenges.",
        "Among the challenges are that individual messages are often quite short, for the reason that conversational participants are able to assemble the required context over the course of a conversation.",
        "A natural consequence of this is that many tasks that we would like to perform on conversational media (e.g., search, summarization, or automated response) would benefit from reassembly of individual messages into complete conversations.",
        "This task has been studied extensively in the context of email (where it is often referred to as \"threading\") (Yeh et al., 2006).",
        "The extensive metadata associated with email and the relatively rich content of some email messages makes email somewhat of a special case in the broad set of conversation recovery tasks, however.",
        "At the opposite extreme, conversation \"threading\" in multi-party spoken interactions (e.g., meetings) would be a compelling application, but the word error rate ofcurrent automated transcription techniques somewhat limits access to the lexical evidence that we know is useful for this task.",
        "The recent interest in identifying individual conversations from online-discussions, a task that some refer to as \"disentanglement,\" therefore seems to be something of a middle ground in the research space: computationally tractable, representative to some degree of a broader class of problems, and directly useful as a preprocessing step for a range of important applications.",
        "One way to think of this task is as a clustering problem â€“ we seek to partition the messages into a set of disjoint clusters, where each cluster represents a conversation among a set of participants on a topic.",
        "This formulation raises the natural question of how we should design a similarity measure.",
        "Since the messages are often too short to be meaningful by themselves, techniques based solely on lexical overlap (e.g., inner products of term vectors weighted by some function of term frequency, document frequency and message length) are unlikely to be successful.",
        "For instance, consider the multi-party exchange in Figure 1, in which a single message may not convey much about the topic without considering what has been said before, and who said it.",
        "Fortunately for us, additional sources of evidence (18323 Ricardo) is there a way to emulate input for a program listening on a COM port?",
        "(18911 Azzie) Ricardo: Hello there, how is it going?",
        "(18939 Ricardo) pretty good, just at the office, about to leave.",
        "How are you?",
        "(18970 Azzie) well, end of semester work, what could be better?",
        "(18980 Josephina) if it's just reading from /dev/ttyS0 or something you could somehow get it to just read from a named pipe instead (19034 Ricardo) Josephina: I might just have to end up modifying the entire program...",

        "As we describe below, messages are strongly correlated both temporally (i.e., across time) and socially (i.e,, across participants).",
        "For example, in our running example in Figure 1, Ricardo's message (19045 Ricardo) \"so it can read from a different input stream\" elaborates on his previous message (19034 Ricardo) to Josephina.",
        "Messages that are close in time and from the same speaker can share related meanings.",
        "Similarly, we see that Ricardo's messages to Josephina (19034 Ricardo and 19045 Ricardo) are responses to earlier comments made by Josephina (18980 Josephina), and that fact is signaled by Ricardo invoking Josephena's name.",
        "This is an example of social correlation: lexicalized references to identity can also provide useful evidence.",
        "If we take social and temporal context into account, we should be able to do better at recognizing conversations than we could using lexical overlap alone.",
        "In recent years, several approaches have been developed for detecting conversational threads in dynamic text streams (Elsner et al., 2008; Shen et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2008).",
        "Although they use both lexical and non-lexical information (e.g., time, name mentions in message) for this task, they have ignored the temporal and social contexts a message appears in, which provide valuable cues for interpreting the message.",
        "Correlation clustering used in a two-step approach (Elsner et al., 2008) exploits message contexts to some degree, but its performance is largely limited by the classifier used in the first-step which computes message similarity without considering the temporal and social contexts of each message.",
        "Our approach exploits contextual properties (both explicit and hidden) to probabilistically expand each message to provide a more accurate message representation.",
        "The new representation leads to a much improved performance for conversation disentanglement.",
        "We note that this is a general approach and can be applied to the representation of non-chat data that exhibits temporal and social correlations as well.",
        "The results that we obtain with this technique are close to the limit of what we can measure using present test collections and evaluation measures.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to apply document expansion to the conversation disentanglement problem."

        "Previous work in conversation disentanglement (i.e. thread detection) has shown the conventional lexical-based clustering is not suitable for text streams because messages are often too short and incomplete.",
        "They focus on using discourse/chat-specific features to bias the lexical-based message similarity (Elsner et al., 2008; Shen et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2008).",
        "These features provide the means to link messages that may not have sufficient lexical overlap but are nevertheless likely to be topically related.",
        "However, our work is different from them in several aspects:",
        "(1) They treat individual messages as the basic elements for clustering, and ignore the social and temporal contexts of the messages.",
        "In our work, each message is probabilistically expanded using reliable information from its contexts and the expanded messages are the basic elements for clustering.",
        "(2) Messages have different amount of explicit information.",
        "For example, messages that initiate conversations may have more name mentions than subsequent messages (i.e. for establishing conversations).",
        "Previous work only uses what are explicitly present in each message, and clusters may be erroneously assigned for messages that lack enough explicit information.",
        "Our work exploits both explicit and implicit context for each message due to how we define contexts (Section 3.2.1).",
        "(3) Most work imposes a fixed window size for clustering and it may break up long conversations or may not be fine-grained enough for short conversations.",
        "Given each message, we use an exponential decay model to naturally encode time effect and assign differential weights to messages in its contexts.",
        "Another thread of related work is document expansion.",
        "It was previously studied in (Singhal et al., 1999) in the context of the speech retrieval, helping to overcome limitations in the transcription accuracy by selecting additional terms from lexically similar (text) documents.",
        "Document expansion has also been applied to cross-language retrieval in (Levow et al., 2005), in that case to overcome limitations in translation resources.",
        "The technique has recently been revisited (Tao et al., 2006; Kurland et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2004) in the language modeling framework, where lexically related documents are used to enlarge the sample space for a document to improve the accuracy of the estimated document language model.",
        "However, these lexical-based approaches are less well suited to conversational interaction, because conversational messages are often short, they therefore may not overlap sufficiently in words with other messages to provide a useful basis for expansion.",
        "Our technique can be viewed as an extension of these previous methods to text streams.",
        "Our work is also related to text segmentation (Ji et al., 2003) and meeting segmentation (Malioutov et al., 2006; Malioutov et al., 2007; Galley et al., 2003; Eisenstein et al., 2008).",
        "Text segmentation identifies boundaries of topic changes in long text documents, but we form threads of messages from streams consisting of short messages.",
        "Meeting conversations are not as highly interleaving as chat conversations, where participants can create a new conversation at any time."

        "This section describes our technique for clustering messages into threads based on the lexical similarity of documents that have been expanded based on social and temporal evidence.",
        "To represent the semantic information of messages and threads (clusters ofmessages), most ofthe prior approaches build a document representation on each message alone (using word features and time-stamp and/or discourse features found in the message).",
        "We call such a model a context-free message model.",
        "Most commonly, a message is represented as a vector (Salton, 1989).",
        "Each dimension corresponds to a separate term.",
        "If a term occurs in the message, its value in the vector is non-zero.",
        "Several different ways of computing these values, known as term weights, have been developed.",
        "One of the best known schemes is tf-idf weighting.",
        "However, in conversational text, a context-free model cannot fully capture the semantics of messages.",
        "The meaning of a message is highly dependent on other messages in its context.",
        "For example, in our running example in Figure 1, to fully interpret the message 19045 Ricardo, we need to first read his previous message (19034 Ricardo) to Josephina.",
        "Further, messages on the same topic may have little or no overlap in words (Figure 1), and the messages between participants are highly interactive and are often too short and incomplete to fully capture a topic on their own.",
        "Our main idea is to exploit the temporal and social aspects of the conversations to build a context-sensitive document model for each message.",
        "We do this by first identifying the temporal and social contexts for each message, then probabilistically expanding the content of each message with selected messages in each context.",
        "As we have seen, a message's contexts provide valuable cues for interpreting the message.",

        "The variance can be readily estimated from training data.",

        "As pointed out by previous linguistic studies of discourse, especially analysis of multi-party conversation (ONeill et al., 2003), one key difference between multi-party conversation and typical two-party conversation is the frequency with which participants mention each others' names.",
        "Name mentioning is hypothesized as a strategy for participants to compensate for the lack of cues normally present in face-to-face dialogue (ONeill et al., 2003; Elsner et al., 2008).",
        "Although infrequent, name mentions (such as Azzie's comments to Ricardo in Figure 1) provide a means for linking two speakers and their messages.",

        "Discussion: From the definition, mj is included in mi's conversational context if the author of mi mentions the author of mj in any of mi s messages, or vice versa.",
        "For instance, the conversational context for Ricardo's message (19034 Ricardo) in Figure 1 includes the messages from Josephina (18980 Josephina) due to the mentioning of Josephina in his message.",
        "However, it may well be the case that mi does not contain any name mentions, e.g. Ricardo's message to Azzie (18939 Ricardo).",
        "In this case, if Ricardo is being mentioned by another author (here Azzie asks Ricardo a question by starting with his name in 18939 Azzie), message (18939 Ricardo)'s conversational context will contain all of Azzie's messages (18911 and 18970 Azzie) according to the above definition.",
        "This intuitively captures the implicit question-answer patterns in conversational speech: Ricardo s subsequent answer is a response to Azzie s comments, hence they are in each other s conversational context.",
        "Our definition also accounts for another source of implicit context.",
        "In interactive conversations name mention is a tool for getting people s attention and starting a conversation.",
        "Once a participant ai establishes a conversation with aj (such that ai may mention aj ' s name in an initial message mp to aj), a,,, may stop mentioning aj s name in subsequent messages (mq) to aj.",
        "This is illustrated in Ricardo ' s last message to Josephina in Figure 1.",
        "Our definition accounts for the conversation continuity between aj and ai by including messages from aj in the conversational context of subsequent messages mq from a,,, (note mq may or may not mention aj).",
        "For instance, message 19045 Ricardo continues the conversation with Josephina from 19034 Ricardo, message 19045 Ricardo thus has Josephina s messages as part of its conversational context.",
        "In general, a person can participate in multiple conversations over time, but as time goes on the topic of interest may shift and the person may start talking to other people.",
        "So the messages in the conversational context of mi due to earlier discussions with other people should be assigned a lower confidence value for mi.",
        "For example, five hours later Ricardo may still be active, but it is unlikely he still chats with Josephina on the same topic, so the earlier messages by Josephina should receive a small confidence value in the conversational context of Ricardo ' s later messages.",
        "We illustrate this idea in Figure 2(ii).",
        "It shows the probability that message mj, where mj e Cc(mi), belongs to the same thread as mi, given their time difference tj â€“ ti.",
        "This is encoded with a normal probability distribution, N(/j.c, ac) where /j,c = 0 and variance is estimated from training data.",

        "From the viewpoint of document smoothing, this can also be regarded as using temporally nearby messages to smooth the representation of m. So given mi, we again model its temporal context by fitting a normal probability distribution N(/j,t,at), so that if mj e CT(mi) and d = tj â€“ ti, the probability that mj is topically related to mi is:",
        "We have shown how to use the social and temporal aspects of conversational text to identify and model the contexts of each message, and how to assign confidence values to messages in its contexts.",
        "We now show how to use a message s contexts and their associated messages to probabilistically expand the given message.",

        "A context with large variance in its normal density graph should receive a small X value.",
        "This is because a large variance in context k implies more uncertainty on a message mj being topically related to m while mj is in the context k of m. In Figure 2, the conversational context (Figure 2(ii)) has the minimum variance among all contexts, hence, it is more accurate for linking messages related in topic and it is assigned a higher X value (0.6), while the temporal context has the lowest X value (0.1).",

        "The average by this measure between human annotators is 0.53.",
        "In this case, the proposed context model achieves an 14% increase over El-sner and 32%% increase over the best baseline, and it is within 88% of human performance.",
        "This fairly clearly indicates that our Context model can disentangle interleaved conversations relatively well.",
        "Finally, Figure 6 presents the results for \"local-3\" to evaluate the system s ability to do local annotations.",
        "The difference between the best baseline and maximum upper bound is small, implying limited room for potential improvement by any non-baseline techniques.",
        "Our result again compares favorably with the previously reported result and the best baseline, although with a smaller margin of 20%% over the best baseline and 3% over Elsner as a result of the relatively high baseline for this measure."

        "For conversation disentanglement, it outperforms the best previously known technique.",
        "Our work raises three important questions: (1) to what extent is the single test collection that we have used representative of the broad range of \"text chat\" applications?, (2) to what extent do the measures we have reported correlate to effective performance of downstream tasks such as summarization or automated response?, and (3) can we re-conceptualize the formalized problem in a way that would result in greater inter-annotator agreement, and hence provide scope for further refinements in our technique.",
