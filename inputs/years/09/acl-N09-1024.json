        "Unsupervised approaches are attractive due to the the availability of large quantities of unlabeled text, and unsupervised morphological segmentation has been extensively studied for a number of languages (Brent et al., 1995; Goldsmith, 2001; Dasgupta and Ng, 2007; Creutz and Lagus, 2007).",
        "The lack of supervised labels makes it even more important to leverage rich features and global dependencies.",

        "Our model incorporates simple priors inspired by the minimum description length (MDL) principle, as well as overlapping features such as morphemes and their contexts (e.g., in Arabic, the string Al is likely a morpheme, as is any string between Al and a word boundary).",

        "There is a large body of work on the unsupervised learning of morphology.",
        "In addition to morphological segmentation, there has been work on unsupervised morpheme analysis, where one needs to determine features of word forms (Kurimo et al., 2007) or identify words with the same lemma by modeling stem changes (Schone and Jurafsky, 2001; Goldsmith, 2001).",
        "However, we focus our review specifically on morphological segmentation.",
        "In the absence of labels, unsupervised learning must incorporate a strong learning bias that reflects prior knowledge about the task.",
        "In morphological segmentation, an often-used bias is the minimum description length (MDL) principle, which favors compact representations of the lexicon and corpus (Brent et al., 1995; Goldsmith, 2001; Creutz and La-gus, 2007).",
        "Other approaches use statistics on morpheme context, such as conditional entropy between adjacent n-grams, to identify morpheme candidates (Harris, 1955; Keshava and Pitler, 2006).",
        "In this paper, we incorporate both intuitions into a simple yet powerful model, and show that each contributes significantly to performance.",
        "Unsupervised morphological segmentation systems also differ from the engineering perspective.",
        "Some adopt a pipeline approach (Schone and Ju-rafsky, 2001; Dasgupta and Ng, 2007; Demberg, 2007), which works by first extracting candidate affixes and stems, and then segmenting the words based on the candidates.",
        "Others model segmentation using a joint probabilistic distribution (Goldwa-ter et al., 2006; Creutz and Lagus, 2007; Snyder and",
        "Barzilay, 2008b); they learn the model parameters from unlabeled data and produce the most probable segmentation as the final output.",
        "The latter approach is arguably more appealing from the modeling standpoint and avoids error propagation along the pipeline.",
        "However, most existing systems use directed generative models; Creutz & Lagus (2007) used an HMM, while Goldwater et al.",
        "(2006) and Snyder & Barzilay (2008b) used Bayesian models based on Pitman-Yor or Dirichlet processes.",
        "These models are difficult to extend with arbitrary overlapping features that can help improve accuracy.",
        "In this work we incorporate novel overlapping contextual features and show that they greatly improve performance.",
        "Non-overlapping contextual features previously have been used in directed generative models (in the form of Markov models) for unsupervised morphological segmentation (Creutz and Lagus, 2007) or word segmentation (Goldwater et al., 2007).",
        "In terms of feature sets, our model is most closely related to the constituent-context model proposed by Klein and Manning (2001) for grammar induction.",
        "If we exclude the priors, our model can also be seen as a semi-Markov conditional random field (CRF) model (Sarawagi and Cohen, 2004).",
        "Semi-Markov CRFs previously have been used for supervised word segmentation (Andrew, 2006), but not for unsupervised morphological segmentation.",
        "Unsupervised learning with log-linear models has received little attention in the past.",
        "Two notable exceptions are Smith & Eisner (2005) for POS tagging, and Poon & Domingos (2008) for coreference resolution.",
        "Learning with log-linear models requires computing the normalization constant (a.k.a.",
        "the partition function) Z.",
        "This is already challenging in supervised learning.",
        "In unsupervised learning, the difficulty is further compounded by the absence of supervised labels.",
        "Smith & Eisner (2005) proposed contrastive estimation, which uses a small neighborhood to compute Z.",
        "The neighborhood is carefully designed so that it not only makes computation easier but also offers sufficient contrastive information to aid unsupervised learning.",
        "Poon & Domingos (2008), on the other hand, used sampling to approximate Z .",

        "3 Log-Linear Model for Unsupervised Morphological Segmentation",
        "Central to our approach is a log-linear model that defines the joint probability distribution for a corpus (i.e., the words) and a segmentation on the corpus.",
        "The core of this model is a morpheme-context model, with one feature for each morpheme, and one feature for each morpheme context.",
        "We represent contexts using the n-grams before and after the morpheme, for some constant n. To illustrate this, a segmented Arabic corpus is shown below along with its features, assuming we are tracking bigram contexts.",
        "The segmentation is indicated with hyphens, while the hash symbol (#) represents the word boundary.",
        "Segmented Corpus hnAk w-vlAv-wn bn-w Al-ywm Al-jmAEp",
        "Furthermore, the corresponding features for the segmented word w-vlAv-wn are shown in Figure 1.",
        "Each feature is associated with a weight, which correlates with the likelihood that the corresponding morpheme or context marks a valid morphological segment.",
        "Such overlapping features allow us to capture rich segmentation regularities.",
        "For example, given the Arabic word Alywm, to derive its correct segmentation Al-ywm, it helps to know that Al and ywm are likely morphemes whereas Aly or lyw are not; it also helps to know that AL## or ##_yw are likely morpheme contexts whereas ly3# or ##_wm are not.",
        "Ablation tests verify the importance of these overlapping features (see Section 7.2).",
        "Our morpheme-context model is inspired by the constituent-context model (CCM) proposed by Klein and Manning (2001) for grammar induction.",
        "The morphological segmentation of a word can be viewed as a flat tree, where the root node corresponds to the word and the leaves correspond to morphemes (see Figure 1).",
        "The CCM uses uni-grams for context features.",
        "For this task, however, we found that bigrams and trigrams lead to much better accuracy.",
        "We use trigrams in our full model.",
        "For learning, one can either view the corpus as a collection of word types (unique words) or tokens (word occurrences).",
        "Some systems (e.g., Morfessor) use token frequency for parameter estimation.",
        "Our system, however, performs much better using word types.",
        "This has also been observed for other morphological learners (Goldwater et al., 2006).",
        "Thus we use types in learning and inference, and effectively enforce the constraint that words can have only one segmentation per type.",
        "Evaluation is still based on tokens to reflect the performance in real applications.",
        "In addition to the features of the morpheme-context model, we incorporate two priors which capture additional intuitions about morphological segmentations.",
        "First, we observe that the number of distinct morphemes used to segment a corpus should be small.",
        "This is achieved when the same morphemes are reused across many different words.",
        "Our model incorporates this intuition by imposing a lexicon prior: an exponential prior with negative weight on the length of the morpheme lexicon.",
        "We define the lexicon to be the set of unique morphemes identified by a complete segmentation of the corpus, and the lexicon length to be the total number of characters in the lexicon.",
        "In this way, we can simultaneously emphasize that a lexicon should contain few unique morphemes, and that those morphemes should be short.",
        "However, the lexicon prior alone incorrectly favors the trivial segmentation that shatters each word into characters, which results in the smallest lexicon possible (single characters).",
        "Therefore, we also impose a corpus prior: an exponential prior on the number of morphemes used to segment each word in the corpus, which penalizes over-segmentation.",
        "We notice that longer words tend to have more morphemes.",
        "Therefore, each word's contribution to this prior is normalized by the word's length in characters (e.g., the segmented word w-vlAv-wn contributes 3/7 to the total corpus size).",
        "Notice that it is straightforward to incorporate such a prior in a log-linear model, but much more challenging to do so in a directed generative model.",
        "These two priors are inspired by the minimum description length (MDL) length principle; the lexicon prior favors fewer morpheme types, whereas the corpus prior favors fewer morpheme tokens.",
        "They are vital to the success of our model, providing it with the initial inductive bias.",
        "We also notice that often a word is decomposed into a stem and some prefixes and suffixes.",
        "This is particularly true for languages with predominantly inflectional morphology, such as Arabic, Hebrew, and English.",
        "Thus our model uses separate lexicons for prefixes, stems, and suffixes.",
        "This results in a small but non-negligible accuracy gain in our experiments.",
        "We require that a stem contain at least two characters and no fewer characters than any affixes in the same word.",
        "In a given word, when a morpheme is identified as the stem, any preceding morpheme is identified as a prefix, whereas any following morpheme as a suffix.",

        "Each occurrence of a will be in the form of ip1aip2, where ip1, ip2 are the adjacent character n-grams, and c = (ip1, ip2) is the context of a in this occurrence.",

        "As mentioned earlier, the instances in the neighborhood serve as pseudo-negative examples from which probability mass can be taken away.",
