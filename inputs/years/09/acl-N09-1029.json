        "BTG is widely adopted in SMT systems, because of its good trade-off between efficiency and expressiveness (Wu, 1996).",
        "In BTG, the ratio of legal alignments and all possible alignment in a translation pair drops drastically especially for long sentences, yet it still covers most of the syntactic diversities between two languages.",
        "It is common to utilize phrase translation in BTG systems.",
        "For example in (Xiong et al., 2006), source sentences are segmented into phrases.",
        "Each sequences of consecutive phrases, mapping to cells in a CKY matrix, are then translated through a bilingual phrase table and scored as implemented in (Koehn et al., 2005; Chiang, 2005).",
        "In other words, their system shares the same phrase table with standard phrase-based SMT systems.",
        "three years ago after three years",
        "On the other hand, there are various proposed BTG reordering models to predict correct orientations between neighboring blocks (bilingual phrases).",
        "In Figure 1, for example, the role of reordering model is to predict correct orientations of neighboring blocks A1 and A2.",
        "In flat model (Wu, reordering probabilities are assigned uniformly during decoding, and can be tuned depending on different language pairs.",
        "It is clear, however, that this kind of model would suffer when the dominant rule is wrongly applied.",
        "Predicting orientations in BTG depending on context information can be achieved with lexical features.",
        "For example, Xiong et al.",
        "(2006) proposed MEBTG, based on maximum entropy (ME) classification with words as features.",
        "In MEBTG, first words of blocks are considered as the features, which are then used to train a ME model for predicting orientations of neighboring blocks.",
        "Xiong et al.",
        "(2008b) proposed a linguistically annotated BTG (LABTG), in which linguistic features such as POS and syntactic labels from source-side parse trees are used.",
        "Both MEBTG and LABTG achieved significant improvements over phrase-based Pharaoh (Koehn, 2004) and Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) respectively, on Chinese-to-English translation tasks.",
        "the details of the plan",
        "Figure 2: An inversion reordering example, with POS below source words, and class numbers below target words.",
        "However, current BTG-based reordering methods have been limited by the features used.",
        "Information might not be sufficient or representative, if only the first (or tail) words are used as features.",
        "For example, in Figure 2, consider target first-word features extracted from an inverted reordering example (Xiong et al., 2006) in MEBTG, in which first words on two blocks are both \"the\".",
        "This kind of feature set is too common and not representative enough to predict the correct orientation.",
        "Intuitively, one solution is to extend the feature set by considering both boundary words, forming a more complete boundary description.",
        "However, this method is still based on lexicalized features, which causes data sparseness problem and fails to generalize.",
        "In Figure 2, for example, the orientation should basically be the same, when the source/target words \"gfiH/plan\" from block A1 is replaced by other similar nouns and translations (e.g. \"plans\", \"events\" or \"meetings\").",
        "However, such features would be treated as unseen by the current ME model, since the training data can not possibly cover all such similar cases.",
        "In this paper we present an improved reordering model based on BTG, with bilingual linguistic features from neighboring blocks.",
        "To avoid data sparseness problem, both source and target words are classified; we perform part-of-speech (POS) tagging on source language, and word classification on target one, as shown in Figure 2.",
        "Additionally, features are extracted and classified depending on lengths of blocks in order to obtain a more informed model.",

        "Related Work",
        "In statistical machine translation, reordering model is concerned with predicting correct orders of target language sentence given a source language one and translation pairs.",
        "For example, in phrase-based distortion model is used, in which reordering probabilities depend on relative positions of target side phrases between adjacent blocks.",
        "However, distortion model can not model long-distance reordering, due to the lack of context information, thus is difficult to predict correct orders under different circumstances.",
        "Therefore, while phrase-based SMT moves from words to phrases as the basic unit of translation, implying effective local reordering within phrases, it suffers when determining phrase reordering, especially when phrases are longer than three words (Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "There have been much effort made to improve reordering model in SMT.",
        "For example, researchers have been studying CKY parsing over the last decade, which considers translations and orientations of two neighboring block according to grammar rules or context information.",
        "In hierarchical phrase-based systems (Chiang, 2005), for example, SCFG rules are automatically learned from aligned bilingual corpus, and are applied in CKY style decoding.",
        "As an another application of CKY parsing technique is BTG-based SMT.",

        "Different from Zhang's work, their model do not restrict non-syntactic phrases, and applies inverted rules on any pair of neighboring blocks.",
        "Although POS information is used in LABTG and Zhang's work, their models are syntax-oriented, since they focus on syntactic labels.",
        "Boundary POS is considered in LABTG only when source phrases are not syntactic phrases.",
        "In contrast to the previous works, we present a reordering model for BTG that uses bilingual information including class-level features of POS and word classes.",
        "Moreover, our model is dedicated to boundary features and considers different combinations of phrase lengths, rather than only first/tail words.",
        "In addition, current state-of-the-art Chinese parsers, including the one used in LABTG (Xiong et al., 2005), lag beyond in inaccuracy, compared with English parsers (Klein and Manning, 2003; Petrov and Klein 2007).",

        "Given the adjacent blocks Ai and A2, our goal includes (i) adding more linguistic and representative information to Ai and A2 and (2) finding a feature set function F' based on added linguistic information in order to train a more linguistically motivated and effective model.",
        "As described in Section i, designing a more complete feature set causes data sparseness problem, if we use lexical features.",
        "One natural solution is using POS and word class features.",
        "In our model, we perform Chinese POS tagging on source language.",

        "However, due to the relatively low accuracy of current Chinese parsers compared with English ones, we instead use CKIP Chinese word segmentation system (Ma and Chen, 2003) in order to derive Chinese tags with high accuracy.",
        "Moreover, compared with the Treebank Chinese tagset, the CKIP tagset provides more fine-grained tags, including many tags with semantic information (e.g., Nc for place nouns, Nd for time nouns), and verb transitivity and subcategorization (e.g., VA for intransitive verbs, VC for transitive verbs, VK for verbs that take a clause as object).",
        "On the other hand, using the POS features in combination with the lexical features in target language will cause another sparseness problem in the phrase table, since one source phrase would map to multiple target ones with different POS sequences.",
        "As an alternative, we use mkcls toolkit (Och, 1999), which uses maximum-likelihood principle to perform classification on target side.",
        "After classification, the toolkit produces a many-to-one mapping between English tokens and class numbers.",
        "Therefore, there is no ambiguity of word class in target phrases and word class features can be used independently to avoid data sparseness problem and the phrase table remains unchanged.",
        "As mentioned in Section 1, features based on words are not representative enough in some cases, and tend to cause sparseness problem.",
        "By classifying words we are able to linguistically generalize the features, and hence predict the rules more robustly.",
        "In Figure 2, for example, the target words are converted to corresponding classes, and form the more complete boundary feature set",
        "In the feature set (4), #14 is the class containing \"the\", #18 is the class containing \"plans\", and #50 is the class containing \"of.\"",

        "This extends to other nominal word classes to realize the general rule of inverting \"the ... NOUN\" and \"the ... of\".",
        "It is hard to achieve this kind of generality using only lexicalized feature.",
        "With word classification, we gather feature sets with similar concepts from the training data.",
        "Table 1 shows the word classes can be used effectively to cope with data sparseness.",
        "For example, the feature set (4) occurs 309 times in our training data, and only 2 of them are straight, with the remaining 307 inverted examples, implying that similar features based on word classes lead to similar orientation.",
        "Additional examples of similar feature sets with different word classes are shown in Table 1.",
        "straight/inverted graph, government plans, events bikes, motors day, month, year",
        "Boundary features using both the first and last words provide more detailed descriptions of neighboring blocks.",
