        "Syllabification is the process of dividing a word into its constituent syllables.",
        "Although some work has been done on syllabifying orthographic forms (Muller et al., 2000; Bouma, 2002; Marchand and Damper, 2007; Bartlett et al., 2008), syllables are, technically speaking, phonological entities that can only be composed of strings of phonemes.",
        "Most linguists view syllables as an important unit of prosody because many phonological rules and constraints apply within syllables or at syllable boundaries (Blevins, 1995).",
        "Apart from their purely linguistic significance, syllables play an important role in speech synthesis and recognition (Kiraz and Mobius, 1998; Pearson et al., 2000).",
        "The pronunciation of a given phoneme tends to vary depending on its location within a syllable.",
        "While actual implementations vary, text-to-speech (TTS) systems must have, at minimum, three components (Damper, 2001): a letter-to-phoneme (L2P) module, a prosody module, and a synthesis module.",
        "Syllabification can play a role in all three modules.",
        "Because of the productive nature of language, a dictionary lookup process for syllabification is inadequate.",
        "No dictionary can ever contain all possible words in a language.",
        "For this reason, it is necessary to develop systems that can automatically syllabify out-of-dictionary words.",
        "In this paper, we advance the state-of-the-art in both categorical (non-statistical) and supervised syllabification.",
        "We outline three categorical approaches based on common linguistic theories of syllabification.",
        "We demonstrate that when implemented carefully, such approaches can be very effective, approaching supervised performance.",
        "We also present a data-driven, discriminative solution: a Support Vector Machine Hidden Markov Model (SVM-HMM), which tags each phoneme with its syllabic role.",
        "Given enough data, the SVM-HMM achieves impressive accuracy thanks to its ability to capture context-dependent generalizations, while also memorizing inevitable exceptions.",
        "Our experiments on English, Dutch and German demonstrate that our SVM-HMM approach substantially outperforms the existing state-of-the-art learning approaches.",
        "Although direct comparisons are difficult, our system achieves over 99% word accuracy on German and Dutch, and the highest reported accuracy on English.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "We outline common linguistic theories of syllabification in Section 2, and we survey previous computational systems in Section 3.",
        "Our linguistically-motivated approaches are described in Section 4.",
        "In Section 5, we describe our system based on the SVM-HMM.",

        "There is some debate as to the exact structure of a syllable.",
        "However, phonologists are in general agreement that a syllable consists of a nucleus (vowel sound), preceded by an optional onset and followed by an optional coda.",
        "In many languages, both the onset and the coda can be complex, i.e., composed of more than one consonant.",
        "For example, the word breakfast [brek-fast] contains two syllables, of which the first has a complex onset [br], and the second a complex coda [st].",
        "Languages differ with respect to various typological parameters, such as optionality of onsets, admissibility of codas, and the allowed complexity of the syllable constituents.",
        "For example, onsets are required in German, while Spanish prohibits complex codas.",
        "There are a number of theories of syllabification; we present three of the most prevalent.",
        "The Legality Principle constrains the segments that can begin and end syllables to those that appear at the beginning and end of words.",
        "In other words, a syllable is not allowed to begin with a consonant cluster that is not found at the beginning of some word, or end with a cluster that is not found at the end of some word (Goslin and Frauenfelder, 2001).",
        "Thus, a word like admit [admit] must be syllabified [adm t] because [dm] never appears word-initially or word-finally in English.",
        "A shortcoming of the legality principle is that it does not always imply a unique syllabification.",
        "For example, in a word like askew [askju], the principle does not rule out any of [9-skju], [as-kju], or [ask-ju], as all three employ legal onsets and codas.",
        "The Sonority Sequencing Principle (SSP) provides a stricter definition of legality.",
        "The sonority of a sound is its inherent loudness, holding factors like pitch and duration constant (Crystal, 2003).",
        "Low vowels like [a], the most sonorous sounds, are high on the sonority scale, while plosive consonants like [t] are at the bottom.",
        "When syllabifying a word, SSP states that sonority should increase from the first phoneme of the onset to the syllable's nucleus, and then fall off to the coda (Selkirk, 1984).",
        "Consequently, in a word like vintage [vmtidj], we can rule out a syllabification like [vi-ntidj] because [n] is more sonorant than [t].",
        "However, SSP does not tell us whether to prefer [v n-t ] or [v nt- ].",
        "Moreover, when syllabifying a word like vintner [v ntn r], the theory allows both [v n-tn r] and [v nt-n r], even though [tn] is an illegal onset in English.",
        "Both the Legality Principle and SSP tell us which onsets and codas are permitted in legal syllables, and which are not.",
        "However, neither theory gives us any guidance when deciding between legal onsets.",
        "The Maximal Onset Principle addresses this by stating we should extend a syllable's onset at the expense of the preceding syllable's coda whenever it is legal to do so (Kahn, 1976).",
        "For example, the principle gives preference to [ -skju] and [v n-t ] over their alternatives."

        "Unlike tasks such as part of speech tagging or syntactic parsing, syllabification does not involve structural ambiguity.",

        "(Blevins, 1995).",
        "However, in speech applications, the phonemic transcription of a word is often the only linguistic information available to the system.",
        "This is the common assumption underlying a number of computational approaches that have been proposed for the syllabification of phonemes.",
        "Daelemans and van den Bosch (1992) present one of the earliest systems on automatic syllabification: a neural network-based implementation for Dutch.",
        "Daelemans et al.",
        "(1997) also explore the application ofexemplar-based generalization (EBG), sometimes called instance-based learning.",
        "EBG generally performs a simple database lookup to syllabify a test pattern, choosing the most common syllabification.",
        "In cases where the test pattern is not found in the database, the most similar pattern is used to syllabify the test pattern.",
        "Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are another popular approach to syllabification.",
        "Krenn (1997) introduces the idea of treating syllabification as a tagging task.",
        "Working from a list of syllabified phoneme strings, she automatically generates tags for each phone.",
        "She uses a second-order HMM to predict sequences of tags; syllable boundaries can be trivially recovered from the tags.",
        "Demberg (2006) applies a fourth-order HMM to the syllabification task, as a component of a larger German text-to-speech system.",
        "Schmid et al.",
        "(2007) improve on Demberg's results by applying a fifth-order HMM that conditions on both the previous tags and their corresponding phonemes.",
        "Kiraz and Mobius (1998) present a weighted finite-state-based approach to syllabification.",
        "Their language-independent method builds an automaton for each of onsets, nuclei, and codas, by counting occurrences in training data.",
        "These automatons are then composed into a transducer accepting sequences of one or more syllables.",

        "Pearson et al.",
        "(2000) compare two rule-based systems (they do not elaborate on the rules employed) with a CART decision tree-based approach and a \"global statistics\" algorithm.",
        "The global statistics method is based on counts of consonant clusters in contexts such as word boundaries, short vowels, or long vowels.",
        "Each test word has syllable boundaries placed according to the most likely location given a cluster and its context.",
        "In experiments performed with their in-house dataset, their statistics-based method outperforms the decision-tree approach and the two rule-based methods.",
        "Muller (2001) presents a hybrid of a categorical and data-driven approach.",
        "First, she manually constructs a context-free grammar of possible syllables.",
        "This grammar is then made probabilistic using counts obtained from training data.",
        "Muller (2006) attempts to make her method language-independent.",
        "Rather than hand-crafting her context-free grammar, she automatically generates all possible onsets, nuclei, and codas, based on the phonemes existing in the language.",
        "The results are somewhat lower than in (Muller, 2001), but the approach can be more easily ported across languages.",
        "Goldwater and Johnson (2005) also explore using EM to learn the structure of English and German phonemes in an unsupervised setting, following Muller in modeling syllable structure with PCFGs.",
        "They initialize their parameters using a deterministic parser implementing the sonority principle and estimate the parameters for their maximum likelihood approach using EM.",
        "Marchand et al.",
        "(2007) apply their Syllabification by Analogy (SbA) technique, originally developed for orthographic forms, to the pronunciation domain.",
        "For each input word, SbA finds the most similar substrings in a lexicon of syllabified phoneme strings and then applies the dictionary syllabifications to the input word.",
        "Their survey paper also includes comparisons with a method broadly based on the legality principle.",

        "We present three categorical algorithms that implement the linguistic insights outlined in Section 2.",
        "All three can be viewed as variations on the basic pseudo-code shown in Figure 1.",
        "Every vowel is labeled as a nucleus, and every consonant is labeled as either an onset or a coda.",

        "The three methods differ in how they determine a \"legal\" onset.",
        "As a rough baseline, the MaxOnset implementation considers all combinations ofconsonants to be legal onsets.",
        "Only word-final consonants are labeled as codas.",
        "Legality combines the Legality Principle with onset maximization.",
        "In our implementation, we collect all word-initial consonant clusters from the corpus and deem them to be legal onsets.",
        "With this method, no syllable can have an onset that does not appear word-initially in the training data.",
        "We do not test for the legality of codas.",
        "The performance of Legality depends on the number of phonetic transcriptions that are available, but the transcriptions need not be annotated with syllable breaks.",
        "Sonority combines the Sonority Sequencing Principle with onset maximization.",

        "until current phoneme is a vowel",
        "label current phoneme as an onset end loop",
        "until all phonemes have been labeled label current phoneme as a nucleus if there are no more vowels in the word label all remaining consonants as codas onset := all consonants before next vowel coda := empty until onset is legal coda := coda plus first phoneme of onset onset := onset less first phoneme end loop end if end loop",

        "consonants.",
        "Sonority requires no training data because it implements a sound linguistic theory.",

        "Several sonority scales of varying complexity have been proposed.",
        "For example, Selkirk (1984) specifies a hierarchy of eleven distinct levels.",
        "We adopt a minimalistic scale shown in Figure 2. which avoids most of the disputed sonority contrasts (Jany et al., 2007).",
        "We set the sonority distance parameter to 2, which ensures that adjacent consonants in the onset differ by at least two levels of the scale.",
        "For example, [pr] is an acceptable onset because it is composed of an obstruent and a liquid, but [pn] is not, because nasals directly follow obstruents on our sonority scale.",
        "In addition, we incorporate several English-specific constraints listed by Kenstowicz (1994, pages 257-258).",

        "In principle, we could use a multi-class SVM to classify each phoneme according to its position in a syllable on the basis of a set of features.",
        "However, a traditional SVM would treat each phoneme in a word as an independent instance, preventing us from considering interactions between labels.",
        "In order to overcome this shortcoming, we employ an SVM-HMM (Al-tun et al., 2003), an instance of the Structured SVM formalism (Tsochantaridis et al., 2004) that has been specialized for sequence tagging.",
        "When training a structured SVM, each training instance xi is paired with its label yi, drawn from the set of possible labels, Yi.",
        "In our case, the training instances xi are words, represented as sequences of phonemes, and their labels yi are syllabifications, represented as sequences of onset/nucleus/coda tags.",

        "We also discovered that accuracy can be improved by numbering the tags.",
        "Therefore, in our tagging scheme, the single-syllable word strengths [strenSs] would be labeled with the sequence {O1 O2O3N1 C1 C2C3}.",

        "Unlike a generative HMM, these emission features do not require any conditional independence assumptions.",
        "Transition features link tags to tags.",
        "Our only transition features are counts of adjacent tag pairs occurring in y.",
        "For the emission features, we use the current phoneme and a fixed-size context window of surrounding phonemes.",
        "Thus, the features for the phoneme [k] in hockey [haki] might include the [a] preceding it, and the [i] following it.",
        "In experiments on our development set, we found that the optimal window size is nine: four phonemes on either side of the focus phoneme.",

        "The maximal onset principle appears to hold much more strongly for English than forGerman and Dutch (e.g.,patron: [pe-tran] vs. [pat-ron]).",
        "Legality and Sonority also appear to be less effective, possibly because of greater tendency for syllabifications to match morphological boundaries (e.g., English exclusive: [ik-sklu-siv] vs. Dutch ex-clusief [eks-kly-zif]).",
        "Sonority is further affected by our decision to employ the constraints of Ken-stowicz (1994), although they clearly pertain to English.",
        "We expect that adapting them to specific languages would bring the results closer to the level of the English experiments.",
        "Although our SVM system is tuned using an English development set, the results on both German and Dutch are excellent.",
        "We could not find any quantitative data for comparisons on Dutch, but the comparison with the previously reported results on German CELEX demonstrates the quality of our approach.",

        "We have presented several different approaches to the syllabification of phonemes.",
        "The results of our linguistically-motivated algorithms, show that it is possible to achieve adequate syllabification word accuracy in English with no little or no syllable-annotated training data.",
        "We have demonstrated that the poor performance of categorical methods on English NETtalk actually points to problems with the NETtalk annotations, rather than with the methods themselves.",
        "We have also shown that SVM-HMMs can be used to great effect when syllabifying phonemes.",
        "In addition to being both efficient and language-independent, they establish a new state-of-the-art for English and Dutch syllabification.",
        "However, they do require thousands of labeled training examples to achieve this level of accuracy.",
        "in the future, we plan to explore a hybrid approach, which would benefit from both the generality of linguistic principles and the smooth exception-handling of supervised techniques, in order to make best use of whatever data is available."
