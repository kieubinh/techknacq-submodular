        "Automated systems for evaluating highly predictable speech (e.g. read speech or speech that is quite constrained in the use of vocabulary and syntactic structures) have emerged in the past decade (Bernstein, 1999; Witt, 1999; Franco et al., 2000; Hacker et al., 2005) due to the growing maturity of speech recognition and processing technologies.",
        "However, endeavors into automated scoring for spontaneous speech have been sparse given the challenge of both recognizing and assessing spontaneous speech.",
        "This paper addresses the development and evaluation of pronunciation features for an automated system for scoring spontaneous speech.",
        "This system was deployed for the TOEFL®Practice Online (TPO) assessment used by prospective test takers to prepare for the official TOEFL®test.",
        "A construct is a set of knowledge, skills, and abilities measured by a test.",
        "The construct of the speaking test is embodied in the rubrics that human raters use to score the test.",
        "It consists of three key categories: delivery, language use, and topic development.",
        "Delivery refers to the pace and the clarity of the speech, including performance on intonation, rhythm, rate of speech, and degree of hesitancy.",
        "Language use refers to the range, complexity, and precision of vocabulary and grammar use.",
        "Topic development refers to the coherence and fullness of the response.",
        "Most of the research on spontaneous speech assessment focuses on the delivery aspect given the low recognition accuracy on non-native spontaneous speech.",
        "The delivery aspect can be measured on four dimensions: fluency, intonation, rhythm, and pronunciation.",
        "For the TPO assessment, we have defined pronunciation as the quality of vowels, consonants and word-level stress (segmentals).",
        "Intonation and sentence-level stress patterns (supra-segmentals) are not defined as part of pronunciation.",
        "Pronunciation is one of the key factors that impact the intelligibility and perceived comprehensibility of speech.",
        "Because pronunciation plays an important role in speech perception, features measuring pronunciation using speech technologies have been explored in many previous studies.",
        "However, the bulk of the research on automatic pronunciation evaluation concerns read speech or highly predictable speech (Witt, 1999; Franco et al., 2000; Hacker et al., 2005), where there is a high possibility of success in speech recognition.",
        "Automatic pronunciation evaluation is challenging for spontaneous speech and has been under-explored.",
        "In this paper, we will describe a method for extracting pronunciation features based on spontaneous speech that is well motivated by theories and supported by empirical evaluations of feature performance.",
        "In conceptualizing and computing these features, we draw on the literature on automatic pronunciation evaluation for constrained speech.",
        "As described in the related work in Section 2, the widely used features for measuring pronunciation are (1) likelihood (posterior probability) of a phoneme being spoken given the observed audio sample that is computed in a Viterbi decoding process, and (2) phoneme length measurements that are compared to standard references based on native speech.",
        "However, we have also come up with unique solutions to address the issue of relatively low accuracy in recognizing spontaneous speech.",
        "Our methods of feature extraction are designed with considerations of how to best capture the quality of pronunciation given technological constraints.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the related research; Section 3 describes our method to extract a set of features for measuring pronunciation; Section 4 describes the design of the experiments, including the questions investigated, the data, the speech processing technologies, and the measurement metrics; Section 5 reports on the experimental results; Section 6 discusses the experimental results; and Section 7 summaries the findings and future research planned."

        "This paper presents a method for computing features for assessing the pronunciation quality of non-native spontaneous speech, guided by construct considerations.",
        "We were able to show that using a two-stage method of first recognizing speech with a non-native AM and then forced aligning of the hypothesis using a native or near-native speech AM we can generate pronunciation features with promising correlations with holistic scores assigned by human raters.",
        "We plan to continue our research in the following directions: (1) we will improve the native speech norms for vowel durations, such as using the distribution of vowel durations rather than just the mean of durations in our feature computations; (2) we will investigate other aspects of pronunciation, e.g., consonant quality and word stress; (3) we will add other standard varieties of English (such as British, Canadian, Australian, etc) to the training corpus for the reference pronunciation model as the current model is trained on primarily North American English (NaE)."
