        "Despite numerous studies demonstrating the serious shortcomings of the n-gram language models, it has been surprisingly difficult to outperform n-gram language models consistently across different domains, tasks and languages.",
        "It is well-known that n-gram language models are not effective in modeling long range lexical, syntactic and semantic dependencies.",
        "Nevertheless, n-gram models have been very appealing due to their simplicity; they require only a plain corpus of data to train the model.",
        "The improvements obtained by some more elaborate language models (Chelba & Jelinek, 2000; Erdogan et al., 2005) come from the explicit use of syntactic and semantic knowledge put into the annotated corpus.",
        "In addition to the mentioned problems above, traditional n-gram language models do not lend themselves easily to rapid and effective adaptation and discriminative training.",
        "A typical n-gram model contains millions of parameters and has no structure capturing dependencies and relationships between the words beyond a limited local context.",
        "These parameters are estimated from the empirical distributions, and suffer from data sparseness.",
        "n-gram language model adaptation (to new domain, speaker, genre and language) is difficult, simply because of the large number of parameters, for which large amount of adaptation data is required.",
        "Instead of updating model parameters with an adaptation method, the typical practice is to collect some data in the target domain and build a domain specific language model.",
        "The domain specific language model is interpolated with a generic language model trained on a larger domain independent data to achieve robustness.",
        "On the other hand, rapid adaptation for acoustic modeling, using such methods as Maximum Likelihood Linear Regression (MLLR) (Leg-etter & Woodland, 1995), is possible using very small amount of acoustic data, thanks to the inherent structure of acoustic models that allow large degrees of parameter tying across different words (several thousand context dependent states are shared by all the words in the dictionary).",
        "Likewise, even though discriminatively trained acoustic models have been widely used, discriminatively trained languages models (Roark et al., 2007) have not widely accepted as a standard practice yet.",
        "In this study, we present a new perspective to the language modeling.",
        "In this perspective, words are not treated as discrete entities but rather vectors of real numbers.",
        "As a result, long-term semantic relationships between the words could be quantified and can be integrated into a model.",
        "The proposed formulation casts the language modeling problem as an acoustic modeling problem in speech recognition.",
        "This approach opens up new possibilities from rapid and effective adaptation oflanguage models to using discriminative acoustic modeling tools and methods, such as Minimum Phone Error (MPE) (Povey & Woodland, 2002) training to train discriminative language models.",
        "We introduced the idea of language modeling in continuous space from the acoustic modeling perspective and proposed Gaussian Mixture Language Model (GMLM) (Afify et al., 2007).",
        "However, GMLM has model parameter estimation problems.",
        "In GMLM each word is represented by a specific set of Gaussian mixtures.",
        "Robust parameter estimation of the Gaussian mixtures requires hundreds or even thousands of examples.",
        "As a result, we were able to estimate the GMLM probabilities only for words that have at least 50 or more examples.",
        "Essentially, this was meant to estimate the GMLM probabilities for only about top 10% of the words in the vocabulary.",
        "Not surprisingly, we have not observed improvements in speech recognition accuracy (Afify et does not have these requirements in model estimation.",
        "In fact, language model probabilities can be estimated for words having as few as two occurrences in the training data.",
        "The concept of language modeling in continuous space was previously proposed (Bengio et al., 2003; Schwenk & Gauvain, 2003) using Neural Networks.",
        "However, our method offers several potential advantages over (Schwenk & Gauvain, 2003) including adaptation, and modeling of semantic dependencies because of the way we represent the words in the continuous space.",
        "Moreover, our method also allows efficient model training using large amounts of training data, thanks to the acoustic modeling tools and methods which are optimized to handle large amounts of data efficiently.",
        "It is important to note that we have to realize the full potential of the proposed model, before investigating the potential benefits such as adaptation and discriminative training.",
        "To this end, we propose TMLM, which does not have the problems GMLM has and, unlike GMLM we report improvements in speech recognition over the corresponding n-gram models.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 presents the concept of language modeling in continuous space.",
        "Section 3 describes the tied-mixture modeling.",
        "Speech recognition architecture is summarized in Section 4, followed by the experimental results in Section 5.",

        "The language model training in continuous space has three main steps; namely, creation of a cooccurrence matrix, mapping discrete words into a continuous parameter space in the form of vectors of real numbers and training a statistical parametric model.",
        "Now, we will describe each step in detail.",
        "There are many ways that discrete words can be mapped into a continuous space.",
        "The approach we take is based on Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Deerwester et al., 1990), and begins with the creation of a co-occurrence matrix.",
        "The co-occurrence matrix can be constructed in several ways, depending on the morphological complexity of the language.",
        "For a morphologically impoverished language, such as English the cooccurrence matrix can be constructed using word bigram co-occurrences.",
        "For morphologically rich languages, there are several options to construct a cooccurrence matrix.",
        "For example, the co-occurrence matrix can be constructed using either words (wordword co-occurrences) or morphemes (morphememorpheme co-occurrences), which are obtained after morphologically tokenizing the entire corpus.",
        "In addition to word-word or morpheme-morpheme co-occurrence matrices, a word-morpheme cooccurrence matrix can also be constructed.",
        "A word w can be decomposed into a set of prefixes, stem and suffixes: w = [pfx\\ + pfx2 + pfxn + stem + sfx\\ + sfx2 + sfxn].",
        "The columns of such a matrix contain words and the rows contain the corresponding morphological decomposition (i.e. morphemes) making up the word.",
        "The decomposition of this matrix (as will be described in the next sub-section) can allow joint modeling of words and morphemes in one model.",
        "In this study, we use morpheme level bigram cooccurrences to construct the matrix.",
        "All the morpheme bigrams are accumulated for the entire corpus to fill in the entries of a co-occurrence matrix, C, where C(wi,Wj) denotes the counts for which word Wi follows word Wj in the corpus.",
        "This is a large, but very sparse matrix, since typically a small number of words follow a given word.",
        "Because of its large size and sparsity, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a natural choice for producing a reduced-rank approximation of this matrix.",
        "The co-occurrence matrices typically contain a small number of high frequency events and a large number of less frequent events.",
        "Since SVD derives a compact approximation of the co-occurrence matrix that is optimal in the least-square sense, it best models these high-frequency events, which may not be the most informative.",
        "Therefore, the entries of a word-pair co-occurrence matrix are smoothed according to the following expression:",
        "Following the notation presented in (Bellegarda, 2000) we proceed to perform the SVD as follows:",
        "where U is a left singular matrix with row vectors ui (1 < i < M) and dimension M x R. S is a diagonal matrix of singular values with dimension R x R. V is a right singular matrix with row vectors vj (1 < j < N ) and dimension N x R. R is the order of the decomposition and R <C min(M, N).",
        "M and N are the vocabulary sizes on the rows and columns of the co-occurrence matrix, respectively.",
        "For word-word or morpheme-morpheme co-occurrence matrices M = N, but for wordmorpheme co-occurrence matrix, M is the number of unique words in the training corpus and N is the number of unique morphemes in morphologically tokenized training corpus.",
        "The continuous space for the words listed on the rows of the co-occurrence matrix is defined as the space spanned by the column vectors of AM xR = US.",
        "Similarly, the continuous space for the words on the columns are defined as the space spanned by the row vectors of BRxN = SVT.",
        "Here, for a word-word co-occurrence matrix, each of the scaled vectors (by S) in the columns of A and rows of B are called latent word history vectors for the forward and backward bigrams, respectively.",
        "Now, a bigram wij = (wi,Wj) (1 < i,j < M) is represented as a vector of dimension M x 1, where the ith entry of wij is 1 and the remaining ones are zero.",
        "This vector is mapped to a lower dimensional vector Wij by:",

        "where W)ji has dimension of R x 1.",
        "Note that for a word-morpheme co-occurrence matrix the rows of B would contain latent morpheme vectors.",
        "Since a trigram history consists of two bigram histories, a trigram history vector is obtained by concatenating two bigram vectors.",
        "Having generated the features, now we explain the structure of the parametric model and how to train it for language modeling in continuous space.",
        "Recalling the necessary inputs to train an acoustic model for speech recognition would be helpful to explain the new language modeling method.",
        "The acoustic model training in speech recognition needs three inputs: 1) features (extracted from the speech waveform), 2) transcriptions of the speech waveforms and 3) baseforms, which show the pronunciation of each word in the vocabulary.",
        "We propose to model the language model using HMMs.",
        "The HMM parameters are estimated in such way that the given set of observations is represented by the model in the \"best\" way.",
        "The \"best\" can be defined in various ways.",

        "In ML, we maximize the probability of a given sequence of observations O, belonging to a given class, given the HMM X of the class, with respect to the parameters of the model X.",
        "This probability is the total likelihood of the observations and can be expressed mathematically as:",
        "However, there is no known way to analytically solve for the model A = {A, B,n} , which maximize the quantity Ltot, where A is the transition probabilities, B is the observation probabilities, and n is the initial state distribution.",

        "5 is the same objective function used to estimate the parameters of an HMM based acoustic model.",
        "By drawing an analogy between the acoustic model training and language modeling in continuous space, the history vectors are considered as the acoustic observations (feature vectors) and the next word to be predicted is considered as the label the acoustic features belong to, and words with their morphological decompositions can be considered as the lexicon or dictionary.",

        "1 presents the topology of the model for modeling a word sequence of 3 words.",
        "Each word is modeled with a single state left-to-right HMM topology.",

        "In the figure, let the states be the words and the observations that they emit are the morphemes (or characters in the case of Chinese).",
        "The same topology (3 states) can also be used to model a single word, where the first state models the prefixes, the middle state models the stem and the final state models the suffixes.",
        "In this case, words are represented by network of morphemes.",
        "Each path in a word network represents a segmentation (or \"pronunciation\") of the word.",
        "The basic idea of the proposed modeling is to create a separate model for each word of the language and use the language model corpus to estimate the parameters of the model.",
        "However, one could argue that the basic model could be improved by taking the contexts of the morphemes into account.",

        "In order to evaluate the performance of the TMLM, a lattice with a low oracle error rate was generated by a Viterbi decoder using the word tri-gram model (Word-3gr) model.",
        "From the lattice at most 30 (N=30) sentences are extracted for each utterance to form an N-best list.",
        "The N-best error rate for the combined test set (All) is 22.7%.",
        "The N-best size is limited (it is not in the hundreds), simply because of faster experiment turn-around.",
        "These utterances are rescored using TMLM.",
        "The results are presented in Table 1.",
        "The first two rows in the table show the baseline numbers for the word trigram (Word-3gr) model.",
        "TestA has a WER of 18.7% similar to that of TestB (18.6%).",
        "The WER for TestC is relatively high (38.9%), because, as explained above, TestC contains causal conversation with hesitations and repairs, and speakers do not necessarily stick to the domain.",
        "Moreover, when users are speaking to a device, as in the case of TestA and TestB, they use clear and shorter sentences, which are easier to recognize.",
        "The TMLM does not provide improvements for TestA and TestB but it improves the WER by 0.7% for TestC.",
        "The combined overall result is a 0.4% improvement over baseline.",
        "This improvement is not statistically significant.",
        "However, interpolating TMLM with Word-3gr improves the WER to 31.9%, which is 1.0% better than that of the Word-3gr.",
        "Standard p-test (Matched Pairs Sentence-Segment Word Error test available in standard SCLITEs statistical system comparison program from NIST) shows that this improvement is significant at p < 0.05 level.",

        "Despite limited but encouraging experimental results, we believe that the proposed perspective is a radical departure from the traditional n-gram based language modeling methods.",
        "The new perspective opens up a number of avenues which are impossible to explore in one paper.",
        "We realize that there are a number of outstanding issues with the proposed perspective that require a closer look.",
        "We make a number of decisions to build a language model within this perspective.",
        "The decisions are sometimes ad hoc.",
        "The decisions are made in order to build a working system and are by no means the best decisions.",
        "In fact, it is quite likely that a different set of decisions may result into a better system.",
        "Using a word-morpheme co-occurrence matrix instead of a morpheme-morpheme co-occurrence matrix is one such decision.",
        "Another one is the clustering/tying of the rarely observed events to achieve robust parameter estimation both for the SVD and TMLM parameter estimation.",
        "We also use a trivial decision tree to build the models where there were no context questions.",
        "Clustering morphemes with respect to their syntactic and semantic context is another area which should be explored.",
        "In fact, we are in the process of building these models.",
        "Once we have realized the full potential of the baseline maximum likelihood TMLM, then we will investigate the discriminative training methods such as MPE (Povey & Woodland, 2002) to further improve the language model performance and adaptation to new domains using MLLR (Legetter & Woodland, 1995).",
        "We also realize that different problems such as segmentation (e.g. Chinese) of words or morphological decomposition of words into morphemes can be addressed within the proposed perspective."
