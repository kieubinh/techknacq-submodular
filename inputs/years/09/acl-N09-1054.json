        "Web logging (blogging) and its social impact have recently attracted considerable public and scientific interest.",
        "One use of blogs is as a community discussion forum, especially for political discussion and debate.",
        "Blogging has arguably opened a new channel for huge numbers of people to express their views with unprecedented speed and to unprecedented audiences.",
        "Their collective behavior in the blogosphere has already been noted in the American political arena (Adamic and Glance, 2005).",
        "In this paper we attempt to deliver a framework useful for analyzing text in blogs quantitatively as well as qualitatively.",
        "Better blog text analysis could lead to better automated recommendation, organization, extraction, and retrieval systems, and might facilitate data-driven research in the social sciences.",
        "Apart from the potential social utility of text processing for this domain, we believe blog data is worthy of scientific study in its own right.",
        "The spontaneous, reactive, and informal nature of the language in this domain seems to defy conventional analytical approaches in NLP such as supervised text classification (Mullen and Malouf, 2006), yet the data are rich in argumentative, topical, and temporal structure that can perhaps be modeled computationally.",
        "We are especially interested in the semi-causal structure of blog discussions, in which a post \"spawns\" comments (or fails to do so), which meander among topics and asides and show the personality of the participants and the community.",
        "Our approach is to develop probabilistic models for the generation of blog posts and comments jointly within a blog site.",
        "The model is an extension of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Blei et al., 2003).",
        "Unsupervised topic models can be applied to collections of unannotated documents, requiring very little corpus engineering.",
        "They can be easily adapted to new problems by altering the graphical model, then applying standard probabilistic inference algorithms.",
        "Different models can be compared to explore the ramifications of different hypotheses about the data.",
        "For example, we will explore whether the contents of posts a user has commented on in the past and the words she has used can help predict which posts she will respond to in the future.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "In ยง2 we review prior work on topic modeling for document collections and studies of social media like political blogs.",
        "We then provide a qualitative characterization of political blogs, highlighting some of the features we believe a computational model should capture and discuss our new corpus of political blogs (ยง3).",
        "We present several different candidate topic models that aim to capture these ideas in ยง4.",

        "The study modeled the large, complex structure of the political blogosphere as a network of hyperlinks among the blog sites, demonstrated the viability of link structure for information discovery, though their analysis of text content was less extensive.",
        "In contrast, the text seems to be of interest to social scientists studying blogs as an artifact of the political process.",

        "The technique has been applied to Web document collections, notably for community discovery in social networks (Zhang et al., 2007), opinion mining in user reviews (Titov and McDonald, 2008), and sentiment discovery in free-text annotations (Branavan et al., 2008).",

        "(2004), following Cohn and Hofmann (2001), defined a generative process not only for each word in the text, but also its citation to other documents in the collection, thereby capturing the notion of relations between the document into one generative process.",

        "They further applied the Link-PLSA-LDA model to a blog corpus to analyze its cross citation structure via hyperlinks.",

        "We achieved some improvement over both the baseline and Naive Bayes for some cut-offs on three of the ive sites, though the gains were very small for and RS and CB.",
        "LinkLDA usually works slightly better than CommentLDA, except for MY, where CommentLDA is stronger, and RS, where Com-mentLDA is extremely poor.",
        "Differences in commenting style are likely to blame: MY has relatively long comments in comparison to RS, as well as DK.",
        "MY is the only site where CommentLDA variations consistently outperformed LinkLDA variations, as well as Naive Bayes classifiers.",
        "This suggests that sites with more terse comments may be too sparse to support a rich model like CommentLDA.",
        "In general, counting by response works best, though counting by comments is a close rival in some cases.",
        "We observe that counting by response tends to help LinkLDA, which is ignorant of the word contents of the comment, more than it helps CommentLDA.",
        "Varying the counting method can bring as much as 10% performance gain.",
        "Each of the models we have tested makes different assumptions about the behavior of commenters.",
        "Our results suggest that commenters on different sites behave differently, so that the same modeling assumptions cannot be made universally.",
        "In future work, we hope to permit blog-speciic properties to be automatically discovered during learning, so that, for example, the comment words can be exploited when they are helpful but assumed independent when they are not.",
        "Of course, improved performance might also be obtained with more topics, richer priors over topic distributions, or models that take into account other cues, such as the time of the post, pages it links to, etc.",
        "It is also possible that better performance will come from more sophisticated supervised models that do not use topics.",

        "Following previous work on LDA and its extensions, we show words most strongly associated with a few topics, arguing that some coherent clusters have been discovered.",
        "Table 3 shows topics discovered in MY using CommentLDA (counting by comments).",
        "This is the blog site where our models most consistently outperformed the Naive Bayes classi-iers and LinkLDA, therefore we believe the model was a good it for this dataset.",
        "Since the site is concentrated on American politics, many of the topics look alike.",
        "Table 3 shows the most probable words in the posts, comments, and both together for ive hand-picked topics that were relatively transparent.",
        "The probabilistic scores of those words are computed with the scoring method suggested by Blei and Lafferty (in press).",
        "The model clustered words into topics pertaining to religion and domestic policy (irst and last topics in Table 3) quite reasonably.",
        "Some of the religion-related words make sense in light of current affairs.",
        "Some words in the comment section are slightly off-topic from the issue of religion, such as dawkins or wright, but are relevant in the context of real-world events.",
        "Notice those words rank highly only in the comment section, showing differences between discussion in the post and the comments.",
        "This is also noticeable, for example, in the \"primary\" topic (second in Table 3), where the Republican primary receives more discussion in the main post, and in the \"Iraq war\" and \"energy\" topics, where bloggers discuss strategy and commenters focus on the tangible (oil, taxes, prices, weapons).",
        "While our topic-modeling approach achieves mixed results on the prediction task, we believe it holds promise as a way to understand and summarize the data.",
        "Without CommentLDA, we would not be able to easily see the differences noted above in blogger and commenter language.",
        "In future work, we plan to explore models with weaker independence assumptions among users, among blog posts over time, and even across blogs.",
        "This line of research will permit a more nuanced understanding of language in the blogosphere and in political discourse more generally."
