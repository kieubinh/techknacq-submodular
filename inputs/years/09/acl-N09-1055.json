        "With the in-depth study of sentiment analysis research, finer-grained opinion mining, which aims to detect opinions on different review features as opposed to the whole review level, has been receiving more and more attention in the sentiment analysis research community recently.",
        "Most of existing approaches rely mainly on the template extraction to identify the explicit relatedness between product feature and opinion terms, which is insufficient to detect the implicit review features and mine the hidden sentiment association in reviews, which satisfies (1) the review features are not appear explicit in the review sentences; (2) it can be deduced by the opinion words in its context.",
        "From an information theoretic point of view, this paper proposed an iterative reinforcement framework based on the improved information bottleneck algorithm to address such problem.",
        "More specifically, the approach clusters product features and opinion words simultaneously and iteratively by fusing both their semantic information and co-occurrence information.",

        "In the face of the volume of sentimental information available on the Internet continues to increase, there is growing interest in helping people better find, filter, and manage these resources.",

        "Institute of Computing Technology Beijing, China tansongbo@software.ict.ac.cn",
        "Automatic opinion mining (Turney et al., 2003; Ku et al., 2006; Devitt et al., 2007) can play an important role in a wide variety of more flexible and dynamic information management tasks.",
        "For example, with the help of sentiment analysis system, in the field of public administration, the administrators can receive the feedbacks on one policy in a timelier manner; in the field of business, manufacturers can perform more targeted updates on products to improve the consumer experience.",
        "The research of opinion mining began in 1997, the early research results mainly focused on the polarity of opinion words (Hatzivassiloglou et al., 1997) and treated the text-level opinion mining as a classification of either positive or negative on the number of positive or negative opinion words in one text (Turney et al., 2003; Pang et al., 2002; Zagibalov et al., 2008;).",
        "With the in-depth study of opinion mining, researchers committed their efforts for more accurate results: the research of sentiment summarization (Philip et al., 2004; Hu et al., KDD 2004), domain transfer problem of the sentiment analysis (Kanayama et al., 2006; Tan et al., dreevskaia et al., 2008; Tan et al., 2009) and finegrained opinion mining (Hatzivassiloglou et al., 2000; Takamura et al., 2007; Bloom et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2008; Titov et al., 2008) are the main branches of the research of opinion mining.",
        "In this paper, we focus on the fine-grained (feature-level) opinion mining.",
        "For many applications (e.g. the task of public affairs review analysis and the products review analysis), simply judging the sentiment orientation of a review unit is not sufficient.",
        "Researchers (Ku-shal, 2003; Hu et al., KDD 2004; Hu et al., AAAI 2004; Popescu et al., 2005) began to work on finer-grained opinion mining which predicts the sentiment orientation related to different review features.",
        "The task is known as feature-level opinion mining.",
        "In feature-level opinion mining, most of the existing researches associate product features and opinion words by their explicit co-occurrence.",
        "Template extraction based method (Popescu et al., 2005) and association rule mining based method (Hu et al., AAAI 2004) are the representative ones.",
        "These approaches did good jobs for identifying the review features that appear explicitly in reviews, however, real reviews from customers are usually complicated.",
        "In some cases, the review features are implicit in the review sentences, but can be deduced by the opinion words in its context.",
        "The detection of such hidden sentiment association is a big challenge in feature-level opinion mining on Chinese reviews due to the nature of Chinese language (Qi et al., 2008).",
        "Obviously, neither the template extraction based method nor the association rule mining based method is effective for such cases.",
        "Moreover, in some cases, even if the review features appear explicitly in the review sentences, the co-occurrence information between review features and opinion words is too quantitatively sparse to be utilized.",
        "So we consider whether it is a more sensible way to construct or cluster review feature groups and opinion words groups to mine the implicit or hidden sentiment association in the reviews.",
        "The general approach will cluster the two types of objects separately, which neglects the highly interrelationship.",
        "To address this problem, in this paper, we propose an iterative reinforcement framework, under which we cluster product features and opinion words simultaneously and iteratively by fusing both their semantic information and sentiment link information.",
        "We take improved information bottleneck algorithm (Tishby, 1999) as the kernel of the proposed framework.",
        "The information bottleneck approach was presented by Tishby (1999).",
        "The basic idea of the approach is that it treats the clustering problems from the information compressing point of view, and takes this problem as a case of much more fundamental problem: what are the features of the variable X that are relevant for the prediction of another, relevance, variable Y?",
        "Based on the information theory, the problem can be formulated as: find a compressed representation of the variable X, denoted C, such that the mutual information between C and Y is as high as possible, under a constraint on the mutual information between X and C. For our case, take the hotel reviews as example, X is one type of objects of review features (e.g. facilities, service, surrounding environment, etc) or opinion words (e.g. perfect, circumspect, quiet, etc), and Y is another one.",
        "Given some review features (or opinion words) gained from review corpus, we want to assemble them into categories, conserving the information about opinion words (or review features) as high as possible.",
        "The information bottleneck algorithm has some benefits, mainly including (1) it treats the trade-off of precision versus complexity of clustering model through the rate distortion theory, which is a sub-field of information theory; (2) it defines the \"distance\" or \"similarity\" in a well-defined way based on the mutual information.",
        "The efficiency of information bottleneck algorithm (Slonim and Tishby, 2000) motivates us to take it as the kernel of our framework.",
        "As far as we know, this approach has not been employed in opinion mining yet.",
        "In traditional information bottleneck approach, the distance between two data objects is measured by the Jensen-Shannon divergence (Lin, 1991), which aims to measure the divergence between two probability distributions.",
        "We alter this measure to integrate more semantic information, which will be illustrated in detail in the following sections, and the experimental result shows the effectiveness of the alteration.",
        "It would be worthwhile to highlight several aspects of our work here:",
        "• We propose an iterative reinforcement framework, and under this framework, review feature words and opinion words are organized into categories in a simultaneous and iterative manner.",
        "• In the process of clustering, the semantic information and the co-occurrence information are integrated.",

        "Roughly speaking, some of the mutual information will be lost in the process of compression, e.g.",
        "I (C, Y) < I (X, Y) (C is a compressed representation of X).",
        "This representation is defined through a (possibly stochastic) mapping between each value x X to each representative value c C. Formally, this mapping can be characterized by a conditional distribution p(c|x), inducing a soft partitioning of X values, Specifically, each value of X is associated with all the codebook elements (C values), with some normalized probability.",
