        "Many successful models of syntax are based on Probabilistic Context Free Grammars (PCFGs) (e.g., Collins (1999)).",
        "However, directly learning a PCFG from a treebank results in poor parsing performance, due largely to the unrealistic independence assumptions imposed by the context-free assumption.",
        "Considerable effort is required to coax good results from a PCFG, in the form of grammar engineering, feature selection and clever smoothing (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000; Charniak and Johnson, 2005; Johnson, 1998).",
        "This effort must be repeated when moving to different languages, grammar formalisms or treebanks.",
        "We propose that much of this hand-coded knowledge can be obtained automatically as an emergent property of the treebanked data, thereby reducing the need for human input in crafting the grammar.",
        "We present a model for automatically learning a Probabilistic Tree Substitution Grammar (PTSG), an extension to the PCFG in which non-terminals can rewrite as entire tree fragments (elementary trees), not just immediate children.",
        "These large fragments can be used to encode non-local context, such as head-lexicalisation and verb sub-categorisation.",
        "Since no annotated data is available providing TSG derivations we must induce the PTSG productions and their probabilities in an unsupervised way from an ordinary treebank.",
        "This is the same problem addressed by Data Oriented Parsing (DOP, Bod et al.",
        "(2003)), a method which uses as productions all subtrees of the training corpus.",
        "However, many of the DOP estimation methods have serious shortcomings (Johnson, 2002), namely inconsistency for DOP1 (Bod, 2003) and overfitting of the maximum likelihood estimate (Prescher et al., 2004).",
        "In this paper we develop an alternative means of learning a PTSG from a treebanked corpus, with the twin objectives of a) finding a grammar which accurately models the data and b) keeping the grammar as simple as possible, with few, compact, elementary trees.",
        "This is achieved using a prior to encourage sparsity and simplicity in a Bayesian non-parametric formulation.",
        "The framework allows us to perform inference over an infinite space of grammar productions in an elegant and efficient manner.",
        "The net result is a grammar which only uses the increased context afforded by the TSG when necessary to model the data, and otherwise uses context-free rules.",
        "That is, our model learns to use larger rules when the CFG's independence assumptions do not hold.",
        "This contrasts with DOP, which seeks to use all elementary trees from the training set.",
        "While our model is able, in theory, to use all such trees, in practice the data does not justify such a large grammar.",
        "Grammars that are only about twice the size of a treebank PCFG provide large gains in accuracy.",
        "We obtain additional improvements with grammars that are somewhat larger, but still much smaller than the DOP all-subtrees grammar.",
        "The rules in these grammars are intuitive, potentially offering insights into grammatical structure which could be used in, e.g., the development of syntactic ontologies and guidelines for future treebanking projects."

        "A Tree Substitution Grammar (TSG) is a 4-tuple, G = (T, N, S, R), where T is a set of terminal symbols, N is a set of non-terminal symbols, S e N is the distinguished root non-terminal and R is a set of productions (a.k.a.",
        "rules).",
        "The productions take the form of elementary trees - tree fragments of depth > 2, where each internal node is labelled with a non-terminal and each leaf is labelled with either a terminal or a non-terminal.",
        "Non-terminal leaves are called frontier non-terminals and form the substitution sites in the generative process of creating trees with the grammar.",
        "A derivation creates a tree by starting with the root symbol and rewriting (substituting) it with an elementary tree, then continuing to rewrite frontier non-terminals with elementary trees until there are no remaining frontier non-terminals.",
        "Unlike Context Free Grammars (CFGs) a syntax tree may not uniquely specify the derivation, as illustrated in Figure 1 which shows two derivations using different elementary trees to produce the same tree.",
        "A Probabilistic Tree Substitution Grammar (PTSG), like a PCFG, assigns a probability to each rule in the grammar.",
        "The probability of a derivation is the product of the probabilities of its component rules, and the probability of a tree is the sum of the probabilities of its derivations.",
        "As we mentioned in the introduction, work within the DOP framework seeks to induce PTSGs from treebanks by using all possible subtrees as rules, and one of a variety of methods for estimating rule probabilities.",
        "Our aim of inducing compact grammars contrasts with that of DOP; moreover, we develop a probabilistic estimator which avoids the shortcomings of DOP1 and the maximum likelihood estimate (Bod, 2000; Bod, 2003; Johnson, 2002).",
        "Recent work on DOP estimation also seeks to address these problems, drawing from estimation theory to solve the consistency problem (Prescher et al., 2004; Zollmann and Sima'an, 2005), or incorporating a grammar brevity term into the learning objective (Zuidema, 2007).",
        "Our work differs from these previous approaches in that we explicitly model a prior over grammars within a Bayesian framework.",
        "Models of grammar refinement (Petrov et al., 2006; Liang et al., 2007; Finkel et al., 2007) also aim to automatically learn latent structure underlying treebanked data.",
        "These models allow each nonterminal to be split into a number of subcategories.",
        "Theoretically the grammar space of our model is a subspace of theirs (projecting the TSG's elementary trees into CFG rules).",
        "However, the number of nonterminals required to recreate our TSG grammars in a PCFG would be exorbitant.",
        "Consequently, our model should be better able to learn specific lexical patterns, such as full noun-phrases and verbs with their sub-categorisation frames, while theirs are better suited to learning subcategories with larger membership, such as the terminals for days of the week and noun-adjective agreement.",
        "The approaches are orthogonal, and we expect that combining a category refinement model with our TSG model would provide better performance than either approach alone.",
        "Our model is similar to the Adaptor Grammar model of Johnson et al.",
        "(2007b), which is also a kind of Bayesian nonparametric tree-substitution grammar.",
        "However, Adaptor Grammars require that each sub-tree expands completely, with only terminal symbols as leaves, while our own model permits non-terminal frontier nodes.",
        "In addition, they disallow recursive containment of adapted non-terminals; we impose no such constraint."

        "Recall the nature of our task: we are given a corpus of parse trees t and wish to infer a tree-substitution grammar G that we can use to parse new data.",

        "a distribution over sequences of elementary trees e that compose to form t. We will then essentially read the grammar off the elementary trees, as described in Section 5.",
        "Our problem therefore becomes one of identifying the posterior distribution of e given t, which we can do using Bayes' Rule:",
        "Since the sequence of elementary trees can be split into derivations, each of which completely specifies a tree, P(t| e) is either equal to 1 (when t and e are consistent) or 0 (otherwise).",
        "Therefore, the work in our model is done by the prior distribution over elementary trees.",
        "Note that this is analogous to the Bayesian model of word segmentation presented by Goldwater et al.",
        "(2006); indeed, the problem of inferring e from t can be viewed as a segmentation problem, where each full tree must be segmented into one or more elementary trees.",
        "As in Goldwater et al.",
        "(2006), we wish to favour solutions employing a relatively small number of elementary units (here, elementary trees).",
        "This can be done using a Dirichlet process (DP) prior.",
        "Specifically, we define the distribution of elementary tree e with root non-terminal symbol c as where P0 (-| c) (the base distribution) is a distribution over the infinite space of trees rooted with c, and ac (the concentration parameter) controls the model's tendency towards either reusing elementary trees or creating novel ones as each training instance is encountered (and consequently, the tendency to infer larger or smaller sets of elementary trees from the observed data).",
        "We discuss the base distribution in more detail below.",
        "Rather than representing the distribution Gc explicitly, we integrate over all possible values of Gc.",
        "The resulting distribution over ej, conditioned on e<i = ei... ej_i and the root category c is:",
        "acPo(ei| c) where n<jc is the number number of times ei has been used to rewrite c in e<i, and n<cj = e n<c is the total count of rewriting c.",
        "As with other DP models, ours can be viewed as a cache model, where ei can be generated in one of two ways: by drawing from the base distribution, where the probability of any particular tree is proportional to acP0(ei| c), or by drawing from a cache of previous expansions of c, where the probability of any particular expansion is proportional to the number of times that expansion has been used before.",
        "This view makes it clear that the model embodies a \"rich-get-richer\" dynamic in which a few expansions will occur with high probability, but many will occur only once or twice, as is typical of natural language.",
        "Our model is similar in this way to the Adaptor Grammar model of Johnson et al.",
        "(2007a).",
        "We still need to define P0, the base distribution over tree fragments.",
        "We use two such distributions.",
        "The first, generates each elementary tree by a series of random decisions: whether to expand a non-terminal, how many children to produce and their identities.",
        "The probability of expanding a nonterminal node labelled c is parameterised via a binomial distribution, Bin(//c), while all other decisions are chosen uniformly at random.",
        "The second base distribution, P0p, has a similar generative process but draws non-terminal expansions from a treebank-trained PCFG instead of a uniform distribution.",
        "Both choices of P have the effect of biasing the model towards simple rules with a small number of internal nodes.",
        "The geometric increase in cost discourages the model from using larger rules; for this to occur these rules must yield a large increase in the data likelihood.",

        "We expect that tuning the treatment of unknown words in our model would also yield further gains.",
        "The grammar sizes are not strictly comparable, as the Berkeley bi-narised grammars prohibit non-binary rules, and are therefore forced to decompose each of these rules into many child rules.",
        "But the trend is clear - our model produces similar results to a state-of-the-art parser, and can do so using a small grammar.",
        "With additional rounds of split-merge training, the Berkeley grammar grows exponentially larger (200K rules after six iterations).",

        "We run the Gibbs sampler for 15,000 iterations while annealing from T = 5 to T = 1, after which we finish with 5,000 iterations at T = 1 .",
        "We repeat this three times, giving an average Fl of 84.0% on the testing partition using the maximum expected rule algorithm and 83.0% using the Viterbi algorithm.",
        "This far surpasses the ML-PCFG (Fl of 70.7%), and is similar to Zuidema's (2007) DOP result of 83.8%.",
        "However, it still well below state-of-the art parsers (e.g., the Berkeley parser trained using the same data representation scores 87.7%).",
        "But we must bear in mind that these parsers have benefited from years of tuning to the Penn-treebank, where our model is much simpler and is largely untuned.",
        "We anticipate that careful data preparation and model tuning could greatly improve our model's performance.",

        "This model has 56ll CFG rules and 1008 TSG rules.",
        "The TSG rules vary in depth from two to nine levels with the majority between two and four.",
        "Most rules combine a small degree of lexicalisation and a variable or two.",
        "This confirms that the model is learning local structures to encode, e.g., multi-word units, subcategorisation frames and lexical agreement.",
        "The few very large rules specify full parses for sentences which were repeated in the training corpus.",
        "These complete trees are also evident in the long tail of node counts (up to 27; not shown in the figure) and counts for highly lexicalised rules (up to 8).",

        "We can see that many of these rules are larger than CFG rules, showing that the CFG rules alone are inadequate to model the treebank.",
        "Two of the NP rules encode the prevalence of preposition phrases headed by 'of' within a noun phrase, as opposed to other prepositions.",
        "Also noteworthy is the lexicalisation of the determiner, which can affect the type of NP expansion.",
        "For instance, the indeinite article is more likely to have an adjectival modifier, while the definite article appears more frequently unmodified.",
        "Highly specific tokens are also incorporated into lexicalised rules.",
        "The model also learns to use large rules to describe the majority of root node expansions (we add a distinguished TOP node to all trees).",
        "These rules mostly describe cases when the S category is used for a full sentence, which most often include punctuation such as the full stop and quotation marks.",
        "In contrast, the majority of expansions for the S category do not include any punctuation.",
        "The model has learnt to differentiate between the two different classes of S - full sentence versus internal clause due to their different expansions."

      "text": [
        "In this work we have presented a non-parametric Bayesian model for inducing tree substitution grammars.",
        "By incorporating a structured prior over elementary rules our model is able to reason over the ininite space of all such rules, producing compact and simple grammars.",
        "In doing so our model learns local structures for latent linguistic phenomena, such as verb subcategorisation and lexical agreement.",
        "Our experimental results show that the induced grammars strongly outperform standard PCFGs, and are comparable to a state-of-the-art parser on small data samples.",
        "While our results on the full treebank are well shy of the best available parsers, we have proposed a number of improvements to the model and the parsing algorithm that could lead to state-of-the-art performance in the future.",
