        "Discourse parsing, namely, deriving such tree structures and the rhetorical relations labeling their inner nodes is still a challenging and mostly unsolved problem in NLP.",
        "It is linguistically plausible that such structures are determined at least in part on the basis of the meaning of the related chunks of texts, and of the rhetorical intentions of their authors.",

        "Our discourse parser, based on a modified shift-reduce algorithm, crucially uses a rhetorical relation classifier to determine the site of attachment of a new incoming chunk together with the appropriate relation label.",
        "Another novel aspect of our work is the usage of Inductive Logic Programming (ILP): ILP learns from first-order logic representations (FOL).",
        "The ILP-based relation classifier is significantly more accurate than relation classifiers that use competitive propositional ML algorithms such as decision trees and Naive Bayes.",
        "In addition, it results in FOL rules that are linguistically perspicuous.",

        "This is not possible using attribute-value based models like Decision Trees and RIPPER and definitely not using probabilistic models like Naive Bayes.",
        "Our experiments have shown that semantics can be useful in classifying informational relations.",

        "Using semantics for parsing also yields a statistically significant improvement.",
