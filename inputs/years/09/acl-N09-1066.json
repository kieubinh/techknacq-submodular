        "In today's rapidly expanding disciplines, scientists and scholars are constantly faced with the daunting task of keeping up with knowledge in their field.",
        "In addition, the increasingly interconnected nature of real-world tasks often requires experts in one discipline to rapidly learn about other areas in a short amount of time.",
        "Cross-disciplinary research requires scientists in areas such as linguistics, biology, and sociology to learn about computational approaches and applications, e.g., computational linguistics, biological modeling, social networks.",
        "Authors of journal articles and books must write accurate surveys of previous work, ranging from short summaries ofrelated research to in-depth historical notes.",
        "Interdisciplinary review panels are often called upon to review proposals in a wide range of areas, some of which may be unfamiliar to panelists.",
        "Thus, they must learn about a new discipline \"on the fly\" in order to relate their own expertise to the proposal.",
        "Our goal is to effectively serve these needs by combining two currently available technologies: (1) bibliometric lexical link mining that exploits the structure of citations and relations among citations; and (2) summarization techniques that exploit the content of the material in both the citing and cited papers.",
        "It is generally agreed upon that manually written abstracts are good summaries of individual papers.",
        "More recently, Qazvinian and Radev (2008) argue that citation texts are useful in creating a summary of the important contributions of a research paper.",
        "The citation text of a target paper is the set of sentences in other technical papers that explicitly refer to it (Elkiss et al., 2008a).",
        "However, Teufel (2005) argues that using citation text directly is not suitable for document summarization.",
        "In this paper, we compare and contrast the usefulness of abstracts and of citation text in automatically generating a technical survey on a given topic from multiple research papers.",
        "The next section provides the background for this work, including the primary features of a technical survey and also the types of input that are used in our study (full papers, abstracts, and citation texts).",
        "Following this, we describe related work and point out the advances of our work over previous work.",
        "We then describe how citation texts are used as a new input for multi-document summarization to produce surveys of a given technical area.",
        "We apply four different summarization techniques to data in the ACL Anthology and evaluate our results using both automatic (ROUGE) and human-mediated (nugget-based pyramid) measures.",
        "We observe that, as expected, abstracts are useful in survey creation, but, notably, we also conclude that citation texts have crucial survey-worthy information not present in (or at least, not easily extractable from) abstracts.",
        "We further discover that abstracts are author-biased and thus complementary to the broader perspective inherent in citation texts; these differences enable the use of a range of different levels and types of information in the survey – the extent of which is subject to survey length restrictions (if any)."

        "Automatically creating technical surveys is significantly distinct from that of traditional multi-document summarization.",
        "Below we describe primary characteristics of a technical survey and we present three types of input texts that we used for the production of surveys.",
        "In the case of multi-document summarization, the goal is to produce a readable presentation of multiple documents, whereas in the case of technical survey creation, the goal is to convey the key features of a particular field, basic underpinnings of the field, early and late developments, important contributions and findings, contradicting positions that may reverse trends or start new sub-fields, and basic definitions and examples that enable rapid understanding of a field by non-experts.",
        "A prototypical example of a technical survey is that of \"chapter notes,\" i.e., short (50-500 word) descriptions of sub-areas found at the end of chapters of textbook, such as Jurafsky and Martin (2008).",
        "One might imagine producing such descriptions automatically, then hand-editing them and refining them for use in an actual textbook.",
        "We conducted a human analysis of these chapter notes that revealed a set of conventions, an outline of which is provided here (with example sentences in italics):",
        "1.",
        "Introductory/opening statement: The earliest computational use ofX was in Y considered by many to be the foundational work in this area.",
        "2.",
        "Definitional follow up: X is defined as Y.",
        "3.",
        "Elaboration of definition (e.g., with an example): Most early algorithms were based on Z.",
        "4.",
        "Deeper elaboration, e.g., pointing out issues with initial approaches: Unfortunately, this model seems to be wrong.",
        "5.",
        "Contrasting definition: Algorithms since then...",
        "6.",
        "Introduction of additional specific instances / historical background with citations: Two classic approaches are described in Q.",
        "7.",
        "References to other summaries: R provides a comprehensive guide to the details behind X.",
        "The notion of text level categories or zoning of technical papers – related to the survey components enumerated above – has been investigated previously in the work of Nanba and Kan (2004b) and Teufel (2002).",
        "These earlier works focused on the analysis of scientific papers based on their rhetorical structure and on determining the portions of papers that contain new results, comparisons to earlier work, etc.",
        "The work described in this paper focuses on the synthesis of technical surveys based on knowledge gleaned from rhetorical structure not unlike that of the work of these earlier researchers, but perhaps guided by structural patterns along the lines of the conventions listed above.",
        "Although our current approach to survey creation does not yet incorporate a fully pattern-based component, our ultimate objective is to apply these patterns to guide the creation and refinement of the final output.",
        "As a first step toward this goal, we use citation texts (closest in structure to the patterns identified by convention 7 above) to pick out the most important content for survey creation.",
        "Published research on a particular topic can be summarized from two different kinds of sources: (1) where an author describes her own work and (2) where others describe an author's work (usually in relation to their own work).",
        "The author's description of her own work can be found in her paper.",
        "How others perceive her work is spread across other papers that cite her work.",
        "We will refer to the set of sentences that explicitly mention a target paper Y as the citation text of Y.",
        "Traditionally, technical survey generation has been tackled by summarizing a set of research papers pertaining to the topic.",
        "However, individual research papers usually come with manually-created \"summaries\" – their abstracts.",
        "The abstract of a paper may have sentences that set the context, state the problem statement, mention how the problem is approached, and the bottom-line results – all in 200 to 500 words.",
        "Thus, using only the abstracts (instead of full papers) as input to a summarization system is worth exploring.",
        "Whereas the abstract of a paper presents what the authors think to be the important contributions of a paper, the citation text of a paper captures what others in the field perceive as the contributions of the paper.",
        "The two perspectives are expected to have some overlap in their content, but the citation text also contains additional information not found in abstracts (Elkiss et al., 2008a).",
        "For example, how a particular methodology (described in one paper) was combined with another (described in a different paper) to overcome some of the drawbacks of each.",
        "A citation text is also an indicator of what contributions described in a paper were more influential over time.",
        "Another distinguishing feature of citation texts in contrast to abstracts is that a citation text tends to have a certain amount of redundant information.",
        "This is because multiple papers may describe the same contributions of a target paper.",
        "This redundancy can be exploited to determine the important contributions of the target paper.",
        "Our goal is to test the hypothesis that an effective technical survey will reflect information on research not only from the perspective of its authors but also from the perspective of others who use/commend/discredit/add to it.",
        "Before describing our experiments with technical papers, abstracts, and citation texts, we first summarize relevant prior work that used these sources of information as input."

        "In this paper, we investigated the usefulness of directly summarizing citation texts (sentences that cite other papers) in the automatic creation of technical surveys.",
        "We generated surveys of a set of Question Answering (QA) and Dependency Parsing (DP) papers, their abstracts, and their citation texts using four state-of-the-art summarization systems (C-LexRank, C-RR, LexRank, and Trimmer).",
        "We then used two separate approaches, nugget-based pyramid and ROUGE, to evaluate the surveys.",
        "The results from both approaches and all four summarization systems show that both citation texts and abstracts have unique survey-worthy information.",
        "These results also demonstrate that, unlike single document summarization (where citing sentences have been suggested to be inappropriate (Teufel et al., 2006)), multidocument summarization – especially technical survey creation – benefits considerably from citation texts.",
        "We next plan to generate surveys using both citation texts and abstracts together as input.",
        "Given the overlapping content of abstracts and citation texts, discovered in the current study, it is clear that redundancy detection will be an integral component of this future work.",
        "Creating readily consumable surveys is a hard task, especially when using only raw text and simple summarization techniques.",
        "Therefore we intend to combine these summarization and bibliometric techniques with suitable visualization methods towards the creation of iterative technical survey tools – systems that present surveys and bib-liometric links in a visually convenient manner and which incorporate user feedback to produce even better surveys."
