        "Why are some languages more alike than others?",
        "This question is one of the most central issues in historical linguistics.",
        "Typically, one of three answers is given (Aikhenvald and Dixon, 2001; Campbell, 2006).",
        "First, the languages may be related \"genetically.\"",
        "That is, they may have all derived from a common ancestor language.",
        "Second, the similarities may be due to chance.",
        "Some language properties are simply more common than others, which is often attributed to be mostly due to linguistic universals (Greenberg, 1963).",
        "Third, the languages may be related areally.",
        "Languages that occupy the same geographic area often exhibit similar characteristics, not due to genetic relatedness, but due to sharing.",
        "Regions (and the languages contained within them) that exhibit sharing are called linguistic areas and the features that are shared are called areal features.",
        "Much is not understood or agreed upon in the field of areal linguistics.",
        "Different linguists favor different defintions of what it means to be a linguistic area (are two languages sufficient to describe an area or do you need three (Thomason, 2001; Katz, 1975)?",
        "), what areal features are (is there a linear ordering of \"borrowability\" (Katz, 1975; Curnow, 2001) or is that too prescriptive?",
        "), and what causes sharing to take place (does social status or number of speakers play a role (Thomason, 2001)?",
        ").",
        "In this paper, we attempt to provide a statistical answer to some of these questions.",
        "In particular, we develop a Bayesian model of typology that allows for, but does not force, the existence of linguistic areas.",
        "Our model also allows for, but does not force, preference for some feature to be shared are-ally.",
        "When applied to a large typological database of linguistic features (Haspelmath et al., 2005), we find that it discovers linguistic areas that are well documented in the literature (see Campbell (2005) for an overview), and a small preference for certain features to be shared areally.",
        "This latter agrees, to a lesser degree, with some of the published hierarchies of borrowability (Curnow, 2001).",
        "Finally, we show that reconstructing language family trees is significantly aided by knowledge of areal features.",
        "We note that Warnow et al.",
        "(2005) have independently proposed a model for phonological change in Indo-European (based on the Dyen dataset (Dyen et al., 1992)) that includes notions of borrowing.",
        "Our model is different in that we (a) base our model on typological features rather than just lexical patterns and (b) we explicitly represent language areas, not just one-time borrowing phenomena."

        "We describe (in Section 3) a non-parametric, hierarchical Bayesian model for finding linguistic areas and areal features.",
        "In this section, we provide necessary background – both linguistic and statistical – for understanding our model.",
        "2.1 Areal Linguistics",
        "Areal effects on linguistic typology have been studied since, at least, the late 1920s by Trubetzkoy, though the idea of tracing family trees for languages goes back to the mid 1800s and the comparative study of historical linguistics dates back, perhaps to Giraldus Cambrenis in 1194 (Campbell, In press).",
        "A recent article provides a short introduction to both the issues that surround areal linguistics, as well as an enumeration of many of the known language areas (Campbell, 2005).",
        "A fairly wide, modern treatment of the issues surrounding areal diffusion is also given by essays in a recent book edited by Aikhen-vald and Dixon (2001).",
        "The essays in this book provide a good introduction to the issues in the field.",
        "Campbell (2006) provides a critical survey of these and other hypotheses relating to areal linguistics.",
        "There are several issues which are basic to the study of areal linguistics (these are copied almost directly from Campbell (2006)).",
        "Must a linguistic area comprise more than two languages?",
        "Must it comprise more than one language family?",
        "Is a single trait sufficient to define an area?",
        "How \"nearby\" must languages in an area be to one another?",
        "Are some feature more easily borrowed that others?",
        "Despite these formal definitional issues of what constitutes a language area and areal features, most historical linguists seem to believe that areal effects play some role in the change of languages.",
        "Below, we list some of the well-known linguistic areas; Campbell (2005) provides are more complete listing together with example areal features for these areas.",
        "For each area, we list associated languages: The Balkans: Albanian, Bulgarian, Greek, Macedonian, Rumanian and Serbo-Croatian.",
        "(Sometimes: Romani and Turkish) South Asian: Languages belonging to the Dravidian, Indo-Aryan, Munda, Tibeto-Burman families.",
        "Meso-America: Cuitlatec, Huave, Mayan, Mixe-Zoquean, Nahua, Otomanguean, Tarascan, Tequist-latecan, Totonacan and Xincan.",
        "North-west America: Alsea, Chimakuan, Coosan, Eyak, Haida, Kalapuyan, Lower Chinook, Salishan, Takelman, Tlingit, Tsimshian and Wakashan.",
        "The Baltic: Baltic languages, Baltic German, and",
        "Finnic languages (especially Estonian and Livo-nian).",
        "(Sometimes many more are included, such as: Belorussian, Lavian, Lithuanian, Norwegian, Old Prussian, Polish, Romani, Russian, Ukranian.)",
        "Ethiopia: Afar, Amharic, Anyuak, Awngi, Beja, Ge'ez, Gumuz, Janjero, Kefa, Sidamo, Somali, Tigre, Tigrinya and Wellamo.",
        "Needless to say, the exact definition and extent of the actual areas is up to significant debate.",
        "Moreover, claims have been made in favor of many linguistic areas not defined above.",
        "For instance, Dixon (2001) presents arguments for several Australian linguistic areas and Matisoff (2001) defines a SouthEast Asian language area.",
        "Finally, although \"folk lore\" is in favor of identifying a linguistic area including English, French and certain Norse languages (Norwegian, Swedish, Low Dutch, High German, etc.",
        "), there are counterarguments to this position (Thomason, 2001) (see especially Case Study 9.8).",
        "Identifying which linguistic features are most easily shared \"areally\" is a long standing problem in contact linguistics.",
        "Here we briefly review some of the major claims.",
        "Much of this overview is adoped from the summary given by Curnow (2001).",
        "Haugen (1950) considers only borrowability as far as the lexicon is concerned.",
        "He provided evidence that nouns are the easiest, followed by verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, etc.",
        "Ross (1988) corroborates Haugen's analysis and deepens it to cover morphology, syntax and phonology.",
        "He proposes the following hierarchy of borrowability (easiest items coming first): nouns > verbs > adjectives > syntax > non-bound function words > bound morphemes > phonemes.",
        "Coming from a \"constraints\" perspective, Moravcsik (1978) suggests that: lexical items must be borrowed before lexical properties; inflected words before bound morphemes; verbal items can never be borrowed; etc.",
        "Curnow (2001) argues that coming up with a reasonable hierarchy of borrowability is that \"we may never be able to develop such constraints.\"",
        "Nevertheless, he divides the space of borrowable features into 15 categories and discusses the evidence supporting each of these categories, including: phonetics (rare), phonology (common), lexical (very common), interjections and discourse markers (common), free grammatical forms (occasional), bound grammatical forms (rare), position of morphology (rare), syntactic frames (rare), clause-internal syntax (common), between-clause syntax (occasional).",
        "We treat the problem of understanding areal linguistics as a statistical question, based on a database of typological information.",
        "Due to the issues raised in the previous section, we do not want to commit to the existence of a particular number of linguistic areas, or particular sizes thereof.",
        "(Indeed, we do not even want to commit to the existence of any linguistic areas.)",
        "However, we will need to \"unify\" the languages that fall into a linguistic area (if such a thing exists) by means of some statistical parameter.",
        "Such problems have been studied under the name non-parametric models.",
        "The idea behind non-parametric models is that one does not commit a priori to a particularly number of parameters.",
        "Instead, we allow the data to dictate how many parameters there are.",
        "In Bayesian modeling, non-parametric distributions are typically used as priors; see Jordan (2005) or Ghahramani (2005) for overviews.",
        "In our model, we use two different non-parametric priors: the Pitman-Yor process (for modeling linguistic areas) and Kingman's coalescent (for modeling linguistic phylogeny), both described below.",
        "One particular example of a non-parametric prior is the Pitman-Yor process (Pitman and Yor, 1997), which can be seen as an extension to the better-known Dirichlet process (Ferguson, 1974).",
        "The Pitman-Yor process can be understood as a particular example of a Chinese Restaurant process (CRP) exists a restaurant with an infinite number of tables.",
        "Customers come into the restaurant and have to choose a table at which to sit.",
        "The Pitman-Yor process is described by three parameters: a base rate a, a discount parameter d and a mean distribution Go.",
        "These combine to describe a process denoted by PY(a, d, G0).",
        "The parameters a and d must satisfy: 0 < d < 1 and a > – d.",
        "In the CRP analogy, the model works as follows.",
        "The first customer comes in and sits at any table.",
        "After N customers have come in and seated themselves (at a total of K tables), the Nth customer arrives.",
        "In the Pitman-Yor process, the Nth customer sits at a new table with probability proportional to a + Kd and sits at a previously occupied table k with probability proportional to #k – d, where #k is the number of customers already seated at table k. Finally, with each table k we associate a parameter 9k, with each 0k drawn independently from G0.",
        "An important property of the Pitman-Yor process is that draws from it are exchangable: perhaps counterintuitively, the distribution does not care about customer order.",
        "The Pitman-Yor process induces a power-law distribution on the number of singleton tables (i.e., the number of tables that have only one customer).",
        "This can be seen by noticing two things.",
        "In general, the number of singleton tables grows as O(aNd).",
        "When d = 0, we obtain a Dirichlet process with the number of singleton tables growing as O(a log N).",
        "Kingman's coalescent is a standard model in population genetics describing the common genealogy (ancestral tree) of a set of individuals (Kingman, 1982b; Kingman, 1982a).",
        "In its full form it is a distribution over the genealogy of a countable set.",
        "Consider the genealogy of n individuals alive at the present time t = 0.",
        "We can trace their ancestry backwards in time to the distant past t = – do.",
        "Assume each individual has one parent (in genetics, haploid organisms), and therefore genealogies of [n] = {1,..., n} form a directed forest.",
        "King-man's n-coalescent is simply a distribution over genealogies of n individuals.",
        "To describe the Markov process in its entirety, it is sufficient to describe the jump process (i.e. the embedded, discrete-time, Markov chain over partitions) and the distribution over coalescent times.",
        "In the n-coalescent, every pair of lineages merges independently with rate 1, with parents chosen uniformly at random from the set of possible parents at the previous time step.",
        "The n-coalescent has some interesting statistical properties (Kingman, 1982b; Kingman, 1982a).",
        "The marginal distribution over tree topologies is uniform and independent of the coalescent times.",
        "Secondly, it is infinitely exchangeable: given a genealogy drawn from an n-coalescent, the genealogy of any m contemporary individuals alive at time t < 0 embedded within the genealogy is a draw from the m-coalescent.",
        "Thus, taking n – oo, there is a distribution over genealogies of a countably infinite population for which the marginal distribution of the genealogy of any n individuals gives the n-coalescent.",
        "Kingman called this the coalescent.",
        "Teh et al.",
        "(2007) recently described efficient inference algorithms for Kingman's coalescent.",
        "They applied the coalescent to the problem of recovering linguistic phylogenies.",
        "The application was largely successful – at least in comparison to alternative algorithms that use the same data-.",
        "Unfortunately, even in the results they present, one can see significant areal effects.",
        "For instance, in their Figure(3a), Romanian is very near Albanian and Bulgarian.",
        "This is likely an areal effect: specifically, an effect due to the Balkan langauge area.",
