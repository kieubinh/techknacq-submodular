        "Turn-taking, the process by which participants in a conversation alternate speech and silence, is an essential component of spoken interaction.",
        "In order to lead productive conversations, people need not only know what to say but also when to say it.",
        "Decades of research on Conversation Analysis and psycholinguistics (Duncan, 1972; Sacks et al., 1974; Ore-strom, 1983; Schegloff, 2000; Wesseling and van Son, 2005) have shown that human turn-taking behavior relies on a wide range of rules and signals at many different levels of language, from prosody to syntax, semantics, and discourse structure.",
        "In contrast, turn-taking in spoken dialog systems is often reduced to ad hoc rules only based on very low level features.",
        "This simplistic approach leads to inefficient, unnatural, and possibly confusing behavior (Porzel and Baudis, 2004; Ward et al., 2005).",
        "* This research was conducted when the first author was a student at the Language Technologies Institute.",
        "Recently, more complex models of turn-taking have been proposed (Cassell et al., 2001; Thorisson, 2002; Kronild, 2006).",
        "Yet, these models still rely extensively on hand-coded expert knowledge and do not lend themselves to data-driven optimization.",
        "Furthermore, to our knowledge, no such model has been deployed in a widely used system outside ofthe laboratory.",
        "In this paper, we propose a flexible, practical model of turn-taking behavior that builds upon previous work on finite-state models of the conversational floor.",
        "Because of its simplicity and generality, this model can be applied to many turn-taking phenomena.",
        "At the same time, being grounded in decision theory, it lends itself well to data-driven optimization.",
        "We illustrate our approach by applying the model to a specific turn-taking task: end-of-turn detection."

        "In the 1960's and early 1970's, several researchers proposed models to explain the rhythmic turn-taking patterns in human conversation.",
        "In particular, Jaffe and Feldstein (1970) studied the mean duration of pauses, switching pauses (when a different speaker takes the floor), simultaneous speech, and (singlespeaker) vocalizations in recorded dyadic conversations.",
        "Based on their observation that these durations follow exponential distributions, they proposed first-order Markov models to capture the alternation of speech and silence in dialog.",
        "Their initial model had four states: only participant A is speak-",

        "ing; only participant B is speaking; both participants are speaking; and neither participant is speaking.",
        "However, such a model fails to distinguish switching pauses from A to B from switching pauses from B to A.",
        "Based on this observation, they extend their model to a six-state model which they found to better fit their data than the four-state model.",
        "Around the same time, Brady (1969) developed a very similar six-state model.",
        "He trained the parameters on a recorded conversation and compared the generated conversations to the original real one along several dimensions (pause and speech segment durations, overlaps, etc), finding that his model generally produced a good fit of the data.",
        "While Jaffe, Feldstein and Brady were primarily concerned with the analysis of human-human conversations, more recently, several researchers have proposed finite-state machines to control conversational agents.",
        "For instance, Cassell et al.",
        "(2001) model the conversational state of an embodied real estate agent as a 5-state machine.",
        "Two states indicate whether a user is present or not, whereas the other three indicate who holds the floor between the user and the agent, or whether the floor is open.",
        "Floor conflicts are not captured by this machine and are presumably resolved through simple rules (e.g. when the user speaks, the agent yields the floor).",
        "Kronild (2006) proposes a much more complex model, based on Harel statecharts, which are an extension of finite-state machines for modeling and visualizing abstract control (Harel, 1987).",
        "Thorisson's Ymir architecture (Thorisson, 2002) is an attempt to model the cognitive processes involved in conversation.",
        "It features dialog states, capturing, for example, who has the floor, and rules that govern the transition from one state to another based on \"boolean conditions of perceptual features\".",
        "All these models are deterministic.",
        "At any point in time, the agent knows who owns the floor and uses fixed rules to take appropriate actions.",

        "Our model, the Finite-State Turn-Taking Machine (FSTTM), uses the same six states as Jaffe and Feldstein: USER and SYSTEM represent states where one and only one of the participants claims the floor, FREES and FREEu states where no participant claims the floor (following, resp., a SYSTEM and USER state), and BOTHS and BOTHu states where both participants claim the floor (following, resp.",
        "a SYSTEM and USER state).",
        "However, we apply this model to the control of a conversational agent, with a goal similar to that of Cassel, Thorisson, and Kronild.",
        "One important distinction is that we define the states in terms of the participants' intentions and obligations (in the sense of Traum and Allen (1994)) rather than the surface level observation of speech vs silence.",
        "For example, the state is USER when the user has the obligation to speak (to respond to a system question) or the intention to speak, while at the same time, the system does not hold the floor.",
        "This does not necessarily mean that the user is speaking, for example at pauses during a user utterance.",
        "As can be seen in Figure 1, not all transitions are valid.",
        "First, there is no direct transition between any of the intermediate states (the two FREE states and two BOTH states).",
        "The assumption is that to go from any of these state to another, the model will first go to either SYSTEM or USER.",
        "This is an approximation as there might be cases where, for example, both the system and user start speaking at the exact same time, going from a FREE state to a BOT H state.",
        "However these cases are rare enough that they can be approximated using a transition through either SYSTEM or USER.",
        "Second, because intermediate states are conditioned on who had the floor previously, not all valid transitions are bidirectional.",
        "For example, there is no transition from SYSTEM to BOTHU .",
        "We associate pairs of user/system actions to each transition.",
        "The four possible actions are Grab the floor, Release the floor, Wait while not claiming the floor, and Keep the floor.",
        "For example, transition from SYSTEM to F REES corresponds to the user waiting silently and the system releasing the floor at the end of a prompt, noted (R, W) (we always note the system action first and user action second).",
        "This representation allows us to formalize a wide variety of turn-taking phenomena in a unified framework.",
        "Specifically, there are 4 types of 2-step transitions from a single-floor-holder state (SYSTEM or USER) to another (or the same) single-floor-holder state, which represent typical turn-taking phenomena:",
        "Turn transitions with gap are the most common way the floor goes from one participant to the other.",
        "For example, at the end of a user utterance, once the user finishes speaking, the floor becomes free, after which the system starts responding, thus grabbing the floor.",

        "For example, when a user barges in on a system prompt, both participants hold the floor.",
        "Then, the system recognizes the barge-in attempt and relinquishes the floor, which becomes user's.",
        "And conversely, when the system interrupts the user mid-utterance (which in dialog systems is more often the result of an intentional cut-in, rather than intentional interruption), the state sequence is:",
        "USER (GK) BOTHu (KR) SYSTEM",
        "Failed interruptions happen when a participant barges in on the other and then withdraws before the original floor holder releases the floor.",
        "For example, when the system interrupts the user (often by mistake) but detects it and interrupts itself:",
        "USER (G4° BOTHu {R?",
        "USER",
        "The converse is usually the result of the system failing to react fast enough to a user barge-in:",
        "Note that backchannels seem to fit in this category too.",
        "However, since backchannels, by definition, do not represent an attempt to grab the floor, they are not captured by the model as it is (for example, the floor should remain SYSTEM when a user backchannels a system utterance).",
        "Time outs start like transitions with gap but the intended next speaker (e.g. the user after a system prompt) does not take the floor and the original floor holder grabs it back.",
        "For instance, after a system prompt, if the floor remains free for a certain amount of time, the system attempts to re-establish the communication with the user, as follows:",
        "SYSTEM a FREES A SYSTEM",
        "The opposite also happens when the system is to slow to respond to the user:",
        "USER (WR) FREEU (AG USER",
        "While all the transitions above were described as deterministic, the actual state of the model is not fully observable.",
        "Specifically, while the system knows whether its claiming the floor or not, it can only believe with some degree of uncertainty that the user does so.",
        "The system's knowledge of its own claim to the floor splits the state space into two disjoint subsets.",
        "When the system claims the floor, the state can be SYSTEM, BOTHs, or BOTHu).",
        "When the system does not claim the loor, the state can be USER, FREEU, or FREES).",
        "In either case, the system needs to recognize the user's intention (i.e. whether the user claims to the floor or not) to maintain a probability distribution over the three states.",
        "Since the distinction between the two BOTH states (resp.",
        "the two FREE states) is based on past history that can be known with a high level of certainty, the uncertainty in state distribution is fully characterized by the probability that the user is claiming the loor, which will have to be estimated from observations, as we will see below.",
        "The problem we are facing is that of choosing the best system action given the system's belief about the current state of the model.",
        "That is achieved by applying the probabilistic decision theory principle of selecting the action with lowest expected cost.",
        "The actions available to the system are the four described above (G,R,K,W), although not all actions are available in all states.",
        "In fact, as can be seen in Table 1, there are always only two actions available in each state, depending on whether the system is claiming the loor or not.",
        "Each action in each state has a particular cost.",

        "3.",
        "The cost of an action that maintains a gap or overlap is either a constant or an increasing function of the total time spent in that state",
        "The resulting cost matrix is shown in Table 1, where",
        "• CS is the cost of interrupting a system prompt before its end when the user is not claiming the loor (false interruption)",
        "• Co (t ) is the cost of remaining in an overlap that is already t ms long",
        "• Cjj is the cost of grabbing the floor when the user is holding it (cut-in)",
        "• Cg(t) is the cost of remaining in a gap that is already t ms long",
        "This cost structure makes a number of simplifying assumptions and there are many other possible cost matrices.",
        "For example, the cost of interrupting the user might vary depending on what has already been said in the utterance, so does the cost of interrupting a system prompt.",
        "A more principled approach to setting the costs would be to estimate from perceptual experiments or user studies what the impact of remaining in gap or overlap is compared to that of a cut-in or false interruption.",
        "However, as a first approximation, the proposed cost structure offers a simple way to take into account some of the constraints of interaction.",
        "Given the state space and the cost matrix given above, the optimal decision at any point in time is the one that yields the lowest expected cost, where the expected cost of action A is:",

        "Both batch and live evaluation results confirm the effectiveness of the FSTTM approach in improving system responsiveness.",
        "This approach significantly reduced endpointing latency over previous approaches.",
        "Boundary LM score got the highest weight in the regression, indicating that in a domain such as telephone-based information access, lexical cues are very informative for endpointing.",
        "The fact that boundary LMs can be computed without any human transcription effort (since they are trained on ASR output) makes them all the more appealing.",
        "Essentially, the FSTTM provides a simple, unified model of turn-taking that lends itself to data-driven optimization.",
        "While we discussed specific cost structures and probability estimation techniques, the framework's flexibility opens it to other choices at many levels.",
        "By formalizing the overall turn-taking process in a probabilistic, decision-theoretic framework, the FSTTM extends and generalizes previous classification-based approaches to endpointing such as those proposed by Sato et al.",
        "(2002), Ferrer et al.",
        "(2003), Takeuchi et al.",
        "(2004), and our previous work (Raux et al., 2008).",
        "Possible extensions of the approach include data-driven cost matrices to relax some of the assumptions introduced in section 3.2, as well as more complex state structures to handle, for example, multiparty conversations.",
        "Finally, we plan to investigate more principled approaches, such as Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes or Dynamic Bayesian Networks, to model the different sources of uncertainty (detection errors and inherent ambiguity) and track the state distribution over time.",
        "Raux (2009) provides more details on all aspects of the approach and its possible extensions."

        "We describe the application of the FSTTM to the key turn-taking phenomenon of end-of-turn detection.",
