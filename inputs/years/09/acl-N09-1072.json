        "How can we extract social meaning from speech, deciding if a speaker is particularly engaged in the conversation, is uncomfortable or awkward, or is particularly friendly and flirtatious?",
        "Understanding these meanings and how they are signaled in language is an important sociolinguistic task in itself.",
        "Extracting them automatically from dialogue speech and text is crucial for developing socially aware computing systems for tasks such as detection of interactional problems or matching conversational style, and will play an important role in creating more natural dialogue agents (Pentland, 2005; Nass and Brave, 2005; Brave etal., 2005).",
        "Cues for social meaning permeate speech at every level of linguistic structure.",
        "Acoustic cues such as low and high F0 or energy and spectral tilt are important in detecting emotions such as annoyance, anger, sadness, or boredom (Ang et al., 2002; Lee and Narayanan, 2002; Liscombe et al., 2003), speaker characteristics such as charisma (Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2005), or personality features like extroversion (Mairesse et al., 2007; Mairesse and Walker, 2008).",
        "Lexical cues to social meaning abound.",
        "Speakers with links to depression or speakers who are under stress use more first person singular pronouns (Rude et al., 2004; Pennebaker and Lay, 2002; Cohn et al., 2004), positive emotion words are cues to agreeableness (Mairesse et al., 2007), and negative emotion words are useful cues to deceptive speech (Newman et al., 2003).",
        "The number of words in a sentence can be a useful feature for extroverted personality (Mairesse et al., 2007).",
        "Finally, dialog features such as the presence of disfluencies can inform listeners about speakers' problems in utterance planning or about confidence (Brennan and Williams, 1995; Brennan and Schober, 2001).",
        "Our goal is to see whether cues of this sort are useful in detecting particular elements of conversational style and social intention; whether a speaker in a speed-dating conversation is judged by the interlocutor as friendly, awkward, or flirtatious."

        "The graduate student participants volunteered to be in the study and were promised emails of persons with whom they reported mutual liking.",
        "Each date was conducted in an open setting where there was substantial background noise.",
        "All participants wore audio recorders on a shouldersash, thus resulting in two audio recordings of the approximately 1100 4-minute dates.",
        "In addition to the audio, we collected pretest surveys, event scorecards, and post-test surveys.",
        "This is the largest sample we know of where audio data and detailed survey information were combined in a natural experiment.",
        "The rich survey information included date perceptions and follow-up interest, as well as general attitudes, preferences, and demographic information.",
        "Participants were also asked about the conversational style and intention of the interlocutor.",
        "Each speaker was asked to report how often their date's speech reflected different conversational styles (awkward, friendly, flirtatious, funny, assertive) on a scale of 1-10 (1=never, 10=con-stantly): \"How often did the other person behave in the following ways on this 'date'?\".",
        "We chose three of these five to focus on in this paper.",
        "We acquired acoustic information by taking the acoustic wave file from each recorder and manually segmenting it into a sequence of wavefiles, each corresponding to one 4-minute date.",
        "Since both speakers wore microphones, most dates had two recordings, one from the male recorder and one from the female recorder.",
        "Because of mechanical, operator, and experimenter errors, some recordings were lost, and thus some dates had only one recording.",
        "Transcribers at a professional transcription service used the two recordings to create a transcript for each date, and timestamped the start and end time of each speaker turn.",
        "Transcribers were instructed to mark various disfluencies as well as some nonverbal elements of the conversation such as laughter.",
        "Because of noise, participants who accidentally turned off their mikes, and some segmentation and transcription errors, a number of dates were not possible to analyze.",
        "19 dates were lost completely, and for an additional 130 we lost one of the two audio tracks and had to use the remaining track to extract features for both interlocutors.",
        "The current study focuses on the 991 remaining clean dates for which we had usable audio, transcripts, and survey information."

        "For the experiments, the 1-10 Likert scale ratings were first mean-centered within each respondent so that the average was 0.",
        "Then the top ten percent of the respondent-centered meaned Likert ratings were marked as positive for the trait, and the bottom ten percent were marked as negative for a trait.",
        "Thus each respondent labels the other speaker as either positive, negative, or NA for each of the three traits.",
        "We run our binary classification experiments to predict this output variable.",
        "For each speaker side of each 4-minute conversation, we extracted features from the wavefiles and the transcript, as described in the next section.",

        "Because of the very high level of noise, the speaker wearing the recorder was much clearer on his/her own recording, and so we extracted the acoustic features for each speaker from their own microphone (except for the 130 dates for which we only had one audio file).",

        "Alter features thus indicate the conversational behavior of the speaker talking with an interlocutor they considered to be flirtatious, friendly, or awkward.",
        "F0 and RMS amplitude features were extracted using Praat scripts (Boersma and Weenink, 2005).",
        "Since the start and end of each turn were time-marked by hand, each feature was easily extracted over a turn, and then averages and standard deviations were taken over the turns in an entire conversation side.",

        "F0 min sd is the standard deviation across turns of this same measure.",
        "Note that we coded four measures of f0 variation, not knowing in advance which one was likely to be the most useful: f0 mean sd is the deviation across turns from the global F0 mean for the conversation side, measuring how variable the speakers mean f0 is across turns.",

        "The results presented here should be regarded with some caution.",
        "The sample is not a random sample of English speakers or American adults, and speed dating is not a natural context for expressing every conversational style.",
        "Therefore, a wider array of studies across populations and genres would be required before a more general theory of conversational styles is established.",
        "On the other hand, the presented results may under-reflect the relations being captured.",
        "The quality of recordings and coarse granularity (1 second) of the timestamps likely cloud the relations, and as the data is cleaned and improved, we expect the associations to only grow stronger.",
        "Caveats aside, we believe the evidence indicates that the perception of several types of conversational style have relatively clear signals across genders, but with some additional gender contextualization.",
        "Both genders convey flirtation by laughing more, speaking faster, and using higher and more variable pitch.",
        "Both genders convey friendliness by laughing more, and using collaborative completions.",
        "However, we do find gender differences; men asl more questions when (labeled as) flirting, women ask fewer.",
        "Men labeled as flirting are softer, but women labeled as flirting are louder.",
        "Women flirting swear more, while men are more likely to use sexual vocabulary.",
        "Gender differences exist as well for the other variables.",

        "Men speaker faster and with higher f0 (min) in flirtatious speech, but not faster and with lower f0 (min) in friendly speech.",
        "For men, flirtatious speech involves more questions and repair questions, while friendly speech does not.",
        "For women, friendly speech is more disfluent than flirtatious speech, and has more collaborative style (completions, repair questions, appreciations).",
        "We also seem to see a model of collaborative conversational style (probably related to the collaborative floor of Edelsky (1981) and Coates (1996)), cued by the use of more collaborative completions, repair questions and other questions, you, and laughter.",
        "These collaborative techniques were used by both women and men who were labeled as friendly, and occurred less with men labeled as awkward.",
        "Women themselves displayed more of this collaborative conversational style when they labeled the men as friendly.",
        "For women only, collaborative style included appreciations; while for men only, collaborative style included overlaps.",
        "In addition to these implications for social science, our work has implications for the extraction of meaning in general.",
        "A key focus of our work was on ways to extract useful dialog act and disfluency features (repair questions, backchannels, appreciations, restarts, dispreferreds) with very shallow methods.",
        "These features were indeed extractable and proved to be useful features in classification.",
        "We are currently extending these results to predict date outcomes including 'liking', extending work such as Madan and Pentland (2006)."
