        "Topical Text Categorization (TC), the task of classifying documents by predefined topics, is most commonly addressed as a supervised learning task.",
        "However, the supervised setting requires a substantial amount of manually labeled documents, which is often impractical in real-life settings.",
        "Keyword-based TC methods (see Section 2) aim at a more practical setting.",
        "Each category is represented by a list of characteristic keywords, which should capture the category meaning.",
        "Classification is then based on measuring similarity between the category keywords and the classified documents, typically followed by a bootstrapping step.",
        "The manual effort is thus reduced to providing a keyword list per category, which was partly automated in some works through clustering.",
        "The keyword-based approach still requires non-negligible manual work in creating a representative keyword list per category.",
        "(Gliozzo et al., 2005) succeeded eliminating this requirement by using the category name alone as the initial keyword, yet obtaining superior performance within the keyword-based approach.",
        "This was achieved by measuring similarity between category names and documents in Latent Semantic space (LSA), which implicitly captures contextual similarities for the category name through unsupervised dimensionality reduction.",
        "Requiring only category names as user input seems very attractive, particularly when labeled training data is too costly while modest performance (relative to supervised methods) is still useful.",
        "The goal of our research is to further improve the scheme of text categorization from category name, which was hardly explored in prior work.",
        "When analyzing the behavior of the LSA representation of (Gliozzo et al., 2005) we noticed that it captures two types of similarities between the category name and document terms.",
        "One type regards words which refer specifically to the category name's meaning, such as pitcher for the category Baseball.",
        "However, typical context words for the category which do not necessarily imply its specific meaning, like stadium, also come up as similar to baseball in LSA space.",
        "This limits the method's precision, due to false-positive classifications of contextually-related documents that do not discuss the specific category topic (such as other sports documents wrongly classified to Baseball).",
        "This behavior is quite typical for query expansion methods, which expand a query with contextually correlated terms.",
        "We propose a novel scheme that models separately these two types of similarity.",

        "(Ko and Seo, 2004; Liu et al., 2004) partly automated this step, using clustering to generate candidate keywords.",
        "These methods employed a standard term-space representation in step 2.",
        "As described in Section 1, the keyword list in (Gliozzo et al., 2005) consisted of the category name alone.",
        "This was accompanied by representing the category names and documents (step 2) in LSA space, obtained through cooccurrence-based dimensionality reduction.",
        "In this space, words that tend to cooccur together, or occur in similar contexts, are represented by similar vectors.",
        "Thus, vector similarity in LSA space (in step 3) captures implicitly the similarity between the category name and contextually related words within the classified documents.",
        "Step 3 yields an initial similarity-based classification that assigns a single (most similar) category to each document, with Sim(c, d) typically being the cosine between the corresponding vectors.",

        "We tested our method on the two corpora used in (Gliozzo et al., 2005): 20-NewsGroups, classified by a single-class scheme (single category per document), and Reuters-10 , of a multi-class scheme.",
        "As in their work, non-standard category names were adjusted, such as Foreign exchange for Money-fx.",
        "Table 2 presents the results of the initial classification (step 3).",
        "The first 4 lines refer to classification based on Simref alone.",
        "As a baseline, including only the category name in the reference vector (Cat-Name) yields particularly low recall.",
        "Expansion by WordNet is notably more powerful than by the automatically extracted Wikipedia resource; still, the latter consistently provides a small marginal improvement when using both resources (Reference), indicating their complementary nature.",
        "As we hypothesized, the Reference model achieves much better precision than the Context model from (Gliozzo et al., 2005) alone (Simcon).",
        "For 20-NewsGroups the recall of Reference is limited, due to partial coverage of our current expansion resources, yielding a lower F1.",
        "Yet, its higher precision pays off for the bootstrapping step (Section 4.2).",
        "Finally, when the two models are Combined a small precision improvement is observed.",
        "The output of step 3 was fed as standard training for a binary SVM classifier for each category (step 4).",
        "We used the default setting for SVM-light, apart from the j parameter which was set to the number of categories in each data set, as suggested by (Morik et al., 1999).",
        "For Reuters-10, classification was determined independently by the classifier of each category, allowing multiple classes per document.",
        "For 20-NewsGroups, the category which yielded the highest classification score was chosen (one-versus-all), fitting the single-class setting.",
        "We experimented with two document representations for the supervised step: either as vectors in tf-idf weighted term space or as vectors in LSA space.",
        "Table 3 shows the final classification results.First, we observe that for the noisy bootstrapping training data LSA document representation is usually preferred.",
        "Most importantly, our Reference and Combined models clearly improve over the earlier Context.",
        "Combining reference and context yields some improvement for Reuters-10, but not for 20-NewsGroups.",
        "We noticed though that the actual accuracy of our method on 20-NewsGroups is notably higher than measured relative to the gold standard, due to its single-class scheme: in many cases, a document should truly belong to more than one category while that chosen by our algorithm was counted as false positive.",
        "Future research is proposed to increase the method's recall via broader coverage lexical reference resources, and to improve its precision through better context models than LSA, which was found rather noisy for quite a few categories.",
        "To conclude, the results support our main contribution - the benefit of identifying referring terms for the category name over using noisier context models alone.",
        "Overall, our work highlights the potential of text categorization from category names when labeled training sets are not available, and indicates important directions for further research."
