        "There has been tremendous recent interest in opinion mining from online product reviews and it's effect on customer purchasing behavior.",
        "In this work, we present a novel alternative categorization of comments in online reviews as either being qualified claims or bald claims.",
        "Comments in a review are claims that reviewers make about the products they purchase.",
        "A customer reads the reviews to help him/her make a purchasing decision.",
        "However, comments are often open to interpretation.",
        "For example, a simple comment like this camera is small is open to interpretation until qualified by more information about whether it is small in general (for example, based on a poll from a collection of people), or whether it is small compared to some other object.",
        "We call such claims bald claims.",
        "Customers hesitate to rely on such bald claims unless they identify (from the context or otherwise) themselves to be in a situation similar to the customer who posted the comment.",
        "The other category of claims that are not bald are qualified claims.",
        "Qualified claims such as it is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse are more precise claims as they give the reader more details, and are less open to interpretation.",
        "Our notion of qualified claims is similar to that proposed in the argumentation literature by Toulmin (1958).",
        "This distinction of qualified vs. bald claims can be used to filter out bald claims that can't be verified.",
        "For the qualified claims, the qualifier can be used in personalizing what is presented to the reader.",
        "The main contributions of this work are: (i) an annotation scheme that distinguishes qualified claims from bald claims in online reviews, and (ii) a supervised machine learning approach that uses syntactic features to learn this distinction.",
        "In the remainder of the paper, we first motivate our work based on a customer behavior study.",
        "We then describe the proposed annotation scheme, followed by our supervised learning approach.",
        "We conclude the paper with a discussion of our results."

        "In order to study how online product reviews are used to make purchasing decisions, we conducted a user study.",
        "The study involved 16 pair of graduate students.",
        "In each pair there was a customer and an observer.",
        "The goal of the customer was to decide which camera he/she would purchase using a camera review blog to inform his/her decision.",
        "As the customer read through the reviews, he/she was asked to think aloud and the observer recorded their observations.",
        "The website used for this study had two types of reviews: expert and user reviews.",
        "There were mixed opinions about which type of reviews people wanted to read.",
        "About six customers could relate more with user reviews as they felt expert reviews were more like a 'sales pitch'.",
        "On the other hand, about five people were interested in only expert reviews as they believed them to be more practical and well reasoned.",
        "From this study, it was clear that the customers were sensitive to whether a claim was qualified or not.",
        "About 50% of the customers were concerned about the reliability of the comments and whether it applied to them.",
        "Half of them felt it was hard to comprehend whether the user criticizing a feature was doing so out of personal bias or if it represented a real concern applicable to everyone.",
        "The other half liked to see comments backed up with facts or explanations, to judge if the claim could be qualified.",
        "Two customers expressed interest in comments from users similar to themselves as they felt they could base their decision on such comments more reliably.",
        "Also, exaggerations in reviews were deemed untrustworthy by at least three customers."

        "We now present the guidelines we used to distinguish bald claims from qualified claims.",
        "A claim is called qualified if its validity or scope is limited by making the conditions of its applicability more explicit.",
        "It could be either a fact or a statement that is well-defined and attributed to some source.",
        "For example, the following comments from our data are qualified claims according to our definition,",

        "The first example is a fact about the camera.",
        "The second example is a report of an event.",
        "The third example is a self-attributed opinion of the reviewer.",
        "Bald claims on the other hand are non-factual claims that are open to interpretation and thus cannot be verified.",
        "A straightforward example of the distinction between a bald claim and a qualified claim is a comment like the new flavor of peanut butter is being well appreciated vs. from a survey conducted among 20 people, 80%c of the people liked the new flavor of peanut butter.",
        "We now present some examples of bald claims.",
        "A more detailed explanation is provided in the annotation manual:",
        "• Not quantifiable gradable words such as good, better, best etc.",
        "usually make a claim bald, as there is no qualified definition of being good or better.",
        "• Quantifiable gradable words such as small, hot etc.",
        "make a claim bald when used without any frame of reference.",
        "For example, a comment this desk is small is a bald claim whereas this desk is smaller than what I had earlier is a qualified claim, since the comparative smaller can be verified by observation or actual measurement, but whether something is small in general is open to interpretation.",
        "• Unattributed opinion or belief: A comment that implicitly expresses an opinion or belief without qualifying it with an explicit attribution is a bald claim.",
        "For example, Expectation is that camera automatically figures out when to use the flash.",
        "• Exaggerations: Exaggerations such as on every visit, the food has blown us away do not have a well defined scope and hence are not well qualified.",
        "The two categories for gradable words defined above are similar to what Chen (2008) describes as vagueness, non-objective measurability and imprecision."

        "We experimented with several different features including standard lexical features such as word uni-grams and bigrams; pseudo-syntactic features such as Part-of-Speech bigrams and syntactic features such as dependency triples.",
        "Finally, we also used syntactic scope relationships computed using the dependency triples.",
        "Use of features based on syntactic scope is motivated by the difference in how qualified and bald claims are expressed in language.",

        "is not a qualified claim.",
