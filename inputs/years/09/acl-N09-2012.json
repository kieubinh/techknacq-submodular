        "Such algorithms would enable a number of applications, including automated geotagging of text and speech, robots that can follow human route instructions, and NL-description based localization.",
        "To aide development of training and testing corpora for this area, we have built The gEoSpa-tial Language Annotator (TESLA) – a tool which supports the visualization and hand-annotation of both text and speech-based geospatial language corpora.",
        "TESLA can be used to create a gold-standard for training and testing geospatial language understanding algorithms by allowing the user to annotate geospatial references with object (e.g., streets, businesses, and parks) and latitude and longitude (lat/lon) coordinates.",

        "The PURSUIT Corpus (Blaylock and Allen, 2008) is a collection of speech data in which subjects describe their path in real time (i.e., while they are traveling it) and a GPS receiver simultaneously records the actual paths taken.",

        "One person in the lead car (usually a passenger) and one person in the follow car (usually the driver) were given close-speaking headset microphones and instructed to describe, during the ride, where the lead car was going, as if they were speaking to someone in a remote location who was trying to follow the car on a map.",
        "The speakers were also instructed to try to be verbose, and that they did not need to restrict themselves to street names – they could use businesses, landmarks, or whatever was natural.",
        "Both speakers' speech was recorded during the session.",
        "In addition, a GPS receiver was placed in each car and the GPS track was recorded at a high sampling rate.",

        "Although this Google Earth playback is somewhat analogous to a video of the movement, Google Earth remains usable and the user can move the display or zoom in and out as desired.",

        "Businesses through Yellow Pages, and other various freely available geospatial data.",
        "It supports keyword searches on database fields as well as radius-bounded searches from a given point.",

        "This figure shows the result of searching for intersections with the keyword \"Romana\".",

        "Regardless of its syntactic form, we annotate all references to locations in the corpus that correspond to types found in our GIS database.",
        "References to such things as fields, parking lots, and fire hydrants are not annotated, as our database does not contain these types of entities.",
        "(Although, with access to certain local government resources or advanced computer vision systems, these references could be resolved as well.)",
        "In PURSUIT, we markup the entire noun phrase (as opposed to e.g., the head word) and annotate that grouping.",
        "Rather than annotate a location reference with just latitude and longitude coordinates, we annotate it with the geospatial entity being referred to, such as a street or a business.",
        "The reasons for this are twofold: first, lat/lon coordinates are real numbers, and it would be difficult to guarantee that each reference to the same entity was marked with the same coordinates (e.g., to identify coreference).",
        "Secondly, targeting the entity allows us to include more information about that entity (as detailed below).",
        "In the corpus, we have found four types of entities that are references, which are also in our database: streets, intersections, addresses (e.g., 127 Main Street), and other points (a catch-all category containing other point-like entities such as businesses, parks, bridges, etc.)",

        "Finally, the path descriptions in the PURSUIT Corpus were all done from a first-person, ground-level perspective.",
        "As TESLA allows us to replay the actual routes from GPS tracks within Google Earth, we believe we could use this tool to gather more spoken descriptions of the paths from an aerial perspective from different subjects.",
        "This would give us several more versions of descriptions of the same path and allow the comparison of descriptions from the two different perspectives."
