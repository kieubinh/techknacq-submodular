        "Automatically learning dialogue structure from corpora is an active area of research driven by a recognition of the value offered by data-driven approaches (e.g., Bangalore et al., 2006).",
        "Dialogue structure information is of particular importance when the interaction is centered around a learning task, such as in natural language tutoring, because techniques that support empirical identification of dialogue strategies can inform not only the design of intelligent tutoring systems (Forbes-Riley et al., 2007), but also contribute to our understanding of the cognitive and affective processes involved in learning through tutoring (VanLehn et al., 2007).",
        "Although traditional top-down approaches (e.g., Cade et al., 2008) and some empirical work on analyzing the structure of tutorial dialogue (Forbes-Riley et al., 2007) have yielded significant results, the field is limited by the lack of an automatic, data-driven approach to identifying dialogue structure.",
        "An empirical approach to identifying tutorial dialogue strategies, or modes, could address this limitation by providing a mechanism for describing in succinct probabilistic terms the tutorial strategies that actually occur in a corpus.",
        "Just as early work on dialogue act interpretation utilized hidden Markov models (HMMs) to capture linguistic structure (Stolcke et al., 2000), we propose a system that uses HMMs to capture the structure of tutorial dialogue implicit within sequences of already-tagged dialogue acts.",
        "This approach operates on the premise that at any given point in the tutorial dialogue, the collaborative interaction is in a dialogue mode that characterizes the nature of the exchanges between tutor and student.",
        "In our model, a dialogue mode is defined by a probability distribution over the observed symbols (e.g., dialogue acts and adjacency pairs).",
        "Our previous work has noted some limitations of first-order HMMs as applied to sequences of individual dialogue acts (Boyer et al., in press).",
        "Chief among these is that HMMs allow arbitrarily frequent transitions between hidden states, which does not conform well to human intuition about how tutoring strategies are applied.",
        "Training an HMM on a sequence of adjacency pairs rather than individual dialogue acts is one way to generate a more descriptive model without increasing model complexity more than is required to accommodate the expanded set of observation symbols.",
        "To this end, we apply the approach of Midgley et al.",
        "(2006) for empirically identifying significant adjacency pairs within dialogue, and proceed by treating adjacency pairs as atomic units for the purposes of training the HMM."

        "The tutoring corpus was manually tagged with dialogue acts designed to capture the salient characteristics of the tutoring process (Table 1).",
        "The correspondence between utterances and dialogue act tags is one-to-one.",
        "Compound utterances (i.e., a single utterance comprising more than one dialogue act) were split by the primary annotator prior to the inter-rater reliability study.",
        "The importance of adjacency pairs is well-established in natural language dialogue (e.g., Schlegoff & Sacks, 1973), and adjacency pair analysis has illuminated important phenomena in tutoring as well (Forbes-Riley et al., 2007).",
        "For the current corpus, bigram analysis of dialogue acts yielded a set of commonly-occurring pairs.",
        "However, as noted in (Midgley et al., 2006), in order to",
        "in (Boyer et al., 2008).",
        "establish that two dialogue acts are truly related as an adjacency pair, it is important to determine whether the presence of the first member of the pair is associated with a significantly higher probability of the second member occurring.",
        "For this analysis we utilize a % test for independence of the categorical variables acti and acti+1 for all two-way combinations of dialogue act tags.",

        "This exploratory application of hidden Markov models involves training an HMM on a mixed input sequence consisting of both individual dialogue acts and adjacency pairs.",

        "The transition probabilities show that nearly 60% of the time the dialogue transitions from State 3 to State 0; this may indicate that after establishing what the student does or does not know in State 3, the tutoring switches to a less collaborative \"teaching\" mode represented by",

        "Future evaluation of the HMM presented here will include comparison with other types of graphical models.",

        "This type of inquiry can lead directly to design recommendations for tutorial dialogue systems that aim to maximize particular learner outcomes.",
