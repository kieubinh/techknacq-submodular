        "A general pipeline of speaker clustering consists of four essential elements, namely feature extraction, utterance representation, distance metric, and clustering.",
        "We incorporate our prior knowledge of speakers into the various stages of this pipeline through an independent training set.",
        "The most popular speech features are spectrum-based acoustic features such as mel-frequency cep-stral coefficients (MFCCs) and perceptual linear predictive (PLP) coefficients.",
        "In order to account for the dynamics of spectrum changes over time, the basic acoustic features are often supplemented by their first and second derivatives.",
        "We pursue a different avenue in which we augment the basic acoustic features of every frame with those of the neighboring frames.",
        "Specifically, the acoustic features of the current frame and those of the KL frames to the left and KR frames to the right are concatenated to form a high-dimensional feature vector.",
        "In the context-expanded feature vector space, we learn a speaker-discriminative feature transformation by linear discriminant analysis (LDA) based on the known speaker labels of the independent training set.",
        "The resulting low-dimensional feature subspace is expected to provide optimal speaker separability.",
        "Deviating from the mainstream \"bag of acoustic features\" representation where the extracted acoustic features are represented by a statistical model such as a Gaussian mixture model (GMM), we adopt the GMM mean supervector representation which has emerged in the speaker recognition area (Campbell et al., 2006).",
        "Such representation is obtained by maximum a posteriori (MAP) adapting a universal background model (UBM), which has been finely trained with all the data in the training set, to a particular utterance.",
        "The component means of the adapted GMM are stacked to form a column vector conventionally called a GMM mean supervector.",
        "In this way, we are allowed to represent an utterance as a point in a high-dimensional space where traditional distance metrics and clustering techniques can be naturally applied.",
        "The UBM, which can be deemed as a universal speaker prior model inferred from the independent training set, imposes generic speaker constraints to the GMM mean supervector space.",
        "In the GMM mean supervector space, a naturally arising distance metric is the Euclidean distance metric.",
        "However, it is observed that the supervec-tors show strong directional scattering patterns.",
        "The directions of the data points seem to be more indicative than their magnitudes.",
        "This observation motivates us to favor the cosine distance metric over the Euclidean distance metric for speaker clustering.",
        "Although the cosine distance metric can be used in the GMM mean supervector space, it is optimal only if the data points are uniformly spread in all directions in the entire space.",
        "In a high-dimensional space, most often the data lies in or near a low-dimensional manifold or subspace.",
        "It is advantageous to learn an optimal distance metric from the data directly.",
        "The general cosine distance between two data points x and y can be defined and manipulated as follows.",

        "The general cosine distance can be casted as the cosine distance between two transformed data points WTx and WTy where WT = A1/2.",
