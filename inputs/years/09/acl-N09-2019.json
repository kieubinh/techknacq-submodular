        "Morphologically rich languages pose significant challenges for natural language processing.",

        "Statistical machine translation (SMT) systems estimated from parallel text are affected by this.",
        "This is particularly acute when either the source or the target language, or both, are morphologically complex.",
        "Owing to these difficulties and to the natural interest researchers take in complex linguistic phenomena, many approaches to morphological analysis have been developed and evaluated.",
        "We focus on applications to SMT in Section 1.1, but we note the recent general survey (Roark and Sproat, 2007) and the Morpho Challenge competitive evaluations.",
        "Prior evaluations of morphological analyzers have focused on determining which analyzer was best suited for some particular task.",
        "For translation, we take a different approach and investigate whether competing analyzers might have complementary information.",
        "Our method is straightforward.",
        "We train two identical SMT systems with two versions of the same parallel corpus, each with a different morphological decomposition of the source language.",
        "We combine their translation hypotheses performing Minimum Bayes Risk decoding over merged N-best lists.",
        "Results are reported in the NIST 2008 Arabic-to-English MT task and an European Parliament Finnish-to-English task, with significant gains over each individual system.",
        "Several earlier works investigate word segmentation and transformation schemes, which may include Part-Of-Speech or other information, to alleviate the effect of morphological variation on translation models.",
        "With different training corpus sizes, they focus on translation into English from Arabic (Lee, 2004; Habash and Sadat, 2006; Zollmann et al., 2006), Czech (Goldwater and McClosky, 2005; Talbot and Osborne, 2006), German (NieBen and Ney, 2004) or Catalan, Spanish and Serbian (Popovic and Ney, 2004).",
        "Some address the generation challenge when translating from English into Spanish (Ueffing and Ney, 2003; de Gispert and Marino, 2008).",
        "Unsupervised morphology learning is proposed as a language-independent solution to reduce the problems of rich morphology in (Virpioja et al.,",
        "there to earlier workshops.",

        "(2008) report improvements from multiple Arabic segmentations in translation to English translation, but their goal was to demonstrate the value of lattice-based translation.",
        "From amodel-ing perspective their approach is unwieldy: multiple analyses of the parallel text collections are merged to create a large, heterogeneous training set; a single set of models and alignments is produced; lattice translation is then performed using a single system to translate all morphological analyses.",
        "We find that similar gains can be obtained much more easily.",
        "The approach we take is Minimum Bayes Risk best lists from multiple SMT systems are merged; the posterior distributions over the individual lists are interpolated to form a new distribution over the merged list.",
        "MBR hypotheses selection is then performed using sentence-level BLEU score (Kumar and Byrne, 2004).",
        "It is very likely that even greater gains can be achieved by more complicated combination schemes (Rosti et al., 2007), although significantly more effort in tuning would be required."

        "Secondly, we take the segmentation generated by Sakhr Software in Egypt using their Arabic Morphological Tagger, as an alternative segmentation into subword units.",
        "This scheme generates more tokens as it segments all Arabic articles which otherwise remain attached in the MADA D2 scheme (Table 1).",
        "Translation experiments are based on the NIST MT08 Arabic-to-English translation task, including all allowed parallel data as training material (~150M English words, and 153M or 178M Arabic words for MADA-segmented and Sakhr-segmented text, respectively).",
        "In addition to the MT08 set itself, we take the NIST MT02 through MT05 evaluation sets and divide them into a development set (odd-numbered sentences) and a test set (even-numbered sentences), each containing ~2k sentences.",
        "The SMT system used is HiFST, a hierarchical phrase-based system implemented with Weighted Finite-State Transducers (Iglesias et al., 2009).",
        "Two identical systems are trained from each parallel corpus, i.e. MADA-based and SAKHR-based.",
        "Both systems use the same standard features and share the first-pass English language model, a 4-gram estimated over the parallel text and a 965 million word subset of monolingual data from the English Giga-word Third Edition.",
        "Minimum Error Training parameter estimation under IBM BLEU is performed on the development set (mt02-05-tune), and the output translation lattice is rescored with large language models estimated using <~-4.7B words of English newswire text, in the same fashion as (Iglesias et al., 2009).",
        "Finally, the first 1000-best hypotheses are rescored with MBR, taking the negative sentence level BLEU score as the loss function to minimise.",
        "For system combination, we obtain two sets ofN-best lists of depth N=500, one from each system.",
        "Both lists are obtained after large-LM lattice rescor-ing, i.e. prior to individual MBR.",
        "A joint MBR decoding is then carried out on the aggregated 1000-best list with equal weight assigned to the posterior distribution assigned to the hypotheses by each system.",
        "Results are shown in Table 2.",
        "As shown, the scores obtained via MBR combination outperform significantly those achieved via MBR for the best-performing system (MADA).",

        "Unlike other unsupervised methods (e.g., Goldsmith (2001)), there is no restrictions on how many morphs a word can have.",
        "After training the model, the most likely segmentation of new words to morphs can be found using the Viterbi algorithm.",

        "Following the approach in (Virpioja et al., 2007), we use the Morfes-sor Categories-MAP algorithm (Creutz and Lagus, 2005).",
