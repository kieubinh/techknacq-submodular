        "Collecting children's speech data is more costly compared to adult's speech.",
        "The patentpending method developed in this work requires only adult data to estimate synthetic children's acoustic models in any language and works as follows: For a new language where only adult data is available, an adult male and an adult female model is trained.",
        "A linear transformation from each male HMM mean vector to its closest female mean vector is estimated.",
        "This transform is then scaled to a certain power and applied to the female model to obtain a synthetic children's model.",
        "In a pronunciation verification task the method yields 19% and 3.7% relative improvement on native English and Spanish children's data, respectively, compared to the best adult model.",
        "For Spanish data, the new model outperforms the available real children's data based model by 13% relative."

        "Language learning is becoming more and more important in the age of globalization.",
        "Depending on their work or cultural situation some people are confronted with various different languages on a daily basis.",
        "While it is very desirable to learn languages at any age, language learning, among other learning experiences, is comparably simpler for children than for adults and should therefore be encouraged at early ages.",
        "Even though the children's language learning market is highly important, comprising effective speech recognition tools for pronunciation assessment is relatively hard due to the special characteristics of children's speech and the limited availability of children's speech data in many languages in the speech research community.",
        "Adult speech data is usually easier to obtain.",
        "By understanding the characteristics of children's speech the unconditional need for children's speech data can be lessened by altering adult acoustic models such that they are suitable for children's speech.",
        "Children's speech has higher pitch and formants than female speech.",
        "Further, female speech has higher pitch and formants than male speech.",
        "Children's speech is more variable than female speech, and, as research has shown, female speech is more variable than male speech (Lee et al., 1999).",
        "Given this transitive chain of argumentation, the transformation from a male to a female acoustic model can be estimated for a language and applied (at a certain adjustable degree) to the female model.",
        "This process results in a synthetic children's speech model designed on the basis of the female model.",
        "Therefore, for a new language an effective synthetic children's acoustic model can be derived without the need of children's data (Hagen et al., 2008)."

        "As mentioned in Section 1, research has shown that pitch and formants of children's speech are higher than for female speech.",
        "Female speech has higher pitch and formants than male speech.",
        "In order to exploit these research results a transformation from a male acoustic model to a female acoustic model can be derived.",
        "This transformation will map a male model as close as possible to a female model.",
        "The transformation can be adjusted and applied to the female model.",
        "The resulting synthetic model can be tested on children's data.",
        "Parameters that are subject to transformation in this process are the mean vectors of the HMM states.",
        "The transformation can be represented as a square matrix in the dimension of the mean vectors.",
        "The transformation chosen in this approach is therefore linear and is for example capable of representing a vocal tract length adaptation as it was shown in (Pitz et al., 2005).",
        "Linear transformations (i.e. matrices) are also chosen in adaptation approaches as MAPLR and MLLR, whose benefit has been shown to be additive to the benefit of VTLN in speaker adaptation applications.",
        "A linear transform in the form of a matrix is therefore well suited due to its expressive power as well as its mathematical manageability.",
        "The transformation matrix used in this approach is estimated by mapping the male to the female acoustic model, such that each HMM state mean vector in the male model is assigned a corresponding mean vector in the female model.",
        "Information used in the mapping process is the basic phoneme and context.",
        "The resulting mean vector pairs are used as source and target features in the training process of the transformation matrix.",
        "During training the matrix is initialized as the identity matrix and the estimate of the mapping is refined by gradient descent.",
        "In a typical acoustic model there are several hundred, sometimes thousands, of these mean vector pairs to train the transformation matrix.",
        "The expression that needs to be minimized is:",
        "where T is the error-minimizing transformation matrix; x is a male model's source vector and y it corresponding female model's target vector.",
        "In this optimization process the Matrix A is initialized as the identity matrix.",
        "Each matrix entry ajj is updated (to the new value atj) in the following way by gradient descent:",
        "aj = aj + k(Aix - yi )xj where Az is the i-th line of matrix A and k determines the descent step size (k<0 and incorporates the factor of 2 resulting from the differentiation).",
        "The gradient descent needs to be run multiple times over all vector pairs (x,y) for the matrix to converge to an acceptable approximation which is called the transformation matrix T.",
        "The transformation matrix can be applied to the female model in order to create a new synthetic acoustic model which should suit children's speech better than adult acoustic models.",
        "It is unlikely that the transformation applied \"as is\" will result in the best model possible, therefore the transformation can be altered (amplified or weakened) in order to yield the best results.",
        "An intuitive way to alter the impact of the transformation is taking the matrix T to a certain power p. Synthetic models can be created by applyingT p to the female model, for various values p. If children's data is available for evaluation purposes, the best value of p can be determined.",
        "The power p is claimed to be language independent.",
        "It might vary in nuances, but experiments have shown that a value around 0.25 is a reasonable choice.",
