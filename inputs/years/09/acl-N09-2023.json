        "Data-driven approaches have been long applied for spoken language technologies.",
        "Although a data-driven approach requires time-consuming data annotation, the training is done automatically and requires little human supervision.",
        "These advantages have motivated the development of data-driven dialog modelings (Williams and Young, 2007, Lee et al., 2009).",
        "In general, the data-driven approaches are more robust and portable than traditional knowledge-based approaches.",
        "However, various knowledge sources are still used in many spoken dialog systems that have been developed recently.",
        "These knowledge sources contain task model, domain model, and agenda which are powerful representation to reflect the hierarchy of natural dialog control.",
        "In the spoken dialog systems, these are manually designed for various purposes including dialog modeling (Bohus and Rud-nicky, 2003, Lee et al., 2008), search space reduction (Young et al., 2007), domain knowledge (Roy and Sub-ramaniam, 2006), and user simulation (Schatzmann et al., 2007).",
        "We have proposed an example-based dialog modeling (EBDM) framework using an agenda graph as prior knowledge (Lee et al., 2008).",
        "This is one of the data-driven dialog modeling techniques and the next system action is determined by selecting the most similar dialog examples in dialog example database.",
        "In the EBDM framework for task-oriented dialogs, agenda graph is manually designed to address two aspects of a dialog management: (1) Keeping track of the dialog state with a view to ensuring steady progress towards task completion, and (2) Supporting n-best recognition hypotheses to improve the robustness of dialog manager.",
        "However, manually building such graphs for various applications may be labor intensive and time consuming.",
        "Thus, we have tried to investigate how to build this graph automatically.",
        "Consequently, we sought to solve the problem by automatically building the agenda graph using clustering method from an annotated dialog corpus."

        "Clustering techniques have been widely used to build prior knowledge for spoken dialog systems.",
        "One of them is automatic construction of domain model (or topic structure) which is one of the important resources to handle user's queries in call centers.",
        "Traditional approach to building domain models is that the analysts manually generate a domain model through inspection of the call records.",
        "However, it has recently been proposed to use an unsupervised technique to generate domain models automatically from call transcriptions (Roy and Subramaniam, 2006).",
        "In addition, there has been research on how to automatically learn models of task-oriented discourse structure using dialog act and task information (Bangalore et al., 2006).",
        "Discourse structure is necessary for dialog state-specific speech recognition and language understanding to improve the performance by predicting the next possible dialog states.",
        "In addition, the discourse structure is essential to determine whether the current utterance in the dialog is part of the current subtask or starts a new task.",
        "guidance domain",
        "More recently, it has been proposed stochastic dialog management such as the framework of a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP).",
        "This framework is statistically data-driven and theoretically principled dialog modeling.",
        "However, detailed dialog states in the master space should be clustered into general dialog states in summary space to scale up POMDP-based dialog management for practical applications (Williams and Young, 2007).",
        "To address this problem, an unsupervised automatic clustering of dialog states has been introduced and investigated in POMDP-based dialog manager (Lefevre and Mori, 2007).",
        "In this paper, we are also interested in exploring methods that would automatically construct the agenda graph as prior knowledge for the EBDM framework."

        "In other words, v corresponds to dialog state to achieve domain-specific subtask in its expected agenda.",
        "Each node includes three different components: (1) A precondition that must be true before the subtask is executed; (2) A description of the node that includes its label and identifier; and (3) Links to nodes that will be executed at the subsequent turn.",
        "In this system, this graph is used to rescore n-best ASR hypotheses and to interpret the discourse state such as new task, next task, and new subtask based on topological position on the graph.",
        "In the agenda graph G, each node holds a set of relevant dialog examples which may appear in the corresponding dialog states when a precondition of the node is true.",
        "To determine the next system action, the dialog manager first generates possible candidate nodes with n-best hypotheses by using a discourse interpretation algorithm based on the agenda graph, and then selects the focus node which is the most likely dialog state given the previous dialog state.",
        "Finally the best example in the focus node is selected to determine appropriate system action.",
        "Human efforts are required to manually design the agenda graph to integrate it into the EBDM framework.",
