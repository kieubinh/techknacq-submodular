        "However, due to the vast amount of information available and the open nature of the spoken queries, these applications still suffer from recognition errors.",
        "This paper explores the utilization of personalization features for the post-processing of recognition results in the form of n-best lists.",
        "Personalization is carried out from three different angles: short-term, long-term and Web-based, and a large variety of features are proposed for use in a log-linear classification framework.",
        "Experimental results on data obtained from a commercially deployed Voice Search system show that the combination of the proposed features leads to a substantial sentence error rate reduction.",
        "In addition, it is shown that personalization features which are very different in nature can successfully complement each other."

        "Search engines are a powerful mechanism to find specific content through the use of queries.",
        "In recent years, due to the vast amount of information available, there has been significant research on the use of recommender algorithms to select what information will be presented to the user.",
        "These systems try to predict what content a user may want based not only on the user's query but on the user's past queries, history of clicked results, and preferences.",
        "In (Tee-van et al., 1996) it was observed that a significant percent of the queries made by a user in a search engine are associated to a repeated search.",
        "Recommender systems like (Das et al., 2007) and (Dou et al., 2007) take advantage of this fact to refine the search results and improve the search experience.",
        "In this paper, we explore the use of personalization in the context of voice searches rather than web queries.",
        "Specifically, we focus on data from a multimodal cellphone-based business search application (Acero et al., 2008).",
        "In such an application, repeated queries can be a powerful tool for personalization.",
        "These can be classified into short and long-term repetitions.",
        "Short-term repetitions are typically caused by a speech recognition error, which produces an incorrect search result and makes the user repeat or reformulate the query.",
        "On the other hand, long-term repetitions, as in text-based search applications, occur when the user needs to access some information that was accessed previously, for example, the exact location of a pet clinic.",
        "This paper proposes several different user personalization methods for increasing the recognition accuracy in Voice Search applications.",
        "The proposed personalization methods are based on extracting short-term, long-term and Web-based features from the user's history.",
        "In recent years, other user personalization methods like deriving personalized pronunciations have proven successful in the context of mobile applications (Deligne et al., 2002).",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the classification method used for rescoring the recognition hypotheses.",
        "Section 3 describes the proposed personalization methods.",
        "Section 4 describes the experiments carried out.",
        "Finally, conclusions from this work are drawn in section 5."

        "Short-term personalization aims at modeling the repair/repetition behavior of the user.",
        "Short-term features are a mechanism suitable for representing negative evidence: if the user repeats a utterance it normally means that the hypotheses in the previous n-best lists are not correct.",
        "For this reason, if a hypothesis is contained in a preceding n-best list, that hypothesis should be weighted negatively during the rescoring.",
        "A straightforward method for identifying likely repetitions consists of using a fixed size time window and considering all the user queries within that window as part of the same repetition round.",
        "Once an appropriate window size has been determined, the proposed short-term features can be extracted for each hypothesis using a binary tree like the one depicted in figure 1, where feature values are in the leaves of the tree.",
        "Does a recent (60s) n-best list contain the hypothesis we are scoring?",

This can be seen to be the same as a maximum entropy formulation where the class is defined as the word sequence (thus allowing potentially infinite values) but with sums restricted as a computational convenience to only those class values (word strings) appearing on the n-best list.",
        "The models were estimated with a widely available toolkit (Mahajan, 2007).",
        "more recently than any other competing hypothesis.",
        "• User history (edit distance): minimum edit distance between the hypothesis and the closest query in the user history, normalized by the number of words.",
        "• User history (words in common): maximum number of words in common between the hypothesis and each of the queries in the user history, normalized by the number of words in the hypothesis.",
        "• User history (plural/singular): 1 if either the plural or singular version of the hypothesis appears in the user history, otherwise 0.",

        "• Search results rank: sort the hypotheses in the n-best list by their relative value of x and use the rank as a feature.",

        "In the experiments, due to their lower oracle error rate, n-bests from the enhanced decoder were used for doing the rescoring.",
        "However, these n-bests do not correspond to the listings shown in the user's device screen (i.e. do not match the user interaction) so are not suitable for identifying repetitions.",

        "The proposed features reduce the SER of the baseline system by 3.19% absolute on the rescoring set, and by 1.40% absolute on the whole set of transcribed utterances.",
        "Repetition based features are moderately useful; by incorporating them into the rescoring it is possible to reduce the SER from 24.73% to 24.32%.",
        "Although repetitions cover a large percentage of the data, it is believed that inconsistencies in the user interaction (the right listing is displayed but not confirmed by the user) prevented further improvement.",
        "As expected, long-term personalization based features contribute to improve the classification accuracy.",
        "The UH (occurrences) feature by itself is able to reduce the SER in about a 1%.",

        "In this respect it is interesting to note that a right design of the features seems critical to take full advantage of it.",
        "The relative number of counts of one hypothesis respect to other hypotheses in the n-best list is more informative than an absolute or ranked count.",
        "A simple feature using this kind of information, like Live Search (relative I), can reduce the SER in more than 1% respect to the baseline.",
