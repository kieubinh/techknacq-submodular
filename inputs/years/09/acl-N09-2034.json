        "The speech understanding component in a spoken dialogue system consists of an automatic speech recognition (ASR) component and a language understanding (LU) component.",
        "To develop a speech understanding component, we need to prepare an ASR language model (LM) and a language understanding model (LUM) for the dialogue domain of the system.",
        "There are many types of LMs such as finite-state grammars and N-grams, and many types of LUMs such as finite-state transducers (FST), weighted finite-state transducers (WFST), and keyphrase-extractors (extractor).",
        "Selecting a suitable combination of LM and LUM is necessary for robust speech understanding against various user utterances.",
        "Conventional studies of speech understanding have investigated which LM and LUM give the best performance by using fixed training and test data such as the Air Travel Information System (ATIS) corpus.",
        "However, in real system development, resources such as training data for statistical models and efforts to write finite-state grammars vary according to the available human resources or budgets.",
        "Domain-dependent training data are particularly difficult to obtain.",
        "Therefore, in conventional system development, system developers determine the types of LM and LUM by trial and error.",
        "Every LM and LUM has some advantages and disadvantages, so it is difficult for a single combination of LM and LUM to gain high accuracy except in a situation involving a lot of training data and effort.",
        "Therefore, using multiple speech understanding methods is a more effective approach.",
        "In this paper, we propose a speech understanding framework called \"Multiple Language models and Multiple Understanding models (MLMU)\", in which multiple LMs and LUMs are used, to achieve better performance under the various development situations.",
        "It selects the best speech understanding result from the multiple results generated by arbitrary combinations of LMs and LUMs.",

        "The framework selects one understanding result from multiple results or calculates a confidence score of the result by using the generated multiple understanding results.",
        "MLMU can improve speech understanding for the following reason.",
        "The performance of each speech understanding (a combination of LM and LUM) might not be very high when either training data for the statistical model or available expertise and effort for writing grammar are insufficient.",
        "In such cases, some utterances might not be covered by the system's finite-state grammar LM, and probability estimation in the statistical models may not be very good.",
        "Using multiple speech understanding models is expected to solve this problem because each model has different specialities.",
        "For example, finite-state grammar LMs and FST-based LUMs achieve high accuracy in recognizing and understanding in-grammar utterances, whereas out-of-grammar utterances are covered by N-gram models and LUMs based on WFST and keyphrase-extractors.",
        "Therefore it is more possible that the understanding results of MLMU will include the correct result than a case when a single understanding model is used.",
        "The understanding results of MLMU will be helpful in many ways.",
        "We used them to achieve better understanding accuracy by selecting the most reliable one.",
        "This selection is based on features concerning ASR results and language understanding results.",
        "It is also possible to delay the selection, holding multiple understanding result candidates that will be disambiguated as the dialogue proceeds (Bo-hus, 2004).",
        "Furthermore, confidence scores, which enable an efficient dialogue management (Komatani and Kawahara, 2000), can be calculated by ranking these results or by voting on them, by using multiple speech understanding results.",
