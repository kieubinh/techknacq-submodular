        "As speech-to-speech translation systems move from the laboratory into field deployment, we quickly see that mismatch in training data with field use can degrade the performance of the system.",
        "Retraining based on field usage is a common technique used in all speech systems to improve performance.",
        "In the case of speech-to-speech translation we would particularly like to be able to adapt the system based on its usage automatically without having to ship data back to the laboratory for retraining.",
        "This paper investigates the scenario of a two-day event.",
        "We wish to improve the system for the second day based on the data collected on the first day.",
        "Our system is designed for eyes-free use and hence provides no graphical user interface.",
        "This allows the user to concentrate on his surrounding environment during an operation.",
        "The system only provides audio control and feedback.",
        "Additionally the system operates on a push-to-talk method.",
        "Previously the system (Hsiao et al., 2006; Bach et al., 2007) needed 2 buttons to operate, one for the English speaker and the other one for the Iraqi speaker.",
        "To make the system easier and faster to use, we propose to use a single button which can be controlled by the English speaker.",
        "We mounted a microphone and a Wii remote controller together as shown in 1.",
        "Since the Wii controller has an accelerometer which can be used to detect the orientation of the controller, this feature can be applied to identify who is speaking.",
        "When the English speaker points towards himself, the system will switch to English-Iraqi translation.",
        "However, when the Wii is pointed towards somebody else, the system will switch to Iraqi-English translation.",
        "In addition, we attach a light on the Wii controller providing visual feedback.",
        "This can inform an Iraqi speaker when to start speaking.",
        "The overall system is composed of five major components: two automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, a bidirectional statistical machine translation (SMT) system and two text-to-speech (TTS) systems."

      "heading": "2. Data Scenario",
      "text": [
        "The standard data that is available for the TransTac project was collected by recording human interpreter mediated dialogs between war fighters and Iraqi native speakers in various scenarios.",
        "The dialog partners were aware that the data was being collected for training machine based translation devices, but would often talk directly to the human interpreter rather than pretending it was an automatic device.",
        "This means that the dialog partners soon ignored the recording equipment and used a mostly natural language, using informal pronunciation and longer sentences with more disfluencies than we find in machine mediated translation dialogs.",
        "Most users mismatch their language when they communicate using an automatic speech-to-speech translation system.",
        "They often switch to a clearer pronunciation and use shorter and simpler sentences with less dis-fluency.",
        "This change could have a significant impact on speech recognition and machine translation performance if a system was originally trained on data from the interpreter mediated dialogs.",
        "For this reason, additional data was collected during the TransTac meeting in June of 2008.",
        "This data was collected with dialog partners using the speech-to-speech translation systems from 4 developer participants in the TransTac program.",
        "The dialog partners were given a description of the specific scenario in form of a rough script and had to speak their sentences into the translation systems.",
        "The dialog partners were not asked to actually react to the potentially incorrect translations but just followed the script, ignoring the output of the translation system.",
        "This has the effect that the dialog partners are no longer talking to a human interpreter, but to a machine, pressing push-to-talk buttons etc.",
        "and will change their speech patterns accordingly.",
        "The data was collected over two days, with around 2 hours of actual speech per day.",
        "This data was transcribed and translated, resulting in 864 and 824 utterance pairs on day 1 and 2, respectively."

        "The acoustic model has 6000 codebooks and each codebook has at most 64 Gaussian mixtures determined by merge-and-split training.",
        "Semi-tied covariance and boosted MMI discriminative training is performed to improve the model (Povey et al., 2009).",

        "To perform LM adaptation for the ASR system, we use the ASR hypotheses from day 1 to build a LM.",
        "This LM is then interpolated with the original trigram LM to produce an adapted LM for day 2.",
        "We also evaluate the effect of having transcribers provide accurate transcription references for day 1 data, and see how it may improve the performance on day 2.",
        "We compare unigram, bigram and trigram LMs for adaptation.",
        "Since the amount of day 1 data is much smaller than the whole training set and we do not assume transcription of day 1 is always available, the interpolation weight is chosen of be 0.9 for the original trigram LM and 0.1 for the new LM built from the day 1 data.",
        "The WER of baseline ASR system on day 1 is 32.0%.",
        "The results in Table 1 show that the ASR benefits from LM adaptation.",
        "Adapting day 1 data can slightly improve the performance of day 2.",
        "The improvement is larger when day 1 transcript is available which is expected.",
        "The result also shows that the unigram LM is the most robust model for adaptation as it works reasonably well when transcripts are not available, whereas bigram and trigram LM are more sensitive to the ASR errors made on day 1.",

        "This approach is similar to the work in (Chen et al., 2008).",
        "sThe adaptation framework is 1) create a domain-specific LM via an n-best list of day 1 machine translation hypothesis, or day 1 translation references; 2) retune the translation system on day 1 via minimum error rate training (MERT) (Venugopal and Vogel, 2005).",
        "The first question we would like to address is whether our adaptation obtains improvements via an unsupervised manner.",
