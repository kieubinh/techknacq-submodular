        "A question addressed neither by Hogan et al.",
        "nor anyone else working on broad coverage surface realization recently is whether reported increases in BLEU scores actually correspond to observable improvements in quality.",
        "We view this situation as problematic, not only because Callison-Burch et al.",
        "(2006) have shown that BLEU does not always rank competing systems in accord with human judgments, but also because surface realization scores are typically much higher than those in MT – where BLEU's performance has been repeatedly assessed – even when using just one reference.",
        "Thus, in this paper, we present a targeted manual evaluation confirming that our BLEU score increase corresponds to a significant rise in fluency, a practice we encourage others to adopt."

        "CCG (Steedman, 2000) is a unification-based cat-egorial grammar formalism defined almost entirely in terms of lexical entries that encode sub-categorization as well as syntactic features (e.g. number and agreement).",
        "OpenCCG is a parsing/generation library which includes a hybrid symbolic-statistical chart realizer (White, 2006).",
        "A vital component of the realizer is the hypertagger (Espinosa et al., 2008), which predicts lexical category assignments using a maxent model trained on contexts within a directed graph structure representing the logical form (LF) input; features and relations in the graph as well as parent child relationships are the main features used to train the model.",
        "The realizer takes as input an LF description (see Figure 1 of Espinosa et al., 2008), but here we also use LFs with class information on some elementary predications (e.g. @x:MONEY($-10,000)).",
        "Chart realization proceeds in iterative beta-best fashion, with a progressively wider hypertagger beam width.",
        "Ifno complete realization is found within the time limit, fragments are greedily assembled.",
        "Alternative realizations are ranked using integrated n-gram scoring; n-gram models help in choosing word order and, to a lesser extent, making lexical choices."

        "Inspired by Hogan et al.",
        "'s (2007)'s Experiment 1, we decided to use the BBN corpus NE annotation (Weischedel and Brunstein, 2005) to collapse certain classes of NEs.",
        "But unlike their experiment where all the NEs annotated by the BBN corpus are collapsed, we chose to collapse into single tokens only NEs whose exact form can be reasonably expected to be specified in the input to the realizer.",
        "For example, while some quantificational or comparatives phrases like more than $ 10,000 are annotated as MONEY in the BBN corpus, in our view only $J0,000 should be collapsed into an atomic unit, with more than handled compositionally according to the semantics assigned to it by the grammar.",
        "Thus, after transferring the BBN annotations to the CCGbank corpus, we (partially) collapsed NEs which are CCGbank constituents according to the following rules: (1) completely collapse the PERSON, ORGANIZATION, GPE, WORK OF ART major class type entitites; (2) ignore phrases like three decades later, which are annotated as DATE entities; and (3) collapse all phrases with POS tags CD or NNP(S) or lexical items % or $, ensuring that all prototypical named entities are collapsed."

        "Our baseline results are much better than those previously reported with OpenCCG in large part due to improved grammar engineering efforts and bug fixing.",
        "Table 3 shows development set results which indicate that collapsing appears to improve realization on the whole, as evidenced by the small increase in BLEU scores.",
        "The class-replaced word model provides a big boost on the collapsed corpus, from 0.7917 to 0.7993, much more than 4-grams.",

        "Standard test set results, reported in Table 4, confirm the overall increase, from 0.7940 to 0.8173.",
        "In analyzing the Section 00 results, we found that with the collapsed corpus, NE errors were reduced from 238 to 99, which explains why the BLEU score increases despite the drop in exact matches and grammatically complete realizations from the baseline.",

        "While the language models employing NE classes certainly improve some examples, others are made worse, and some are just changed to different, but equally acceptable paraphrases.",
