        "It is typical that applications for biomedical text involve the use of natural language syntactic parsers as one of the first steps in processing.",
        "Thus, the performance of the system as a whole is largely dependent on how well the natural language syntactic parsers perform.",
        "One of the challenges in parsing biomedical text is that it is significantly more complex than articles in typical English text.",
        "Different analysis show other problematic characteristics, including inconsistent use of nouns and partial words (Tateisi & Tsujii, 2004), higher perplexity measures (Elhadad, 2006), greater lexical density, plus increased number of relative clauses and prepositional phrases (Gemoets, 2004), all of which correlate with diminished comprehension and higher text difficulty.",
        "These characteristics also lead to performance problems in terms of computation time and accuracy for parsers that are trained on common English text corpus.",
        "We identified three categories of sentences: 1) normal English sentences, like in Newswire text, 2) normal biomedical English sentences - those sentences which can be parsed without a problem by Link Grammar-, and 3) complex biomedical English sentences - those sentences which can't be parsed by Link Grammar.",
        "Aside from the known characteristics mentioned before, sentences in the third group tended to be longer (18% of them had more than 50 words, while only 8% of those in group 2 and 2% of those in group 1 did).",
        "It has been observed that parsers perform well with sentences of reduced length (Chandrasekar & Srini-vas, 1997; Siddharthan, 2006).",
        "In this paper, we explore the use of text simplification as a preprocessing step for general parsing to reduce length and complexity of biomedical sentences in order to enhance the performance of the parsers."

      "heading": "2. Methods",
      "text": [
        "There are currently many publicly available corpora of biomedical texts, the most popular among them being Biolnfer, Genia, Aimed, HPRD 50, IEPA, LLL and BioCreativel-PPI.",
        "Among these corpora, BioInfer includes the most comprehensive collection of sentences and careful annotation for links of natural parser, in both the Stanford and Link Grammar schemes.",
        "Therefore, we chose the BioInfer corpus, version 1.1.0 (Pyysalo et al., 2007), containing 1100 sentences for evaluating the effectiveness of our simplification method on the performance of syntactic parsers.",
        "The method includes syntactic and non-syntactic transformations, detailed next.",
        "We group here three steps of our approach: 1. preprocessing through removal of spurious phrases; 2. replacement of gene names; 3. replacement of noun phrases.",
        "To improve the correctness of the parsing, each biomedical sentence is first preprocessed to remove phrases that are not essential to the sentence.",
        "This includes removal of section indicators, which are phrases that specify the name of the section at the beginning of the sentence, plus the removal of phrases in parentheses (such as citations and numbering in lists).",
        "Also, partially hyphenated words are transformed by combining with the nearest word that follows or precedes the partial hyphenated word to make a meaningful word.",
        "For instance, the phrase \"alpha- and beta-catenin\" is transformed into \"alpha-catenin and beta-catenin\".",
        "Occurrences of multi-word technical terms and entity names involved in biomedical processes are common in biomedical text.",
        "Such terms are not likely to appear in the dictionary of a parser (perplexity is high), and will force it to use morpho-guessing and unknown word guessing.",
        "This is time consuming and prone to error.",
        "Thus, unlike typical text simplification that emphasizes syntactic transformation of sentences, our approach utilizes a named entity recognition engine, BANNER (Leaman & Gonzalez, 2008), to replace multi-word gene names with single-word placeholders.",
        "Replacement of gene names with single elements is not enough, however, and grammatical category (i.e. singular or plural) of the element has to be considered.",
        "Lingpipe (Alias-i, 2006), a shallow parser for biomedical text, identifies noun phrases and replaces them with single elements.",
        "A single element is considered singular when the following verb indicates a third-person singular verb or the determiner preceded by the element is either \"a\" or \"an\".",
        "Otherwise it is considered as plural and an \"s\" is attached to the end of the element.",
        "The problem of simplifying long sentences in common English text has been studied before, notably by Chandrasekar & Srinivas (1997) and Sidd-harthan (2006).",
        "However, the techniques used in these studies might not totally solve the issue of parsing biomedical sentences.",
        "For example, using Siddharthan's approach, the biological finding \"The Huntington's disease protein interacts with p53 and CREB-binding protein and represses transcription\", and assuming multi-word nouns such as \"CREB-binding protein\" do not present a problem, would be simplified to:",
        "\"The Huntington S disease protein interacts with p53.",
        "The Huntington's disease protein interacts with CREB-binding protein.",
        "The Huntington's disease protein represses transcription. \"",
        "Our method transforms it to \"GENE1 interacts with GENE2 and GENE3 and represses transcription.\"",
        "Both decrease the average sentence length, but the earlier distorts the biological meaning (since the Huntington's disease protein might not repress transcription on its own), while the latter signifies it.",
        "While replacement of gene names and noun phrases can reduce the sentence length, there are Original sentence ST: The gene for the human CREB binding protein, the transcriptional coactivator CBP, is included in the RT1 cosmid.",
        "and mutations in CBP have recently been identified in RTS patients.",

        "We developed a simple algorithm that utilizes linkages (specific grammatical relationships between pairs of words in a sentence) of the Link Grammar parser (Sleator, 1998) and punctuations for splitting sentences into clauses.",
        "An example in Figure 1 illustrates the main part of the algorithm.",
        "Each linkage has a primary link type in CAPITAL followed by secondary link type in short.",
        "The intuition behind the algorithm is to try to identify independent clauses from complex sentences.",
        "The first step is to split the sentence ST into clauses c1, c2, c3 and c4 based on commas.",
        "c1 is parsed using the Link Grammar parser, but c1 cannot be a sentence as there is no \"S\" link in the linkage of c1.",
        "c2 is then attached to c1 and the linkage of \"c1, c2\" does not contain a \"S\" link as well.",

        "Our method has the greatest impact on the performance of Link Grammar (LG), which lies at the core of BioLG (Pyysalo et al., 2006).",
        "However, it also has a significant impact on the self-training biomedical parser by McClosky & Charniak (CM), which is currently the best parser available for biomedical text.",
        "3.1 Rudimentary statistics of the results of simplification: After the simplification algorithm was tested on the 1100 annotated sentences of the Bio-Infer corpus, there were 1159 simplified sentences because of syntactic transformation (section 2.2).",
        "The number of words per sentence showed a sharp drop of 20.4% from 27.0 to 21.5.",
        "The Flesh-Kincaid score for readability dropped from 17.4 to 14.2.",
        "The Gunning Fog index also dropped by 18.3% from 19.7 to 16.1.",

        "The average time for parsing a sentence also dropped from 7.36 secs to 1.70 secs after simplification.",
        "3.3 Impact of simplification on the accuracy of parsing: Let Eg, Zo and Zs, respectively be the sets containing the links of the gold standard, the output generated by the parser on original sentences and the output generated by the parser on simplified sentences.",
        "We denote a link of type n between the tokens $1 and <D2 by (n,01,02).",
        "In the case of the original sentences, the tokens 01and <D2are single-worded.",
        "So, (n,01,02) is a true positive iff (n,01,02) belongs to both Zg and Zo, false positive iff it only belongs to Zo and false negative iff it only belongs to Zg.",
        "In the case of simplified sentences, the tokens 01and <D2 can have multiple words.",
        "So, (n,01,02) which belongs to Zs is a true positive iff (n,<l>'1,<l>'2) belongs to Zg where $'1 and $'2 are respectively one of the words in $1 and <D2.",
        "Additionally, (n,$1,$2) which belongs to Zg is not a false negative if $1 and <D2 are parts of a single token of a simplified sentence.",
        "For measuring the performance of a parser, the nature of linkage is most relevant in the context of the sentence in consideration.",
        "So, we calculate precision and recall for each sentence and average them over all sentences to get the respective precision and recall for the collection.",
