        "In the community of sentiment analysis (Turney 2002; Pang et al., 2002; Tang et al., 2009), transferring a sentiment classifier from one source domain to another target domain is still far from a trivial work, because sentiment expression often behaves with strong domain-specific nature.",
        "Up to this time, many researchers have proposed techniques to address this problem, such as classifiers adaptation, generalizable features detection and so on (DaumeIII et al., 2006; Jiang et al., 2007; Tan et al., 2007; Tan et al., 2008; Tan et al., 2009).",
        "Among these techniques, SCL (Structural Correspondence Learning) (Blitzer et al., 2006) is regarded as a promising method to tackle transfer-learning problem.",
        "The main idea behind SCL model is to identify correspondences among features from different domains by modeling their correlations with pivot features (or generalizable features).",
        "Pivot features behave similarly in both domains.",
        "If non-pivot features from different domains are correlated with many of the same pivot features, then we assume them to be corresponded with each other, and treat them similarly when training a sentiment classifier.",
        "However, SCL model treats each feature as well as each instance by an equivalent-weight strategy.",
        "From the perspective of feature, this strategy fails to overcome the adverse influence of high-frequency domain-specific (HFDS) features.",
        "For example, the words \"stock\" or \"market\" occurs frequently in most of stock reviews, so these non-sentiment features tend to have a strong correspondence with pivot features.",
        "As a result, the representative ability of the other sentiment features will inevitably be weakened to some degree.",
        "To address this issue, we proposed Frequently Exclusively-occurring Entropy (FEE) to pick out HFDS features, and proposed a feature-weighted SCL model (FW-SCL) to adjust the influence of HFDS features in building correspondence.",
        "The main idea of FW-SCL is to assign a smaller weight to HFDS features so that the adverse influence of HFDS features can be decreased.",
        "From the other perspective, the equivalent-weight strategy of SCL model ignores the labels (\"positive\" or \"negative\") of labeled instances.",
        "Obviously, this is not a good idea.",
        "In fact, positive pivot features tend to occur in positive instances, so the correlations built on positive instances are more reliable than that built on negative instances; and vice versa.",
        "Consequently, utilization of labels of instances and pivot features can decrease the adverse influence of some co-occurrences, such as co-occurrences involved with positive pivot features and negative instances, or involved with negative pivot features and positive instances.",
        "In order to take into account the labels of labeled instances, we proposed an instance-weighted SCL model (IW-SCL), which assigns a larger weight to instances with the same label as the involved pivot feature.",
        "In this time, we obtain a combined model: feature-weighted and instanceweighted SCL model (FWIW-SCL).",
        "For the sake of convenience, we simplify \"FWIW-SCL\" as \"W-SCL\" in the rest of this paper."

        "Pivot features occur frequently in both the source and the target domain.",
        "In the community of sentiment analysis, generalizable sentiment words are good candidates for pivot features, such as \"good\" and \"excellent\".",
        "In the rest of this paper, we use K to stand for the number of pivot features.",
        "Second, we need to compute the pivot predictors (or mapping vectors) using selected pivot features.",
        "The pivot predictors are the key job, because they directly decide the performance of SCL.",
        "For each pivot feature k, we use a loss function Lk,",
        "Lk =Z(k(x)wTx, -l)+4f (1)where the function pk(xi) indicates whether the pivot feature k occurs in the instance x , [-1 otherwise where the weight vector w encodes the correspondence of the non-pivot features with the pivot feature k (Blitzer et al., 2006).",
        "Finally we use the augmented space [xT, xTW]T to train the classifier on the source labeled data and predict the examples on the target domain, where W=[wi,W2, Wk]."
