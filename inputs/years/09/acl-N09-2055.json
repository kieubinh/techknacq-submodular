        "Current machine translation systems are far from perfect.",
        "To achieve high-quality output, the raw translations they generate often need to be corrected, or post-edited by human translators.",
        "One way of increasing the productivity of the whole process is the development of automatic post-editing (APE) systems (Dugast et al., 2007; Simard et al., 2007).",

        "Many of these works propose a combination of rule-based machine translation (RBMT) and statistical machine translation (SMT) systems, in order to take advantage of the particular capabilities of each system (Chen and Chen, 1997).",
        "A possible combination is to automatically post-edit the output of a RBMT system employing a SMT system.",
        "In this work, we will apply this technique into two different corpora: Parliament and Protocols.",
        "In addition, we will propose a new human evaluation measure that will deal with the impact of the automatic post-editing.",
        "This paper is structured as follows: after a brief introduction of the RBMT, SMT, and APE systems in Section 2, Section 3 details the carried out experimentation, discussing its results.",
        "Finally, some conclusions and future work are presented in Section 4."

        "RBMT was the first approach to machine translation, and thus, a relatively mature area in this field.",
        "RBMT systems are basically constituted by two components: the rules, that account for the syntactic knowledge, and the lexicon, which deals with the morphological, syntactic, and semantic information.",
        "Both rules and lexicons are grounded on linguistic knowledge and generated by expert linguists.",
        "As a result, the build process is expensive and the system is difficult to maintain (Bennett and Slocum, 1985).",
        "Furthermore, RBMT systems fail to adapt to new domains.",
        "Although they usually provide a mechanism to create new rules and extend and adapt the lexicon, changes are usually very costly and the results, frequently, do not pay off (Isabelle et al., 2007).",

        "In SMT, translations are generated on the basis of statistical models, which are derived from the analysis of bilingual text corpora.",

        "In practice, several models are often combined into a log-linear fashion.",

        "Thus, a binary measure was chosen, the suitability, where the translations are identified as suitable or not suitable.",
        "A given translation is considered to be suitable if it can be manually post-edited with effort savings, i.e., the evaluator thinks that a manual post-editing will increase his productivity.",
