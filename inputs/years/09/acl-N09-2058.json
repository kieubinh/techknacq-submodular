        "The job of a surface realizer is to transform an input semantic/syntactic form into a sequence of words.",
        "This task includes word choice, and word and constituent ordering.",
        "In English, the positions of required elements of a sentence, verb phrase or noun phrase are relatively fixed.",
        "However, many sentences also include adverbials whose position is not fixed (Figure 1).",
        "There may be several appropriate positions for an adverbial in a particular context, but other positions give output that is non-idiomatic or disfluent, ambiguous, or incoherent.",
        "Some computational research has included models for adjunct ordering (e.g. (Ringger et al., 2004; Marciniak and Strube, 2004; Elhadad et al., 2001)).",
        "However, this is the first computational study to look specifically at adverbials.",
        "Adverbial positioning has long been studied in linguistics (e.g. (Keyser, 1968; Allen and Cruttenden, 1974; Ernst, 1984; Haider, 2000)).",
        "Most linguistic research focuses on whether adverbial placement is functional or semantic in nature.",
        "However, Costa (2004) takes a more flexible feature-based approach that uses: lexical features (e.g. phonological shape, ambiguity of meaning, categorical status); syntactic features (e.g. possible adjunction sites, directionality of adjunction, domain of modification); and information structure features (e.g. focus, contrast).",
        "We decided to evaluate Costa's approach computationally, using features automatically extracted from an annotated corpus.",
        "In this paper, we compare three approaches to adverbial positioning: a simple baseline approach using lexical and syntactic features, and one-and two-stage classification-based approaches using lexical, syntactic, semantic and sentence-level features.",
        "We apply these approaches in a hybrid surface realizer that uses a probabilistic grammar to produce realization alternatives, and a second-stage classifier to select among alternatives.",
        "We find that: (a) One-and two-stage classification-based approaches can achieve almost 86% accuracy in determining the absolute position of adverbials; (b) A classifier trained with only syntactic features gives performance close to that of a classifier trained with all features; and (c) A surface realizer using a two-stage classifier for adverbial positioning can get improvements of at least 10% in simple string accuracy over a baseline realizer for sentences containing adverbials.",
        "As well as being useful for surface realization, a model of adverbial ordering can be used in machine translation (e.g. (Ogura et al., 1997)), language learning software (e.g. (Leacock, 2007; Burstein et al., 2004)), and automatic summarization (e.g. (El-hadad et al., 2001; Clarke and Lapata, 2007; Madnani et al., 2007)).",

        "These phrases mostly modify S constituents (including RRC, S, SBAR, SBARQ, SINV, SQ), VP constituents, or NP constituents (including NP and WHNP), but also modify other adjuncts (PP, ADJP or ADVP) and other phrase types (FRAG,",

        "It may also have other adverbial siblings.",
        "In the sentence in Figure 1, at your bank has one adverbial and two non-adverbial siblings.",

(Marciniak and Strube, 2004)): the ordering of a pair of adverbials is assigned to be the most frequent in the training data, given the lexical head, adverbial phrase type, and category of each adverbial.",

        "This is somewhat surprising given Costa's arguments about the need for lexical and discourse features; it may be due to errors introduced by approximating discourse features automatically, as well as to data sparsity in the lexical features.",
