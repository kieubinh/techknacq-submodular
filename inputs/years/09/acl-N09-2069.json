        "While English abbreviations are usually formed as acronyms, Chinese abbreviations are much more complex, as shown in Figure 1.",
        "Most of the Chinese abbreviations are formed by selecting several characters from full-names, which are not necessarily the first character of each word.",

        "However, reordering of characters as shown in the third example in Figure 1 where characters \"3.\"",
        "and \"SL\" are swapped in the abbreviation, also happens.",
        "There has been a considerable amount of research on extracting full-name and abbreviation pairs in the same document for obtaining abbreviations (Li and Yarowsky, 2008; Sun et al., 2006; Fu et al., 2006).",
        "However, generation of abbreviations given a full-name is still a non-trivial problem.",
        "Chang and Lai (Chang and Lai, 2004) have proposed using a hidden Markov model to generate abbreviations from full-names.",
        "However, their method assumes that there is no word-to-null mapping, which means that every word in the full-name has to contribute at least one character to the abbreviation.",
        "This assumption does not hold for organizations' names which have many word skips in the abbreviation generation.",
        "The CRF was first introduced to natural language processing (NLP) by (Lafferty et al., 2001) and has been widely used in word segmentation, part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and some other NLP tasks.",
        "In this paper, we convert the Chinese abbreviation generation process to a CRF tagging problem.",
        "The key problem here is how to find a group of discriminant and robust features.",
        "After using the CRF, we get a list of abbreviation candidates with associate probability scores.",
        "We also use the prior conditional probability of the length of the abbreviations given the length of the full-names to complement the CRF probability scores.",
        "Such global information is hard to include in the CRF model.",
        "In addition, we apply the full-name and abbreviation candidate cooccurrence statistics obtained on the web to increase the correctness of the abbreviation candidates."

        "Chinese abbreviations are generated by three methods (Lee, 2005): reduction, elimination, and generalization.",

        "Note that this paper does not cover the case when the order is changed.",
        "The elimination means that one or more words in the full-name are ignored completely, while the reduction requires that at least one character is selected from each word.",
        "All the three examples in Figure 1 are produced by the elimination, where at least one word is skipped.",
        "Generalization, which is used to abbreviate a list of similar terms, is usually composed of the number of terms and a shared character across the terms.",
        "A example is \"3 (three forces) for \"p£ ^, , § (land force, sea force, air force).",
