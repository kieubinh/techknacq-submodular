        "Coreference resolution is the task of partitioning a set of mentions (i.e. person, organization and location) into entities.",
        "A mention is an instance oftextual reference to an object, which can be either named (e.g. Barack Obama), nominal (e.g. the president) or pronominal (e.g. he, his, it).",
        "An entity is an aggregate of all the mentions (of any level) which refer to one conceptual entity.",
        "For example, in the following sentence:",
        "John said Mary was his sister.",
        "there are four mentions: John, Mary, his, and sister.",
        "John and his belong to the one entity since they refer to the same person; Mary and sister both refer to another person entity.",
        "Furthermore, John and Mary are named mentions, sister is a nominal mention and his is a pronominal mention.",
        "In this paper, we present a potential approach for improving the performance of coreference resolution by using classifier combination techniques such as bagging and boosting.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort that utilizes classifier combination for improving coreference resolution.",
        "Combination methods have been applied to many problems in natural-language processing (NLP).",
        "Examples include the ROVER system (Fiscus, 1997) for speech recognition, the Multi-Engine Machine Translation (MEMT) system (Jayaraman and Lavie, 2005), and part-of-speech tagging (Brill and Wu, 1998; Halteren et al., 2001).",
        "Most of these techniques have shown a considerable improvement over the performance of a single classifier and, therefore, lead us to consider implementing such a multiple-classifier system for coreference resolution as well.",
        "Using classifier combination techniques one can potentially achieve a classification accuracy that is superior to that of the single best classifier.",
        "This is based on the assumption that the errors made by each of the classifiers are not identical, and therefore if we intelligently combine multiple classifier outputs, we may be able to correct some of these errors.",
        "The main contributions of this paper are:",
        "• Demonstrating the potential for improvement in the baseline - By implementing a system that behaves like an oracle, we have shown that the output of the combination of multiple classifiers has the potential to be significantly higher in accuracy than any of the individual classifiers.",
        "• Adapting traditional bagging techniques - Multiple classifiers, generated using bagging techniques, were combined using an entity-level sum",
        "rule and mention-level majority voting.",
        "• Implementing a document-level boosting algorithm - A boosting algorithm was implemented in which a coreference resolution classifier was iteratively trained using a re-weighted training set, where the reweighting was done at the document level.",
        "• Addressing the problem of entity alignment In order to apply combination techniques to multiple classifiers, we need to address entity-alignment issues, explained later in this paper.",
        "The baseline coreference system we use is similar to the one described by Luo et al.",
        "(Luo et al., 2004).",
        "In such a system, mentions are processed sequentially, and at each step, a mention is either linked to one of existing entities, or used to create a new entity.",
        "At the end of this process, each possible partition of the mentions corresponds to a unique sequence of link or creation actions, each of which is scored by a statistical model.",
        "The one with the highest score is output as the final coreference result."

        "One way to obtain multiple classifiers is via bagging or bootstrap aggregating (Breiman, 1996).",
        "These classifiers, obtained using randomly-sampled training sets, may be combined to improve classification.",
        "We generated several classifiers by two techniques.",
        "In the first technique, we randomly sample the set of documents (training set) to generate a few classifiers.",
        "In the second technique, we need to reduce the feature set and this is not done in a random fashion.",
        "Instead, we use our understanding of the individual features and also their relation to other features to decide which features may be dropped.",
        "In this paper, we refer to an oracle system which uses knowledge of the truth.",
        "Here, truth, called the gold standard henceforth, refers to mention detection and coreference resolution done by a human for each document.",
        "It is possible that the gold standard may have errors and is not perfect truth, but, as in most NLP systems, it is considered the reference for evaluating computer-based coreference resolution.",
        "To understand the oracle, consider an example in which the outputs of two classifiers for the same input document are C1 and C2, as shown in Figure 1.",
        "Classifier Ci",
        "Classifier C2",
        "Oracle Output",
        "The number of entities in C1 and C2 may not be the same and even in cases where they are, the number of mentions in corresponding entities may not be the same.",
        "In fact, even finding the corresponding entity in the other classifier output or in the gold standard output G is not a trivial problem and requires us to be able to align any two classifier outputs.",
        "The alignment between any two coreference la-belings, say C1 and G, for a document is the best one-to-one map (Luo, 2005) between the entities of C1 and G. To align the entities of C1 with those of G, under the assumption that an entity in C1 may be aligned with at most only one entity in G and vice versa, we need to generate a bipartite graph between the entities of C1 and G. Now the alignment task is a maximum bipartite matching problem.",
        "This is solved by using the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm (Kuhn, 1955; Munkres, 1957).",
        "The weights of the edges of the graph are entity-level alignment measures.",
        "The metric we use is a relative measure of the similarity between the two entities.",
        "To compute the similarity metric 0 (Luo, 2005) for the entity pair (R, S), we use the formula shown in Equation 1, where (n) represents the commonality with attribute-weighted partial scores.",
        "Attributes are things such as (ACE) entity type, subtype, entity class, etc.",
        "The oracle output is a combination of the entities in C1 and C2 with the highest entity-pair alignment measures with the entities in G. We can see in Figure 1 that the entity G-E1 is aligned with entities C1-EA and C2-EP.",
        "We pick the entity with the highest entity-pair alignment measure (highlighted in gray) which, in this case, is C1-EA.",
        "This is repeated for",
        "Classifier C2",
        "Classifier Ci",
        "Entity-level Alignment Table",
        "every entity in G. The oracle output can be seen in the right-hand side of Figure 1.",
        "This technique can be scaled up to work for any number of classifiers.",
        "Imitating the oracle.",
        "Making use of the existing framework of the oracle, we implement a combination technique that imitates the oracle except that in this case, we do not have the gold standard.",
        "If we have N classifiers Ci, i = 1 to N, then we replace the gold standard by each of the N classifiers in succession, to get N outputs Combi, i = 1 to N.",
        "The task of generating multiple classifier combination outputs that have a higher accuracy than the original classifiers is often considered to be easier than the task of determining the best of these outputs.",
        "We used the formulas in Equations 2, 3 and 4 to assign a score Si to each of the N combination outputs Combi, and then we pick the one with the highest score.",
        "The function Sc (which corresponds to the function 0 in Equation 1) gives the similarity between the entities in the pair (R,S).",
        "Sc(Combi,Cj) Si = Sc(Combi,Ci) Sc(Combi,Combj) Entity-level sum-rule.",
        "We implemented a basic sum-rule at the entity level, where we generate only one combination classifier output by aligning the entities in the N classifiers and picking only one entity at each level of alignment.",
        "In the oracle, the reference for entity-alignment was the gold standard.",
        "Here, we use the baseline/full system (generated using the entire training and feature set) to do this.",
        "The entity-level alignment is represented as a table in Figure 2.",
        "Let Ai, i = 1 to M be the aligned entities in one row of the table in Figure 2.",
        "Here, M < N if we exclude the baseline from the combination and M < N + 1 if we include it.",
        "To pick one entity out of these M entities, we use the traditional sum rule (Tulyakov et al., 2008), shown in Equation 5, to compute the S(Ai) for each Ai and pick the entity with the highest S(Ai) value.",
        "In the previous techniques, entities are either picked or rejected as a whole but never broken down further.",
        "In the mention-level majority voting technique, we work at the mention level, so the entities created after combination may be different from the entities of all the classifiers that are being combined.",
        "In the entity-level alignment table (shown in Figure 3), A, B, C and D refer to the entities in the baseline system and A1, A2, D4 represent the entities of the input classifiers that are aligned with each of the baseline classifier entities.",
        "Majority voting is done by counting the number of times a mention is found in a set of aligned entities.",
        "So for every row in the table, we have a mention count.",
        "The row with the highest mention count is assigned the mention in the output.",
        "This is repeated for each mention in the document.",
        "In Figure 3, we are voting for the mention m1, which is found to have a voting count of 3 (the majority vote) at the entity-level A and a count of 1 at the entity-level C, so the mention is assigned to the entity A.",
        "It is important to note that some classifier entities may not align with any baseline classifier entity as we allow only a one-to-one mapping during alignment.",
        "Such entities will not be a part of the alignment table.",
        "If this number is large, it may have a considerable effect on the combination.",
        "Boosting techniques (Schapire, 1999) combine multiple classifiers, built iteratively and trained on re-weighted data, to improve classification accuracy.",
        "Since coreference resolution is done for a whole document, we can not split a document further.",
        "So when we re-weight the training set, we are actually re-weighting the documents (hence the name document-level boosting).",

        "We shuffle the training set to create some randomness and then divide it into groups of training and test sets in a round-robin fashion such that a predetermined ratio of the number of training documents to the number of test documents is maintained.",
        "In Figure 4, the light gray regions refer to training documents and the dark gray regions refer to test documents.",
        "Another important consideration is that it is difficult to achieve good coreference resolution performance on documents of some genres compared to others, even if they are boosted significantly.",
        "In an iterative process, it is likely that documents of such genres will get repeatedly boosted.",

        "We measure the performance for varying number of classifiers, and the result is plotted in Figure 5.",
        "First, we observe a steady and significant increase in CEAF for every additional classifier, because additional classifiers can only improve the alignment score.",
        "Second, we note that the oracle accuracy is 87.58% for a single input classifier C1, i.e. an absolute gain of 9% compared to Co.",
        "This is because the availability of gold entities makes it possible to remove many false-alarm entities.",
        "Finally, the oracle accuracy when all 15 classifiers are used as input is 94.59%, a 16.06% absolute improvement.",
        "This experiment helps us to understand the performance bound of combining multiple classifiers and the contribution of every additional classifier.",

        "But they are present in more than one input classifier and there is a tie between the mention counts at different entity-level alignments.",
        "The rule to break the tie is that mentions are included if they are also seen in the full system Co. As can been seen, this rule brings in correct mentions such as 7-61, 7-63, 7-64, but it also admits 20-33,20-39 and 20-62.",
        "In the oracle, the gold standard helps to remove entities with false-alarm mentions, whereas the full system output is noisy and it is not strong enough to reliably remove undesired mentions.",

        "In summary, the current implementation of this technique has a limited ability to distinguish correct mentions from wrong ones due to the noisy nature of C0 which is used for alignment.",
        "We also observe that mentions spread across different alignments often have low-count and they are often tied in count.",
