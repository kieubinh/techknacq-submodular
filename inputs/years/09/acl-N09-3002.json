        "Cross document coreference (CDC) (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998) is a distinct technology that consolidates named entities across documents according to their real referents.",
        "Despite the variety of styles and content in different text, CDC can break the boundaries of documents and cluster those mentions referring to the same",
        "Mark Johnson.",
        "As unambiguous person references are key to many tasks, e.g. social network analysis, this work focuses on person named entities.",
        "The method can be later extended to organizations.",
        "We highlight the key differences between our proposed CDC system with past person name search systems.",
        "First, we seek to transcend the simple bag of words approaches in earlier CDC work by leveraging state-of-the-art information extraction (IE) tools for disambiguation.",
        "The main advantage is that our IE based approach has access to accurate information such as a person's work titles, geo-locations, relationships and other attributes.",
        "Traditional IR approaches, on the other hand, may naively use the terms in a document which can significantly hamper accuracy.",
        "For instance, an article about Hillary Clinton may contain references to journalists, politicians who make comments about her.",
        "Even with careful word selection, such textual features may still confuse the disambiguation system about the true identity of the person.",
        "The information extraction process in our work can thus be regarded as an intelligent feature selection step for disambiguation.",
        "Second, after coreferencing, our system not only yields clusters of documents, but also structured information which is highly useful for automated document understanding and data mining.",
        "We review related work on CDC next and describe our approach in Section 3.",
        "The methods are evaluated on benchmark datasets in Section 4.",

      "text": [
        "The overall framework of our CDC system works as follows.",
        "Given a document, the information extraction tool first extracts named entities and constructs WDC chains.",
        "It also creates linkages (relationships) between entities.",
        "The similarity between a pair of relationships in WDC chains is measured by an awakened similarity specialist and the similarity between two WDC chains is determined by the mixture of awakened specialists' predictions.",
        "Finally, a density-based clustering method generates clusters corresponding to real world entities.",
        "We describe these steps in detail.",
        "Given a document, an information extraction tool is first used to extract named entities and perform within document coreference.",
        "Hence, named entities in each document are divided into a set of WDC chains, each chain corresponding to one real world entity.",
        "In addition, state-of-the-art IE tools are capable of creating relational information between named entities.",
        "We use an IE tool AeroText (Taylor, 2004) for this purpose.",
        "Besides the attribute information about the person named entity (first/middle/last names, gender, mention, etc), AeroText also extracts relationship information between named entities, such as Family, List, Employment, Ownership, Citizen-Resident-Religion-Ethnicity, etc, as specified in the Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) evaluation.",
        "The input to the CDC system is a set ofWDC chains (with relationship information stored in them) and the CDC task is to merge these WDC chains.",
        "We design a suite of similarity functions to determine whether the relationships in a pair of WDC chains match, divided into three groups: Text similarity.",
        "To decide whether two names in the co-occurrence or family relationship match, we use SoftTFIDF (Cohen et al., 2003), which has shown best performance among various similarity schemes tested for name matching.",
        "SoftTFIDF is a hybrid matching scheme that combines the token-based TFIDF with the Jaro-Winkler string distance metric.",
        "This permits inexact matching of named entities due to name variations, spelling errors, etc.",
        "Semantic similarity.",
        "Text or syntactic similarity is not always sufficient for matching relationships.",
        "For instance, although the mentions \"U.S. President\" and \"Commander-in-chief\" have no textual overlap, they are semantically highly related as they can be synonyms.",
        "We use WordNet and the information theory based JC semantic distance (Jiang and Conrath, 1997) to measure the semantic similarity between concepts in relationships such as mention, employment, ownership and so on.",
        "Other rule-based similarity.",
        "Several other cases require special treatment.",
        "For example, the employment relationships of Senator and D-N.Y. should match based on domain knowledge.",
        "Also, we design rule-based similarity functions to handle nicknames (Bill and William), acronyms (COLING for International Conference on Computational Linguistics), and geographical locations.",
        "After the similarity features between a pair of WDC chains are computed, we need to compute the pairwise distance metric for clustering.",
        "(Cohen et al., 2003) trained a binary SVM model and interpreted its confidence in predicting the negative class as the distance metric.",
        "In our case of using information extraction results for disambiguation, however, only some of the similarity features are present based on the availability of relationships in two WDC chains.",
        "Therefore, we treat each similarity function as a subordinate predicting algorithm (called specialist) and utilize the specialist learning framework (Freund et al., 1997) to combine the predictions.",
        "Here, a specialist is awake only when the same relationships are present in two WDC chains.",
        "Also, a specialist can refrain from making a prediction for an instance if it is not confident enough.",
        "In addition to the similarity scores, specialists have different weights, e.g. a match in a family relationship is considered more important than in a co-occurrence relationship.",
        "The Specialist Exponentiated Gradient (SEG) (Freund et al., 1997) algorithm is adopted to learn to mix the specialists' prediction.",
        "Given a set of T training instances {xt} denotes the i-th specialist's prediction), the SEG algorithm minimizes the square loss of the outcome y in an online manner (Algorithm 1).",
        "In each learning iteration, SEG first predict yt using the set of awake experts Et with respect to instance xt.",
        "The true outcome yt (1 for coreference and 0 otherwise) is then revealed and square loss L is incurred.",
        "SEG then updates the weight distribution p accordingly.",

        "5: end for Output: Model p",
        "WDC chains w% and wj can be represented in a similarity matrix R, with ri;j computed by the SEG prediction step using the learned weight distribution p (Equation 1).",
        "A relational clustering algorithm then clusters entities using R, as we introduce next.",
        "The set of WDC chains to be clustered are represented by a relational similarity matrix.",
        "Most of the work in clustering, however, is only capable of clustering numerical object data (e.g. K-means).",
        "Relational clustering algorithms, on the other hand, cluster objects based on the less direct measurement of similarity between object pairs.",
        "We choose to use a density based clustering algorithm DBSCAN (Ester et al., 1996) mainly for two reasons.",
        "First, most clustering algorithm require the number of clusters K as an input parameter.",
        "The optimal K can apparently vary greatly for names with different frequency and thus is a sensitive parameter.",
        "Even if a cluster validity index is used to determine K, it usually requires running the underlying clustering algorithm multiple times and hence is inefficient for large scale data.",
        "DBSCAN, as a density based clustering method, only requires density parameters such as the radius of the neighborhood e that are universal for different datasets.",
        "As we show in the experiment, density parameters are relatively insensitive for disambiguation performance.",
        "Second, the distance metric in relational space may be non-Euclidean, rendering many clustering algorithms ineffective (e.g. single linkage clustering algorithm is known to generate chain-shaped clusters).",
        "Density-based clustering, on the other hand, can generate clusters of arbitrary shapes since only objects in dense areas are placed in a cluster.",
        "DBSCAN induces a density-based cluster by the core objects, i.e. objects having more than a specified number of other data objects in their neighborhood of size e. In each clustering step, a seed object is checked to determine whether it's a core object and if so, it induces other points of the same cluster using breadth first search (otherwise it's considered as a noise point).",
        "In interest of space, we refer readers to (Ester et al., 1996) for algorithmic details of DBSCAN and now turn our attention to evaluating the disambiguation performance of our methods."

        "The CDC task in the perspective of this paper, however, is to merge the WDC chains rather than documents.",
        "Hence in our evaluation, we adopt the document label to annotate the WDC chain from the document that corresponds to the person name search query.",

        "The Fa5 score of our CDC system (AT-CDC) is 0.708, comparable to the test results of the first tier systems in the official evaluation.",
        "The two baselines are also included.",
        "Because the test set is very ambiguous (on average only two documents per real world entity), the one-in-one baseline has relatively high F0 5 score.",
        "The Wikipedia, ACL06 and US Census sets have on average 56, 31 and 50 entities per name respectively.",
        "We notice that as the data set becomes more ambiguous, purity decreases implying it's harder for the system to discard irrelevant documents from a cluster.",
        "The other case is true for inverse purity.",
        "In particular, we are interested in how the coreference performance changes with the number of entities per name (which can be viewed as the ambiguity level of a data set).",
        "This is shown in Figure 1.",
        "We observe that in general the harmonic mean of the purity is fairly stable across different number of entities per dataset (generally within the band between 0.6 and 0.8).",
