        "There are important semantic distinctions between different types of English nouns.",
        "For example, some nouns typically refer to a concrete physical object, such as book, tree, etc.",
        "Others are used to represent the process or the result of an event (e.g. birth, celebration).",
        "Such information is useful in disambiguating syntactically similar phrases and sentences, so as to provide more accurate semantic interpretations.",
        "For instance, a man with hobbies and a man with apples share the same structure, but convey very different aspects about the man being referred to (i.e. activities vs possessions).",
        "Compiling such a lexicon by hand, e.g., WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), requires tremendous time and expertise.",
        "In addition, when new words appear, these will have to be analyzed and added manually.",
        "Furthermore, a single, global lexicon may contain erroneous categorizations when used within a specific domain/genre; we would like a \"flexible\" lexicon, adaptable to a given corpus.",
        "Also, in adapting semantic classifications of words to a particular genre or domain, we would like to be able to exploit continuing improvements in methods of extracting semantic occurrence patterns from text.",
        "We present our initial efforts in discovering semantic classes incrementally under a weakly supervised bootstrapping process.",
        "The approach is able to selectively learn from its own discoveries, thereby minimizing the effort needed to provide seed examples as well as maintaining a reasonable accuracy rate.",
        "In what follows, we first focus on its application to an event-noun classification task, and then use a physical-object vs non-physical-object experiment as a showcase for the algorithm's generality."

        "The bootstrapping algorithm discovers words with semantic properties similar to a small set of labelled seed examples.",
        "These examples can be manually selected from an existing lexicon.",
        "By simply changing the semantic property of the seed set, this algorithm can be applied to the task of discovering a variety of semantic classes.",
        "Features Classification is performed using a perceptron-based model (Rosenblatt, 1958) that examines features of each word.",
        "We use two kinds of features in our model: morphological (affix and word length), and contextual.",
        "Suffixes, such as -ion, often reveal the semantic type that a noun belongs to (e.g., destruction, explosion).",
        "Other suffixes like er typically suggest non-event nouns (e.g. waiter, hanger).",
        "The set of affixes can be modified to reflect meaningful distinctions in the task at hand.",
        "Regarding word length, longer words tend to have more syllables, and thus are more likely to contain affixes.",
        "For example, if a word ends with -ment, its number of letters must be > 5.",
        "We defined a partition of words based on word length: shortest (fewer than 5 letters), short (5-7), medium (8-12), long (13-19), and longest (> 19).",
        "Besides morphological features, we also make use of verbalized propositions resulting from the experiments of Van Durme et al.",
        "(2008) as contextual features.",
        "These outputs are in the form of world knowledge \"factoids\" abstracted from texts, based on logical forms from parsed sentences, produced by the Knext system (see Schubert (2002) for details).",
        "The followings are some sample factoids about the word destruction, extracted from the British National Corpus.",
        "• A PERSON-OR-ORGANIZATION MAY UNDERGO A DESTRUCTION",
        "• INDIVIDUAL S MAY HAVE A DESTRUCTION",
        "• PROPERTY MAY UNDERGO A DESTRUCTION",
        "We take each verbalization (with the target word removed) as a contextual feature, such as property may undergo a ___Words from the same semantic category (e.g., event nouns) should have semantic and syntactic similarities on the sentential level.",
        "Thus their contextual features, which reflect the use of words both semantically and syntactically, should be similar.",
        "For instance, property may undergo a protection is another verbalization produced by Knext, suggesting the word protection may belong to the same category as destruction.",
        "A few rough-and-ready heuristics are already employed by Knext to do the same task as we wish to automate here.",
        "A built-in classifier judges nominals to be event or non-event ones based on analysis of endings, plus a list of event nouns whose endings are unrevealing, and a list of non-event nouns whose endings tend to suggest they are event nouns.",
        "As a result, the factoids used as contextual features in our work already reflect the built-in classifier's attempt to distinguish event nouns from the rest.",
        "Thus, the use of these contextual features may bias the algorithm to perform seemingly well on event-noun classification.",
        "However, we will show that our algorithm works for classification of other semantic categories, for which Knext does not yet have discriminative procedures.",
        "Iterative Training We use a bootstrapping procedure to iteratively train a perceptron-based linear classifier.",
        "A perceptron algorithm determines whether the active features of a test case are similar to those learned from given categories of examples.",
        "In an iterative training process, the classifier first learns from a small seed set, which contains examples of all categories (in binary classification, both positive and negative examples) manually selected to reflect human knowledge of semantic categories.",
        "The classifier then discovers new instances (and corresponding features) of each category.",
        "Based on activation values, these newly discovered instances are selectively admitted into the original training set, which increases the size of training examples for the next iteration.",
        "The iterative training algorithm described above is adopted from Klementiev and Roth (2006).",
        "The advantage of bootstrapping is the ability to automatically learn from new discoveries, which saves both time and effort required to manually examine a source lexicon.",
        "However, if implemented exactly as described above, this process has two apparent disadvantages: New examples may be wrongly classified by the model; and it is difficult to evaluate the discriminative models produced in successive iterations, as there are no standard data against which to judge them (the new examples are by definition previously unexamined).",
        "We propose two measures to alleviate these problems.",
        "First, we admit into the training set only those instances whose activation values are higher than the mean activation of their corresponding categories in an iteration.",
        "This sets a variable threshold that is correlated with the performance of the model at each iteration.",
        "Second, we evaluate iterative results post hoc, using a Bootstrapping Score.",
        "This measures the efficacy of bootstrapping (i.e. the ratio of correct newly discovered instances to training examples) and precision (i.e. the proportion of correct discoveries among all those returned by the algorithm).",
        "We compute this score to decide which iteration has yielded the optimal discriminative model."

        "Experimental Setup The WordNet noun-list is chosen as the source lexicon (Fellbaum, 1998), which consists of 21,512 nouns.",
        "The purpose of this task is to explore the separability of event nouns from this collection.",
        "typical suffixes: appeasement, arrival, renewal, construction, robbery, departure, happening irregular cases: birth, collapse, crash, death, decline, demise, loss, murder",
        "We manually selected 15 event nouns and 215 non-event nouns for the seed set.",
        "Event-noun examples are representative of subcategories within the semantic class, as well as their commonly seen morphological structures (Table 1).",
        "Non-event examples are primarily exceptions to morphological regularities (to prevent the algorithm from overly relying on affix features), such as, anything, ambition, diagonal.",
        "The subset of all contextual and morphological features represented by both event and non-event examples are used to bootstrap the training process.",
        "Event Noun Discovery Reducing the number of working features is often an effective strategy in training a perceptron.",
        "We experimented with two cut-off thresholds for features: in Trial 1, features must appear at least 10 times (55,354 remaining); in Trial 2, features must appear at least 15 times (35,457 remaining).",
        "We set the training process to run for 20 iterations in both trials.",
        "Classification results of each iteration were collected.",
        "We expect the algorithm to discover few event nouns during early iterations.",
        "But with new instances found in each subsequent iteration, it ought to utilize newly seen features and discover more.",
        "Figure 1 confirms our intuition.",
        "The number of classified event-noun instances increased sharply at the 15 th iteration in Trial 1 and the 11th iteration in Trial 2, which may suggest overfit-ting of the training examples used in those iterations.",
        "If so, this should also correlate with an increase of error rate in the classification results (error rate defined as the percentage of non-event nouns identified as event nouns in all discovered event nouns).",
        "We manually marked all misclassified event noun instances for the first 10 iterations in both trials.",
        "The error rate in Trial 2 is expected to significantly increase at the 10th iteration, while Trial 1 should exhibit little increase in error rate within this interval.",
        "This expectation is confirmed in Figure 2.",
        "Extracting the Optimal Model We further pursued the task of finding the iteration that has yielded the best model.",
        "Optimality is judged from two aspects: 1) the number of correctly identified event nouns should be significantly larger than the size of seed examples; and 2) the accuracy of classification results should be relatively high so that it takes little effort to clean up the result.",
        "Once the optimal model is determined, we analyze its most heavily weighted features and try to derive finer categories from them.",
        "Furthermore, the optimal model could be used to discover new instances from other source lexicons in the future.",
        "We define a measure called the Bootstrapping Score (BS), serving a similar purpose as an F-score.",

        "where \\NEW\\ is the number of correctly identified new instances (seed examples excluded), and \\ SEED\\ is the size of seed examples.",
        "The rate of bootstrapping reveals how large the effect of the bootstrapping process is.",
        "Note that BR is different from the classic measure recall, for which the total number of relevent documents (i.e. true event nouns in English) must be known a priori - again, this knowledge is what we are discovering.",
        "The score is a post hoc solution; both BR and precision are computed for analysis after the algorithm has finished.",
        "Combining Formulas (1) and (2), a higher Bootstrapping Score means better model quality.",

        "In addition, within Trial 2, Iteration 6 yielded the best discriminative model with a bootstrapping score of 90.8%.",
        "Compared to instance counts and error rate measures as shown in Table 2, this bootstrapping score provides a balanced measure of model quality.",
        "The model at the 6th iteration (hereafter, Model 6) can be considered the optimal model generated during the bootstrapping training process.",
        "Top-ranked Features in the Optimal Model In order to understand why Model 6 is optimal, we extracted its top 15 features that activate the event-noun target in Model 6, as listed in Table 3.",
        "Interestingly, top-ranked features are all contextual ones.",
        "In fact, in later models where the ranks of morphological features are boosted, the algorithm performed worse as a result of relying too much on those context-insensitive features.",
        "Collectively, top-ranked features define the contextual patterns of event nouns.",
        "We are interested in finding semantic subcategories within the set of event nouns (497 nouns, Trial 2) by exploiting these features individually.",
        "For instance, some events typically happen to people only (e.g. birth, betrayal), while others usually happen to inanimate objects (e.g. destruction, removal).",
        "Human actions can also be distinguished by the number of participants, such as group activities (e.g. election) or individual activities (e.g. death).",
        "It is thus worth distinguishing nouns that describe different sorts of events.",
        "Manual Classification We extracted the top 100 contextual features from Model 6 and grouped them into feature classes.",
        "A feature class consists of contextual features sharing similar meanings.",
        "For instance, a country may undergo __ and a state may undergo __ both belong to the class social activity.",
