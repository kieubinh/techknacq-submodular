        "The Opinion Summarization Pilot (OSP) task within the TAC 2008 competition consisted in generating summaries from answers to opinion questions retrieved from blogs (the Blog06collection).",
        "The questions were organized around 25 targets - persons, events, organizations etc.",
        "Additionally, a set of text snippets that contained the answers to the questions were provided by the organizers, their use being optional.",
        "An example of target, question and provided snippet is given in Figure 1.",

        "The techniques employed by the participants were mainly based on the already existing summarization systems.",
        "While most participants added new features (sentiment, pos/neg sentiment, pos/neg opinion) to account for the presence of positive opinions or negative ones - CLASSY (Conroy and Schlessinger, 2008); CCNU (He et al.,2008); LIPN (Bossard et al., 2008); IIITSum08 (Varma et al., 2008) -, efficient methods were proposed focusing on the retrieval and filtering stage, based on polarity - DLSIUAES (Balahur et al., 2008) - or on separating information rich clauses - italica (Cruz et al., 2008).",
        "In general, previous work in opinion mining includes document level sentiment classification using supervised (Chaovalit and Zhou, 2005) and unsupervised methods (Turney, 2002), machine learning techniques and sentiment classification considering rating scales (Pang, Lee and Vaithyanathan, 2002), and scoring of features (Dave, Lawrence and Pennock, 2003).",
        "Other research has been conducted in analysing sentiment at a sentence level using bootstrapping techniques (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003), finding strength of opinions (Wilson, Wiebe and Hwa, 2004), summing up orientations of opinion words in a sentence (Kim and Hovy, 2004), and identifying opinion holders (Stoyanov and Cardie, 2006).",

        "In order to tackle the OSP task, we considered the use of two different methods for opinion mining and summarization, differing mainly with respect to the use of the optional text snippets provided.",
        "Our first approach (the Snippet-driven Approach) used these snippets, whereas the second one (Blog-driven Approach) found the answers directly in the corresponding blogs.",
        "A general overview of the system's architecture is shown in Figure 2, where three main parts can be distinguished: the question processing stage, the snippets processing stage (only carried out for the first approach), and the final summary generation module.",
        "Next, the main steps involved in each process will be explained in more detail.",
        "Figure 2.",
        "System architecture",
        "The first step was to determine the polarity of each question, extract the keywords from each of them and finally, build some patterns of reformulation.",
        "The latter were defined in order to give the final summary an abstract nature, rather than a simple joining of sentences.",
        "The polarity of the question was determined using a set of created patterns, whose goal was to extract for further classification the nouns, verbs, adverbs or adjectives indicating some kind of polarity (positive or negative).",
        "These extracted words, together with their determiners, were classified using the emotions lists in WordNet Affect (Strapparava and Valitutti, 2005), jointly with the emotions lists of attitudes, triggers resource (Balahur and Montoyo, 2008 [1]), four created lists of attitudes, expressing criticism, support, admiration and rejection and two categories for value (good and bad), taking for the opinion mining systems in (Balahur and Montoyo, 2008 [2]).",
        "Moreover, the focus of each question was automatically extracted using the FreelingNamed Entity Recognizer module.",
        "This information was used to determine whether or not all the questions within the same topic had the same focus, as well as be able to decide later on which text snippet belonged to which question.",
        "Regarding the given text snippets, we also computed their polarity and their focus.",
        "The polarity was calculated as a vector similarity between the snippets and vectors constructed from the list of sentences contained in the ISEAR corpus (Scherer and Wallbot, 1997), WordNet Affect emotion lists of anger, sadness, disgust and joy and the emotion triggers resource, using Pedersen's Text Similarity Package.",
        "Concerning the blogs, our opinion mining and summarization system is focused only on plain text; therefore, as pre processing stage, we removed all unnecessary tags and irrelevant information, such as links, images etc.",
        "Further on, we split the remaining text into individual sentences.",
        "A matching between blogs' sentences and text snippets was performed so that a preliminary set of potential meaningful sentences was recorded for further processing.",
        "To achieve this, snippets not literally contained in the blogs were tokenized and stemmed using Porter's Stemmer, and stop words were removed in order to find the most similar possible sentence associated with it.",
        "Subsequently, by means of the same Pedersen Text Similarity Package as for computing the snippets' polarity, we computed the similarity between the given snippets and this created set of potential sentences.",
        "We extracted the complete blog sentences to which each snippet was related.",
        "Further on, we extracted the focus for each blog phrase sentence as well.",
        "Then, we filtered redundant sentences using a naïve similarity based approach.",
        "Once we obtained the possible answers, we used Minipar to filter out incomplete sentences.",
        "Having computed the polarity for the questions and snippets, and set out the final set of sentences to produce the summary, we bound each sentence to its corresponding question, and we grouped all sentences which were related to the same question together, so that we could generate the language for this group, according to the patterns of reformulation previously mentioned.",
        "Finally, the speech style was changed to an impersonal one, in order to avoid directly expressed opinion sentences.",
        "A POS-tagger tool (TreeTagger) was used to identify third person verbs and change them to a neutral style.",
        "A set of rules to identify pronouns was created, and they were also changed to the more general pronoun \"they\" and its corresponding forms, to avoid personal opinions."

        "When an exhaustive examination of the nuggets used for evaluating the summaries was done, we found some problems that are worth mentioning.",
        "a) Some nuggets with high score did not exist in the snippet list (e.g. \"When buying from CARMAX, got a better than blue book trade-in on old car\" (0.9)).",
        "b) Some nuggets for the same target express the same idea, despite their not being identical (e.g. \"NAFTA needs to be renegotiated to protect Canadian sovereignty\" and \"Green Party: Renegotiate NAFTA to protect Canadian Sovereignty\").",

        "On the other hand, regarding the use of the optional snippets, the main problem to address is to remove redundancy, because many of them are repeated for the same target, and we have to determine which snippet represents better the idea for the final summary, in order to avoid noisy irrelevant information.",
        "4.1 Measuring the Performance of a Generic Summarization System",
        "Several participants in the TAC 2008 edition performed the OSP task by using generic summarization systems.",
        "Most were adjusted by integrating an opinion classifier module so that the task could be fulfilled, but some were not (Bossard fact made us realize that a generic summarizer could be used to achieve this task.",

        "Although the first approach suggested for opinion summarization obtained much better results in the evaluation than the second one (see Section 3.1), we decided to run the generic system over both approaches, with and without applying TE, to provide a more extent analysis and conclusions.",
        "After preprocessing the blogs and having all the possible candidate sentences grouped together, we considered these as the input for the generic summarizer.",

        "After the manual matching of nuggets and sentences, we computed the average Recall, Precision and F-measure (Beta =1) in the same way as in the TAC 2008 was done, according to the number and weight of the nuggets that were also covered in the summary.",
