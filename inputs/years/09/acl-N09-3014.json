        "Sentence ordering is a problem in many natural language processing tasks.",
        "While it has, historically, mainly been considered a challenging problem in (concept-to-text) language generation tasks, more recently, the issue has also generated interest within summarization research (Barzilay, 2003; Ji and Pul-man, 2006).",
        "In the spirit of the latter, this paper investigates the following questions: (1) Does the topic of the text influence the factors that are important to sentence ordering?",
        "(2) Which factors are most important for determining coherent sentence orderings?",
        "(3) How much performance is gained when using deeper knowledge resources?",
        "Past research has investigated a wide range of aspects pertaining to the ordering of sentences in text.",
        "The most prominent approaches include: (1) temporal ordering in terms of publication date (Barzi-lay, 2003), (2) temporal ordering in terms of textual cues in sentences (Bollegala et al., 2006), (3) the topic of the sentences (Barzilay, 2003), (4) coherence theories (Barzilay and Lapata, 2008), e.g., Centering Theory, (5) content models (Barzilay and Lee, 2004), and (6) ordering(s) in the underlying documents in the case of summarisation (Bollegala et al., 2006; Barzilay, 2003)."

      "text": [
        "We view coherence assessment, which we recast as a sentence ordering problem, as a machine learning problem using the feature representation discussed in Section 2.1.",
        "It can be viewed as a ranking task because a text can only be more or less coherent than some other text.",
        "The sentence ordering task used in this paper can easily be transformed into a ranking problem.",
        "Hence, paralleling Barzilay and Lapata (2008), our model has the following structure.",
        "The data consists of alternative orderings (xij ,xik) of the sentences of the same document di.",
        "In the training data, the preference ranking of the alternative orderings is known.",
        "As a result, training consists of determining a parameter vector w that minimizes the number of violations of pairwise rankings in the training set, a problem which can be solved using SVM constraint optimization (Joachims, 2002).",
        "The following section explores the features available for this optimization.",
        "Approaches to sentence ordering can generally be categorized as knowledge-rich or knowledge-lean.",
        "Knowledge-rich approaches rely on manually created representations of sentence orderings using domain communication knowledge.",
        "Barzilay and Lee (2004)'s knowledge-lean approach attempts to automate the inference of knowledge-rich information using a distributional view of content.",
        "In essence, they infer a number of topics using clustering.",
        "The clusters are represented by corresponding states in a hidden Markov model, which is used to model the transitions between topics.",
        "Lapata (2003), in contrast, does not attempt to model topics explicitly.",
        "Instead, she reduces sentence ordering to the task of predicting the next sentence given the previous sentence, which represents a coarse attempt at capturing local coherence constraints.",
        "The features she uses are derived from three categories - verbs, nouns, and dependencies - all of which are lexicalised.",
        "Her system thereby, to some extent, learns a precedence between the words in the sentences, which in turn represent topics.",
        "Ji and Pulman (2006) base their ordering strategy not only on the directly preceding sentence, but on all preceding sentences.",
        "In this way, they are able to avoid a possible topic bias when summarizing multiple documents.",
        "This is specific to their approach as approaches are not tailored to summarization and therefore do not experience the topic bias problem.",
        "The present paper deviates from Lapata (2003) insofar as we do not attempt to learn the ordering preferences between pairs of sentences.",
        "Instead, we learn the ranking of documents.",
        "The advantage of this approach is that it allows us to straightforwardly discern the individual value of various features (cf. Barzilay and Lapata (2008)).",
        "The methods used in this paper are mostly shallow with the exception of two aspects.",
        "First, some of the measures make use of WordNet relations (Fellbaum, 1998), and second, some use the temporal ordering provided by the \"happens-before\" relation in VerbO-cean (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004).",
        "While the use of WordNet is self-explanatory, its effect on sentence ordering algorithms does not seem to have been explored in any depth.",
        "The use of VerbOcean is meant to reveal the degree to which common sense orderings of events affect the ordering of sentences, or whether the order is reversed.",
        "With this background, the sentence ordering features used in this paper can be grouped into three categories:",
        "The features in this category are inspired by discourse entity-based accounts of local coherence.",
        "Yet, in contrast to Barzilay and Lapata (2008), who employ the syntactic properties of the respective occurrences, we reduce the accounts to whether or not the entities occur in subsequent sentences (similar to Karamanis (2004)'s NOCB metric).",
        "We also investigate whether using only the information from the head of the noun group (cf. Barzilay and Lapata (2008)) suffices, or whether performance is gained when allowing the whole noun group in order to determine similarity.",
        "Moreover, as indicated above, some of the noun group measures make use of WordNet synonym, hypernym, hyponym, antonym relationships.",
        "For completeness, we also consider the effects of using verb groups and whole sentences as syntactic units of choice.",
        "This set of features uses information on the temporal ordering of sentences, although it currently only includes the \"happens-before\" relations in Ver-bOcean.",
        "The group similarity features only capture the relation between a sentence and its immediate successor.",
        "However, the coherence of a text is clearly not only defined by direct relations, but also requires longer range relations between sentences (e.g., Barzilay and Lapata (2008)).",
        "The features in this section explore the impact of such relations on the coherence of the overall document as well as the appropriate way of modeling them."

        "This section introduces the datasets used for the experiments, describes the experiments, and discusses our main findings.",
        "The three datasets used for the automatic evaluation in this paper are based on human-generated texts (Table 1).",
        "The first two are the earthquake and accident datasets used by Barzilay and Lapata (2008).",
        "Each of these sets consists of 100 datasets in the training and test sets, respectively, as well as 20 random permutations for each text.",
        "The third dataset is similar to the first two in that it contains original texts and random permutations.",
        "In contrast to the other two sources, however, this dataset is based on the human summaries from DUC 2005 (Dang, 2005).",
        "It comprises 300 human summaries on 50 document sets, resulting in a total of 6,000 pairwise rankings split into training and test sets.",
        "The source furthermore differs from Barzilay and Lapata (2008)'s datasets in that the content of each text is not based on one individual event (an earthquake or accident), but on more complex topics followed over a period of time (e.g., the espionage case between GM and VW along with the various actions taken to resolve it).",
        "Since the different document sets cover completely different topics the third dataset will mainly be used to evaluate the topic-independent properties of our model.",
        "In the first part of this experiment, we consider the problem of the granularity of the syntactic units to be used.",
        "That is, does it make a difference whether we use the words in the sentence, the words in the noun groups, the words in the verb groups, or the words in the respective heads of the groups to determine coherence?",
        "(The units are obtained by processing the documents using the LT-TTT2 tools (Grover and Tobin, 2006); the lemmatizer used by LT-TTT2 is morpha (Minnen and Pearce, 2000).)",
        "We also consider whether lemmatization is beneficial in each of the granularities.",
        "The results - presented in Table 2 - indicate that considering only the heads of the verb and noun groups separately provides the best performance.",
        "In particular, the heads outperform the whole groups, and the heads separately also outperform noun and verb group heads together.",
        "As for the question of whether lemmatization provides better results, one needs to distinguish the case of noun and verb groups.",
        "For noun groups, lemmatization improves performance, which can mostly be attributed to singular and plural forms.",
        "In the case of verb groups, however, the lemmatized version yields worse results than the surface forms, a fact mainly explained by the tense and modality properties of verbs.",
        "Table 2: Performance with respect to the syntactic unit of processing of the training datasets.",

        "The rationale for the consideration of semantic relations lies in the fact that the frequent use of the same words is usually deemed bad writing style.",
        "One therefore tends to observe the use of semantically similar terms in neighboring sentences.",
        "The results of using semantic relations for coherence rating are provided in Table 3.",

        "This paper investigated the effect of different features on sentence ordering.",
        "While a set of features has been identified that works well individually as well as in combination on the accident dataset, the results on the earthquake and DUC 2005 datasets are disappointing.",
        "Taking into account the performance of content models and the baseline of the Barzilay and Lapata (2008) model, the most convincing explanation is that the sentence ordering in the earthquake datasets is based on some sort of topic notion, providing a variety of possible antecedents between which our model is thus far unable to distinguish without resorting to the original (correct) ordering.",
        "Future work will have to concentrate on this aspect of sentence ordering, as it appears to coincide with the structure of the summaries for the DUC 2005 dataset.",
