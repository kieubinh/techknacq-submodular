        "People proceed in their conversations through a sequence of dialogue acts to yield some specific communicative goal.",

        "Dialogue Acts (DA) attracted linguistics (Austin, 1962; Searle, 1969) and computational linguistics research (Core and Allen, 1997; Traum, 2000) since long time.",
        "With the advent of the Web, a large amount of material about natural language interactions (e.g. blogs, chats, conversation transcripts) has become available, raising the attractiveness of empirical methods analyses on this field.",
        "There is a large number of application domains that could benefit from automatically labeling DAs: e.g. conversational agents for monitoring and supporting human-human remote conversations, blogs, forums and chat logs analysis for opinion mining, interpersonal stances modeling by mean of conversational analysis, automatic meeting summarizations and so on.",
        "These applications require a deep understanding of the conversational structure and the ability of the system to understand who is telling what to whom.",
        "This study defines a method for automatically labeling dialogues with the proper speech acts by relying on empirical methods.",
        "Even if prosody and intonation surely play a role (e.g. (Stolcke et al., 2000; Warnke et al., 1997)), nonetheless language and words are what the speaker uses to convey the communicative message and are just what we have at disposal when we consider texts found on the Web.",
        "Hence, we decided to simply exploit lexical semantics of the sentences.",
        "We performed some experiments in a supervised and unsupervised framework on both an English and an Italian corpora of dialogue transcriptions, achieving good results in all settings.",
        "Unsupervised performance is particularly encouraging, independently from the used language.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 gives a brief sketch of the NLP background on Dialogue Acts recognition.",
        "In Section 3 we introduce the English and Italian corpora of dialogues, their characteristics and DA labeling.",
        "In Section 4 we describe the preprocessing of the data sets.",
        "Then Section 5 explains the supervised and unsupervised settings, showing the experimental results obtained on the two corpora and providing an error analysis.",
        "Finally, in Section 6 we conclude the paper with a brief discussion and some directions for future work."

        "A DA can be identified with the communicative goal of a given utterance (Austin, 1962).",

        "Traditionally, the NLP community has employed DA definitions with the drawback of being domain or application oriented.",
        "Recently some efforts have been made towards unifying the DA annotation (Traum, 2000).",

        "It is not always easy to collect large training, partly because of manual labeling effort and moreover because often it is not possible to find it.",
        "Schematically, our unsupervised methodology is: (i) building a semantic similarity space in which words, set of words, text fragments can be represented homogeneously, (ii) finding seeds that properly represent dialogue acts and considering their representations in the similarity space, and (iii) checking the similarity of the utterances.",
        "To get a similarity space with the required characteristics, we used Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), a corpus-based measure of semantic similarity proposed by Landauer (Landauer et al., 1998).",
        "In LSA, term co-occurrences in a corpus are captured by means of a dimensionality reduction operated by a singular value decomposition (SVD) on the term-by-document matrix T representing the corpus.",
        "SVD decomposes the term-by-document matrix T into three matrices T = USkVT where Xk is the diagonal k x k matrix containing the k singular values of T, <j\\ > a2 > ... > crk, and U and V are column-orthogonal matrices.",
        "When the three matrices are multiplied together the original term-by-document matrix is re-composed.",
        "Typically we can choose k' <C k obtaining the approximation T ~ USk/ VT.",
        "LSA can be viewed as a way to overcome some of the drawbacks of the standard vector space model (sparseness and high dimensionality).",
        "In fact, the LSA similarity is computed in a lower dimensional space, in which second-order relations among terms and texts are exploited.",
        "The similarity in the resulting vector space is then measured with the standard cosine similarity.",
        "Note also that LSA yields a vector space model that allows for a homogeneous representation (and hence comparison) of words, sentences, and texts.",
        "For representing a word set or a sentence in the LSA space we use the pseudodocument representation technique, as described by Berry (1992).",
        "In practice, each text segment is represented in the LSA space by summing up the normalized LSA vectors of all the constituent words, using also a tf.idf weighting scheme (Gliozzo and Strapparava, 2005).",
        "S-OPINION Verbs which directly express opinion or",

        "The methodology is completely unsupervised.",
        "We run the LSA using 400 dimensions (i.e. k', as suggested by (Landauer et al., 1998)) respectively on the English and Italian corpus, without any DA label information.",
        "Starting from a set of seeds (words) representing the communicative acts (see the complete sets in Table 3), we build the corresponding vectors in the LSA space and then we compare the utterances to find the communicative act with higher similarity.",
        "To compare with SVM, the performance is measured on the same test set partition used in the supervised experiment (Table 4).",
        "We defined seeds by only considering the communicative goal and the specific semantic of every single DA, just avoiding as much as possible the overlapping between seeds groups.",
        "We wanted to design an approach which is as general as possible, so we did not consider domain words.",
        "The seeds are the same for both languages, which is coherent with our goal of defining a language-independent method.",
        "We evaluate the performance of our method in terms of precision, recall and fl-measure (see Table 4) according to the DA labels given by annotators in the datasets.",
        "As baselines we consider (i) most-frequent label assignment (respectively 37% for Italian, 57% for English) for the supervised setting, and (ii) random DA selection (ll%) for the unsupervised one.",
        "Results are quite satisfying (Table 4).",
        "In particular, the unsupervised technique is largely above the baselines, for both the Italian and the English experiments.",
        "The methodology is independent from the language and the domain: the Italian corpus is a collection of dialogue about a very restricted domain while the Switchboard conversations are essentially task-free.",
        "Moreover, in the unsupervised setting we use in practice the same seed definitions.",
        "Secondly, it is independent on the differences in the linguistic style due to the specific interaction scenario and input modality.",
        "Finally, the performance is not affected by the difference in size of the two data sets.",
        "Error analysis.",
        "After conducting an error analysis, we noted that many utterances are misclassified as STATEMENT.",
        "One possible reason is that statements usually are quite long and there is a high chance that some linguistic markers that characterize other dialogue acts are present in those sentences.",
        "On the other hand, looking at the corpora we observed that many utterances which appear to be linguistically consistent with the typical structure of statements have been annotated differently, according to the actual communicative role they play.",
        "For similar reasons, we observed some misclassification of S-OPINION as STATEMENT.",
        "The only significative difference between the two labels seems to be the wider usage of 'slanted' and affectively loaded lexicon when conveying an opinion.",
        "Another cause of confounding is the confusion among the backchannel labels (GEN-ANS, AGREE-ACC and REJECT) due to the inherent ambiguity of common words like yes, no, yeah, ok.",
        "Recognition of such cases could be improved (i) by enabling the classifiers to consider not only the lexical semantics of the given utterance (local context) but also the knowledge about a wider context window (e.g. the previous n utterances), (ii) by enriching the data preprocessing (e.g. by exploiting information about lexicon polarity and subjectivity parameters).",
        "We intend to follow both these directions in our future research."
