        "Letter-to-phoneme (L2P) conversion can be defined as the task of predicting the pronunciation of a word given its orthographic form (Bartlett et al., 2008).The pronunciation is usually represented as a sequence of phonemes.",
        "Letter-to-phoneme conversion systems play a very important role in spell checkers (Toutanova and Moore, 2002), speech synthesis systems (Schroeter et al., 2002) and transliteration (Sherif and Kondrak, 2007).",
        "Letter-to-phoneme conversion systems may also be effectively used for cognate identification and transliteration.",
        "The existing cognate identification systems use the orthographic form of a word as the input.",
        "But we know that the correspondence between written and spoken forms of words can be quite irregular as is the case in English.",
        "Even in other languages with supposedly regular spellings, this irregularity exists owing to linguistic phenomena like borrowing and language variation.",
        "Letter-to-phoneme conversion systems can facilitate the task of cognate identification by providing a language independent transcription for any word.",
        "Until a few years ago, letter-to-phoneme conversion was performed considering only one-one correspondences (Black et al., 1998; Damper et al., 2004).",
        "Recent work uses many-to-many correspondences (Jiampojamarn et al., 2007) and reports significantly higher accuracy for Dutch, German and French.",
        "The current state of the art systems give as much as 90% (Jiampojamarn et al., 2008) accuracy for languages like Dutch, German and French.",
        "However, accuracy of this level is yet to be achieved for English.",
        "Rule-based approaches to the problem of letter-to-phoneme conversion although appealing, are impractical as the number of rules for a particular language can be very high (Kominek and Black, 2006).",
        "Alternative approaches to this problem are based on machine learning and make use of resources such as pronunciation dictionaries.",
        "In this paper, we present one such machine learning based approach wherein we envisage this problem as a Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) problem.",

        "In the letter-to-phoneme conversion task, a single letter can map to multiple phonemes [x – ks] and multiple letters can generate a single phoneme.",
        "A letter can also map to a null phoneme [e – <p] and vice-versa.",
        "These examples give a glimpse of why the task is so complex and a single machine learning technique may not be enough to solve the problem.",
        "A overview of the literature supports this claim.",
        "In older approaches, the alignment between the letters and phonemes was taken to be one-to-one (Black et al., 1998) and the phoneme was predicted for every single letter.",
        "But recent work (Bisani and Ney, 2002; Jiampojamarn et al., 2007) shows that multiple letter-to-phoneme alignments perform better than single letter to phoneme alignments.",
        "The problem can be either viewed as a multi-class classifier problem or a structure prediction problem.",
        "In structure prediction, the algorithm takes the previous decisions as the features which influence the current decision.",
        "In the classifier approach, only the letter and its context are taken as features.",
        "Then, either multiclass decision trees (Daelemans and van den Bosch, 1997) or instance based learning as in (van den Bosch and Daelemans, 1998) is used to predict the class, which in this case is a phoneme.",
        "Some of these methods (Black et al., 1998) are not completely automatic and need an initial handcrafted seeding to begin the classification.",
        "Structure prediction is like a tagging problem where HMMs (Taylor, 2005) are used to model the problem.",
        "Taylor claims that except for a preprocessing step, it is completely automatic.",
        "The whole process is performed in a single step.",
        "The results are poor, as reasoned in (Jiampojamarn et al., 2008) due to the emission probabilities not being informed by the previous letter's emission probabilities.",
        "Pronunciation by Analogy (PbA) is a data-driven method (Marchand and Damper, 2000) for letter-to-phoneme conversion which is used again by Damper et al. (2004).",
        "They simply use an",
        "Expectation-Maximisation (EM) like algorithm for aligning the letter-phoneme pairs in a speech dictionary.",
        "They claim that by integrating the alignments induced by the algorithm into the PbA system, they were able to improve the accuracy of the pronunciation significantly.",
        "We also use the many-to-many alignment approach but in a different way and obtained from a different source.",
        "The recent work of Jiampojamarn et al. (2007) combines both of the above approaches in a very interesting manner.",
        "It uses an EM like algorithm for aligning the letters and phonemes.",
        "The algorithm allows many-to-many alignments between letters and phonemes.",
        "Then there is a letter chunking module which uses instance-based training to train on the alignments which have been obtained in the previous step.",
        "This module is used to guess the possible letter chunks in every word.",
        "Then a local phoneme predictor is used to guess the phonemes for every letter in a word.",
