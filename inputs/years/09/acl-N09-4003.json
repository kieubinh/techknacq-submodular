        "Dynamic Programming (DP) is an important class of algorithms widely used in many areas of speech and language processing.",
        "It provides efficient solutions to seemingly intractable inference over exponentially-large spaces by sharing overlapping subproblems.",
        "Well-known examples of DP in our field include Viterbi and Forward-Backward Algorithms for finite-state models, CKY and Earley Algorithms for context-free parsing, and A* Algorithm for both.",
        "These algorithms are widely used to solve problems ranging from sequence labeling to word alignment to machine translation decoding.",
        "With this overwhelming popularity, this tutorial aims to provide a better understanding of DP from both theoretical and practical perspectives.",
        "In the theory part, we try to unify various DP algorithms under a generic algebraic framework, where the above mentioned examples are merely special cases, and we can easily analyze their correctness and complexities.",
        "However, exact DP algorithms are often infeasible in practice due to time and space constraints.",
        "So in the practice part, we will survey several widely used tricks to reduce the size of the search space, including beam search, histogram pruning, coarse-to-fine search, and cube pruning.",
        "We will discuss these methods within the context of state-of-the-art large-scale NLP systems."
