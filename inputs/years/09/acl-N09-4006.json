        "Sameer S. Pradhan and Nianwen Xue",
        "OntoNotes is a five year multi-site collaboration between BBN Technologies, Information Sciences Institute of University of Southern California, University of Colorado, University of Pennsylvania and Brandeis University.",
        "The goal of the OntoNotes project is to provide linguistic data annotated with a skeletal representation of the literal meaning of sentences including syntactic parse, predicate-argument structure, coreference, and word senses linked to an ontology, allowing a new generation of language understanding technologies to be developed with new functional capabilities.",
        "In its third year of existence, the OntoNotes project has generated a large amount of high quality data covering various layers of linguistic annotation.",
        "This is probably the first time that data of such quality has been available in large quantities covering multiple genres (newswire, broadcast news, broadcast conversation and weblogs) and languages (English, Chinese and Arabic).",
        "The guiding principle has been to find a \"sweet spot\" in the space of inter-tagger agreement, productivity, and depth of representation.",
        "The most effective use of this resource for research requires simultaneous access to multiple layers of annotation.",
        "This has been made possible by representing the corpus with a relational database to accommodate the dense connectedness of the data and ensure consistency across layers.",
        "In order to facilitate ease of understanding and manipulability, the database has also been supplemented with a object-oriented Python API.",
        "The tutorial consists of two parts.",
        "In the first part we will familiarize the user with this new resource, describe the various layers of annotations in some detail and discuss the linguistic principles and sometimes practical considerations behind the important design decisions that shapes the corpus.",
        "We will also describe the salient differences between the three languages at each layer of annotation and how linguistic peculiarities of different languages were handled in the data.",
        "In the second part, we will describe the data formats of each of the layers and talk about various design decisions that went into the creation of the architecture of the database and the individual tables comprising it, along with issues that came up during the representation process and compromises that were made without sacriicing some primary objectives one of which being the independent existence of each layer that is necessary to allow multi-site collaboration.",
        "We will explain how the database schema attempts to interconnect all the layers.",
        "Then we will go into the details of the Python API that allows easy access to each of the layers and show that by making the objects closely resemble database tables, the API allows for their flexible integration.",
        "This will be followed by a hands-on working session."
