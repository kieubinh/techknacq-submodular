        "Traditional machine learning relies on the availability of a large amount of data to train a model, which is then applied to test data in the same feature space.",
        "However, labeled data are often scarce and expensive to obtain.",
        "Various machine learning strategies have been proposed to address this problem, including semi-supervised learning (Zhu, 2007), domain adaptation (Wu and Diet-terich, 2004; Blitzer et al., 2006; Blitzer et al., and Rappoport, 2007; Andreevskaia and Bergler, 2008), multi-task learning (Caruana, 1997; Reichart et al., 2008; Arnold et al., 2008), self-taught learning (Raina et al., 2007), etc.",
        "A commonality among these methods is that they all require the training data and test data to be in the same feature space.",
        "In addition, most of them are designed for supervised learning.",
        "However, in practice, we often face the problem where the labeled data are scarce in their own feature space, whereas there may be a large amount of labeled heterogeneous data in another feature space.",
        "In such situations, it would be desirable to transfer the knowledge from heterogeneous data to domains where we have relatively little training data available.",
        "To learn from heterogeneous data, researchers have previously proposed multi-view learning (Blum and Mitchell, 1998; Nigam and Ghani, 2000) in which each instance has multiple views in different feature spaces.",
        "Different from previous works, we focus on the problem of heterogeneous transfer learning, which is designed for situation when the training data are in one feature space (such as text), and the test data are in another (such as images), and there may be no correspondence between instances in these spaces.",
        "The type of heterogeneous data can be very different, as in the case of text and image.",
        "To consider how heterogeneous transfer learning relates to other types of learning, Figure 1 presents an intuitive illustration of four learning strategies, including traditional machine learning, transfer learning across different distributions, multi-view learning and heterogeneous transfer learning.",
        "As we can see, an important distinguishing feature of heterogeneous transfer learning, as compared to other types of learning, is that more constraints on the problem are relaxed, such that data instances do not need to correspond anymore.",
        "This allows, for example, a collection of Chinese text documents to be classified using another collection of English text as the 2.1).",
        "In this paper, we will give an illustrative example of heterogeneous transfer learning to demonstrate how the task of image clustering can benefit from learning from the heterogeneous social Web data.",
        "A major motivation of our work is Web-based image search, where users submit textual queries and browse through the returned result pages.",
        "One problem is that the user queries are often ambiguous.",
        "An ambiguous keyword such as \"Apple\" might retrieve images of Apple computers and mobile phones, or images of fruits.",
        "Image clustering is an effective method for improving the accessibility of image search result.",
        "Loeff et al.",
        "(2006) addressed the image clustering problem with a focus on image sense discrimination.",
        "In their approach, images associated with textual features are used for clustering, so that the text and images are clustered at the same time.",
        "Specifically, spectral clustering is applied to the distance matrix built from a multimodal feature set associated with the images to get a better feature representation.",
        "This new representation contains both image and text information, with which the performance of image clustering is shown to be improved.",
        "A problem with this approach is thatwhen images contained in the Web search results are very scarce and when the textual data associated with the images are very few, clustering on the images and their associated text may not be very effective.",
        "Different from these previous works, in this paper, we address the image clustering problem as a heterogeneous transfer learning problem.",
        "We aim to leverage heterogeneous auxiliary data, social annotations, etc.",
        "to enhance image clustering performance.",
        "We observe that the World Wide Web has many annotated images in Web sites such as Flickr (http : //www.",
        "flickr.",
        "com), which can be used as auxiliary information source for our clustering task.",
        "In this work, our objective is to cluster a small collection of images that we are interested in, where these images are not sufficient for traditional clustering algorithms to perform well due to data sparsity and the low level of image features.",
        "We investigate how to utilize the readily available socially annotated image data on the Web to improve image clustering.",
        "Although these auxiliary data may be irrelevant to the images to be clustered and cannot be directly used to solve the data sparsity problem, we show that they can still be used to estimate a good latent feature representation, which can be used to improve image clustering."

        "As the World Wide Web in China grows rapidly, it has become an increasingly important problem to be able to accurately classify Chinese Web pages.",
        "However, because the labeled Chinese Web pages are still not sufficient, we often find it difficult to achieve high accuracy by applying traditional machine learning algorithms to the Chinese Web pages directly.",
        "Would it be possible to make the best use of the relatively abundant labeled English Web pages for classifying the Chinese Web pages?",
        "To answer this question, in (Ling et al., 2008), we developed a novel approach for classifying the Web pages in Chinese using the training documents in English.",
        "In this subsection, we give a brief summary of this work.",
        "The problem to be solved is: we are given a collection of labeled English documents and a large number of unla-beled Chinese documents.",
        "The English and Chinese texts are not aligned.",
        "Our objective is to classify the Chinese documents into the same label space as the English data.",
        "Our key observation is that even though the data use different text features, they may still share many of the same semantic information.",
        "What we need to do is to uncover this latent semantic information by finding out what is common among them.",
        "We did this in (Ling et al., 2008) by using the information bottleneck theory (Tishby et al., 1999).",
        "In our work, we first translated the Chinese document into English automatically using some available translation software, such as Google translate.",
        "Then, we encoded the training text as well as the translated target text together, in terms of the information theory.",

        "Finally, information bottleneck was used to maintain most of the common information between the two data sources, and discard the remaining irrelevant information.",
        "In this way, we can approximate the ideal situation where similar training and translated test pages shared in the common part are encoded into the same codewords, and are thus assigned the correct labels.",
        "In (Ling et al., 2008), we experimentally showed that heterogeneous transfer learning can indeed improve the performance of cross-language text classification as compared to directly training learning models (e.g., Naive Bayes or SVM) and testing on the translated texts.",
        "In the past, several other works made use of transfer learning for cross-feature-space learning.",
        "Wu and Oard (2008) proposed to handle the cross-language learning problem by translating the data into a same language and applying kNN on the latent topic space for classification.",
        "Most learning algorithms for dealing with cross-language heterogeneous data require a translator to convert the data to the same feature space.",
        "For those data that are in different feature spaces where no translator is available, Davis and Domingos (2008) proposed a Markov-logic-based transfer learning algorithm, which is called deep transfer, for transferring knowledge between biological domains and Web domains.",
        "Dai et al.",
        "(2008a) proposed a novel learning paradigm, known as translated learning, to deal with the problem of learning heterogeneous data that belong to quite different feature spaces by using a risk minimization framework.",
        "Our work makes use of PLSA.",
        "Probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) is a widely used probabilistic model (Hofmann, 1999), and could be considered as a probabilistic implementation of latent semantic analysis (LSA) (Deerwester et al., 1990).",
        "An extension to PLSA was proposed in (Cohn and Hofmann, 2000), which incorporated the hyperlink connectivity in the PLSA model by using a joint probabilistic model for connectivity and content.",
        "Moreover, PLSA has shown a lot of applications ranging from text clustering (Hofmann, 2001) to image analysis (Sivic et al., 2005).",
        "Compared to many previous works on image clustering, we note that traditional image clustering is generally based on techniques such as K-means (MacQueen, 1967) and hierarchical clustering (Kaufman and Rousseeuw, 1990).",
        "However, when the data are sparse, traditional clustering algorithms may have difficulties in obtaining high-quality image clusters.",
        "Recently, several researchers have investigated how to leverage the auxiliary information to improve target clustering performance, such as supervised clustering (Fin-ley and Joachims, 2005), semi-supervised clustering (Basu et al., 2004), self-taught clustering (Dai et al., 2008b), etc."

        "For each of the above two baselines, we have two strategies: (1) separated: the baseline method was applied on the target image data only; (2) combined: the baseline method was applied to cluster the combined data consisting of both target image data and the annotated image data.",
        "Clustering results on target image data were used for evaluation.",
        "Note that, in the combined data, all the annotations were thrown away since baseline methods evaluated in this paper do not leverage annotation information.",
        "In addition, we compared our algorithm aPLSA to a state-of-the-art transfer clustering strategy, known as self-taught clustering (STC) (Dai et al., 2008b).",
        "STC makes use of auxiliary data to estimate a better feature representation to benefit the target clustering.",
        "In these experiments, the annotated image data were used as auxiliary data in STC , which does not use the annotation text.",
        "In our experiments, the performance is in the form of the average entropy and variance of five repeats by randomly selecting 50 images from each of the categories.",
        "We selected only 50 images per category, since this paper is focused on clustering sparse data.",
        "Table 2 shows the performance with respect to all comparison methods on each of the image clustering tasks measured by the entropy criterion.",
        "From the tables, we can see that our algorithm aPLSA outperforms the baseline methods in all the data sets.",
        "We believe that is because aPLSA can effectively utilize the knowledge from the socially annotated image data.",
        "On average, aPLSA gives rise to 21.8% of entropy reduction and as compared to KMeans, 5.7% of entropy reduction as compared to PLSA, and 10.1% of entropy reduction as compared to STC.",
        "We now show how the data size affects aPLSA, with two baseline methods KMeans and PLSA as reference.",
        "The experiments were conducted on different amounts of target image data, varying from 10 to 80.",
        "The corresponding experimental results in average entropy over all the ll clustering tasks are shown in Figure 4(a).",
        "From this figure, we observe that aPLSA always yields a significant reduction in entropy as compared with two baseline methods KMeans and PLSA, regardless of the size of target image data that we used.",
