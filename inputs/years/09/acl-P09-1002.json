        "The vast majority of work on word senses has relied on predefined sense inventories and an annotation schema where each word instance is tagged with the best fitting sense.",

        "We find that the graded responses correlate with annotations from previous datasets, but sense assignments are used in a way that weakens the case for clear cut sense boundaries.",
        "The responses from both experiments correlate with the overlap of paraphrases from the English lexical substitution task which bodes well for the use of substitutes as a proxy for word sense.",

        "The vast majority of work on word sense tagging has assumed that predefined word senses from a dictionary are an adequate proxy for the task, although of course there are issues with this enterprise both in terms of cognitive validity (Hanks, 2000; Kilgarriff, 1997; Kilgarriff, 2006) and adequacy for computational linguistics applications (Kilgarriff, 2006).",
        "Furthermore, given a predefined list of senses, annotation efforts and computational approaches to word sense disambiguation (wsd) have usually assumed that one best fitting sense should be selected for each usage.",
        "While there is usually some allowance made for multiple senses, this is typically not adopted by annotators or computational systems.",
        "Research on the psychology of concepts (Murphy, 2002; Hampton, 2007) shows that categories in the human mind are not simply sets with clear-cut boundaries: Some items are perceived as more typical than others (Rosch, 1975; Rosch and Mervis, 1975), and there are borderline cases on which people disagree more often, and on whose categorization they are more likely to change their minds (Hampton, 1979; McCloskey and Glucksberg, 1978).",
        "Word meanings are certainly related to mental concepts (Murphy, 2002).",
        "This raises the question of whether there is any such thing as the one appropriate sense for a given occurrence.",
        "In this paper we will explore using graded responses for sense tagging within a novel annotation paradigm.",
        "Modeling the annotation framework after psycholinguistic experiments, we do not train annotators to conform to sense distinctions; rather we assess individual differences by asking annotators to produce graded ratings instead of making a binary choice.",
        "We perform two annotation studies.",
        "In the first one, referred to as WSsim (Word Sense Similarity), annotators give graded ratings on the applicability of WordNet senses.",
        "In the second one, Usim (Usage Similarity), annotators rate the similarity of pairs of occurrences (usages) of a common target word.",
        "Both studies explore whether users make use of a graded scale or persist in making binary decisions even when there is the option for a graded response.",
        "The first study additionally tests to what extent the judgments on WordNet senses fall into clear-cut clusters, while the second study allows us to explore meaning similarity independently of any lexicon resource."

        "Manual word sense assignment is difficult for human annotators (Krishnamurthy and Nicholls, 2000).",
        "Reported inter-annotator agreement (ITA) for fine-grained word sense assignment tasks has ranged between 69% (Kilgarriff and Rosenzweig, 2000) for a lexical sample using the HECTOR dictionary and 78.6.% using WordNet (Landes et al., 1998) in all-words annotation.",
        "The use of more coarse-grained senses alleviates the problem: In OntoNotes (Hovy et al., 2006), an ITA of 90% is used as the criterion for the construction ofcoarse-grained sense distinctions.",
        "However, intriguingly, for some high-frequency lemmas such as leave this ITA threshold is not reached even after multiple re-partitionings of the semantic space (Chen and Palmer, 2009).",
        "Similarly, the performance of wsd systems clearly indicates that wsd is not easy unless one adopts a coarse-grained approach, and then systems tagging all words at best perform a few percentage points above the most frequent sense heuristic (Navigli et al., 2007).",
        "Good performance on coarse-grained sense distinctions may be more useful in applications than poor performance on fine-grained distinctions (Ide and Wilks, 2006) but we do not know this yet and there is some evidence to the contrary (Stokoe, 2005).",
        "Rather than focus on the granularity of clusters, the approach we will take in this paper is to examine the phenomenon of word meaning both with and without recourse to predefined senses by focusing on the similarity of uses of a word.",
        "Human subjects show excellent agreement on judging word similarity out of context (Ruben-stein and Goodenough, 1965; Miller and Charles, 1991), and human judgments have previously been used successfully to study synonymy and near-synonymy (Miller and Charles, 1991; Bybee and Eddington, 2006).",
        "We focus on polysemy rather than synonymy.",
        "Our aim will be to use WSsim to determine to what extent annotations form cohesive clusters.",
        "In principle, it should be possible to use existing sense-annotated data to explore this question: almost all sense annotation efforts have allowed annotators to assign multiple senses to a single occurrence, and the distribution of these sense labels should indicate whether annotators viewed the senses as disjoint or not.",
        "However, the percentage of markables that received multiple sense labels in existing corpora is small, and it varies massively between corpora: In the SemCor corpus (Landes et al., 1998), only 0.3% of all markables received multiple sense labels.",
        "In the senseval-3 English lexical task corpus (Mihal-cea et al., 2004) (hereafter referred to as se-3), the ratio is much higher at 8% of all markables.",
        "This could mean annotators feel that there is usually a single applicable sense, or it could point to a bias towards single-sense assignment in the annotation guidelines and/or the annotation tool.",
        "The WSsim experiment that we report in this paper is designed to eliminate such bias as far as possible and we conduct it on data taken from SemCor and se-3 so that we can compare the annotations.",
        "Although we use WordNet for the annotation, our study is not a study of WordNet per se.",
        "We choose WordNet because it is sufficiently fine-grained to examine subtle differences in usage, and because traditionally annotated datasets exist to which we can compare our results.",
        "Predefined dictionaries and lexical resources are not the only possibilities for annotating lexical items with meaning.",
        "In cross-lingual settings, the actual translations of a word can be taken as the sense labels (Resnik and Yarowsky, 2000).",
        "Recently, McCarthy and Navigli (2007) proposed the English Lexical Substitution task (hereafter referred to as lexsub) under the auspices of SemEval-2007.",
        "It uses paraphrases for words in context as a way of annotating meaning.",
        "The task was proposed following a background of discussions in the wsd community as to the adequacy of predefined word senses.",
        "The lexsub dataset comprises open class words (nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs) with token instances of each word appearing in the context of one sentence taken from the English Internet Corpus (Sharoff, 2006).",
        "The methodology can only work where there are paraphrases, so the dataset only contains words with more than one meaning where at least two different meanings have near synonyms.",
        "For meanings without obvious substitutes the annotators were allowed to use multiword paraphrases or words with slightly more general meanings.",
        "This dataset has been used to evaluate automatic systems which can find substitutes appropriate for the context.",
        "To the best of our knowledge there has been no study of how the data collected relates to word sense annotations or judgments of semantic similarity.",
        "In this paper we examine these relationships by reusing data from lexsub in both new annotation experiments and testing the results for correlation."

        "In addition annotators had the ability to respond with \"Cannot Decide\", indicating that they were unable to make an effective comparison between the two contexts, for example because the meaning of one usage was unclear.",
        "This occurred in 9 paired occurrences during the course of annotation, and these items (paired occurrences) were excluded from further analysis.",

        "The results in the first and third block of table 5 are not directly comparable, as the results in the first block are for all Usim data and not the subset of lexsub with WSsim annotations.",
        "We therefore repeated the analysis for Usim on the subset of data in WSsim and provide the correlation in the middle section of table 5.",
        "The mean correlation for Usim on this subset of the data is 0.532, which is a stronger relationship compared to WSsim, although there is more discrepancy between individual annotators, with the result for annotator 4 giving a p-value = 9.139e-05 while the other two annotators had p-values < 2.2e-16.",
        "The lexsub substitute overlaps between different usages correlate well with both Usim and WSsim judgments, with a slightly stronger relationship to Usim, perhaps due to the more complicated representation of word meaning in WSsim which uses the full set of WordNet senses.",
        "As we showed in section 4.1, WSsim correlates with previous word sense annotations in SemCor and se-3 while allowing the user a more graded response to sense tagging.",
        "As we saw in section 4.2, Usim and WSsim judgments both have a highly significant correlation with similarity of usages as measured using the overlap of substitutes from lexsub.",

        "This shows that the tasks are well-defined.",
        "in addition, there is a strong correlation between WSsim and Usim, which indicates that the potential bias introduced by the use of dictionary senses in WSsim is not too prominent.",
        "However, we note that WSsim only contained a small portion of 3 lemmas (30 sentences and 135 spairs) in common with Usim, so more annotation is needed to be certain of this relationship.",
        "Given the differences between annotator 1 and the other annotators in Fig. 1, it would be interesting to collect judgments for additional annotators.",
        "Graded judgments of use similarity and sense applicability.",
        "The annotators made use of the full spectrum of ratings, as shown in Figures 1 and 4.",
        "This may be because of a graded perception of the similarity of uses as well as senses, or because some uses and senses are very similar.",
        "Table 4 shows that for a large number of WSsim items, multiple senses that were not significantly positively correlated got high ratings.",
        "This seems to indicate that the ratings we obtained cannot simply be explained by more coarse-grained senses.",
        "it may hence be reasonable to pursue computational models of word meaning that are graded, maybe even models that do not rely on dictionary senses at all (Erk and Pado, 2008).",
        "Comparison to previous word sense annotation.",
        "Our graded WSsim annotations do correlate with traditional \"best fitting sense\" annotations from SemCor and se-3; however, if annotators perceive similarity between uses and senses as graded, traditional word sense annotation runs the risk of introducing bias into the annotation.",
        "Comparison to lexical substitutions.",
        "There is a strong correlation between both Usim and WSsim and the overlap in paraphrases that annotators generated for lexsub.",
        "This is very encouraging, and especially interesting because lexsub annotators freely generated paraphrases rather than selecting them from a list."

      "text": [
        "We have introduced a novel annotation paradigm for word sense annotation that allows for graded judgments and for some variation between annotators.",
        "We have used this annotation paradigm in two experiments, WSsim and Usim, that shed some light on the question of whether differences between word usages are perceived as categorial or graded.",
        "Both datasets will be made publicly available.",
        "There was a high correlation between annotator judgments within and across tasks, as well as with previous word sense annotation and with paraphrases proposed in the English Lexical Substitution task.",
        "Annotators made ample use of graded judgments in a way that cannot be explained through more coarse-grained senses.",
        "These results suggest that it may make sense to evaluate wsd systems on a task of graded rather than categorial meaning characterization, either through dictionary senses or similarity between uses.",
        "in that case, it would be useful to have more extensive datasets with graded annotation, even though this annotation paradigm is more time consuming and thus more expensive than traditional word sense annotation.",
        "As a next step, we will automatically cluster the judgments we obtained in the WSsim and Usim experiments to further explore the degree to which the annotation gives rise to sense grouping.",
        "We will also use the ratings in both experiments to evaluate automatically induced models of word meaning.",
        "The SemEval-2007 word sense induction task (Agirre and Soroa, 2007) already allows for evaluation of automatic sense induction systems, but compares output to gold-standard senses from OntoNotes.",
        "We hope that the Usim dataset will be particularly useful for evaluating methods which relate usages without necessarily producing hard clusters.",
        "Also, we will extend the current dataset using more annotators and exploring additional lexicon resources.",
