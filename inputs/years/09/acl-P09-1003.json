        "Some roles in two related frames are also connected with role-to-role relations.",
        "We assume that this hierarchy is a promising resource for generalizing the semantic roles; the idea is that the role at a node in the hierarchy inherits the characteristics of the roles of its ancestor nodes.",
        "For example, Commerce_sell::Seller in Figure 2 inherits the property of Giving::Donor.",
        "For Inheritance, Using, Perspective jon, and Subframe relations, we assume that descendant roles in these relations have the same or specialized properties of their ancestors.",
        "Hence, for each role yi, we define the following two role groups,",
        "Hfld = [y\\y = yi v y is a child of yi}, Hyesc = {y\\y = yi V y is a descendant of yi}.",
        "The hierarchical-relation groups in Figure 4 are the illustrations of H.desc.",

        "HParent = {y\\y = yi v y is a parent of yi}, Hynce = {y\\y = yi v y is an ancestor of yi}.",
        "This is because lower roles of Inchoative jof and Causative of relations represent more neutral stances or consequential states; for example, Killing::Victim is a parent of Death::Protagonist in the Causative jof relation.",

        "This criterion may be effective in collecting similar roles since the descriptors have been annotated by intuition of human experts.",
        "As illustrated in Figure 2, the role descriptors group the semantic roles which are similar to the roles that the FrameNet hierarchy connects as sister or parent-child relations.",
        "However, role-descriptor groups cannot express the relations between the roles as inclusions since they are equivalence classes.",
        "For example, the roles Commerce_sell::Buyer and Commerce_buy::Buyer are included in the role descriptor group Buyer in Figure 2; however, it is difficult to merge Giving::Recipient and Commerce_sell::Buyer because the Com-merce_sell::Buyer has the extra property that one gives something of value in exchange and a human assigns different descriptors to them.",

        "For instance, FrameNet specifies the constraint that Self_motion::Area should be filled by phrases whose semantic type is Location.",

Let Yf be the set of semantic roles that FrameNet defines as being possible role assignments for the frame f, and let x = {xi,..., xn} be observed features for x from s, e and f. The task of semantic role classification can be formalized as the problem ofchoos-ing the most suitable role y from Yf.",
        "Suppose we have a model P(y\\f, x) which yields the conditional probability of the semantic role y for given f and x.",
        "Then we can choose y as follows:",
        "A traditional way to incorporate role groups into this formalization is to overwrite each role y in the training and test data with its role group m(y) according to the memberships of the group.",

        "Some previous studies have employed this idea to remedy the data sparseness problem in the training data (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002).",
        "However, we cannot apply this approach when multiple roles in Yf are contained in the same class.",
        "For example, we can construct a semantic-type group St::State jof affairs in which Giving::Reason and Giving::Means are included, as illustrated in Figure 4.",
        "If c = St::State of affairs, we cannot disambiguate which original role is correct.",
        "In addition, it may be more effective to use various groupings of roles together in the model.",
        "For instance, the model could predict the correct role Commerce_sell::Seller for the phrase \"you\" in Figure 3 more confidently, if it could infer its thematic-role group as Themer.Agent and its parent group Givingr.Donor correctly.",
        "Although the ensemble of various groupings seems promising, we need an additional procedure to prioritize the groupings for the case where the models for multiple role groupings disagree; for example, it is unsatisfactory if two models assign the groups Giving..Theme and Theme..Agent to the same phrase.",
        "We thus propose another approach that incorporates group information as feature functions.",
        "We model the conditional probability P(y\\f, x) by using the maximum entropy framework,",
        "Here, G = {gi} denotes a set of n feature functions, and A = {Xi} denotes a weight vector for the feature functions.",
        "In general, feature functions for the maximum entropy model are designed as indicator functions for possible pairs of Xj and y.",
        "For example, the event where the head word of x is \"you\" (xi = 1) and x plays the role Commerce_sell::Seller in a sentence is expressed by the indicator function, grole(x,y)",
        "y = Commerce_seN::Seller) 0 (otherwise)",

        "Giving::Donor).",
        "We call this kind offeature function an x-group function.",
        "In this way, we obtain x-group functions for all grouping methods, e.g., gtheme, g^™*^'.",
        "The role-group features will receive more training instances by collecting instances for fine-grained roles.",
        "Thus, semantic roles with few training instances are expected to receive additional clues from other training instances via role-group features.",
        "Another advantage of this approach is that the usefulness of the different role groups is determined by the training processes in terms of weights of feature functions.",

        "They were: role hierarchy, human-understandable descriptors of roles, semantic types of filler phrases, and mappings from FrameNet roles to thematic roles of VerbNet.",
        "We also proposed a feature design that combines and weights these criteria using the training data.",
        "The experimental result of the role classification task showed a 19.16% of the error reduction and a 7.42% improvement in the macro-averaged F1 score.",
        "In particular, the method we have presented was able to classify roles having few instances.",
        "We confirmed that modeling the role generalization at feature level was better than the conventional approach that replaces semantic role labels.",
        "Each criterion presented in this paper improved the accuracy of classification.",
        "The most successful criterion was the use of human-understandable role descriptors.",
        "Unfortunately, the FrameNet hierarchy did not outperform the role descriptors, contrary to our expectations.",

        "Since we used the latest release of FrameNet in order to use a greater number of hierarchical role-to-role relations, we could not make a direct comparison of performance with that of existing systems; however we may say that the 89.00% F1 micro-average of our baseline system is roughly comparable to the 88.93% value of Bejan and Hathaway (2007) for SemEval-2007 (Baker et al., 2007).",
        "In addition, the methodology presented in this paper applies generally to any SRL resources; we are planning to determine several grouping criteria from existing linguistic resources and to apply the methodology to the PropBank corpus."
