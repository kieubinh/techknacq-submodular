        "Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) is a major NLP task, providing a shallow sentence-level semantic analysis.",
        "SRL aims at identifying the relations between the predicates (usually, verbs) in the sentence and their associated arguments.",
        "The SRL task is often viewed as consisting of two parts: argument identification (argid) and argument classification.",
        "The former aims at identifying the arguments of a given predicate present in the sentence, while the latter determines the type of relation that holds between the identified arguments and their corresponding predicates.",
        "The division into two subtasks is justified by the fact that they are best addressed using different feature sets (Pradhan et al., 2005).",
        "Performance in the argid stage is a serious bottleneck for general SRL performance, since only about 81% of the arguments are identified, while about 95% of the identified arguments are labeled correctly (Marquez et al., 2008).",
        "SRL is a complex task, which is reflected by the algorithms used to address it.",
        "A standard SRL algorithm requires thousands to dozens of thousands sentences annotated with POS tags, syntactic annotation and SRL annotation.",
        "Current algorithms show impressive results but only for languages and domains where plenty of annotated data is available, e.g., English newspaper texts (see Section 2).",
        "Results are markedly lower when testing is on a domain wider than the training one, even in English (see the WSJ-Brown results in (Pradhan et al., 2008)).",
        "Only a small number of works that do not require manually labeled SRL training data have been done (Swier and Stevenson, 2004; Swier and Stevenson, 2005; Grenager and Manning, 2006).",
        "These papers have replaced this data with the VerbNet (Kipper et al., 2000) lexical resource or a set of manually written rules and supervised parsers.",
        "A potential answer to the SRL training data bottleneck are unsupervised SRL models that require little to no manual effort for their training.",
        "Their output can be used either by itself, or as training material for modern supervised SRL algorithms.",
        "In this paper we present an algorithm for unsupervised argument identification.",
        "The only type of annotation required by our algorithm is POS tagging, which needs relatively little manual effort.",
        "The algorithm consists of two stages.",
        "As preprocessing, we use a fully unsupervised parser to parse each sentence.",
        "Initially, the set of possible arguments for a given verb consists of all the constituents in the parse tree that do not contain that predicate.",
        "The first stage of the algorithm attempts to detect the minimal clause in the sentence that contains the predicate in question.",
        "Using this information, it further reduces the possible arguments only to those contained in the minimal clause, and further prunes them according to their position in the parse tree.",
        "In the second stage we use pointwise mutual information to estimate the collocation strength between the arguments and the predicate, and use it to filter out instances of weakly collocating predicate argument pairs.",
        "We use two measures to evaluate the performance of our algorithm, precision and F-score.",
        "Precision reflects the algorithm's applicability for creating training data to be used by supervised SRL models, while the standard SRL F-score measures the model's performance when used by itself.",
        "The first stage of our algorithm is shown to outperform a strong baseline both in terms of F-score and of precision.",
        "The second stage is shown to increase precision while maintaining a reasonable recall.",
        "We evaluated our model on sections 2-21 of Propbank.",
        "As is customary in unsupervised parsing work (e.g. (Seginer, 2007)), we bounded sentence length by 10 (excluding punctuation).",
        "Our first stage obtained a precision of 52.8%, which is more than 6% improvement over the baseline.",
        "Our second stage improved precision to nearly 56%, a 9.3% improvement over the baseline.",
        "In addition, we carried out experiments on Spanish (on sentences of length bounded by 15, excluding punctuation), achieving an increase of over 7.5% in precision over the baseline.",
        "Our algorithm increases F-score as well, showing an 1.8% improvement over the baseline in English and a 2.2% improvement in Spanish.",
        "Section 2 reviews related work.",
        "In Section 3 we detail our algorithm.",

        "The advance of machine learning based approaches in this field owes to the usage of large scale annotated corpora.",
        "English is the most studied language, using the FrameNet (FN) (Baker et al., 1998) and PropBank (PB) (Palmer et al., 2005) resources.",
        "PB is a corpus well suited for evaluation, since it annotates every non-auxiliary verb in a real corpus (the WSJ sections of the Penn Treebank).",
        "PB is a standard corpus for SRL evaluation and was used in the CoNLL SRL shared tasks of 2004 (Carreras and Marquez, 2004) and 2005 (Carreras and Marquez, 2005).",
        "Most work on SRL has been supervised, requiring dozens of thousands of SRL annotated training sentences.",
        "In addition, most models assume that a syntactic representation of the sentence is given, commonly in the form of a parse tree, a dependency structure or a shallow parse.",
        "Obtaining these is quite costly in terms of required human annotation.",
        "The first work to tackle SRL as an independent task is (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), which presented a supervised model trained and evaluated on FrameNet.",
        "The CoNLL shared tasks of 2004 and 2005 were devoted to SRL, and studied the influence of different syntactic annotations and domain changes on SRL results.",
        "Computational Linguistics has recently published a special issue on the task (Marquez et al., 2008), which presents state-of-the-art results and surveys the latest achievements and challenges in the field.",
        "Most approaches to the task use a multilevel approach, separating the task to an argid and an argument classification sub-tasks.",
        "They then use the unlabeled argument structure (without the semantic roles) as training data for the argid stage and the entire data (perhaps with other features) for the classification stage.",
        "Better performance is achieved on the classification, where state-of-the-art supervised approaches achieve about 81% F-score on the in-domain identification task, of which about 95% are later labeled correctly (Marquez et al., 2008).",
        "There have been several exceptions to the standard architecture described in the last paragraph.",
        "One suggestion poses the problem of SRL as a sequential tagging of words, training an SVM classifier to determine for each word whether it is inside, outside or in the beginning of an argument (Hacioglu and Ward, 2003).",
        "Other works have integrated argument classification and identification into one step (Collobert and Weston, 2007), while others went further and combined the former two along with parsing into a single model (Musillo and Merlo, 2006).",
        "Work on less supervised methods has been scarce.",
        "Swier and Stevenson (2004) and Swier and Stevenson (2005) presented the first model that does not use an SRL annotated corpus.",
        "However, they utilize the extensive verb lexicon VerbNet, which lists the possible argument structures allowable for each verb, and supervised syntactic tools.",
        "Using VerbNet along with the output of a rule-based chunker (in 2004) and a supervised syntactic parser (in 2005), they spot instances in the corpus that are very similar to the syntactic patterns listed in VerbNet.",
        "They then use these as seed for a bootstrapping algorithm, which consequently identifies the verb arguments in the corpus and assigns their semantic roles.",
        "Another less supervised work is that of (Grenager and Manning, 2006), which presents a Bayesian network model for the argument structure of a sentence.",
        "They use EM to learn the model's parameters from unannotated data, and use this model to tag a test corpus.",
        "However, argid was not the task of that work, which dealt solely with argument classification.",
        "argid was performed by manually-created rules, requiring a supervised or manual syntactic annotation of the corpus to be annotated.",
        "The three works above are relevant but incomparable to our work, due to the extensive amount of supervision (namely, VerbNet and a rule-based or supervised syntactic system) they used, both in detecting the syntactic structure and in detecting the arguments.",
        "Work has been carried out in a few other languages besides English.",
        "Chinese has been studied in (Xue, 2008).",
        "Experiments on Catalan and Spanish were done in SemEval 2007 (Marquez et al., 2007) with two participating systems.",
        "Attempts to compile corpora for German (Burdchardt et al., 2006) and Arabic (Diab et al., 2008) are also underway.",
        "The small number of languages for which extensive SRL annotated data exists reflects the considerable human effort required for such endeavors.",
        "Some SRL works have tried to use unannotated data to improve the performance of a base supervised model.",
        "Methods used include bootstrapping approaches (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Kate and Mooney, 2007), where large unannotated corpora were tagged with SRL annotation, later to be used to retrain the SRL model.",
        "Another approach used similarity measures either between verbs (Gordon and Swanson, 2007) or between nouns (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002) to overcome lexical sparsity.",
        "These measures were estimated using statistics gathered from corpora augmenting the model's training data, and were then utilized to generalize across similar verbs or similar arguments.",
        "Attempts to substitute full constituency parsing by other sources of syntactic information have been carried out in the SRL community.",
        "Suggestions include posing SRL as a sequence labeling problem (Marquez et al., 2005) or as an edge tagging problem in a dependency representation (Ha-cioglu, 2004).",
        "Punyakanok et al.",
        "(2008) provide a detailed comparison between the impact of using shallow vs. full constituency syntactic information in an English SRL system.",
        "Their results clearly demonstrate the advantage ofusing full annotation.",
        "The identification of arguments has also been carried out in the context of automatic subcatego-rization frame acquisition.",
        "Notable examples include (Manning, 1993; Briscoe and Carroll, 1997; Korhonen, 2002) who all used statistical hypothesis testing to filter a parser's output for arguments, with the goal of compiling verb subcategorization lexicons.",
        "However, these works differ from ours as they attempt to characterize the behavior of a verb type, by collecting statistics from various instances of that verb, and not to determine which are the arguments of specific verb instances.",
        "The algorithm presented in this paper performs unsupervised clause detection as an intermediate step towards argument identification.",
        "Supervised clause detection was also tackled as a separate task, notably in the CoNLL 2001 shared task (Tjong Kim Sang and Dejean, 2001).",
        "Clause information has been applied to accelerating a syntactic parser (Glaysher and Moldovan, 2006)."

        "In this section we describe our algorithm.",
        "It consists of two stages, each of which reduces the set of argument candidates, which a-priori contains all consecutive sequences of words that do not contain the predicate in question.",
        "As pre-processing, we use an unsupervised parser that generates an unlabeled parse tree for each sentence (Seginer, 2007).",
        "This parser is unique in that it is able to induce a bracketing (unlabeled parsing) from raw text (without even using POS tags) achieving state-of-the-art results.",
        "Since our algorithm uses millions to tens of millions sentences, we must use very fast tools.",
        "The parser's high speed (thousands of words per second) enables us to process these large amounts of data.",
        "The only type of supervised annotation we use is POS tagging.",
        "We use the taggers MX-POST (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) for English and Tree-Tagger (Schmid, 1994) for Spanish, to obtain POS tags for our model.",
        "The first stage of our algorithm uses linguistically motivated considerations to reduce the set of possible arguments.",
        "It does so by confining the set of argument candidates only to those constituents which obey the following two restrictions.",
        "First, they should be contained in the minimal clause containing the predicate.",
        "Second, they should be k-th degree cousins of the predicate in the parse tree.",
        "We propose a novel algorithm for clause detection and use its output to determine which of the constituents obey these two restrictions.",
        "The second stage of the algorithm uses point-wise mutual information to rule out constituents that appear to be weakly collocating with the predicate in question.",
        "Since a predicate greatly restricts the type of arguments with which it may appear (this is often referred to as \"selectional restrictions\"), we expect it to have certain characteristic arguments with which it is likely to collocate.",
        "The main idea behind this stage is the observation that most of the arguments of a predicate are contained within the minimal clause that contains the predicate.",
        "We tested this on our development data - section 24 of the WSJ PTB, where we saw that 86% of the arguments that are also constituents (in the gold standard parse) were indeed contained in that minimal clause (as defined by the tree label types in the gold standard parse that denote a clause, e.g., s, sbar).",
        "Since we are not provided with clause annotation (or any label), we attempted to detect them in an unsupervised manner.",

        "In the \"Collocation Maximum Precision\" setting the parameters of the collocation stage (a and r) were generally tuned such that maximal precision is achieved while preserving a minimal recall level (40% for English, 20% for Spanish on the development data).",
        "In the \"Collocation Maximum F-score\" the collocation parameters were generally tuned such that the maximum possible F-score for the collocation algorithm is achieved.",
        "The best or close to best F-score is achieved when using the clause detection algorithm alone (59.14% for English, 23.34% for Spanish).",

        "The \"Collocation Maximum Precision\" achieves the best precision level (55.97% for English, 21.8% for Spanish) but at the expense of the largest recall loss.",
        "Still, it maintains a reasonable level of recall.",
        "The \"Collocation Maximum F-score\" is an example of a model that provides a precision improvement (over both the baseline and the clause detection stage) with a relatively small recall degradation.",
        "In the Spanish experiments its F-score (23.87%) is even a bit higher than that of the clause detection stage (23.34%).",
        "The full two-stage algorithm (clause detection + collocations) should thus be used when we intend to use the model's output as training data for supervised SRL engines or supervised argid algorithms.",
        "In our algorithm, the initial set of potential arguments consists of constituents in the Seginer parser's parse tree.",
        "Consequently the fraction of arguments that are also constituents (81.87% for English and 51.83% for Spanish) poses an upper bound on our algorithm's recall.",
        "Note that the recall of the All Cousins baseline is score emphasizes the baseline's strength, and justifies the restriction that the arguments should be k-th cousins of the predicate.",
        "The difference between these bounds for the two languages provides a partial explanation for the corresponding gap in the algorithm's performance.",
        "Figure 3 shows the precision of the collocation model (on development data) as a function of the amount of data it was given.",
        "We can see that the algorithm reaches saturation at about 5M sentences.",
        "It achieves this precision while maintaining a reasonable recall (an average recall of43.1% after saturation).",
        "The parameters of the collocation model were separately tuned for each corpus size, and the graph displays the maximum which was obtained for each of the corpus sizes.",
        "To better understand our model's performance, we performed experiments on the English corpus to test how well its first stage detects clauses.",
        "Clause detection is used by our algorithm as a step towards argument identification, but it can be of potential benefit for other purposes as well (see Section 2).",

        "Our model displayed an increase in precision of 9% in English and 8% in Spanish over a strong baseline.",
