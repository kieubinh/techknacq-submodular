        "Although supervised learning methods bring state-of-the-art outcome for dependency parser inferring (McDonald et al., 2005; Hall et al., 2007), a large enough data set is often required for specific parsing accuracy according to this type of methods.",
        "However, to annotate syntactic structure, either phrase-or dependency-based, is a costly job.",
        "Until now, the largest treebanks in various languages for syntax learning are with around one million words (or some other similar units).",
        "Limited data stand in the way of further performance enhancement.",
        "This is the case for each individual language at least.",
        "But, this is not the case as we observe all treebanks in different languages as a whole.",
        "For example, of ten treebanks for CoNLL-2007 shared task, none includes more than 500K",
        "The study is partially supported by City University of Hong Kong through the Strategic Research Grant 7002037 and 7002388.",
        "The first author is sponsored by a research fellowship from CTL, City University of Hong Kong.",
        "tokens, while the sum of tokens from all treebanks is about two million (Nivre et al., 2007).",
        "As different human languages or treebanks should share something common, this makes it possible to let dependency parsing in multiple languages be beneficial with each other.",
        "In this paper, we study how to improve dependency parsing by using (automatically) translated texts attached with transformed dependency information.",
        "As a case study, we consider how to enhance a Chinese dependency parser by using a translated English treebank.",
        "What our method relies on is not the close relation of the chosen language pair but the similarity of two treebanks, this is the most different from the previous work.",
        "Two main obstacles are supposed to confront in a cross-language dependency parsing task.",
        "The first is the cost of translation.",
        "Machine translation has been shown one of the most expensive language processing tasks, as a great deal of time and space is required to perform this task.",
        "In addition, a standard statistical machine translation method based on a parallel corpus will not work effectively if it is not able to find a parallel corpus that right covers source and target treebanks.",
        "However, dependency parsing focuses on the relations of word pairs, this allows us to use a dictionary-based translation without assuming a parallel corpus available, and the training stage of translation may be ignored and the decoding will be quite fast in this case.",
        "The second difficulty is that the outputs of translation are hardly qualified for the parsing purpose.",
        "The most challenge in this aspect is morphological preprocessing.",
        "We regard that the morphological issue should be handled aiming at the specific language, our solution here is to use character-level features for a target language like Chinese.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "The next section presents some related existing work.",
        "Section 3 describes the procedure on treebank translation and dependency transformation.",
        "Section 4 describes a dependency parser for Chinese as a baseline.",
        "Section 5 describes how a parser can be strengthened from the translated treebank.",
        "The experimental results are reported in Section 6.",
        "Section 7 looks into a few issues concerning the conditions that the proposed approach is suitable for.",

      "heading": "2. The Related Work",
      "text": [
        "As this work is about exploiting extra resources to enhance an existing parser, it is related to domain adaption for parsing that has been draw some interests in recent years.",
        "Typical domain adaptation tasks often assume annotated data in new domain absent or insufficient and a large scale unlabeled data available.",
        "As unlabeled data are concerned, semi-supervised or unsupervised methods will be naturally adopted.",
        "In previous works, two basic types of methods can be identified to enhance an existing parser from additional resources.",
        "The first is usually focus on exploiting automatic generated labeled data from the unlabeled data (Steedman",
        "Rappoport, 2007; Sagae and Tsujii, 2007; Chen et al., 2008), the second is on combining supervised and unsupervised methods, and only unla-beled data are considered (Smith and Eisner, 2006; Wang and Schuurmans, 2008; Koo et al., 2008).",
        "Our purpose in this study is to obtain a further performance enhancement by exploiting treebanks in other languages.",
        "This is similar to the above first type of methods, some assistant data should be automatically generated for the subsequent processing.",
        "The differences are what type of data are concerned with and how they are produced.",
        "In our method, a machine translation method is applied to tackle golden-standard treebank, while all the previous works focus on the unlabeled data.",
        "Although cross-language technique has been used in other natural language processing tasks, it is basically new for syntactic parsing as few works were concerned with this issue.",
        "The reason is straightforward, syntactic structure is too complicated to be properly translated and the cost of translation cannot be afforded in many cases.",
        "However, we empirically find this difficulty may be dramatically alleviated as dependencies rather than phrases are used for syntactic structure representation.",
        "Even the translation outputs are not so good as the expected, a dependency parser for the target language can effectively make use of them by only considering the most related information extracted from the translated text.",
        "The basic idea to support this work is to make use of the semantic connection between different languages.",
        "In this sense, it is related to the work of (Merlo et al., 2002) and (Burkett and Klein, 2008).",
        "The former showed that complementary information about English verbs can be extracted from their translations in a second language (Chinese) and the use of multilingual features improves classification performance of the English verbs.",
        "The latter iteratively trained a model to maximize the marginal likelihood of tree pairs, with alignments treated as latent variables, and then jointly parsing bilingual sentences in a translation pair.",
        "The proposed parser using features from monolingual and mutual constraints helped its log-linear model to achieve better performance for both monolingual parsers and machine translation system.",
        "In this work, cross-language features will be also adopted as the latter work.",
        "However, although it is not essentially different, we only focus on dependency parsing itself, while the parsing scheme in (Bur-kett and Klein, 2008) based on a constituent representation.",
        "Among of existing works that we are aware of, we regard that the most similar one to ours is (Ze-man and Resnik, 2008), who adapted a parser to a new language that is much poorer in linguistic resources than the source language.",
        "However, there are two main differences between their work and ours.",
        "The first is that they considered a pair of sufficiently related languages, Danish and Swedish, and made full use of the similar characteristics of two languages.",
        "Here we consider two quite different languages, English and Chinese.",
        "As fewer language properties are concerned, our approach holds the more possibility to be extended to other language pairs than theirs.",
        "The second is that a parallel corpus is required for their work and a strict statistical machine translation procedure was performed, while our approach holds a merit of simplicity as only a bilingual lexicon is required."

        "According to (McDonald and Nivre, 2007), all data-driven models for dependency parsing that have been proposed in recent years can be described as either graph-based or transition-based.",
