        "Sentence-final punctuation is typically placed outside a clause in this version ofTuBa-D/Z.",
        "Other Issues Other incorrect parses generated by the parser include problems with the infrequently occurring topological fields like LV and DM, inability to determine the boundary between MF and NF in clauses without a VC field separating the two, and misidentifying appositive constructions.",
        "Another issue is that although the parser output may disagree with the gold standard tree in TuBa-D/Z, the parser output may be a well-formed topological field parse for the same sentence with a different interpretation, for example because of attachment ambiguity.",
        "Each of the authors independently checked the fifty worst-scoring parses, and determined whether each parse produced by the Berkeley parser could be a well-formed topological parse.",
