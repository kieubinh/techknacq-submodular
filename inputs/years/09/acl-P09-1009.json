        "Multilingual learning has been successful for other linguistic induction tasks such as lexicon acquisition, morphological segmentation, and part-of-speech tagging (Genzel, 2005; Snyder and Barzilay, 2008; Snyder et al., 2008; Snyder et al., 2009).",
        "We focus here on the unsupervised induction of unlabeled constituency brackets.",
        "This task has been extensively studied in a monolingual setting and has proven to be difficult (Charniak and Carroll, 1992; Klein and Manning, 2002).",
        "The key premise of our approach is that ambiguous syntactic structures in one language may correspond to less uncertain structures in the other language.",
        "For instance, the English sentence I saw [the student [from MIT]] exhibits the classic problem of PP-attachment ambiguity.",
        "However, its Urdu translation, literally glossed as I [[MITof ] student] saw, uses a genitive phrase that may only be attached to the adjacent noun phrase.",
        "Knowing the correspondence between these sentences should help us resolve the English ambiguity.",
        "One of the main challenges of unsupervised multilingual learning is to exploit cross-lingual patterns discovered in data, while still allowing a wide range of language-specific idiosyncrasies.",
        "To this end, we adapt a formalism known as unordered tree alignment (Jiang et al., 1995) to a probabilistic setting.",
        "Under this formalism, any two trees can be embedded in an alignment tree.",
        "This alignment tree allows arbitrary parts of the two trees to diverge in structure, permitting language-specific grammatical structure to be preserved.",
        "Additionally, a computational advantage of this formalism is that the marginalized probability over all possible alignments for any two trees can be efficiently computed with a dynamic program in linear time.",
        "We formulate a generative Bayesian model which seeks to explain the observed parallel data through a combination of bilingual and monolingual parameters.",
        "Our model views each pair of sentences as having been generated as follows: First an alignment tree is drawn.",
        "Each node in this alignment tree contains either a solitary monolingual constituent or a pair of coupled bilingual constituents.",
        "For each solitary monolingual constituent, a sequence of part-of-speech tags is drawn from a language-specific distribution.",
        "For each pair of coupled bilingual constituents, a pair of part-of-speech sequences are drawn jointly from a cross-lingual distribution.",

        "Finally, parallel sentences are assembled from these generated part-of-speechse-quences and word-level alignments.",
        "To perform inference under this model, we use a Metropolis-Hastings within-Gibbs sampler.",

        "While PCFGs perform poorly on this task, the CCM model (Klein and Manning, 2002) has achieved large gains in performance and is among the state-of-the-art probabilistic models for unsupervised constituency parsing.",
        "We therefore use CCM as our basic model of monolingual syntax.",
        "While there has been some previous work on bilingual CFG parsing, it has mainly focused on improving MT systems rather than monolingual parsing accuracy.",
        "Research in this direction was pioneered by (Wu, 1997), who developed Inversion Transduction Grammars to capture cross-lingual grammar variations such as phrase re-orderings.",
        "More general formalisms for the same purpose were later developed (Wu and Wong, 1998; Chiang, 2005; Melamed, 2003; Eisner, 2003; Zhang and Gildea, 2005; Blunsom et al., 2008).",
        "We know of only one study which evaluates these bilingual grammar formalisms on the task of grammar induction itself (Smith and Smith, 2004).",
        "Both our model and even the monolingual CCM baseline yield far higher performance on the same Korean-English corpus.",
        "Our approach is closer to the unsupervised bilingual parsing model developed by Kuhn (2004), which aims to improve monolingual performance.",
        "Assuming that trees induced over parallel sentences have to exhibit certain structural regularities, Kuhn manually specifies a set of rules for determining when parsing decisions in the two languages are inconsistent with giza++ wordlevel alignments.",
        "By incorporating these constraints into the EM algorithm he was able to improve performance over a monolingual unsupervised PCFG.",
        "Still, the performance falls short of state-of-the-art monolingual models such as the",

        "More recently, there has been a body of work attempting to improve parsing performance by exploiting syntactically annotated parallel data.",
        "In one strand of this work, annotations are assumed only in a resource-rich language and are projected onto a resource-poor language using the parallel data (Hwa et al., 2005; Xi and Hwa, 2005).",
        "In another strand of work, syntactic annotations are assumed on both sides of the parallel data, and a model is trained to exploit the parallel data at test time as well (Smith and Smith, 2004; Burkett and Klein, 2008).",
        "In contrast to this work, our goal is to explore the benefits of multilingual grammar induction in a fully unsupervised setting.",
        "We finally note a recent paper which uses parameter tying to improve unsupervised dependency parse induction (Cohen and Smith, 2009).",
        "While the primary performance gains occur when tying related parameters within a language, some additional benefit is observed through bilingual tying, even in the absence of a parallel corpus."

        "We achieve this loose binding of trees by adapting unordered tree alignment (Jiang et al., 1995) to a probabilistic setting.",
        "Under this formalism, any two trees can be aligned using an alignment tree.",

        "The individual structure of each tree must be preserved under the embedding with the exception of sibling order (to allow variations in phrase and word order).",

        "Besides these yields, the contexts (two surrounding POS tags) of constituents and distituents are generated as well.",

        "Under our bilingual model, each pair of sentences is assumed to have been generated jointly in the following way: First, an unlabeled alignment tree is drawn uniformly from the set of all such trees.",

        "We could rewrite this by explicitly integrating over the yield, context, coupling, Giza-score parameters as well as the alignment trees.",

        "The samples form a Markov chain which is guaranteed to converge to the true joint distribution over all sentences.",
        "In the monolingual setting, there is a well-known tree sampling algorithm (Johnson et al., 2007).",
        "This algorithm proceeds in top-down fashion by sampling individual split points using the marginal probabilities of all possible subtrees.",
        "These marginals can be efficiently precomputed and form the \"inside\" table of the famous Inside-Outside algorithm.",
        "However, in our setting, trees come in pairs, and their joint probability crucially depends on their alignment.",
        "For the ith parallel sentence, we wish to jointly sample the pair of trees (T1,T2 )j together with their alignment Aj.",
        "To do so directly would involve simultaneously marginalizing over all possible subtrees as well as all possible alignments between such subtrees when sampling upper-level split points.",

        "We instead first sample the pair of trees (T1, T2)j from a simpler proposal distribution Q.",

        "This use of a tractable proposal distribution and acceptance ratio is known as the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and it preserves the convergence guarantee of the Gibbs sampler (Hastings, 1970).",
        "To compute the terms P(T*|T_j, A_j) and P(T|T – j, A_j) in the acceptance ratio above, we need to marginalize over all possible alignments between tree pairs.",
        "Fortunately, for any given pair of trees T1 and T2 this marginalization can be computed using a dynamic program in time O(|T1||T2|).",
        "Here we provide a very brief sketch.",
        "For every pair of nodes n1 e T1,n2 G T2, a table stores the marginal probability of the subtrees rooted at n1 and n2, respectively.",
        "A dynamic program builds this table from the bottom up: For each node pair n1, n2, we sum the probabilities of all local alignment configurations, each multiplied by the appropriate marginals already computed in the table for lower-level node pairs.",
        "This algorithm is an adaptation of the dynamic program presented in (Jiang et al., 1995) for finding minimum cost alignment trees (Fig.",
        "5 of that publication).",

        "Once the triple (T1, T2, A) has been sampled, we move on to the next parallel sentence.",
        "We avoid directly sampling parameter values, instead using the marginalized closed forms for multinomials with Dirichlet conjugate-priors using counts and hyperparameter pseudo-counts (Gelman et al., 2004).",
        "Note that in the case of yield pairs produced according to Distribution 1 (in step 4 of the generative process) conjugacy is technically broken, since the yield pairs are no longer produced by a single multinomial distribution.",
