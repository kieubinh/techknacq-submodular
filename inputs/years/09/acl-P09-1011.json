        "Recent work in learning semantics has focused on mapping sentences to meaning representations (e.g., some logical form) given aligned sentence/meaning pairs as training data (Ge and Mooney, 2005; Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005; Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2007; Lu et al., 2008).",
        "However, this degree of supervision is unrealistic for modeling human language acquisition and can be costly to obtain for building large-scale, broad-coverage language understanding systems.",
        "A more flexible direction is grounded language acquisition: learning the meaning of sentences in the context of an observed world state.",
        "The grounded approach has gained interest in various disciplines (Siskind, 1996; Yu and Ballard, 2004; Feldman and Narayanan, 2004; Gorniak and Roy, 2007).",
        "Some recent work in the NLP community has also moved in this direction by relaxing the amount of supervision to the setting where each sentence is paired with a small set of candidate meanings (Kate and Mooney, 2007; Chen and Mooney, 2008).",
        "The goal of this paper is to reduce the amount of supervision even further.",
        "We assume that we are given a world state represented by a set of records along with a text, an unsegmented sequence of words.",
        "For example, in the weather forecast domain (Section 2.2), the text is the weather report, and the records provide a structured representation of the temperature, sky conditions, etc.",
        "In this less restricted data setting, we must resolve multiple ambiguities: (1) the segmentation of the text into utterances; (2) the identification of relevant facts, i.e., the choice of records and aspects of those records; and (3) the alignment of utterances to facts (facts are the meaning representations of the utterances).",
        "Furthermore, in some of our examples, much of the world state is not referenced at all in the text, and, conversely, the text references things which are not represented in our world state.",
        "This increased amount ofambigu-ity and noise presents serious challenges for learning.",
        "To cope with these challenges, we propose a probabilistic generative model that treats text segmentation, fact identification, and alignment in a single unified framework.",
        "The parameters of this hierarchical hidden semi-Markov model can be estimated efficiently using EM.",
        "We tested our model on the task of aligning text to records in three different domains.",
        "The first domain is Robocup sportscasting (Chen and",
        "Mooney, 2008).",
        "Their best approach (KRISPER) obtains 67% Fi; our method achieves 76.5%.",
        "This domain is simplified in that the segmentation is known.",
        "The second domain is weather forecasts, for which we created a new dataset.",
        "Here, the full complexity of joint segmentation and alignment arises.",
        "Nonetheless, we were able to obtain reasonable results on this task.",
        "The third domain we considered is NFL recaps (Barzilay and Lapata, 2005; Snyder and Barzilay, 2007).",
        "The language used in this domain is richer by orders of magnitude, and much of it does not reference the world state.",
        "Nonetheless, taking the first unsupervised approach to this problem, we were able to make substantial progress: We achieve an Fi of 53.2%, which closes over half of the gap between a heuristic baseline (26%) and supervised systems (68%-80%).",
        "Table 1: Statistics for the three datasets.",
        "We report average values across all scenarios in the dataset: | w| is the number of words in the text, |T| is the number of record types, |s| is the number of records, and |A| is the number of gold alignments."

        "The text is simply a sequence of words w = (w1,..., W|w|).",
        "We represent the world state s as a set of records, where each record r e s is described by a record type r.t e T and a tuple of field values r.v = (r.v1,..., r.vm)} For example, temperature is a record type in the weather domain, and it has four fields: time, min, mean, and max",
        "The record type r.t e T specifies the field type r.tf e {int, str, cat} of each field value r.Vf, f = 1,... ,m. There are three possible field types – integer (int), string (str), and categorical (cat) – which are assumed to be known and fixed.",
        "Integer fields represent numeric properties of the world such as temperature, string fields represent surface-level identifiers such as names of people, and categorical fields represent discrete concepts such as score types in football (touchdown, field goal, and safety).",
        "The field type determines the way we expect the field value to be rendered in words: integer fields can be numerically perturbed, string fields can be spliced, and categorical fields are represented by open-ended word distributions, which are to be learned.",
        "See Section 3.3 for details.",
        "In this domain, a Robocup simulator generates the state of a soccer game, which is represented by a set of event records.",
        "For example, the record pass(arg1=pink1,arg2=pink5) denotes a passing event; this type of record has two fields: argl (the actor) and arg2 (the recipient).",
        "As the game is progressing, humans interject commentaries about notable events in the game, e.g.,pink1 passes back to pink5 near the middle of the field.",
        "All of the fields in this domain are categorical, which means there is no a priori association between the field value pinkl and the word pink1.",
        "This degree of flexibility is desirable because pink1 is sometimes referred to as pink goalie, a mapping which does not arise from string operations but must instead be learned.",
        "We used the dataset created by Chen and Mooney (2008), which contains 1919 scenarios from the 2001-2004 Robocup finals.",
        "Each scenario consists of a single sentence representing a fragment of a commentary on the game, paired with a set of candidate records.",
        "In the annotation, each sentence corresponds to at most one record (possibly one not in the candidate set, in which case we automatically get that sentence wrong).",
        "See Figure 1(a) for an example and Table 1 for summary statistics on the dataset.",
        "In this domain, the world state contains detailed information about a local weather forecast and the text is a short forecast report (see Figure 1(b) for an example).",
        "To create the dataset, we collected local weather forecasts for 3,753 cities in the US (those with population at least 10,000) over three days (February 7-9, 2009) from www.weather.gov.",
        "For each city and date, we created two scenarios, one for the day forecast and one for the night forecast.",
        "The forecasts consist of hour-by-hour measurements of temperature, wind speed, sky cover, chance of rain, etc., which represent the underlying world state.",
        "This world state is summarized by records which aggregate measurements over selected time intervals.",
        "For example, one of the records states the minimum, average, and maximum temperature from 5pm to 6am.",
        "This aggregation process produced 22,146 scenarios, each containing |s| = 36 multi-field records.",
        "There are 12 record types, each consisting of only integer and categorical fields.",
        "To annotate the data, we split the text by punctuation into lines and labeled each line with the records to which the line refers.",
        "These lines are used only for evaluation and are not part of the model (see Section 5.1 for further discussion).",
        "The weather domain is more complex than the Robocup domain in several ways: The text w is longer, there are more candidate records, and most notably, w references multiple records (5.8 on av-",

        "For example, in the NFL domain, 70% of scoring records are mentioned whereas only 1% of punting records are mentioned.",

        "For example, in the weather domain, the sky conditions are generally mentioned first, followed by temperature, and then wind speed.",
        "To capture these two phenomena, we define a Markov model on the record types (and given the record type, a record is chosen uniformly from the set of records with that type):",

        "Equipped with the ability to prefer a coherent field sequence, Model 3 fixes these errors.",
        "Many of the remaining errors are due to the garbage collection phenomenon familiar from word alignment models (Moore, 2004; Liang et al., 2006).",
        "For example, the ballstopped record occurs frequently but is never mentioned in the text.",
        "At the same time, there is a correlation between ballstopped and utterances such as pink2 holds onto the ball, which are not aligned to any record in the annotation.",
