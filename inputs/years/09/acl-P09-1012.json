        "For example, proper nouns such as \"United Kingdom\" or idiomatic phrases such as \"with respect to\" actually function as a single word, and we often condense them into the virtual words \"UK\" and \"w.r.t\".",
        "In order to extract \"words\" from text streams, unsupervised word segmentation is an important research area because the criteria for creating supervised training data could be arbitrary, and will be suboptimal for applications that rely on segmentations.",

        "However, they are still naive with respect to word spellings, and the inference is very slow owing to inefficient Gibbs sampling.",
        "Crucially, since they rely on sampling a word boundary between two neighboring words, they can leverage only up to bigram word dependencies.",
        "In this paper, we extend this work to propose a more efficient and accurate unsupervised word segmentation that will optimize the performance of the word n-gram Pitman-Yor (i.e. Bayesian Kneser-Ney) language model, with an accurate character oo-gram Pitman-Yor spelling model embedded in word models.",

        "The Pitman-Yor (PY) process is a stochastic process that generates discrete probability distribution G that is similar to another distribution Go, called a base measure.",

        "Therefore, we can generate G2 from a PY process of base measure G1, as G2 – PY(G1, d, 6).",
        "Similarly, trigram distribution G3 = {p(-|v'v) } given an additional word v' is generated as G3 – PY(G2,d, 6), and G1 ,G2,G3 will form a tree structure shown in Figure 1(a).",
        "In practice, we cannot observe G directly because it will be infinite dimensional distribution over the possible words, as we shall see in this paper.",
        "However, when we integrate out G it is known that Figure 1(a) can be represented by an equivalent hierarchical Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP) (Aldous, 1985) as in Figure 1(b).",

        "If a lexicon is finite, we can use a uniform prior G0(w) = 1/\\V \\ for every word w in lexicon V. However, with word segmentation every substring could be a word, thus the lexicon is not limited but will be countably infinite.",
        "Building an accurate G0 is crucial for word segmentation, since it determines how the possible words will look like.",
        "Previous work using a Dirichlet process used a relatively simple prior for G0, namely an uniform distribution over characters (Goldwater et al., 2006), or a prior solely dependent on word length with a Poisson distribution whose parameter is fixed by hand (Xu et al., 2008).",

        "In this paper, we proposed a much more efficient and accurate model for fully unsupervised word segmentation.",
        "With a combination of dynamic programming and an accurate spelling model from a Bayesian perspective, our model significantly outperforms the previous reported results, and the inference is very efficient.",
        "This model is also considered as a way to build a Bayesian Kneser-Ney smoothed word n-gram language model directly from characters with no \"word\" indications.",
        "In fact, it achieves lower perplexity per character than that based on supervised segmentations.",
        "We believe this will be particularly beneficial to build a language model on such texts as speech transcripts, colloquial texts or unknown languages, where word boundaries are hard or even impossible to identify a priori."
