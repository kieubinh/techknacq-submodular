        "However, for the purpose of comparison of corpora of different sizes or linguistic phenomena based on samples of different sizes it is imperative that these quantities be compared based on similar sample sizes.",

        "However, we note that the distribution of On is unaffected if one relabels the words in Qn.",
        "This motivates studying of the probabilities assigned by Pn without reference to the labeling of the word; this is done in (Khmaladze and Chitashvili, 1989) via the structural distribution function and in (Wagner et al., 2006) via the shadow.",
