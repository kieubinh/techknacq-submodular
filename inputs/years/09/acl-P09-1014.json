        "In many languages, certain syllables in words are phonetically more prominent in terms of duration, pitch, and loudness.",
        "This phenomenon is referred to as lexical stress.",
        "In some languages, the location of stress is entirely predictable.",
        "For example, lexical stress regularly falls on the initial syllable in Hungarian, and on the penultimate syllable in Polish.",
        "In other languages, such as English and Russian, any syllable in the word can be stressed.",
        "Correct stress placement is important in text-to-speech systems because it affects the accuracy of human word recognition (Tagliapietra and Ta-bossi, 2005; Arciuli and Cupples, 2006).",
        "However, the issue has often been ignored in previous letter-to-phoneme (L2P) systems.",
        "The systems that do generate stress markers often do not report separate figures on stress prediction accuracy, or they only provide results on a single language.",
        "Some only predict primary stress markers (Black et al., 1998; Webster, 2004; Demberg et al., 2007), while those that predict both primary and secondary stress generally achieve lower accuracy (Bagshaw, 1998; Coleman, 2000; Pearson et al., 2000).",
        "In this paper, we formulate stress assignment as a sequence prediction problem.",
        "We divide each word into a sequence of substrings, and use these substrings as features for a Support Vector Machine (SVM) ranker.",
        "For a given sequence length, there is typically only a small number of stress patterns in use.",
        "The task of the SVM is to rank the true stress pattern above the small number of acceptable alternatives.",
        "This is the first system to predict stress within a powerful discriminative learning framework.",
        "By using a ranking approach, we enable the use of arbitrary features over the entire (input) sequence and (output) stress pattern.",
        "We show that the addition of a feature for the entire output sequence improves prediction accuracy.",
        "Our experiments on English, German, and Dutch demonstrate that our ranking approach substantially outperforms previous systems.",
        "The SVM ranker achieves exceptional 96.2% word accuracy on the challenging task of predicting the full stress pattern in English.",

      "heading": "2. Background and Task Definition",
      "text": [
        "There is a long history of research into the principles governing lexical stress placement.",
        "Zipf (1929) showed that stressed syllables are often those with low frequency in speech, while unstressed syllables are usually very common.",
        "Chomsky and Halle (1968) proposed a set of context-sensitive rules for producing English stress from underlying word forms.",
        "Due to its importance in text-to-speech, there is also a long history of computational stress prediction systems (Fudge, 1984; Church, 1985; Williams, 1987).",
        "While these early approaches depend on human definitions of vowel tensity, syllable weight, word etymology, etc., our work follows a recent trend of purely data-driven approaches to stress prediction (Black et al., 1998; Pearson et al., 2000; Webster, 2004; Demberg et al., 2007).",
        "In many languages, only two levels of stress are distinguished: stressed and unstressed.",
        "However, some languages exhibit more than two levels of stress.",
        "For example, in the English word economic, the first and the third syllable are stressed, with the former receiving weaker emphasis than the latter.",
        "In this case, the initial syllable is said to carry a secondary stress.",
        "Although each word has only one primary stress, it may have any number of secondary stresses.",
        "Predicting the full stress pattern is therefore inherently more difficult than predicting the location of primary stress only.",
        "Our objective is to automatically assign primary and, where possible, secondary stress to out-of-vocabulary words.",
        "Stress is an attribute of syllables, but syllabification is a non-trivial task in itself (Bartlett et al., 2008).",
        "Rather than assuming correct syllabification of the input word, we instead follow Webster (2004) in placing the stress on the vowel which constitutes the nucleus of the stressed syllable.",
        "If the syllable boundaries are known, the mapping from the vowel to the corresponding syllable is straightforward.",
        "We investigate the assignment of stress to two related but different entities: the spoken word (represented by its phonetic transcription), and the written word (represented by its orthographic form).",
        "Although stress is a prosodic feature, assigning stress to written words (\"stressed orthography\") has been utilized as a preprocessing stage for the L2P task (Webster, 2004).",
        "This preprocessing is motivated by two factors.",
        "First, stress greatly influences the pronunciation of vowels in",
        "English (c.f., allow vs. alloy).",
        "Second, since phoneme predictors typically utilize only local context around a letter, they do not incorporate the global, long-range information that is especially predictive of stress, such as penultimate syllable emphasis associated with the suffix -ation.",
        "By taking stressed orthography as input, the L2P system is able to implicitly leverage morphological information beyond the local context.",
        "Indicating stress on letters can also be helpful to humans, especially second-language learners.",
        "In some languages, such as Spanish, orthographic markers are obligatory in words with irregular stress.",
        "The location of stress is often explicitly marked in textbooks for students of Russian.",
        "In both languages, the standard method of indicating stress is to place an acute accent above the vowel bearing primary stress, e.g., adios.",
        "The secondary stress in English can be indicated with a grave accent (Coleman, 2000), e.g.,precede.",
        "In summary, our task is to assign primary and secondary stress markers to stress-bearing vowels in an input word.",
        "The input word may be either phonemes or letters.",
        "If a stressed vowel is represented by more than one letter, we adopt the convention of marking the first vowel of the vowel sequence, e.g., meeting.",
        "In this way, we are able to focus on the task of stress prediction, without having to determine at the same time the exact syllable boundaries, or whether a vowel letter sequence represents one or more spoken vowels (e.g., beating vs. be-at-i-fy)."

        "Our stress assignment system maps a word, w, to a stressed-form of the word, w. We formulate stress assignment as a sequence prediction problem.",
        "The assignment is made in three stages:",
        "(1) First, we map words to substrings (s), the basic units in our sequence (Section 3.1).",
        "(2) Then, a particular stress pattern (t) is chosen for each substring sequence.",
        "We use a support vector machine (SVM) to rank the possible patterns for each sequence (Section 3.2).",
        "(3) Finally, the stress pattern is used to produce the stressed-form of the word (Section 3.3).",
        "Table 1 gives examples of words at each stage of the algorithm.",
        "We discuss each step in more detail.",
        "Table 1: The steps in our stress prediction system (with orthographic and phonetic prediction examples): (1) word splitting, (2) support vector ranking of stress patterns, and (3) pattern-to-vowel mapping.",
        "The first step in our approach is to represent the word as a sequence of N individual units: w – s = {s1-s2-...-sN}.",
        "These units are used to define the features and outputs used by the SVM ranker.",
        "Although we are ultimately interested in assigning stress to individual vowels in the phoneme and letter sequence, it is beneficial to represent the task in units larger than individual letters.",
        "Our substrings are similar to syllables; they have a vowel as their nucleus and include consonant context.",
        "By approximating syllables, our substring patterns will allow us to learn recurrent stress regularities, as well as dependencies between neighboring substrings.",
        "Since determining syllable breaks is a non-trivial task, we instead adopt the following simple splitting technique.",
        "Each vowel in the word forms the nucleus of a substring.",
        "Any single preceding or following consonant is added to the substring unit.",
        "Thus, each substring consists of at most three symbols (Table 1).",
        "Using shorter substrings reduces the sparsity of our training data; words like cryer, dryer and fryer are all mapped to the same form: ry-er.",
        "The SVM can thus generalize from observed words to similarly-spelled, unseen examples.",
        "Since the number of vowels equals the number of syllables in the phonetic form of the word, applying this approach to phonemes will always generate the correct number of syllables.",
        "For letters, splitting may result in a different number of units than the true syllabification, e.g., pronounce – ron-no-un-ce.",
        "This does not prevent the system from producing the correct stress assignment after the pattern-to-vowel mapping stage (Section 3.3) is complete.",
        "After creating a sequence of substring units, s = {si-s2-...-sN}, the next step is to choose an output sequence, t = {t1-t2-...-tN}, that encodes whether each unit is stressed or unstressed.",
        "We use the number '1' to indicate that a substring receives primary stress, '2' for secondary stress, and '0' to indicate no stress.",
        "We call this output sequence the stress pattern for a word.",
        "Table 1 gives examples of words, substrings, and stress patterns.",
        "We use supervised learning to train a system to predict the stress pattern.",
        "We generate training (s, t) pairs in the obvious way from our stress-marked training words, W. That is, we first extract the letter/phoneme portion, w, and use it to create the substrings, s. We then create the stress pattern, t, using w's stress markers.",
        "Given the training pairs, any sequence predictor can be used, for example a Conditional Random Field (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001) or a structured per-ceptron (Collins, 2002).",
        "However, we can take advantage of a unique property of our problem to use a more expressive framework than is typically used in sequence prediction.",
        "The key observation is that the output space of possible stress patterns is actually fairly limited.",
        "Clopper (2002) shows that people have strong preferences for particular sequences of stress, and this is confirmed by our training data (Section 4.1).",
        "In English, for example, we find that for each set of spoken words with the same number of syllables, there are no more than fifteen different stress patterns.",
        "In total, among 55K English training examples, there are only 70 different stress patterns.",
        "In both German and Dutch there are only about 50 patterns in 250K examples.",
        "Therefore, for a particular input sequence, we can safely limit our consideration to only the small set of output patterns of the same length.",
        "Thus, unlike typical sequence predictors, we do not have to search for the highest-scoring output according to our model.",
        "We can enumerate the full set of outputs and simply choose the highest-scoring one.",
        "This enables a more expressive representation.",
        "We can define arbitrary features over the entire output sequence.",

        "At test time we simply score each possible output pattern using the learned weights.",
        "That is, for an input sequence s of length N, we compute A • $(s, t) for all t e TN, and we take the highest scoring t as our output.",

        "In this section, we evaluate various methods of combining stress prediction with phoneme generation.",
        "We first describe the specific system that we use for letter-to-phoneme (L2P) conversion.",
        "We then discuss the different ways stress prediction can be integrated with L2P, and define the systems used in our experiments.",
        "Finally, we provide the results.",
        "We combine stress prediction with a state-of-the-art L2P system (Jiampojamarn et al., 2008).",
        "Like our stress ranker, their system is a data-driven sequence predictor that is trained with supervised learning.",
        "The score for each output sequence is a weighted combination of features.",
        "The feature weights are trained using the Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm (MIRA) (Crammer and Singer, 2003), a powerful online discriminative training framework.",
        "Like other recent L2P systems (Bisani and Ney, 2002; Marchand and Damper, 2007; Jiampojamarn et al., 2007), this approach does not generate stress, nor does it consider stress when it generates phonemes.",
        "For L2P experiments, we use the same training, testing, and development data as was used in Section 4.",
        "For all experiments, we use the development set to determine at which iteration to stop training in the online algorithm.",
        "Various methods have been used for combining stress and phoneme generation.",
        "Phonemes can be generated without regard to stress, with stress assigned as a post-process (Bagshaw, 1998; Cole-man, 2000).",
        "Both van den Bosch (1997) and Black et al.",
        "(1998) argue that stress should be predicted at the same time as phonemes.",
        "They expand the output set to distinguish between stressed and unstressed phonemes.",
        "Similarly, Demberg et al.",
        "(2007) produce phonemes, stress, and syllable-boundaries within a single joint n-gram model.",
        "Pearson et al.",
        "(2000) generate phonemes and stress together by jointly optimizing a decision-tree phoneme-generator and a stress predictor based on stress pattern counts.",
        "In contrast, Webster (2004) first assigns stress to letters, creating an expanded input set, and then predicts both phonemes and stress jointly.",
        "The system marks stress on letter vowels by determining the correspondence between affixes and stress in written words.",
        "Following the above approaches, we can expand the input or output symbols of our L2P system to include stress.",
        "However, since both decision tree systems and our L2P predictor utilize only local context, they may produce invalid global output.",
        "One option, used by Demberg et al.",
        "(2007), is to add a constraint to the output generation, requiring each output sequence to have exactly one primary stress.",
        "We enhance this constraint, based on the observation that the number of valid output sequences is fairly limited (Section 3.2).",
        "The modified system produces the highest-scoring sequence such that the output's corresponding stress pattern has been observed in our training data.",
        "We call this the stress pattern constraint.",
        "This is a tighter constraint than having only one primary stress.",
        "Another advantage is that it provides some guidance for the assignment of secondary stress.",
        "Inspired by the aforementioned strategies, we evaluate the following approaches:",
        "1) Joint: The L2P system's input sequence is letters, the output sequence is phonemes+stress.",
        "2) Joint+Constr: Same as Joint, except it selects the highest scoring output that obeys the stress pattern constraint.",
        "3) PostProcess: The L2P system's input is letters, the output is phonemes.",
        "It then applies the SVM stress ranker (Section 3) to the phonemes to produce the full phoneme+stress output.",
        "4) LetterStress: The L2P system's input is letters+stress, the output is phonemes+stress.",
        "It creates the stress-marked letters by applying the SVM ranker to the input letters as a pre-process.",
        "5) OracleStress: The same input/output as LetterStress, except it uses the goldstandard stress on letters (Section 4.1).",
        "Table 5: Combined phoneme and stress prediction word accuracy (%) for English, German, and Dutch.",
        "P: predicting primary stress only.",
        "P+S: primary and secondary.",
        "Note that while the first approach uses only local information to make predictions (features within a context window around the current letter), systems 2 to 5 leverage global information in some manner: systems 3 and 4 use the predictions of our stress ranker, while 2 uses a global stress pattern constraint.",
        "We also generated stress and phonemes using the popular Festival Speech Synthesis System(version 1.96, 2004) and report its accuracy.",
        "Word accuracy results for predicting both phonemes and stress are provided in Table 5.",
        "First of all, note that the Joint approach, which simply expands the output set, is 4%-8% worse than all other comparison systems across the three languages.",
        "These results clearly indicate the drawbacks of predicting stress using only local information.",
        "In English, both LetterStress and PostProcess perform best, while PostProcess and the constrained system are highest on German and Dutch.",
        "Results using the oracle letter stress show that given perfect stress assignment on letters, phonemes and stress can be predicted very accurately, in all cases above 91%.",
        "We also found that the phoneme prediction accuracy alone (i.e., without stress) is quite similar for all the systems.",
        "The gains over Joint on combined stress and phoneme accuracy are almost entirely due to more accurate stress assignment.",
        "utilizing the oracle stress on letters markedly improves phoneme prediction in English (from 88.8% to 91.4%).",
        "This can be explained by the fact that English vowels are often reduced to schwa when unstressed (Section 2).",
        "Predicting both phonemes and stress is a challenging task, and each of our globally-informed systems represents a major improvement over previous work.",
        "The accuracy of Festival is much lower even than our Joint approach, but the relative performance on the different languages is quite similar.",
        "A few papers report accuracy on the combined stress and phoneme prediction task.",
        "The most directly comparable work is van den Bosch (1997), which also predicts primary and secondary stress using English CELEX data.",
        "However, the reported word accuracy is only 62.1%.",
        "Three other papers report word accuracy on phonemes and stress, using different data sets.",

        "In the future, we will investigate additional features to leverage syllabic and morphological information, when available.",
