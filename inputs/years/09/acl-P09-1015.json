        "An accurate L2P converter is an important component of a text-to-speech system.",
        "In general, a lookup table does not suffice for L2P conversion, since out-of-vocabulary words (e.g., proper names) are inevitably encountered.",
        "This motivates the need for classification techniques that can predict the phonemes for an unseen word.",
        "Numerous studies have contributed to the development of increasingly accurate L2P systems (Black et al., 1998; Kienappel and Kneser, 2001; Bisani and Ney, 2002; Demberg et al., 2007; Jiampojamarn et al., 2008).",
        "A common assumption made in these works is that ample amounts of labelled data are available for training a classifier.",
        "Yet, in practice, this is the case for only a small number of languages.",
        "In order to train an L2P classifier for a new language, we must first annotate words in that language with their correct phoneme sequences.",
        "As annotation is expensive, we would like to minimize the amount of effort that is required to build an adequate training set.",
        "The objective of this work is not necessarily to achieve state-of-the-art performance when presented with large amounts of training data, but to outperform other approaches when training data is limited.",
        "This paper proposes a system for training an accurate L2P classifier while requiring as few annotated words as possible.",
        "We employ decision trees as our supervised learning method because of their transparency and flexibility.",
        "We incorporate context ordering into a decision tree learner that guides its tree-growing procedure towards generating more intuitive rules.",
        "A clustering over letters serves as a back-off model in cases where individual letter counts are unreliable.",
        "An active learning technique is employed to request the phonemes (labels) for the words that are expected to be the most informative.",
        "Finally, we apply a novel L2P alignment technique based on phonetic similarity, which results in impressive gains in accuracy without relying on any training data.",
        "Our empirical evaluation on several L2P datasets demonstrates that significant reductions in annotation effort are indeed possible in this domain.",
        "Individually, all four enhancements improve the accuracy of our decision tree learner.",
        "The combined system yields savings of up to 75% in the number of words that have to be labelled, and reductions of at least 52% are observed on all the datasets.",
        "This is achieved without any additional tuning for the various languages.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 explains how supervised learning for L2P conversion is carried out with decision trees, our classifier of choice.",

        "In this work, we employ a decision tree model to learn the mapping from words to phoneme sequences.",
        "Decision tree learners are attractive because they are relatively fast to train, require little or no parameter tuning, and the resulting classifier can be interpreted by the user.",
        "A number of prior studies have applied decision trees to L2P data and have reported good generalization accuracy (Andersen et al., 1996; Black et al., 1998; Kienappel and Kneser, 2001).",
        "Also, the widely-used Festival Speech Synthesis System (Taylor et al., 1998) relies on decision trees for L2P conversion.",
        "We adopt the standard approach of using the letter context as features.",
        "The decision tree predicts the phoneme for the focus letter based on the m letters that appear before and after it in the word (including the focus letter itself, and beginning/end of word markers, where applicable).",
        "The model predicts a phoneme independently for each letter in a given word.",
        "In order to keep our model simple and transparent, we do not explore the possibility of conditioning on adjacent (predicted) phonemes.",
        "Any improvement in accuracy resulting from the inclusion of phoneme features would also be realized by the baseline that we compare against, and thus would not materially influence our findings.",
        "We employ binary decision trees because they substantially outperformed nary trees in our preliminary experiments.",
        "In L2P, there are many unique values for each attribute, namely, the letters of a given alphabet.",
        "In a nary tree each decision node partitions the data into n subsets, one per letter, that are potentially sparse.",
        "By contrast, a binary tree creates one branch for the nominated letter, and one branch grouping the remaining letters into a single subset.",
        "In the forthcoming experiments, we use binary decision trees exclusively."

      "heading": "3. Context ordering",
      "text": [
        "In the L2P task, context letters that are adjacent to the focus letter tend to be more important than context letters that are further away.",
        "For example, the English letter c is usually pronounced as [s] if the following letter is e or i.",
        "The general tree-growing algorithm has no notion of the letter distance, but instead chooses the letters on the basis of their estimated information gain (Manning and Schütze, 1999).",
        "As a result, it will sometimes query a letter at position +3 (denoted for example, before examining the letters that are closer to the center of the context window.",
        "We propose to modify the tree-growing procedure to encourage the selection of letters near the focus letter before those at greater offsets are examined.",
        "In its strictest form, which resembles the \"dynamically expanding context\" search strategy of Davel and Barnard (2004), k can only be queried after l0,... have been queried.",
        "However, this approach seems overly rigid for L2P.",
        "In English, for example, l2 can directly influence the pronunciation of a vowel regardless of the value of li (c.f., the difference between rid and ride).",
        "Instead, we adopt a less intrusive strategy, which we refer to as \"context ordering,\" that biases the decision tree toward letters that are closer to the focus, but permits gaps when the information gain for a distant letter is relatively high.",
        "Specifically, the ordering constraint described above is still applied, but only to letters that have above-average information gain (where the average is calculated across all letters/attributes).",
        "This means that a letter with above-average gain that is eligible with respect to the ordering will take precedence over an ineligible letter that has an even higher gain.",
        "However, if all the eligible letters have below-average gain, the ineligible letter with the highest gain is selected irrespective of its position.",
        "Our only strict requirement is that the focus letter must always be queried first, unless its information gain is zero.",
        "Kienappel and Kneser (2001) also worked on improving decision tree performance for L2P, and devised tie-breaking rules in the event that the tree-growing procedure ranked two or more questions as being equally informative.",
        "In our experience with L2P datasets, exact ties are rare; our context ordering mechanism will have more opportunities to guide the tree-growing process.",
        "We expect this change to improve accuracy, especially when the amount of training data is very limited.",
        "By biasing the decision tree learner toward questions that are intuitively of greater utility, we make it less prone to overfitting on small data samples."

      "heading": "4. Clustering letters",
      "text": [
        "A decision tree trained on L2P data bases its phonetic predictions on the surrounding letter context.",
        "Yet, when making predictions for unseen words, contexts will inevitably be encountered that did not appear in the training data.",
        "Instead of relying solely on the particular letters that surround the focus letter, we postulate that the learner could achieve better generalization if it had access to information about the types of letters that appear before and after.",
        "That is, instead of treating letters as abstract symbols, we would like to encode knowledge of the similarity between certain letters as features.",
        "One way of achieving this goal is to group the letters into classes or clusters based on their contextual similarity.",
        "Then, when a prediction has to be made for an unseen (or low probability) letter sequence, the letter classes can provide additional information.",
        "Kienappel and Kneser (2001) report accuracy gains when applying letter clustering to the L2P task.",
        "However, their decision tree learner incorporates neighboring phoneme predictions, and employs a variety of different pruning strategies; the portion of the gains attributable to letter clustering are not evident.",
        "In addition to exploring the effect of letter clustering on a wider range of languages, we are particularly concerned with the impact that clustering has on decision tree performance when the training set is small.",
        "The addition of letter class features to the data may enable the active learner to better evaluate candidate words in the pool, and therefore make more informed selections.",
        "To group the letters into classes, we employ a hierarchical clustering algorithm (Brown et al., 1992).",
        "One advantage of inducing a hierarchy is that we need not commit to a particular level of granularity; in other words, we are not required to specify the number of classes beforehand, as is the case with some other clustering algorithms.",
        "The clustering algorithm is initialized by placing each letter in its own class, and then proceeds in a bottom-up manner.",
        "At each step, the pair of classes is merged that leads to the smallest loss in the average mutual information (Manning and Schütze, 1999) between adjacent classes.",
        "The merging process repeats until a single class remains that contains all the letters in the alphabet.",
        "Recall that in our problem setting we have access to a (presumably) large pool of unanno-tated words.",
        "The unigram and bigram frequencies required by the clustering algorithm are calculated from these words; hence, the letters can be grouped into classes prior to annotation.",
        "The letter classes only need to be computed once for a given language.",
        "We implemented a brute-force version of the algorithm that examines all the possible merges at each step, and generates a hierarchy within a few hours.",
        "However, when dealing with a larger number of unique tokens (e.g., when clustering words instead of letters), additional optimizations are needed in order to make the procedure tractable.",
        "The resulting hierarchy takes the form of a binary tree, where the root node/cluster contains all the letters, and each leaf contains a single letter.",
        "Hence, each letter can be represented by a bit string that describes the path from the root to its leaf.",
        "As an illustration, the clustering in Table 1 was automatically generated from the words in the English CMU Pronouncing Dictionary (Carnegie Mellon University, 1998).",
        "It is interesting to note that the first bit distinguishes vowels from consonants, meaning that these were the last two groups that were merged by the clustering algorithm.",
        "Note also that the beginning/end of word marker (#) is included in the hierarchy, and is the last character to be absorbed into a larger cluster.",
        "This indicates that # carries more information than most letters, as is to be expected, in light of its distinct status.",
        "We also experimented with a manually-constructed letter hierarchy, but observed no significant differences in accuracy vis-à-vis the automatic clustering.",

        "Words for which the prediction confidence is above a certain threshold are immediately added to the lexicon, while the remaining words must be verified (and corrected, if necessary) by a human annotator.",
        "The main drawback of such an approach lies in the risk of adding erroneous entries to the lexicon when the classifier is overly confident in a prediction.",

        "Their method slightly outperforms random selection, thereby establishing passive learning as a strong baseline.",
        "However, only a single Italian dataset was used, and the results do not necessarily generalize to other languages.",
        "In this paper, we propose to apply an active learning technique known as Query-by-Bagging (Abe and Mamitsuka, 1998).",
        "We consider a pool-based active learning setting, whereby the learner has access to a pool of unlabelled examples (words), and may obtain labels (phoneme sequences) at a cost.",

        "Once labelled, these examples are added to the training set, the classifier is re-trained, and the process repeats until some stopping criterion is met (e.g., annotation resources are exhausted).",
        "Query-by-Bagging (QBB) is an instance of the Query-by-Committee algorithm (Freund et al., 1997), which selects examples that have high classification variance.",
        "At each iteration, QBB employs the bagging procedure (Breiman, 1996) to create a committee of classifiers C. Given a training set T containing k examples (in our setting, k is the total number of letters that have been labelled), bagging creates each committee member by sampling k times from T (with replacement), and then training a classifier C on the resulting data.",

        "Our expectation was that context ordering would be particularly helpful during the early rounds of active learning, when there is a greater risk of overfitting on the small training sets.",
        "For some languages (notably, German and Spanish) this was indeed the case; yet, for Dutch, context ordering became more effective as the training set increased in size.",
        "It should be noted that our context ordering strategy is sufficiently general that it can be implemented in other decision tree learners that grow binary trees, such as Wagon/CART (Taylor et al., 1998).",
        "An nary implementation is also feasible, although we have not tried this variation.",
        "As can be seen in Figure 1b, clustering letters into classes tended to produce a steady increase in accuracy.",
        "The only case where it had no statistically significant effect was on English.",
        "Another benefit of clustering is that it reduces variance.",
        "The confidence intervals are generally wider when clustering is disabled, meaning that the system's performance was less sensitive to changes in the initial training set when letter classes were used.",
        "On five of the six datasets, Query-by-Bagging required significantly fewer labelled examples to reach the maximum level of performance achieved by the passive learner (see Figure 1c).",
        "For instance, on the Spanish dataset, random sampling reached 97% word accuracy after 1420 words had been annotated, whereas QBB did so with only 510 words – a 64% reduction in labelling effort.",
        "Similarly, savings ranging from 30% to 63% were observed for the other languages, with the exception of English, where a statistically insignificant 4% reduction was recorded.",
        "Since English is highly irregular in comparison with the other five languages, the active learner tends to query examples that are difficult to classify, but which are unhelpful in terms of generalization.",
        "It is important to note that empirical comparisons of different active learning techniques have shown that random sampling establishes a very strong baseline on some datasets (Schein and Ungar, 2007; Settles and Craven, 2008).",
        "It is rarely the case that a given active learning strategy is able to unanimously outperform random sampling across a range of datasets.",
        "From this perspective, to achieve statistically significant improvements on five of six L2P datasets (without ever being beaten by random) is an excellent result for QBB.",
        "The ALINE method for L2P alignment outperformed EM on all six datasets (see Figure 1d).",
        "As was mentioned in Section 6, the EM aligner depends on all the available training data, whereas ALINE processes words individually.",
        "Only on Spanish and Italian, languages which have highly regular spelling systems, was the EM aligner competitive with ALINE.",
        "The accuracy gains on the remaining four datasets are remarkable, considering that better alignments do not necessarily translate into improved classification.",
        "We hypothesized that EM's inferior performance was due to the limited quantities of data that were available in the early stages of active learning.",
        "In a follow-up experiment, we allowed EM to align the entire learning set in advance, and these aligned entries were revealed when requested by the learner.",
        "We compared this with the usual procedure whereby EM is applied to the labelled training data at each iteration of learning.",
        "The learning curves (not shown) were virtually indistinguishable, and there were no statistically significant differences on any of the languages.",
        "EM appears to produce poor alignments regardless of the amount of available data.",
        "The complete system consists of context ordering, clustering, Query-by-Bagging, and ALINE; the baseline represents random sampling with EM alignment and no additional enhancements.",
        "Figure 2 plots the word accuracies for all six datasets.",
        "Although the absolute word accuracies varied considerably across the different languages, our system significantly outperformed the baseline in every instance.",
        "On the French dataset, for example, the baseline labelled 1850 words before reaching its maximum accuracy of 64%, whereas the complete system required only 480 queries to reach 64% accuracy.",
        "This represents a reduction of 74% in the labelling effort.",
        "The savings for the other languages are: Spanish, 75%; Dutch, 68%;",
        "Interestingly, the savings are the highest on Spanish, even though the corresponding accuracy gains are the smallest.",
        "This demonstrates that our approach is also effective on languages with relatively transparent orthography.",
        "At first glance, the performance of both systems appears to be rather poor on the English dataset.",
        "To put our results into perspective, Black et al.",
        "(1998) report 57.8% accuracy on this dataset with a similar alignment method and decision tree learner.",
        "Our baseline system achieves 57.3% accuracy when 90,000 words have been labelled.",
        "Hence, the low values in Figure 2 simply reflect the fact that many more examples are required to learn an accurate classifier for the English data.",
        "9 Conclusions",
        "We have presented a system for learning a letter-to-phoneme classifier that combines four distinct enhancements in order to minimize the amount of data that must be annotated.",
        "Our experiments involving datasets from several languages clearly demonstrate that unlabelled data can be used more efficiently, resulting in greater accuracy for a given training set size, without any additional tuning for the different languages.",
        "The experiments also show that a phonetically-based aligner may be preferable to the widely-used EM alignment technique, a discovery that could lead to the improvement of L2P accuracy in general.",
        "While this work represents an important step in reducing the cost of constructing an L2P training set, we intend to explore other active learners and classiication algorithms, including sequence labelling strategies (Settles and Craven, 2008).",
        "We also plan to incorporate user-centric enhancements (Davel and Barnard, 2004; Culotta and Mc-Callum, 2005) with the aim of reducing both the effort and expertise that is required to annotate words with their phoneme sequences."
