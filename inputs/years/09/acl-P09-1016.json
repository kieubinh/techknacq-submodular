        "A number of transliteration studies have touched on the alignment issue as a part of the transliteration modeling process, where alignment is needed at levels of graphemes and phonemes.",
        "In their seminal paper Knight and Graehl (1998) described a transliteration approach that transfers the grapheme representation of a word via the phonetic representation, which is known as phoneme-based transliteration technique (Virga and Khu-danpur, 2003; Meng et al., 2001; lung et al., 2000; Gao et al., 2004).",
        "Another technique is to directly transfer the grapheme, known as direct orthographic mapping, that was shown to be simple and effective (Li et al., 2004).",
        "Some other approaches that use both source graphemes and phonemes were also reported with good performance (Oh and Choi, 2002; Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002; Bilac and Tanaka, 2004).",
        "To align a bilingual training corpus, some take a phonological approach, in which the crafted mapping rules encode the prior linguistic knowledge about the source and target languages directly into the system (Wan and Verspoor, 1998; Meng et al., 2001; liang et al., 2007; Xu et al., 2006).",
        "Others adopt a statistical approach, in which the affinity between phonemes or graphemes is learned from the corpus (Gao et al., 2004; Abdullaleel and Larkey, 2003; Virga and Khudanpur, 2003).",
        "In the phoneme-based technique where an intermediate level of phonetic representation is used as the pivot, alignment between graphemes and phonemes of the source and target words is needed (Oh and Choi, 2005).",
        "If source and target languages have different phoneme sets, alignment between the the different phonemes is also required (Knight and Graehl, 1998).",
        "Although the direct orthographic mapping approach advocates a direct transfer of grapheme at run-time, we still need to establish the grapheme correspondence at the model training stage, when phoneme level alignment can help.",
        "It is apparent that the quality of transliteration alignment of a training corpus has a significant impact on the resulting transliteration model and its performance.",
        "Although there are many studies of evaluation metrics of word alignment for MT (Lambert, 2008), there has been much less reported work on evaluation metrics of transliteration alignment.",
        "In MT, the quality of training corpus alignment A is often measured relatively to the gold standard, or the ground truth alignment Q, which is a manual alignment of the corpus or a part of it.",
        "Three evaluation metrics are used: precision, recall, and F-score, the latter being a function of the former two.",
        "They indicate how close the alignment under investigation is to the gold standard alignment (Mihalcea and Pedersen, 2003).",
        "Denoting the number of cross-lingual mappings that are common in both A and Q as Cag, the number of cross-lingual mappings in A as Ca and the number of cross-lingual mappings in Q as Cq, precision Pr is given as CagICa, recall Rc as Cag/Cg and F-score as 2Pr ■ Rc/(Pr + Rc).",
        "Note that these metrics hinge on the availability of the gold standard, which is often not available.",
        "In this paper we propose a novel evaluation metric for transliteration alignment grounded on the information theory.",
        "One important property of this metric is that it does not require a gold standard alignment as a reference.",
        "We will also show that how this metric is used in generative transliteration modeling and transliteration validation."

        "The minimum distance achieved is then given by where j = 9{i) is the correspondence between the source and target graphemes.",
        "The alignment can be performed via the Expectation-Maximization (EM) by starting with a random initial alignment and calculating the affinity matrix count (ei, Cj) over the whole parallel corpus, where element (i,j) is the number of times character e» was aligned to Cj.",

        "We run one iteration of alignment over LDC05 (both genuine and false) with the distance function d(ei, cpk) derived from the affinity matrix of one aligned Xinhua training set.",
        "In this way, each transliteration pair in LDC05 provides an alignment distance.",
        "One can expect that a genuine transliteration pair typically aligns well, leading to a low distance, while a false transliteration pair will do otherwise.",

        "In this way, each pre-set threshold will present two types of errors, a false alarm and a miss-detect rate.",
        "A common way to present such results is via the detection error tradeoff (DET) curves, which show all possible decision points, and the equal error rate (EER), when false alarm and miss-detect rates are equal.",

        "To avoid cluttering Figure 9b, we show the DET curves for alignments 1, 2 and 5 only.",

        "We conclude that the alignment entropy is a reliable indicator of the alignment quality, as confirmed by our experiments on both Xinhua and LDC corpora.",
        "Alignment entropy does not require the gold standard reference, it thus can be used to evaluate alignments of large transliteration corpora and is possibly to give more reliable estimate of alignment quality than the F-score metric as shown in our transliteration experiment.",
        "The alignment quality of training corpus has a significant impact on the transliteration models.",
        "We achieve the highest MRR of 0.773 on Xinhua corpus with phonological alignment technique, which represents a significant performance gain over other reported results.",
        "Phonological alignment outperforms affinity alignment on clean database.",
        "We propose using alignment distance to validate transliterations.",
        "A high quality alignment on a small verified corpus such as Xinhua can be effectively used to validate a large noisy corpus, such as LDC05.",
