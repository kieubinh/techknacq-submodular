        "Current statistical machine translation (SMT) systems rely on large parallel and monolingual training corpora to produce translations of relatively higher quality.",
        "Unfortunately, large quantities of parallel data are not readily available for some languages pairs, therefore limiting the potential use of current SMT systems.",
        "In particular, for speech translation, the translation task often focuses on a specific domain such as the travel domain.",
        "It is especially difficult to obtain such a domain-specific corpus for some language pairs such as Chinese to Spanish translation.",
        "To circumvent the data bottleneck, some researchers have investigated to use a pivot language approach (Cohn and Lapata, 2007; Utiyama and Isahara, 2007; Wu and Wang 2007; Bertoldi et al., 2008).",
        "This approach introduces a third language, named the pivot language, for which there exist large source-pivot and pivot-target bilingual corpora.",
        "A pivot task was also designed for spoken language translation in the evaluation campaign of as a pivot language for Chinese to Spanish translation.",
        "Three different pivot strategies have been investigated in the literature.",
        "The first is based on phrase table multiplication (Cohn and Lapcorresponding translation probabilities and lexical weights in source-pivot and pivot-target translation models to induce a new source-target phrase table.",
        "We name it the triangulation method.",
        "The second is the sentence translation strategy, which first translates the source sentence to the pivot sentence, and then to the target sentence (Utiyama and the transfer method.",
        "The third is to use existing models to build a synthetic source-target corpus, from which a source-target model can be trained (Bertoldi et al., 2008).",
        "For example, we can obtain a source-pivot corpus by translating the pivot sentence in the source-pivot corpus into the target language with pivot-target translation models.",
        "We name it the synthetic method.",
        "The working condition with the pivot language approach is that the source-pivot and pivot-target parallel corpora are independent, in the sense that they are not derived from the same set of sentences, namely independently sourced corpora.",
        "Thus, some linguistic phenomena in the source-pivot corpus will lost if they do not exist in the pivot-target corpus, and vice versa.",
        "In order to fill up this data gap, we make use of rule-based machine translation (RBMT) systems to translate the pivot sentences in the source-pivot or pivot-target corpus into target or source sentences.",
        "As a result, we can build a synthetic multilingual corpus, which can be used to improve the translation quality.",
        "The idea of using RBMT systems to improve the translation quality of SMT sysems has been explored in Hu et al.",
        "(2007).",
        "Here, we re-examine the hybrid method to fill up the data gap for pivot translation.",
        "Although previous studies proposed several pivot translation methods, there are no studies to combine different pivot methods for translation quality improvement.",
        "In this paper, we first compare the individual pivot methods and then investigate to improve pivot translation quality by combining the outputs produced by different systems.",
        "We propose to regard system combination as a translation evaluation problem.",
        "For translations from one of the systems, this method uses the outputs from other translation systems as pseudo references.",
        "A regression learning method is used to infer a function that maps a feature vector (which measures the similarity of a translation to the pseudo references) to a score that indicates the quality of the translation.",
        "Scores are first generated independently for each translation, then the translations are ranked by their respective scores.",
        "The candidate with the highest score is selected as the final translation.",
        "This is achieved by optimizing the regression learning model's output to correlate against a set of training examples, where the source sentences are provided with several reference translations, instead of manually labeling the translations produced by various systems with quantitative assessments as described in (Albrecht and Hwa, 2007; Duh, 2008).",
        "The advantage of our method is that we do not need to manually label the translations produced by each translation system, therefore enabling our method suitable for translation selection among any systems without additional manual work.",
        "We conducted experiments for spoken language translation on the pivot task in the IWSLT 2008 evaluation campaign, where Chinese sentences in travel domain need to be translated into Spanish, with English as the pivot language.",
        "Experimental results show that (1) the performances of the three pivot methods are comparable when only SMT systems are used.",
        "However, the triangulation method and the transfer method significantly outperform the synthetic method when RBMT systems are used to improve the translation quality; (2) The hybrid method combining SMT and RBMT system for pivot translation greatly improves the translation quality.",
        "And this translation quality is higher than that of those produced by the system trained with a real Chinese-Spanish corpus; (3) Our sentence-level translation selection method consistently and significantly improves the translation quality over individual translation outputs in all of our experiments.",
