        "Recently syntax-based statistical machine translation (SMT) methods have achieved very promising results and attracted more and more interests in the SMT research community.",
        "Fundamentally, syntax-based SMT views translation as a structural transformation process.",
        "Therefore, structure divergence and parse errors are two of the major issues that may largely compromise the performance of syntax-based SMT (Zhang et al., 2008a; Mi et al., 2008).",
        "Many solutions have been proposed to address the above two issues.",
        "Among these advances, forest-based modeling (Mi et al., 2008; Mi and Huang, 2008) and tree sequence-based modeling (Liu et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2008a) are two interesting modeling methods with promising results reported.",
        "Forest-based modeling aims to improve translation accuracy through digging the potential better parses from Â«-bests (i.e. forest) while tree sequence-based modeling aims to model non-syntactic translations with structured syntactic knowledge.",
        "In nature, the two methods would be complementary to each other since they manage to solve the negative impacts of monolingual parse errors and cross-lingual structure divergence on translation results from different viewpoints.",
        "Therefore, one natural way is to combine the strengths of the two modeling methods for better performance of syntax-based SMT.",
        "However, there are many challenges in combining the two methods into a single model from both theoretical and implementation engineering viewpoints.",
        "In theory, one may worry about whether the advantage of tree sequence has already been covered by forest because forest encodes implicitly a huge number of parse trees and these parse trees may generate many different phrases and structure segmentations given a source sentence.",
        "In system implementation, the exponential combinations of tree sequences with forest structures make the rule extraction and decoding tasks much more complicated than that of the two individual methods.",
        "In this paper, we propose a forest-based tree sequence to string model, which is designed to integrate the strengths of the forest-based and the tree sequence-based modeling methods.",
        "We present our solutions that are able to extract translation rules and decode translation results for our model very efficiently.",
        "A general, configurable platform was designed for our model.",
        "With this platform, we can easily implement our method and many previous syntax-based methods by simple parameter setting.",

        "Many techniques have been proposed to address the structure divergence issue while only fewer studies are reported in addressing the parse errors in the SMT research community.",
        "To address structure divergence issue, many researchers (Eisner, 2003; Zhang et al., 2007) propose using the Synchronous Tree Substitution Grammar (STSG) grammar in syntax-based SMT since the STSG uses larger tree fragment as translation unit.",
        "Although promising results have been reported, STSG only uses one single subtree as translation unit which is still committed to the syntax strictly.",
        "Motivated by the fact that non-syntactic phrases make non-trivial contribution to phrase-based SMT, the tree sequence-based translation model is proposed (Liu et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2008a) that uses tree sequence as the basic translation unit, rather than using single sub-tree as in the STSG.",
        "Here, a tree sequence refers to a sequence of consecutive sub-trees that are embedded in a full parse tree.",
        "For any given phrase in a sentence, there is at least one tree sequence covering it.",
        "Thus the tree sequence-based model has great potential to address the structure divergence issue by using tree sequence-based non-syntactic translation rules.",
        "Liu et al. (2007) propose the tree sequence concept and design a tree sequence to string translation model.",
        "Zhang et al. (2008a) propose a tree sequence-based tree to tree translation model and Zhang et al. (2008b) demonstrate that the tree sequence-based modelling method can well address the structure divergence issue for syntaxbased SMT.",
        "To overcome the parse errors for SMT, Mi et al. (2008) propose a forest-based translation method that uses forest instead of one best tree as translation input, where a forest is a compact representation of exponentially number of n-best parse trees.",
        "Mi and Huang (2008) propose a forest-based rule extraction algorithm, which learn tree to string rules from source forest and target string.",
        "By using forest in rule extraction and decoding, their methods are able to well address the parse error issue.",
        "From the above discussion, we can see that traditional tree sequence-based method uses single tree as translation input while the forest-based model uses single sub-tree as the basic translation unit that can only learn tree-to-string (Galley et al. 2004; Liu et al., 2006) rules.",
        "Therefore, the two methods display different strengths, and which would be complementary to each other.",

        "However, the major difference between them lies in that the sub-trees of a tree sequence in forest may belongs to different single parse trees while, in a single parse tree-based model, all the sub-trees in a tree sequence are committed to the same parse tree.",
        "The forest-based tree sequence enables our model to have the potential of exploring additional parse trees that may be wrongly pruned out by the parser and thus are not encoded in the forest.",
