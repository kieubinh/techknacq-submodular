        "The main source of training data for statistical machine translation (SMT) models is a parallel corpus.",
        "In many cases, the same information is available in multiple languages simultaneously as a multilingual parallel corpus, e.g., European Parliament (EuroParl) and U.N. proceedings.",
        "In this paper, we consider how to use active learning (AL) in order to add a new language to such a multilingual parallel corpus and at the same time we construct an MT system from each language in the original corpus into this new target language.",
        "We introduce a novel combined measure of translation quality for multiple target language outputs (the same content from multiple source languages).",
        "The multilingual setting provides new opportunities for AL over and above a single language pair.",
        "This setting is similar to the multi-task AL scenario (Reichart et al., 2008).",
        "In our case, the multiple tasks are individual machine translation tasks for several language pairs.",

        "languages to the new language depending on the characteristics of each source-target language pair, hence these tasks are competing for annotating the same resource.",
        "However it may be that in a single language pair, AL would pick a particular sentence for annotation, but in a multilingual setting, a different source language might be able to provide a good translation, thus saving annotation effort.",
        "In this paper, we explore how multiple MT systems can be used to effectively pick instances that are more likely to improve training quality.",
        "Active learning is framed as an iterative learning process.",
        "In each iteration new human labeled instances (manual translations) are added to the training data based on their expected training quality.",
        "However, if we start with only a small amount of initial parallel data for the new target language, then translation quality is very poor and requires a very large injection of human labeled data to be effective.",
        "To deal with this, we use a novel framework for active learning: we assume we are given a small amount of parallel text and a large amount of monolingual source language text; using these resources, we create a large noisy parallel text which we then iteratively improve using small injections of human translations.",
        "When we build multiple MT systems from multiple source languages to the new target language, each MT system can be seen as a different 'view' on the desired output translation.",
        "Thus, we can train our multiple MT systems using either self-training or co-training (Blum and Mitchell, 1998).",
        "In self-training each MT system is retrained using human labeled data plus its own noisy translation output on the unlabeled data.",
        "In co-training each MT system is retrained using human labeled data plus noisy translation output from the other MT systems in the ensemble.",
        "We use consensus translations (He et al., 2008; Rosti et al., 2007; Matusov et al., 2006) as an effective method for co-training between multiple MT systems.",
        "This paper makes the following contributions: • We provide a new framework for multilingual MT, in which we build multiple MT systems and add a new language to an existing multilingual parallel corpus.",
        "The multilingual setting allows new features for active learning which we exploit to improve translation quality while reducing annotation effort.",

        "Moreover the algorithmic framework that we introduce in Sec. 2.1 for AL in the multilingual setting includes the single language pair setting as a special case (Haffari et al., 2009).",

        "Afterwards, we select and remove a subset of highly informative sentences from U, and add those sentences together with their human-provided translations to L. This process is continued iteratively until a certain level of translation quality is met (we use the BLEU score, WER and PER) (Papineni et al., 2002).",
        "In the baseline, against which we compare our sentence selection methods, the sentences are chosen randomly.",
        "When (re-)training the models, two phrase tables are learned for each SMT model: one from the labeled data L and the other one from pseudo-labeled data U+ (which we call the main and auxiliary phrase tables respectively).",

        "Since each entry in U+ has multiple translations, there are two options when building the auxiliary table for a particular language pair (Fd, E): (i) to use the corresponding translation ed of the source language in a self-training setting, or (ii) to use the consensus translation among all the translation candidates (e,.., eD) in a co-training setting (sharing information between multiple SMT models).",

        "In addition in this paper by considering multilingual parallel corpora we were able to introduce co-training for AL, while (Haf-fari et al., 2009) only use self-training since they are using a single language pair.",
        "(Reichart et al., 2008) introduces multi-task active learning where unlabeled data require annotations for multiple tasks, e.g. they consider named-entities and parse trees, and showed that multiple tasks helps selection compared to individual tasks.",
        "Our setting is different in that the target language is the same across multiple MT tasks, which we exploit to use consensus translations and co-training to improve active learning performance.",
        "(Callison-Burch and Osborne, 2003b; Callison-Burch and Osborne, 2003a) provide a co-training approach to MT, where one language pair creates data for another language pair.",
        "In contrast, our co-training approach uses consensus translations and our setting for active learning is very different from their semi-supervised setting.",
        "A Ph.D. proposal by Chris Callison-Burch (Callison-burch, 2003) lays out the promise of AL for SMT and proposes some algorithms.",
        "However, the lack of experimental results means that performance and feasibility of those methods cannot be compared to ours.",
        "While we use consensus translations (He et al., 2008; Rosti et al., 2007; Matusov et al., 2006) as an effective method for co-training in this paper, unlike consensus for system combination, the source languages for each of our MT systems are different, which rules out a set of popular methods for obtaining consensus translations which assume translation for a single language pair.",
        "Finally, we briefly note that triangulation (see (Cohn and Lapata, 2007)) is orthogonal to the use of co-training in our work, since it only enhances each MT system in our ensemble by exploiting the multilingual data.",
        "In future work, we plan to incorporate triangulation into our active learning approach."
