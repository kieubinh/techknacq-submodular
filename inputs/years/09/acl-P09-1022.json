        "Evaluation is a crucial component in the area of automatic summarization; it is used both to rank multiple participant systems in shared summarization tasks, such as the Summarization track at Text Analysis Conference (TAC) 2008 and its Document Understanding Conference (DUC) predecessors, and to provide feedback to developers whose goal is to improve their summarization systems.",
        "However, manual evaluation of a large number of documents necessary for a relatively unbiased view is often unfeasible, especially in the contexts where repeated evaluations are needed.",
        "Therefore, there is a great need for reliable automatic metrics that can perform evaluation in a fast and consistent manner.",
        "In this paper, we explore one such evaluation metric, DEPEVAL(summ), based on the comparison of Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) dependencies between a candidate summary and one or more model (reference) summaries.",
        "The method is similar in nature to Basic Elements (Hovy et al., 2005), in that it extends beyond a simple string comparison of word sequences, reaching instead to a deeper linguistic analysis of the text.",
        "Both methods use handwritten extraction rules to derive dependencies from constituent parses produced by widely available Penn II Treebank parsers.",
        "The difference between DEPEVAL(summ) and BE is that in DEPE-VAL(summ) the dependency extraction is accomplished through an LFG annotation of Cahill et al.",
        "(2004) applied to the output of the reranking parser of Charniak and Johnson (2005), whereas in BE (in the version presented here) dependencies are generated by the Minipar parser (Lin, 1995).",
        "Despite relying on a the same concept, our approach outperforms BE in most comparisons, and it often achieves higher correlations with human judgments than the string-matching metric ROUGE (Lin, 2004).",
        "A more detailed description of BE and ROUGE is presented in Section 2, which also gives an account of manual evaluation methods employed at TAC 2008.",
        "Section 3 gives a short introduction to the LFG annotation.",
        "Section 4 describes in more detail DEPEVAL(summ) and its variants.",
        "Section 5 presents the experiment in which we compared the perfomance of all three metrics on the TAC 2008 data (consisting of 5,952 100-words summaries) and on the DUC 2007 data (1,620 250-word summaries) and discusses the correlations these metrics achieve.",

      "text": [
        "In the first Text Analysis Conference (TAC 2008), as well as its predecessor, the Document Understanding Conference (DUC) series, the evaluation of summarization tasks was conducted using both manual and automatic methods.",
        "Since manual evaluation is still the undisputed gold standard, both at TAC and DUC there was much effort to evaluate manually as much data as possible.",
        "Manual assessment, performed by human judges, usually centers around two main aspects of summary quality: content and form.",
        "Similarly to Machine Translation, where these two aspects are represented by the categories of Accuracy and Fluency, in automatic summarization evaluation performed at TAC and DUC they surface as (Content) Responsiveness and Readability.",
        "In TAC 2008 (Dang and Owczarzak, 2008), however, Content Responsiveness was replaced by Overall Responsiveness, conflating these two dimensions and reflecting the overall quality of the summary: the degree to which a summary was responding to the information need contained in the topic statement, as well as its linguistic quality.",
        "A separate Readability score was still provided, assessing the fluency and structure independently of content, based on such aspects as grammaticality, non-redundancy, referential clarity, focus, structure, and coherence.",
        "Both Overall Responsiveness and Readability were evaluated according to a five-point scale, ranging from \"Very Poor\" to \"Very Good\".",
        "Content was evaluated manually by NIST assessors using the Pyramid framework (Passonneau et al., 2005).",
        "In the Pyramid evaluation, assessors first extract all possible \"information nuggets\", or Summary Content Units (SCUs) from the four human-crafted model summaries on a given topic.",
        "Each SCU is assigned a weight in proportion to the number of model summaries in which it appears, on the assumption that information which appears in most or all human-produced model summaries is more essential to the topic.",
        "Once all SCUs are harvested from the model summaries, assessors determine how many of these SCUs are present in each of the automatic peer summaries.",
        "The final score for an automatic summary is its total SCU weight divided by the maximum SCU weight available to a summary of average length (where the average length is determined by the mean SCU count of the model summaries for this topic).",
        "All types of manual assessment are expensive and time-consuming, which is why it can be rarely provided for all submitted runs in shared tasks such as the TAC Summarization track.",
        "It is also not a viable tool for system developers who ideally would like a fast, reliable, and above all automatic evaluation method that can be used to improve their systems.",
        "The creation and testing of automatic evaluation methods is, therefore, an important research venue, and the goal is to produce automatic metrics that will correlate with manual assessment as closely as possible.",
        "Automatic metrics, because of their relative speed, can be applied more widely than manual evaluation.",
        "In TAC 2008 Summarization track, all submitted runs were scored with the ROUGE (Lin, 2004) and Basic Elements (BE) metrics (Hovy et al., 2005).",
        "ROUGE is a collection of string-comparison techniques, based on matching n-grams between a candidate string and a reference string.",
        "The string in question might be a single sentence (as in the case of translation), or a set of sentences (as in the case of summaries).",
        "The variations of ROUGE range from matching unigrams (i.e. single words) to matching four-grams, with or without lemmatization and stopwords, with the options of using different weights or skip-n-grams (i.e. matching n-grams despite intervening words).",
        "The two versions used in TAC 2008 evaluations were",
        "ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-SU4, where ROUGE-2 calculates the proportion of matching bigrams between the candidate summary and the reference summaries, and ROUGE-SU4 is a combination of unigram match and skip-bigram match with skip distance of 4 words.",
        "BE, on the other hand, employs a certain degree of linguistic analysis in the assessment process, as it rests on comparing the \"Basic Elements\" between the candidate and the reference.",
        "Basic Elements are syntactic in nature, and comprise the heads of major syntactic constituents in the text (noun, verb, adjective, etc.)",
        "and their modifiers in a dependency relation, expressed as a triple (head, modifier, relation type).",
        "First, the input text is parsed with a syntactic parser, then Basic Elements are extracted from the resulting parse, and the candidate BEs are matched against the reference BEs.",
        "In TAC 2008 and DUC 2008 evaluations the BEs were extracted with Minipar (Lin, 1995).",
        "Since BE, contrary to ROUGE, does not rely solely on the surface sequence of words to determine similarity between summaries, but delves into what could be called a shallow semantic structure, comprising thematic roles such as subject and object, it is likely to notice identity of meaning where such identity is obscured by variations in word order.",
        "In fact, when it comes to evaluation of automatic summaries, BE shows higher correlations with human judgments than ROUGE, although the difference is not large enough to be statistically significant.",
        "In the TAC 2008 evaluations, BE-HM (a version of BE where the words are stemmed and the relation type is ignored) obtained a correlation of 0.911 with human assessment of overall responsiveness and 0.949 with the Pyramid score, whereas ROUGE-2 showed correlations of 0.894 and 0.946, respectively.",
        "While using dependency information is an important step towards integrating linguistic knowledge into the evaluation process, there are many ways in which this could be approached.",
        "Since this type of evaluation processes information in stages (constituent parser, dependency extraction, and the method of dependency matching between a candidate and a reference), there is potential for variance in performance among dependency-based evaluation metrics that use different components.",
        "Therefore, it is interesting to compare our method, which relies on the Charniak-Johnson parser and the LFG annotation, with BE, which uses Minipar to parse the input and produce dependencies."

        "Predicate-only dependencies are those whose path ends in a predicate-value pair, describing grammatical relations.",
        "For instance, in the sentence John resigned yesterday, predicate-only dependencies would include: subject(resign, john) and adjunct(resign, yesterday), while non-predicate dependencies are per-son(john,3), number(john,sg), tense(resign,past), person(yesterday,3), num(yesterday,sg).",

        "Overlap between the candidate bag and the reference bag is calculated in the form of precision, recall, and the f-measure (with precision and recall equally weighted).",

        "In Owczarzak (2008), the method achieves equal or higher correlations with human judgments than METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), one of the best-performing automatic MT evaluation metrics.",
        "However, it is not clear that the method can be applied without change to the task of assessing automatic summaries; after all, the two tasks - of summarization and translation - produce outputs that are different in nature.",
        "In MT, the unit of text is a sentence; text is translated, and the translation evaluated, sentence by sentence.",
        "In automatic summarization, the output unit is a summary with length varying depending on task, but which most often consists of at least several sentences.",
        "This has bearing on the matching process: with several sentences on the candidate and reference side each, there is increased possibility of trivial matches, such as dependencies containing function words, which might inflate the summary score even in the absence of important content.",
        "This is particularly likely if we were to employ partial matching for dependencies.",
        "Partial matching (indicated in the result tables with the tag pm) \"splits\" each predicate dependency into two, replacing one or the other element with a variable, e.g. for the dependency subject(resign, John) we would obtain two partial dependencies subject(resign, x) and subject(x, John).",
        "This process helps circumvent some of the syntactic and lexical variation between a candidate and a reference, and it proved very useful in MT evaluation (Owczarzak, 2008).",
        "In summary evaluation, as will be shown in Section 5, it leads to higher correlations with human judgments only in the case of human-produced model summaries, because almost any variation between two model summaries is \"legal\", i.e. either a paraphrase or another, but equally relevant, piece of information.",
        "For automatic summaries, which are of relatively poor quality, partial matching lowers our method's ability to reflect human judgment, because it results in overly generous matching in situations where the examined information is neither a paraphrase nor relevant.",
        "Similarly, evaluating a summary against the union of all references, as we do in the baseline version of our method, increases the pool of possible matches, but may also produce score inflation through matching repetitive information across models.",
        "To deal with this, we produce a version of the score (marked in the result tables with the tag one) that counts only one \"hit\" for every dependency match, independent of how many instances of a given dependency are present in the comparison.",
        "The use of WordNet module (Rennie, 2000) did not provide a great advantage (see results tagged with wn), and sometimes even lowered our correlations, especially in evaluation of automatic systems.",
        "This makes sense if we take into consideration that WordNet lists all possible synonyms for all possible senses of a word, and so, given a great number of cross-sentence comparisons in multi-sentence summaries, there is an increased risk of spurious matches between words which, despite being potentially synonymous in certain contexts, are not equivalent in the text.",
        "Another area of concern was the potential noise introduced by the parser and the annotation process.",
        "Due to parsing errors, two otherwise equivalent expressions might be encoded as differing sets of dependencies.",
        "In MT evaluation, the dependency-based method can alleviate parser noise by comparing n-best parses for the candidate and the reference (Owczarzak et al., 2007), but this is not an efficient solution for comparing multi-sentence summaries.",
        "We have therefore attempted to at least partially counteract this issue by removing relation labels from the dependencies (i.e. producing dependencies of the form (resign, John) instead of subject(resign, John)), which did provide some improvement (see results tagged with norel).",
        "Finally, we experimented with a predicate-only version of the evaluation, where only the predicate dependencies participate in the comparison, excluding dependencies that provide purely grammatical information such as person, tense, or number (tagged in the results table as pred).",
        "This move proved beneficial only in the case of system summaries, perhaps by decreasing the number of trivial matches, but decreased the method's correlation for model summaries, where such detailed information might be necessary to assess the degree of similarity between two human summaries."

        "The first question we have to ask is: which of the manual evaluation categories do we want our metric to imitate?",

        "Content seems to be the more important aspect, especially given that Readability can be partially derived from Responsiveness (a summary high in content cannot be very low in readability, although some very readable summaries can have little relevant content).",
        "Content Responsiveness was provided in DUC 2007 data, but not in TAC 2008, where the extrinsic Pyramid measure was used to evaluate content.",
        "It is, in fact, preferable to compare our metric against the Pyramid score rather than Content Responsiveness, because both the Pyramid and our method aim to measure the degree of similarity between a candidate and a model, whereas Content Responsiveness is a direct assessment of whether the summary's content is adequate given a topic and a source text.",
        "The Pyramid is, at the same time, a costly manual evaluation method, so an automatic metric that successfully emulates it would be a useful replacement.",
        "Another question is whether we focus on system-level or summary-level evaluation.",
        "The correlation values at the summary-level are generally much lower than on the system-level, which means the metrics are better at evaluating system performance than the quality of individual summaries.",

        "The problem is twofold: first, our automatic metrics measure identity rather than quality.",
        "Similarity of content between a candidate summary and one or more references is acting as a proxy measure for the quality of the candidate summary; yet, we cannot forget that the relation between these two features is not purely linear.",
        "A candidate highly similar to the reference will be, necessarily, of good quality, but a candidate which is dissimilar from a reference is not necessarily of low quality (vide the case of parallel model summaries, which almost always contain some non-overlapping information).",
        "The second problem is the extent to which our metrics are able to distinguish content through the veil of differing forms.",
        "Synonyms, paraphrases, or pragmatic features such as the choice of topic and focus render simple string-matching techniques ineffective, especially in the area of summarization where the evaluation happens on a supra-sentential level.",
        "As a result, then, a lot of effort was put into developing metrics that can identify similar content despite non-similar form, which naturally led to the application of linguistically-oriented approaches that look beyond surface word order.",
        "Essentially, though, we are using imperfect measures of similarity as an imperfect stand-in for quality, and the accumulated noise often causes a divergence in our metrics' performance with model and system summaries.",
        "Much like the inverse relation of precision and recall, changes and additions that improve a metric's correlation with human scores for model summaries often weaken the correlation for system summaries, and vice versa.",
        "Admittedly, we could just ignore this problem and focus on increasing correlations for automatic summaries only; after all, the whole point of creating evaluation metrics is to score and rank the output of systems.",
        "Such a perspective can be rather short-sighted, though, given that we expect continuous improvement from the summarization systems to, ideally, human levels, so the same issues which now prevent high correlations for models will start surfacing in evaluation of system-produced summaries as well.",
        "Using metrics that only perform reliably for low-quality summaries might prevent us from noticing when those summaries become better.",
        "Our goal should be, therefore, to develop a metric which obtains high correlations in both categories, with the assumption that such a metric will be more reliable in evaluating summaries of varying quality.",

        "Since there is no single winner among all 32 variants of DEPEVAL(summ) on TAC 2008 data, we must decide which of the categories is most important to a successful automatic evaluation metric.",
        "Correlations with Overall Responsiveness are in general lower than those with the Pyramid score (except in the case of system-level models).",
        "This makes sense, if we rememeber that Overall Responsiveness judges content as well as linguistic quality, which are two different dimensions and so a single automatic metric is unlikely to reflect it well, and that it judges content in terms of its relevance to topic, which is also beyond the reach of contemporary metrics which can at most judge content similarity to a model.",
        "This means that the Pyramid score makes for a more relevant metric to emulate.",
        "The last dilemma is whether we choose to focus on system-or summary-level correlations.",
        "This ties in with the purpose which the evaluation metric should serve.",
        "In comparisons of multiple systems, such as in TAC 2008, the value is placed in the correct ordering of these systems; while summary-level assessment can give us important feedback and insight during the system development stage.",
        "The final choice among all DEPEVAL(summ) versions hinges on all of these factors: we should prefer a variant which correlates highly with the Pyramid score rather than with Responsiveness, which minimizes the gap between model and automatic peer correlations while retaining relatively high values for both, and which fulfills these requirements similarly well on both summary-and system-levels.",
        "Three such variants are the baseline DEPEVAL(summ), the WordNet version DE-PEVAL(summ) wn, and the version with removed relation labels DEPEVAL(summ) norel.",
        "Both the baseline and norel versions achieve significant improvement over ROUGE and BE in correlations with the Pyramid score for automatic summaries, and over BE for models, on the summary level.",
        "In fact, almost in all categories they achieve higher correlations than ROUGE and BE.",
        "The only exceptions are the correlations with Pyramid for systems at the system-level, but there the results are close and none of the differences in that category are significant.",
        "To balance this exception, DE-PEVAL(summ) achieves much higher correlations with the Pyramid scores for model summaries than either ROUGE or BE on the system level.",
        "In order to see whether the DEPEVAL(summ) advantage holds for other data, we examined the most optimal versions (baseline, wn, norel, as well as one, which is the closest counterpart to label-free BE-HM) on data from DUC 2007.",
        "Because only a portion of the DUC 2007 data was evaluated with Pyramid, we chose to look rather at the Content Responsiveness scores.",
        "As can be seen in Tables 3 and 4, the same patterns hold: decided advantage over ROUGE/BE when it comes to model summaries (especially at system-level), comparable results for automatic summaries.",
        "Since DUC 2007 data consisted of fewer summaries (1,620 vs 5,952 at TAC) and fewer submissions (32 vs 57 at TAC), some results did not reach statistical significance.",
        "In Table 3, in the models category, only DEPEVAL(summ) correlations are significant.",
        "In Table 4, in the model category, only DEPEVAL(summ) and ROUGE-2 correlations are significant.",
        "Note also that these correlations with Content Responsiveness are generally lower than those with Pyramid in previous tables, but in the case of summary-level comparison higher than the correlations with Overall Responsiveness.",
        "This is to be expected given our earlier discussion of the differences in what these metrics measure.",
        "As mentioned before, the dependency-based evaluation can be approached from different angles, leading to differences in performance.",
        "This is exemplified in our experiment, where DEPE-VAL(summ) outperforms BE, even though both these metrics rest on the same general idea.",
        "The new implementation of BE presented at the TAC 2008 workshop (Tratz and Hovy, 2008) introduces transformations for dependencies in order to increase the number of matches among elements that are semantically similar yet differ in terms of syntactic structure and/or lexical choices, and adds WordNet for synonym matching.",
        "Its core modules were updated as well: Minipar was replaced with the Charniak-Johnson reranking parser (Charniak and Johnson, 2005), Named Entity identification was added, and the BE extraction is conducted using a set of Tregex rules (Levy and Andrew, 2006).",
        "Since our method, presented in this paper, also uses the reranking parser, as well as WordNet, it would be interesting to compare both methods directly in terms of the performance of the dependency extraction procedure."
