        "For instance, some approaches coarsely discriminate between biographical and non-biographical information (Zhou et al., 2004; Biadsy et al., 2008), while others go beyond binary distinction by identifying atomic events - e.g., occupation and marital status - that are typically included in a biography (Weischedel et al., 2004; Filatova and Prager, 2005; Filatova et al., 2006).",
        "Commonly, such templates are specified manually and are hard-coded for a particular domain (Fujii and Ishikawa, 2004; Weischedel et al., 2004).",

        "These domains have been commonly used in prior work on summarization (Weischedel et al., 2004; Zhou et al., 2004; Filatova and Prager, 2005; Demner-Fushman and Lin, 2007; Biadsy et al., 2008).",
        "Our text corpus consists of articles drawn from the corresponding categories in Wikipedia.",
        "There are 2,150 articles in American Film Actors and 523 articles in Diseases.",
        "For each domain, we randomly select 90% of articles for training and test on the remaining 10%.",
        "Human-authored articles in both domains contain an average of four topics, and each topic contains an average of 193 words.",

        "Baselines Our first baseline, Search, relies solely on search engine ranking for content selection.",
        "Using the article title as a query - e.g., Bacillary Angiomatosis, this method selects the web page that is ranked first by the search engine.",
        "From this page we select the first k paragraphs where k is defined in the same way as in our full model.",
        "If there are less than k paragraphs on the page, all paragraphs are selected, but no other sources are used.",
        "This yields a document of comparable size with the output of our system.",
        "Despite its simplicity, this baseline is not naive: extracting material from a single document guarantees that the output is coherent, and a page highly ranked by a search engine may readily contain a comprehensive overview of the subject.",
        "Our second baseline, No Template, does not use a template to specify desired topics; therefore, there are no constraints on content selection.",
        "Instead, we follow a simplified form of previous work on biography creation, where a classifier is trained to distinguish biographical text (Zhou et al., 2004; Biadsy et al., 2008).",
        "In this case, we train a classifier to distinguish domain-specific text.",
        "Positive training data is drawn from all topics in the given domain corpus.",
        "To find negative training data, we perform the search procedure as in our full model (see Section 3.1) using only the article titles as search queries.",
        "Any excerpts which have very low similarity to the original articles are used as negative examples.",
        "During the decoding procedure, we use the same search procedure.",
        "We then classify each excerpt as relevant or irrelevant and select the k non-redundant excerpts with the highest relevance confidence scores.",
        "Our third baseline, Disjoint, uses the ranking perceptron framework as in our full system; however, rather than perform an optimization step during training and decoding, we simply select the highest-ranked excerpt for each topic.",
        "This equates to standard linear classification for each section individually.",
        "In addition to these baselines, we compare against an Oracle system.",
        "For each topic present in the human-authored article, the Oracle selects the excerpt from our full model's candidate excerpts with the highest cosine similarity to the human-authored text.",
        "This excerpt is the optimal automatic selection from the results available, and therefore represents an upper bound on our excerpt selection task.",
        "Some articles contain additional topics beyond those in the template; in these cases, the Oracle system produces a longer article than our algorithm.",
        "Table 2 shows the average number of excerpts selected and sources used in articles created by our full model and each baseline.",
        "Automatic Evaluation To assess the quality of the resulting overview articles, we compare them with the original human-authored articles.",
        "We use ROUGE, an evaluation metric employed at the Document Understanding Conferences (DUC), which assumes that proximity to human-authored text is an indicator of summary quality.",
        "We use the publicly available ROUGE toolkit (Lin, 2004) to compute recall, precision, and F-score for ROUGE-1.",
        "We use the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test to determine statistical significance.",
        "Analysis of Human Edits In addition to our automatic evaluation, we perform a study of reactions to system-produced articles by the general public.",
        "To achieve this goal, we insert automatically created articles into Wikipedia itself and examine the feedback of Wikipedia editors.",
        "Selection of specific articles is constrained by the need to find topics which are currently of \"stub\" status that have enough information available on the Internet to construct a valid article.",
