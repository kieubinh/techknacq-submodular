        "Recent years have witnessed increased interest in the use of interactive language technology in educational and entertainment applications.",
        "Computational story telling could play a key role in these applications by effectively engaging learners and assisting them in creating a story.",
        "It could also allow teachers to generate stories on demand that suit their classes' needs.",
        "And enhance the entertainment value of role-playing games.",
        "The majority of these games come with a set of pre-specified plots that the players must act out.",
        "Ideally, the plot should adapt dynamically in response to the players' actions.",
        "Computational story telling has a longstanding tradition in the field of artificial intelligence.",
        "Early work has been largely inspired by Propp's (1968) typology of narrative structure.",
        "Propp identified in Russian fairy tales a small number of recurring units (e.g., the hero is defeated, the villain causes harm) and rules that could be used to describe their relation (e.g., the hero is pursued and the rescued).",
        "Story grammars (Thorndyke, 1977) were initially used to capture Propp's high-level plot elements and character interactions.",
        "A large body of more recent work views story generation as a form of agent-based planning (Theune et al., 2003; Fass, 2002; Oinonen et al., 2006).",
        "The agents act as characters with a list of goals.",
        "They form plans of action and try to fulfill them.",
        "Interesting stories emerge as agents' plans interact and cause failures and possible replanning.",
        "Perhaps the biggest challenge faced by computational story generators is the amount of world knowledge required to create compelling stories.",
        "A hypothetical system must have information about the characters involved, how they interact, what their goals are, and how they influence their environment.",
        "Furthermore, all this information must be complete and error-free if it is to be used as input to a planning algorithm.",
        "Traditionally, this knowledge is created by hand, and must be recreated for different domains.",
        "Even the simple task of adding a new character requires a whole new set of action descriptions and goals.",
        "A second challenge concerns the generation task itself and the creation of stories characterized by high-quality prose.",
        "Most story generation systems focus on generating plot outlines, without considering the actual linguistic structures found in the stories they are trying to mimic (but see Callaway and Lester 2002 for a notable exception).",
        "In fact, there seems to be little common ground between story generation and natural language generation (NLG), despite extensive research in both fields.",
        "The NLG process (Reiter and Dale, 2000) is often viewed as a pipeline consisting of content planning (selecting and structuring the story's content), microplanning (sentence aggregation, generation ofreferring expressions, lexical choice), and surface realization (agreement, verb-subject ordering).",
        "However, story generation systems typically operate in two phases: (a) creating a plot for the story and (b) transforming it into text (often by means of template-based NLG).",
        "In this paper we address both challenges facing computational story telling.",
        "We propose a data-driven approach to story generation that does not require extensive manual involvement.",
        "Our goal is to create stories automatically by leveraging knowledge inherent in corpora.",
        "Stories within the same genre (e.g., fairy tales, parables) typically have similar structure, characters, events, and vocabularies.",
        "It is precisely this type of information we wish to extract and quantify.",
        "Of course, building a database of characters and their actions is merely the first step towards creating an automatic story generator.",
        "The latter must be able to select which information to include in the story, in what order to present it, how to convert it into English.",
        "Recent work in natural language generation has seen the development of learning methods for realizing each of these tasks automatically without much hand coding.",
        "For example, Duboue and McKeown (2002) and Barzilay and Lapata (2005) propose to learn a content planner from a parallel corpus.",

        "Stent et al.",
        "(2004) learn how to combine the syntactic structure of elementary speech acts into one or more sentences from a corpus of good and bad examples.",
        "And Knight and Hatzivassiloglou (1995) use a language model for selecting a fluent sentence among the vast number of surface realizations corresponding to a single semantic representation.",
        "Although successful on their own, these methods have not been yet integrated together into an end-to-end probabilistic system.",
        "Our work attempts to do this for the story generation task, while bridging the gap between story generators and NLG systems.",
        "Our generator operates over predicate-argument and predicate-predicate co-occurrence statistics gathered from corpora.",
        "These are used to produce a large set of candidate stories which are subsequently ranked based on their interestingness and coherence.",
        "The top-ranked candidate is selected for presentation and verbalized using a language model interfaced with RealPro (Lavoie and Rambow, 1997), a text generation engine.",

        "These stories exhibit several recurrent patterns and are thus amenable to a data-driven approach.",

        "As common in previous work (e.g., Shim and Kim 2002), we assume that our generator operates in an interactive context.",
        "Specifically, the user supplies the topic of the story and its desired length.",
        "By topic we mean the entities (or characters) around which the story will revolve.",
        "These can be a list of nouns such as dog and duck or a sentence, such as the dog chases the duck.",
        "The generator next constructs several possible stories involving these entities by consulting a knowledge base containing information about dogs and ducks (e.g., dogs bark, ducks swim) and their interactions (e.g., dogs chase ducks, ducks love dogs).",
        "We conceptualize the dog chases the duck the dog barks the duck runs away the dog catches the duck the duck escapes dog:SUBJ:bark whistle:OBJ:dog dog:SUBJ:bite treat:OBJ:dog dog:SUBJ:see give:OBJ:dog dog:SUBJ:like have: OBJ:dog hungry:ADJ:dog lovely:ADJ:dog",
        "Table 1: Relations for the noun dog with high MI scores (SUBJ is a shorthand for subject-of, OBJ for object-of and ADJ for adjective-of).",
        "the story generation process as a tree (see Figure 2) whose levels represent different story lengths.",
        "For example, a tree of depth 3 will only generate stories with three sentences.",
        "The tree encodes many stories efficiently, the nodes correspond to different sentences and there is no sibling order (the tree in Figure 2 can generate three stories).",
        "Each sentence in the tree has a score.",
        "Story generation amounts to traversing the tree and selecting the nodes with the highest score",
        "Specifically, our story generator applies two distinct search procedures.",
        "Although we are ultimately searching for the best overall story at the document level, we must also find the most suitable sentences that can be generated from the knowledge base (see Figure 4).",
        "The space of possible stories can increase dramatically depending on the size of the knowledge base so that an exhaustive tree search becomes computationally prohibitive.",
        "Fortunately, we can use beam search to prune low-scoring sentences and the stories they generate.",
        "For example, we may prefer sentences describing actions that are common for their characters.",
        "We also apply two additional criteria in selecting good stories, namely whether they are coherent and interesting.",
        "At each depth in the tree we maintain the N-best stories.",
        "Once we reach the required length, the highest scoring story is presented to the user.",
        "In the following we describe the components of our system in more detail.",
        "As mentioned earlier our generator has access to a knowledge base recording entities and their interactions.",
        "These are essentially predicate argument structures extracted from a corpus.",
        "In our experiments this knowledge base was created using the RASP relational parser (Briscoe and Carroll, 2002).",
        "We collected all verb-subject, verb-object, verb-adverb, and noun-adjective relations from the parser's output and scored them with the mutual information-based metric proposed in Lin (1998):",
        "where w and w' are two words with relation type r. * denotes all words in that particular relation and !",
        "w, r, w' !",
        "represents the number of times w, r, w'occurred in the corpus.",
        "These MI scores are used to inform the generation system about likely entity relationships at the sentence level.",
        "Table 1 shows high scoring relations for the noun dog extracted from the corpus used in our experiments (see Section 4 for details).",
        "Note that MI weighs binary relations which in some cases may be likely on their own without making sense in a ternary relation.",
        "For instance, although both dog:SUBJ:run and president:OBJ:run are probable we may not want to create the sentence \"The dog runs for president\".",
        "Ditransitive verbs pose a similar problem, where two incongru-ent objects may appear together (the sentence John gives an apple to the highway is semantically odd, whereas John gives an apple to the teacher would be fine).",
        "To help reduce these problems, we need to estimate the likelihood of ternary relations.",
        "We therefore calculate the conditional probability:",
        "where s is the subject of verb v, a1 is the first argument of v and a2 is the second argument of v and v, s, a1 = e. When a verb takes two arguments, we first consult (2), to see if the combination is likely before backing off to (1).",
        "The knowledge base described above can only inform the generation system about relationships on the sentence level.",
        "However, a story created simply by concatenating sentences in isolation will often be incoherent.",
        "Investigations into the interpretation of narrative discourse (Asher and Lascarides, 2003) have shown that lexical information plays an important role in determining",
        "OBJ:catch",
        "SUBJ:frighten",

        "OBJ:chase I 2",
        "SUBJ:run",
        "SUBJ:escape",
        "SUBJ:fall",
        "SUBJ:jump the discourse relations between propositions.",
        "Although we don't have an explicit model of rhetorical relations and their effects on sentence ordering, we capture the lexical interdependencies between sentences by focusing on events (verbs) and their precedence relationships in the corpus.",
        "For every entity in our training corpus we extract event chains similar to those proposed by Chambers and Jurafsky (2008).",
        "Specifically, we identify the events every entity relates to and record their (partial) order.",
        "We assume that verbs sharing the same arguments are more likely to be semantically related than verbs with no arguments in common.",
        "For example, if we know that someone steals and then runs, we may expect the next action to be that they hide or that they are caught.",
        "In order to track entities and their associated events throughout a text, we first resolve entity mentions using OpenNLP.",
        "The list of events performed by co-referring entities and their grammatical relation (i.e., subject or object) are subsequently stored in a graph.",
        "The edges between event nodes are scored using the MI equation given in (1).",
        "A fragment of the action graph is shown in Figure 3 (for simplicity, the edges in the example are weighted with co-occurrence frequencies).",
        "Contrary to Chambers and Juraf-sky (2008) we do not learn global narrative chains over an entire corpus.",
        "Currently, we consider local chains of length two and three (i.e., chains of two or three events sharing grammatical arguments).",
        "The generator consults the graph when selecting a verb for an entity.",
        "It will favor verbs that are part of an event chain (e.g., SUBJ:chase – SUBJ:run – SUBJ:fall in Figure 3).",
        "This way, the search space is effectively pruned as finding a suitable verb in the current sentence is influenced by the choice of verb in the next sentence.",
        "So far we have described how we gather knowledge about entities and their interactions, which must be subsequently combined into a sentence.",
        "The backbone of our sentence planner is a grammar with subcategorization information which we collected from the lexicon created by Korhonen and Briscoe (2006) and the COMLEX dictionary (Grishman et al., 1994).",
        "The grammar rules act as templates.",
        "They each take a verb as their head and propose ways of filling its argument slots.",
        "This means that when generating a story, the choice of verb will affect the structure of the sentence.",
        "The subcategorization templates are weighted by their probability of occurrence in the reference dictionaries.",
        "This allows the system to prefer less elaborate grammatical structures.",
        "The grammar rules were converted to a format compatible with our surface realizer (see Section 2.3) and include information pertaining to mood, agreement, argument role, etc.",
        "Our sentence planner aggregates together information from the knowledge base, without however generating referring expressions.",
        "Although this would be a natural extension, we initially wanted to assess whether the stochastic approach advocated here is feasible at all, before venturing towards more ambitious components.",
        "The surface realization process is performed by RealPro (Lavoie and Rambow (1997)).",
        "The system takes an abstract sentence representation and transforms it into English.",
        "There are several grammatical issues that will affect the final realization of the sentence.",
        "For nouns we must decide whether they are singular or plural, whether they are preceded by a definite or indefinite article or with no article at all.",
        "Adverbs can either be pre-verbal or post-verbal.",
        "There is also the issue of selecting an appropriate tense for our generated sentences, however, we simply assume all sentences are in the present tense.",
        "Since we do not know a priori which of these parameters will result in a grammatical sentence, we generate all possible combinations and select the most likely one according to a language model.",
        "We used the SRI toolkit to train a trigram language model on the British National Corpus, with interpolated Kneser-Ney smoothing and perplexity as the scoring metric for the generated sentences.",
        "dog duck bark_at(dog,duck) bark_at(dog,cat) bark(dog,loudly)",
        "It is best to illustrate the generation procedure with a simple example (see Figure 4).",
        "Given the sentence the dog chases the duck as input, our generator assumes that either dog or duck will be the subject of the following sentence.",
        "This is a somewhat simplistic attempt at generating coherent stories.",
        "Centering (Grosz et al., 1995) and other discourse theories argue that topical entities are likely to appear in prominent syntactic positions such as subject or object.",
        "Next, we select verbs from the knowledge base that take the words duck and dog as their subject (e.g., bark, run, fly).",
        "Our beam search procedure will reduce the list of verbs to a small subset by giving preference to those that are likely to follow chase and have duck and dog as their subjects or objects.",
        "The sentence planner gives a set of possible frames for these verbs which may introduce additional entities (see Figure 4).",
        "For example, bark can be intransitive or take an object or adverbial complement.",
        "We select an object for bark, by retrieving from the knowledge base the set of objects it co-occurs with.",
        "Our surface realizer will take structures like \"bark(dog,loudly)\", \"bark_at(dog,cat)\", \"bark_at(dog,duck)\" and generate the sentences the dog barks loudly, the dog barks at the cat and the dog barks at the duck.",
        "This procedure is repeated to create a list of possible candidates for the third sentence, and so on.",
        "As Figure 4 illustrates, there are many candidate sentences for each entity.",
        "In default of generating all of these exhaustively, our system utilizes the MI scores from the knowledge base to guide the search.",
        "So, at each choice point in the generation process, e.g., when selecting a verb for an entity or a frame for a verb, we consider the N best alternatives assuming that these are most likely to appear in a good story."

        "Or in the worst case, actions that make no sense when collated together.",
        "Ideally, we would like to be able to discern interesting stories from tedious ones.",
        "Another important consideration is their coherence.",
        "We have to ensure that the discourse smoothly transitions from one topic to the next.",
        "To remedy this, we developed two ranking functions that assess the candidate stories based on their interest and coherence.",
        "Following previous work (Stent et al., 2004; Barzilay and Lapata, 2007) we learn these ranking functions from training data (i.e., stories labeled with numeric values for interestingness and coherence).",
        "Interest Model A stumbling block to assessing how interesting a story may be, is that the very notion of interestingness is subjective and not very well understood.",
        "Although people can judge fairly reliably whether they like or dislike a story, they have more difficulty isolating what exactly makes it interesting.",
        "Furthermore, there are virtually no empirical studies investigating the linguistic (surface level) correlates of interestingness.",

        "The fables were split into 5 sets of 8; each participant was randomly assigned one of the 5 sets to judge.",
        "We obtained ratings (440 in total) from 55 participants, using the WebExp experimental software.",
        "We next investigated if easily observable syntactic and lexical features were correlated with interest.",
        "Participants gave the fables an average interest rating of 3.05.",

        "We observed a reliable effect of system type by subjects and items on all three dimensions.",

        "These results are not entirely surprising.",
        "The deterministic system maintains a local restricted view of what constitutes a good story.",
        "It creates a story by selecting isolated entity-event relationships with high MI scores.",

        "Moreover, it tends to primarily favor verb-object or verb-subject relations, since these are most frequent in the corpus.",
        "The stories thus have little structural variation and feel repetitive.",
        "The random system uses even less information in generating a story (entity-action relationships are chosen at random without taking note of the MI scores).",
        "In contrast to these baselines, the rank-based system assesses candidate stories more globally.",
        "It thus favors coherent stories, with varied word choice and structure.",
        "A note of caution here concerns referring expressions which our systems cannot at the moment generate.",
        "This may have disadvantaged the stories overall, rendering them stylistically awkward.",
        "The stories generated by both the deterministic and random systems are perceived as less interesting in comparison to the rank-based system.",
        "This indicates that taking interest into account is a promising direction even though the overall interestingness of the stories we generate is somewhat low (see third column in Table 3).",
        "Our interest ranking function was trained on well-formed human authored stories.",
        "It is therefore possible that the ranker was not as effective as it could be simply because it was applied to out-of-domain data.",

        "The deterministic system tends to select simplistic sentences which although read well by themselves do not lead to an overall narrative.",

        "In this paper we proposed a novel method to computational story telling.",
        "Our approach has three key features.",
        "Firstly, story plot is created dynamically by consulting an automatically created knowledge base.",
        "Secondly, our generator realizes the various components of the generation pipeline stochastically, without extensive manual coding.",
        "Thirdly, we generate and store multiple stories efficiently in a tree data structure.",
        "Story creation amounts to traversing the tree and selecting the nodes with the highest score.",
        "We develop two scoring functions that rate stories in terms of how coherent and interesting they are.",
        "Experimental results show that these bring improvements over versions of the system that rely solely on the knowledge base.",
        "Overall, our results indicate that the overgeneration-and-ranking approach advocated here is viable in producing short stories that exhibit narrative structure.",
        "As our system can be easily rertrained on different corpora, it can potentially generate stories that vary in vocabulary, style, genre, and domain.",
        "An important future direction concerns a more detailed assessment of our search procedure.",
        "Currently we don't have a good estimate of the type of stories being overlooked due to the restrictions we impose on the search space.",
        "An appealing alternative is the use of Genetic Algorithms (Goldberg, 1989).",
        "The operations of mutation and crossover have the potential of creating more varied and original stories.",
        "Our generator would also benefit from an explicit model of causality which is currently approximated by the entity chains.",
        "Such a model could be created from existing resources such as ConceptNet (Liu and Davenport, 2004), a freely available commonsense knowledge base.",
        "Finally, improvements such as the generation of referring expressions and the modeling of selectional restrictions would create more fluent stories.",
