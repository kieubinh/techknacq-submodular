        "To date, a variety of corpus-based methods have been developed for sentiment classification.",

        "The challenge before us is how to leverage rich English corpora for Chinese sentiment classification.",
        "In this study, we focus on the problem of cross-lingual sentiment classification, which leverages only English training data for supervised sentiment classification of Chinese product reviews, without using any Chinese resources.",
        "Note that the above problem is not only defined for Chinese sentiment classification, but also for various sentiment analysis tasks in other different languages.",
        "Though pilot studies have been performed to make use of English corpora for subjectivity classification in other languages (Mihalcea et al., 2007; Banea et al., 2008), the methods are very straightforward by directly employing an inductive classifier (e.g. SVM, NB), and the classification performance is far from satisfactory because of the language gap between the original language and the translated language.",
        "In this study, we propose a co-training approach to improving the classification accuracy of polarity identification of Chinese product reviews.",
        "Unlabeled Chinese reviews can be fully leveraged in the proposed approach.",
        "First, machine translation services are used to translate English training reviews into Chinese reviews and also translate Chinese test reviews and additional unlabeled reviews into English reviews.",
        "Then, we can view the classification problem in two independent views: Chinese view with only Chinese features and English view with only English features.",

      "text": [
        "Overview",
        "The purpose of our approach is to make use of the annotated English corpus for sentiment polarity identification of Chinese reviews in a supervised framework, without using any Chinese resources.",
        "Given the labeled English reviews and unlabeled Chinese reviews, two straightforward methods for addressing the problem are as follows:",
        "1) We first learn a classifier based on the labeled English reviews, and then translate Chinese reviews into English reviews.",
        "Lastly, we use the classifier to classify the translated English reviews.",
        "2) We first translate the labeled English reviews into Chinese reviews, and then learn a classifier based on the translated Chinese reviews with labels.",
        "Lastly, we use the classifier to classify the unlabeled Chinese reviews.",
        "The above two methods have been used in (Banea et al., 2008) for Romanian subjectivity analysis, but the experimental results are not very promising.",
        "As shown in our experiments, the above two methods do not perform well for Chinese sentiment classification, either, because the underlying distribution between the original language and the translated language are different.",
        "In order to address the above problem, we propose to use the co-training approach to make use of some amounts of unlabeled Chinese reviews to improve the classification accuracy.",
        "The co-training approach can make full use of both the English features and the Chinese features in a unified framework.",
        "The framework of the proposed approach is illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "The framework consists of a training phase and a classification phase.",
        "In the training phase, the input is the labeled English reviews and some amounts of unlabeled Chinese reviews.",
        "The labeled English reviews are translated into labeled Chinese reviews, and the unlabeled Chinese reviews are translated into unlabeled English reviews, by using machine translation services.",
        "Therefore, each review is associated with an English version and a Chinese version.",
        "The English features and the Chinese features for each review are considered two independent and redundant views of the review.",
        "The co-training algorithm is then applied to learn two classifiers and finally the two classifiers are combined into a single sentiment classifier.",
        "In the classification phase, each unlabeled Chinese review for testing is first translated into English review, and then the learned classifier is applied to classify the review into either positive or negative.",
        "The steps of review translation and the co-training algorithm are described in details in the next sections, respectively.",
        "In order to overcome the language gap, we must translate one language into another language.",
        "Fortunately, machine translation techniques have been well developed in the NLP field, though the translation performance is far from satisfactory.",
        "A few commercial machine translation services can be publicly accessed, e.g. Google Translate, Yahoo Babel Fish and Windows Live Translate.",
        "In this study, we adopt Google Translate for both English-to-Chinese Translation and Chinese-to-English Translation, because it is one of the state-of-the-art commercial machine translation systems used today.",
        "Google Translate applies statistical learning techniques to build a translation model based on both monolingual text in the target language and aligned text consisting of examples of human translations between the languages.",
        "The co-training algorithm (Blum and Mitchell, 1998) is a typical bootstrapping method, which starts with a set of labeled data, and increase the amount of annotated data using some amounts of unlabeled data in an incremental way.",
        "One important aspect of co-training is that two conditional independent views are required for co-training to work, but the independence assumption can be relaxed.",
        "Till now, co-training has been successfully applied to statistical parsing (Sarkar, 2001), reference resolution (Ng and Cardie, 2003), part of speech tagging (Clark et al., 2003), word sense disambiguation (Mihalcea, 2004) and email classification (Kiritchenko and",
        "Matwin, 2001).",
        "In the context of cross-lingual sentiment classification, each labeled English review or unla-beled Chinese review has two views of features: English features and Chinese features.",
        "Here, a review is used to indicate both its Chinese version and its English version, until stated otherwise.",
        "The co-training algorithm is illustrated in Figure 2.",
        "In the algorithm, the class distribution in the labeled data is maintained by balancing the parameter values of p and n at each iteration.",
        "The intuition of the co-training algorithm is that if one classifier can confidently predict the class of an example, which is very similar to some of labeled ones, it can provide one more training example for the other classifier.",
        "But, of course, if this example happens to be easy to be classified by the first classifier, it does not mean that this example will be easy to be classified by the second classifier, so the second classifier will get useful information to improve itself and vice versa (Kiritchenko and Matwin, 2001).",
        "In the co-training algorithm, a basic classification algorithm is required to construct Cen and Ccn.",
        "Typical text classifiers include Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Maximum Entropy (ME), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), etc.",
        "In this study, we adopt the widely-used SVM classifier (Joachims, 2002).",
        "Viewing input data as two sets of vectors in a feature space, SVM constructs a separating hyperplane in the space by maximizing the margin between the two data sets.",
        "The English or Chinese features used in this study include both unigrams and bigrams and the feature weight is simply set to term frequency.",
        "Feature selection methods (e.g.",
        "Document Frequency (DF), Information Gain (IG), and Mutual Information (MI)) can be used for dimension reduction.",
        "But we use all the features in the experiments for comparative analysis, because there is no significant performance improvement after applying the feature selection techniques in our empirical study.",
        "The output value of the SVM classifier for a review indicates the confidence level of the review's classification.",
        "Usually, the sentiment polarity of a review is indicated by the sign of the prediction value.",

        "We normalize the prediction values into [-1, 1] by dividing the maximum absolute value.",
        "Finally, the average of the normalized values is used as the overall prediction value of the review.",
        "The following three datasets were collected and used in the experiments:",
        "Test Set (Labeled Chinese Reviews): In order to assess the performance of the proposed approach, we collected and labeled 886 product reviews (451 positive reviews + 435 negative reviews) from a popular Chinese IT product web site-IT168.",
        "The reviews focused on such products as mp3 players, mobile phones, digital camera and laptop computers.",
        "Training Set (Labeled English Reviews):",
        "There are many labeled English corpora available on the Web and we used the corpus constructed for multi-domain sentiment classification (Blitzer et al., 2007), because the corpus was large-scale and it was within similar domains as the test set.",
        "The dataset consisted of 8000 Amazon product reviews (4000 positive reviews + 4000 negative reviews) for four different product types: books, DVDs, electronics and kitchen appliances.",
        "Unlabeled Set (Unlabeled Chinese Reviews):",
        "We downloaded additional 1000 Chinese product reviews from IT168 and used the reviews as the unlabeled set.",
        "Therefore, the unlabeled set and the test set were in the same domain and had similar underlying feature distributions.",
        "Each Chinese review was translated into English review, and each English review was translated into Chinese review.",
        "Therefore, each review has two independent views: English view and Chinese view.",
        "A review is represented by both its English view and its Chinese view.",
