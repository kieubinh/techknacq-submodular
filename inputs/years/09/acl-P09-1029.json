        "Most notable and widely used are Multi-Perspective Question Answering (MPQA) and Movie-review datasets.",
        "MPQA is a collection of newspaper articles annotated with opinions and private states at the subsentence level (Wiebe et al., 2003).",
        "Movie-review dataset consists of positive and negative reviews from the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) archive (Pang et al., 2002).",
        "Evaluation workshops such as TREC and NT-CIR have recently joined in this new trend of research and organized a number of successful meetings.",
        "At the TREC Blog Track meetings, researchers have dealt with the problem of retrieving topically-relevant blog posts and identifying documents with opinionated contents (Ounis et al., 2008).",
        "NTCIR Multilingual Opinion Analysis Task (MOAT) shared a similar mission, where participants are provided with a number of topics and a set of relevant newspaper articles for each topic, and asked to extract opinion-related properties from enclosed sentences (Seki et al., 2008).",
        "Previous studies for sentiment analysis belong to either the data-driven approach where an annotated corpus is used to train a machine learning (ML) classifier, or to the lexicon-based approach where a pre-compiled list of sentiment terms is utilized to build a sentiment score function.",
        "This paper introduces an approach to the sentiment analysis tasks with an emphasis on how to represent and evaluate the weights of sentiment terms.",
        "We propose a number of characteristics of good sentiment terms from the perspectives of in-formativeness, prominence, topic-relevance, and semantic aspects using collection statistics, contextual information, semantic associations as well as opinion-related properties of terms.",

        "Pang et al.",
        "(2002) employed n-gram and POS features for ML methods to classify movie-review data.",

        "While these features are usually employed by data-driven approaches, there are unsupervised approaches for sentiment analysis that make use of a set of terms that are semantically oriented toward expressing subjective statements (Yu and Hatzi-vassiloglou, 2003).",
        "Accordingly, much research has focused on recognizing terms' semantic orientations and strength, and compiling sentiment lexicons (Hatzivassiloglou and Mckeown, 1997; Turney and Littman, 2003; Kamps et al., 2004; Whitelaw et al., 2005; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006).",

        "Its task is to find relevant documents that also contain sentiments about a given topic.",
        "Generally, the opinion retrieval task has been approached as a two-stage task: first, retrieving topically relevant documents, then reranking the documents by the opinion scores (Ounis et al., 2006).",
        "This approach is also appropriate for evaluation systems such as NTCIR MOAT that assumes that the set of topically relevant documents are already known in advance.",

        "In this section, we describe the characteristics of terms that are useful in sentiment analysis, and present our sentiment analysis model as part of an opinion retrieval system and an ML sentiment classifier.",
        "This section examines the qualities of useful terms for sentiment analysis tasks and corresponding features.",
        "For the sake of organization, we categorize the sources of features into either global or local knowledge, and either topic-independent or topic-dependent knowledge.",
        "Topic-independently speaking, a good sentiment term is discriminative and prominent, such that the appearance of the term imposes greater influence on the judgment of the analysis system.",
        "The rare occurrence of terms in document collections has been regarded as a very important feature in IR methods, and effective IR models of today, either explicitly or implicitly, accommodate this feature as an Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) heuristic (Fang et al., 2004).",
        "Similarly, prominence of a term is recognized by the frequency of the term in its local context, formulated as Term Frequency (TF) in IR.",
        "If a topic of the text is known, terms that are relevant and descriptive of the subject should be regarded to be more useful than topically-irrelevant and extraneous terms.",
        "One way of measuring this is using associations between the query and terms.",
        "Statistical measures of associations between terms include estimations by the co-occurrence in the whole collection, such as Point-wise Mutual Information (PMI) and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA).",
        "Another method is to use proximal information of the query and the word, using syntactic structure such as dependency relations of words that provide the graphical representation of the text (Mullen and Collier, 2004).",
        "The minimum spans of words in such graph may represent their associations in the text.",
        "Also, the distance between words in the local context or in the thesauruslike dictionaries such as WordNet may be approximated as such measure.",
        "The goal of an opinion retrieval system is to find a set of opinionated documents that are relevant to a given topic.",
        "We decompose the opinion retrieval system into two tasks: the topical retrieval task and the sentiment analysis task.",
        "This two-stage approach for opinion retrieval has been taken by many systems and has been shown to perform well (Ounis et al., 2006).",
        "The topic and the sentiment aspects of the opinion retrieval task are modeled separately, and linearly combined together to produce a list of topically-relevant and opinionated documents as below.",
        "The topic-relevance model Scorerei may be substituted by any IR system that retrieves relevant documents for the query Q.",
        "For tasks such as NTCIR MOAT, relevant documents are already known in advance and it becomes unnecessary to estimate the relevance degree of the documents.",
        "We focus on modeling the sentiment aspect of the opinion retrieval task, assuming that the topic-relevance of documents is provided in some way.",

        "Assuming uniform prior probabilities of documents D, query Q, and Op, and conditional independence between Q and Op, the opinion score function reduces to estimating the generative probability of Q and Op given D.",
        "If we regard that the document D is represented as a bag of words and that the words are uniformly distributed, then",
        "Equation 1 consists of three factors: the probability of a word to be opinionated (P(Op|w)), the likelihood of a query given a word (P(Q|w)), and the probability of a document generating a word (P(w|D)).",
        "Intuitively speaking, the probability of a document embodying topically related opinion is estimated by accumulating the probabilities of all words from the document to have sentiment meanings and associations with the given query.",

        "The size, format, specificity, and reliability differ in all these lexicons.",
        "For example, lexicon sizes range from a few hundred to several hundred thousand.",
        "Some lexicons assign real number scores to indicate sentiment orientations and strengths (i.e. probabilities of having positive and negative sentiments) (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006) while other lexicons assign discrete classes (weak/strong, positive/negative) (Wilson et al., 2005).",
        "There are manually compiled lexicons (Stone et al., 1966) while some are created semi-automatically by expanding a set of seed terms (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006).",
        "The goal of this paper is not to create or choose an appropriate sentiment lexicon, but rather it is to discover useful term features other than the sentiment properties.",
        "For this reason, one sentiment lexicon, namely SentiWordNet, is utilized throughout the whole experiment.",
        "SentiWordNet is an automatically generated sentiment lexicon using a semi-supervised method (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006).",
        "It consists of WordNet synsets, where each synset is assigned three probability scores that add up to 1: positive, negative, and objective.",
