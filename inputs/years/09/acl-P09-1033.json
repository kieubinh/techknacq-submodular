        "Most current approaches to language analysis assume that the structure of a sentence depends on the lexical semantics of the verb and of other predicates in the sentence.",
        "It is also assumed that only certain aspects of a sentence meaning are gram-maticalised.",
        "Semantic role labels are the representation of the grammatically relevant aspects of a sentence meaning.",
        "Capturing the nature and the number of semantic roles in a sentence is therefore fundamental to correctly describe the interface between grammar and meaning, and it is of paramount importance for all natural language processing (NLP) applications that attempt to extract meaning representations from analysed text, such as question-answering systems or even machine translation.",
        "The role of theories of semantic role lists is to obtain a set of semantic roles that can apply to any argument of any verb, to provide an unambiguous identifier of the grammatical roles of the participants in the event described by the sentence (Dowty, 1991).",
        "Starting from the first proposals (Gruber, 1965; Fillmore, 1968; Jackendoff, 1972), several approaches have been put forth, ranging from a combination of very few roles to lists of very fine-grained specificity.",
        "(See Levin and Rap-paport Hovav (2005) for an exhaustive review).",
        "In NLP, several proposals have been put forth in recent years and adopted in the annotation of large samples of text (Baker et al., 1998; Palmer et al., 2005; Kipper, 2005; Loper et al., 2007).",
        "The annotated PropBank corpus, and therefore implicitly its role labels inventory, has been largely adopted in NLP because of its exhaustiveness and because it is coupled with syntactic annotation, properties that make it very attractive for the automatic learning of these roles and their further applications to NLP tasks.",
        "However, the labelling choices made by PropBank have recently come under scrutiny (Zapirain et al., 2008; Loper et al., 2007; Yi et al., 2007).",
        "The annotation of PropBank labels has been conceived in a two-tiered fashion.",
        "A first tier assigns abstract labels such as ARG0 or ARG1, while a separate annotation records the second-tier, verb-sense specific meaning of these labels.",
        "Labels ARG0 or ARG1 are assigned to the most prominent argument in the sentence (ARG1 for unaccusative verbs and ARG0 for all other verbs).",
        "The other labels are assigned in the order of prominence.",
        "So, while the same high-level labels are used across verbs, they could have different meanings for different verb senses.",
        "Researchers have usually concentrated on the high-level annotation, but as indicated in Yi et al.",
        "(2007), there is reason to think that these labels do not generalise across verbs, nor to unseen verbs or to novel verb senses.",
        "Because the meaning of the role annotation is verb-specific, there is also reason to think that it fragments the data and creates data sparseness, making automatic learning from examples more difficult.",
        "These shortcomings are more apparent in the annotation of less prominent and less frequent roles, marked by the ARG2 to ARG5 labels.",
        "Yi et al.",
        "(2007) investigated the ability of the Prop-Bank role inventory to generalise compared to the annotation in another semantic role list, proposed in the electronic dictionary VerbNet.",
        "VerbNet labels are assigned in a verb-class specific way and have been devised to be more similar to the inventories of thematic role lists usually proposed by linguists.",
        "The results in these papers are conflicting.",
        "show that augmenting PropBank labels with VerbNet labels increases generalisation of the less frequent labels, such as ARG2, to new verbs and new domains, they also show that PropBank labels perform better overall, in a semantic role labelling task.",
        "Confirming this latter result, Zapirain et al.",
        "(2008) find that PropBank role labels are more robust than VerbNet labels in predicting new verb usages, unseen verbs, and they port better to new domains.",
        "The apparent contradiction of these results can be due to several confounding factors in the experiments.",
        "First, the argument labels for which the VerbNet improvement was found are infrequent, and might therefore not have influenced the overall results enough to counterbalance new errors introduced by the finer-grained annotation scheme; second, the learning methods in both these experimental settings are largely based on syntactic information, thereby confounding learning and generalisation due to syntax – which would favour the more syntactically-driven PropBank annotation – with learning due to greater generality of the semantic role annotation; finally, task-specific learning-based experiments do not guarantee that the learners be sufficiently powerful to make use of the full generality of the semantic role labels.",
        "In this paper, we compare the two annotation schemes, analysing how well they fare in capturing the linguistic generalisations that are known to hold for semantic role labels, and consequently how well they grammaticalise aspects of meaning.",
        "Because the well-attested strong correlation between syntactic structure and semantic role labels (Levin and Rappaport Hovav, 2005; Merlo and Stevenson, 2001) could intervene as a confounding factor in this analysis, we expressly limit our investigation to data analyses and statistical measures that do not exploit syntactic properties or parsing techniques.",
        "The conclusions reached this way are not task-specific and are therefore widely applicable.",
        "To preview, based on results in section 3, we conclude that PropBank is easier to learn, but VerbNet is more informative in general, it generalises better to new role instances and its labels are more strongly correlated to specific verbs.",
        "In section 4, we show that VerbNet labels provide finer-grained specificity.",
        "PropBank labels are more concentrated on a few VerbNet labels at higher frequency.",
        "This is not true at low frequency, where VerbNet provides disambiguations to overloaded PropBank variables.",
        "Practically, these two sets of results indicate that both annotation schemes could be useful in different circumstances, and at different frequency bands.",
        "In section 5, we report results indicating that PropBank role sets are highlevel abstractions of VerbNet role sets and that VerbNet role sets are more verb and class-specific.",
        "In section 6, we show that PropBank more closely captures the thematic hierarchy and is more correlated to grammatical functions, hence potentially more useful for semantic role labelling, for learners whose features are based on the syntactic tree.",
        "Finally, in section 7, we summarise some previous results, and we provide new statistical evidence to argue that VerbNet labels are more general across verbs.",
        "These conclusions are reached by task-independent statistical analyses.",
        "The data and the measures used to reach these conclusions are discussed in the next section."

        "It defines a limited role typology.",
        "Roles are specified for each verb individually.",
        "Verbal predicates in the Penn Treebank (PTB) receive a label REL and their arguments are annotated with abstract semantic role labels A0-A5 or AA for those complements of the predicative verb that are considered arguments, while those complements of the verb labelled with a semantic functional label in the original PTB receive the composite semantic role label AM-X, where X stands for labels such as LOC, TMP or ADV, for locative, temporal and adverbial modifiers respectively.",
        "Prop-Bank uses two levels of granularity in its annotation, at least conceptually.",
        "Arguments receiving labels A0-A5 or AA do not express consistent semantic roles and are specific to a verb, while arguments receiving an AM-X label are supposed to be adjuncts and the respective roles they express are consistent across all verbs.",
        "However, among argument labels, A0 and A1 are assigned attempting to capture Proto-Agent and Proto-Patient properties (Dowty, 1991).",
        "They are, therefore, more valid across verbs and verb instances than the A2-A5 labels.",
        "Numerical results in Yi et al.",
        "(2007) show that 85% of A0 occurrences translate into Agent roles and more than 45% instances of A1 map into Patient and Patient-like roles, using a VerbNet labelling scheme.",

        "VerbNet is a lexical resource for English verbs, yielding argumental and thematic information (Kipper, 2005).",
        "VerbNet resembles WordNet in spirit, it provides a verbal lexicon tying verbal semantics (theta-roles and selectional restrictions) to verbal distributional syntax.",

        "The list of thematic roles can be seen in the first column of",
        "Table 4.",

        "Following previous work (Loper et al., 2007), we define equivalence classes of VerbNet labels.",
        "We will refer to these classes as VerbNet groups.",
        "The groups we define are illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "Notice also that all our comparisons, like previous work, will be limited to the obligatory arguments in PropBank, the A0 to A5, AA arguments, to be comparable to VerbNet.",
        "VerbNet is a lexicon and by definition it does not list optional modifiers (the arguments labelled AM-X in PropBank).",
        "In order to support the joint use of both these resources and their comparison, SemLink has been developed (Loper et al., 2007).",
        "SemLink provides mappings from PropBank to VerbNet for the WSJ portion of the Penn Treebank.",
        "The mapping have been annotated automatically by a two-stage process: a lexical mapping and an instance classifier (Loper et al., 2007).",
        "The results were hand-corrected.",
        "In addition to semantic roles for both PropBank and VerbNet, SemLink contains information about verbs, their senses and their VerbNet classes which are extensions of Levin's classes.",
        "The annotations in SemLink 1.1. are not complete.",
        "In the analyses presented here, we have only considered occurrences of semantic roles for which both a PropBank and a VerbNet label is available in the data (roughly 45% of the Prop-Bank semantic roles have a VerbNet semantic role).",
        "Furthermore, we perform our analyses on training and development data only.",
        "This means that we left section 23 of the Wall Street Journal out.",
        "The analyses are done on the basis of 106,459 semantic role pairs.",
        "For the analysis concerning the correlation between semantic roles and syntactic dependencies in Section 6, we merged the SemLink data with the non-projectivised gold data of the CoNNL 2008 shared task on syntactic and semantic dependency parsing (Surdeanu et al., 2008).",
        "Only those dependencies that bear both a syntactic and a semantic label have been counted for test and development set.",
        "We have discarded discontinous arguments.",
        "Analyses are based on 68,268 dependencies in total.",
        "In the following sections, we will use simple proportions, entropy, joint entropy, conditional entropy, mutual information, and a normalised form of mutual information which measures correlation between nominal attributes called symmetric uncertainty (Witten and Frank, 2005, 291).",

        "We measure here simply the correlation as indicated by the symmetric uncertainty of the joint distribution of role sets by verbs and of role sets by verb classes, for each of the two annotation schemes.",
        "We find that the correlation between PropBank role sets and verb classes is weaker than the correlation between VerbNet role sets and verb classes, as expected (PropBank: U=0.2l vs VerbNet: U=0.46).",
        "We also find that correlation between PropBank role sets and verbs is weaker than the correlation between VerbNet role sets and verbs (PropBank: U=0.23 vs VerbNet U=0.43).",
        "Notice that this result holds for VerbNet role label groups, and is therefore not a side-effect of a different size in role inventory.",
        "This result confirms our findings reported in Table 2, which showed a larger degradation of VerbNet labels in the absence of verb information.",
        "If we analyse the data, we see that many role sets that form one single set in PropBank are split into several sets in VerbNet, with those roles that are different being roles that in PropBank form a group.",
        "So, for example, a role list (A0, Al) in PropBank will corresponds to l4 different lists in VerbNet (when using the groups).",
        "The three most frequent VerbNet role sets describe 86% of the cases: (Agent, Predattr) 71%, (InstrCause, Pre-dAttr) 9%, and (Agent, Patient) 6% .",
        "Using the original VerbNet labels - a very small sample of the most frequent ones is reported in Table 5 – we find 39 different sets.",
        "Conversely, we see that VerbNet sets corresponds to few PropBank sets, even for high frequency.",
        "The third conclusion we can draw then is twofold.",
        "First, while VerbNet labels have been assigned to be valid across verbs, as confirmed by their ability to enter in many combinations, these combinations are more verb and class-specific than combinations in PropBank.",
        "Second, the finegrained, coarse-grained correspondence of annotations between VerbNet and PropBank that was illustrated by the results in Section 4 is also borne out when we look at role sets: PropBank role sets appear to be high-level abstractions of VerbNet role sets.",
        "6 Semantic Roles and Grammatical Functions: the Thematic Hierarchy",
        "A different kind of context-dependence is provided by thematic hierarchies.",
        "It is a well-attested fact that lexical semantic properties described by semantic roles and grammatical functions appear to be distributed according to prominence scales (Levin and Rappaport Hovav, 2005).",
        "Semantic roles are organized according to the thematic hierarchy (one proposal among many is Agent > Experiencer> Goal/Source/Location> Patient (Grimshaw, l990)).",
        "This hierarchy captures the fact that the options for the structural realisation of a particular argument do not depend only on its role, but also on the roles of other arguments.",
        "For example in psychological verbs, the position of the Experiencer as a syntactic subject or object depends on whether the other role in the sentence is a Stimulus, hence lower in the hierarchy, as in the psychological verbs of the fear class or an Agent/Cause as in the frighten class.",
        "Two prominence scales can combine by matching elements harmonically, higher elements with higher elements and lower with lower (Aissen, 2003).",
        "Grammatical functions are also distributed according to a prominence scale.",
        "Thus, we find that most subjects are Agents, most objects are Patients or Themes, and most indirect objects are Goals, for example.",
        "The semantic role inventory, thus, should show a certain correlation with the inventory of grammatical functions.",
        "However, perfect correlation is clearly not expected as in this case the two levels of representation would be linguistically and computationally redundant.",
        "Because PropBank was annotated according to argument prominence, we expect to see that PropBank reflects relationships between syntax and semantic role labels more strongly than VerbNet.",
        "Comparing syntactic dependency labels to their corresponding PropBank or VerbNet groups labels (groups are used to eliminate the confound of different inventory sizes), we find that the joint entropy of PropBank and dependency labels is 2.6l bits while the joint entropy of VerbNet and dependency labels is 3.32 bits.",
        "The symmetric uncertainty of PropBank and dependency labels is 0.49, while the symmetric uncertainty of VerbNet and dependency labels is 0.39.",

        "Since we know that PropBank is more closely related to grammatical function and syntactic annotation than VerbNet, as indicated above in Section 6, then these results could simply indicate that parsing predicts PropBank labels better because they are more closely related to syntactic labels, and not because the semantic roles inventory is more general.",
        "Several of the findings in the previous sections shed light on the generality of the semantic roles in the two inventories.",
