        "However, estimating the system output quality according to its similarity to human references is not a trivial task.",
        "The main problem is that many NLP tasks are open/subjective; therefore, different humans may generate different outputs, all of them equally valid.",
        "Thus, language variability is an issue.",
        "In order to tackle language variability in the context of Machine Translation, a considerable effort has also been made to include deeper linguistic information in automatic evaluation metrics, both syntactic and semantic (see Section 2 for details).",
        "However, the most commonly used metrics are still based on n-gram matching.",
        "The reason is that the advantages of employing higher linguistic processing levels have not been clarified yet.",
        "The main goal of our work is to analyze to what extent deep linguistic features can contribute to the automatic evaluation of translation quality.",
        "For that purpose, we compare - using four different test beds - the performance of 16 n-gram based metrics, 48 linguistic metrics and one combined metric from the state of the art.",
        "Analyzing the reliability of evaluation metrics requires meta-evaluation criteria.",
        "In this respect, we identify important drawbacks of the standard meta-evaluation methods based on correlation with human judgements.",
        "In order to overcome these drawbacks, we then introduce six novel meta-evaluation criteria which represent different metric reliability dimensions.",
        "Our analysis indicates that: (i) both lexical and linguistic metrics have complementary advantages and different drawbacks; (ii) combining both kinds of metrics is a more effective and robust evaluation method across all meta-evaluation criteria.",
        "In addition, we also perform a qualitative analysis of one hundred sentences that were incorrectly evaluated by state-of-the-art metrics.",
        "The analysis confirms that deep linguistic techniques are necessary to avoid the most common types of error.",

        "They found out that lexical metrics fail to produce reliable evaluation scores.",
        "They favor systems which share the expected reference sublanguage (e.g., statistical) and penalize those which do not (e.g., LinearB).",
        "We can find in our test bed many instances in which the statistical systems obtain a metric score similar to the assisted system while achieving a lower mark according to human assessors.",
        "For instance, for the following translations, ROUGELassigns a slightly higher score to the output of a statistical system which contains a lot of grammatical and syntactical failures.",

        "In order to check the metric resistance to be cheated by translations with high lexical overlapping, we estimate the quality decrease that we could cause if we optimized the human-aided translations according to the automatic metric.",
        "For this, we consider in each translation case c, the worse automatic translation t that equals or improves the human-aided translation th according to the automatic metric m. Formally the averaged quality decrease is:",

        "Figure 5 illustrates the results obtained.",
        "All metrics are suitable to be cheated, assigning similar or higher scores to worse translations.",
        "However, linguistic metrics are more resistant.",
        "In addition, the combined metric ULC obtains the best results, better than both linguistic and n-gram based metrics.",
        "Our conclusion is that including higher linguistic levels in metrics is relevant to prevent ungrammatical n-gram matching to achieve similar scores than grammatical constructions.",
        "In order to obtain additional evidence about the usefulness of combining evaluation metrics at different processing levels, let us consider the following situation: given a set of reference translations we want to train a combined system that takes the most appropriate translation approach for each text segment.",
        "We consider the set of translations system presented in each competition as the translation approaches pool.",
        "Then, the upper bound on the quality of the combined system is given by the predictive power of the employed automatic evaluation metric.",
        "This upper bound is obtained by selecting the highest scored translation t according to a specific metric m for each translation case c. The Oracle System Test (OST) consists of computing the averaged human assessed quality Qhof the selected translations according to human assessors across all cases.",
        "Formally:",
        "We use the sum of adequacy and fluency, both in a 1-5 scale, as a global quality measure.",
        "Thus, OST scores are in a 2-10 range.",
        "In summary, the OST represents the best combined system that could be trained according to a specific automatic evaluation metric.",
        "Table 4 shows OST values obtained for the best metrics.",
        "In the table we have also included a random, a maximum (always pick the best translation according to humans) and a minimum (always pick the worse translation according to human) OST for all .",
        "The most remarkable result in Table 4 is that metrics are closer to the random baseline than to the upperbound (maximum OST).",
        "This result confirms the idea that an improvement on metric reliability could contribute considerably to the systems optimization process.",
        "However, the key point is that the combined metric, ULC, improves all the others (5.79 vs. 5.71), indicating the importance of combining n-gram and linguistic features."

        "On the other hand, linguistically motivated metrics improve n-gram metrics in two ways: (i) they achieve higher correlation with human judgements at system level and (ii) they are more resistant to reward poor translations with high word overlapping with references.",
        "The underlying phenomenon is that, rather than managing the linguistics variability, linguistic based metrics introduce additional restrictions for assigning high scores.",
        "This effect decreases the recall over significant system improvements achieved by n-gram based metrics and does not solve the problem of detecting wrong translations.",
        "Linguistic metrics, however, are more difficult to cheat.",
        "In general, the greatest pitfall of metrics is the low reliability of low metric values.",
        "Our qualitative analysis of evaluated sentences has shown that deeper linguistic techniques are necessary to overcome the important surface differences between acceptable automatic translations and human references.",
        "But our key finding is that combining both kinds of metrics gives top performance according to every meta-evaluation criteria.",
        "In addition, our Combined System Test shows that, when training a combined translation system, using metrics at several linguistic processing levels improves substantially the use of individual metrics.",
        "In summary, our results motivate: (i) working on new linguistic metrics for overcoming the barrier of linguistic variability and (ii) performing new metric combining schemes based on linear regression over human judgements (Kulesza and Shieber, 2004), training models over human/machine discrimination (Albrecht and Hwa, 2007) or non parametric methods based on reference to reference distances (Amigo et al., 2005)."
