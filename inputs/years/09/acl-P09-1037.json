        "Hierarchical phrase-based models (Chiang, 2005; Chiang, 2007) offer a number of attractive benefits in statistical machine translation (SMT), while maintaining the strengths of phrase-based systems (Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "The most important of these is the ability to model long-distance reordering efficiently.",
        "To model such a reordering, a hierarchical phrase-based system demands no additional parameters, since long and short distance reorderings are modeled identically using synchronous context free grammar (SCFG) rules.",
        "The same rule, depending on its topological ordering - i.e. its position in the hierarchical structure - can affect both short and long spans of text.",
        "Interestingly, hierarchical phrase-based models provide this benefit without making any linguistic commitments beyond the structure of the model.",
        "However, the system's lack of linguistic commitment is also responsible for one of its greatest drawbacks.",
        "In the absence of linguistic knowledge, the system models linguistic structure using an SCFG that contains only one type of nonterminal symbol.",
        "As a result, the system is susceptible to the overgeneration problem: the grammar may suggest more reordering choices than appropriate, and many of those choices lead to ungrammatical translations.",
        "Chiang (2005) hypothesized that incorrect reordering choices would often correspond to hierarchical phrases that violate syntactic boundaries in the source language, and he explored the use of a \"constituent feature\" intended to reward the application of hierarchical phrases which respect source language syntactic categories.",
        "Although this did not yield significant improvements, Mar-ton and Resnik (2008) and Chiang et al.",
        "(2008) extended this approach by introducing soft syntactic constraints similar to the constituent feature, but more fine-grained and sensitive to distinctions among syntactic categories; these led to substantial improvements in performance.",
        "Zollman et al.",
        "(2006) took a complementary approach, constraining the application of hierarchical rules to respect syntactic boundaries in the target language syntax.",
        "Whether the focus is on constraints from the source language or the target language, the main ingredient in both previous approaches is the idea of constraining the spans of hierarchical phrases to respect syntactic boundaries.",
        "In this paper, we pursue a different approach to improving reordering choices in a hierarchical phrase-based model.",
        "Instead of biasing the model toward hierarchical phrases whose spans respect syntactic boundaries, we focus on the topological ordering of phrases in the hierarchical structure.",
        "We conjecture that since incorrect reordering choices correspond to incorrect topological orderings, boosting the probability of correct topo-",
        "'in practice, one additional nonterminal symbol is used in \"glue rules\".",
        "This is not relevant in the present discussion.",
        "logical ordering choices should improve the system.",
        "Although related to previous proposals (correct topological orderings lead to correct spans and vice versa), our proposal incorporates broader context and is structurally more aware, since we look at the topological ordering of a phrase relative to other phrases, rather than modeling additional properties of a phrase in isolation.",
        "In addition, our proposal requires no monolingual parsing or linguistically informed syntactic modeling for either the source or target language.",
        "The key to our approach is the observation that we can approximate the topological ordering of hierarchical phrases via the topological ordering of function words.",
        "We introduce a statistical reordering model that we call the pairwise dominance model, which characterizes reorderings of phrases around a pair of function words.",
        "In modeling function words, our model can be viewed as a successor to the function words-centric reordering model (Setiawan et al., 2007), expanding on the previous approach by modeling pairs of function words rather than individual function words in isolation.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we briefly review hierarchical phrase-based models.",
        "In Section 3, we first describe the overgeneration problem in more detail with a concrete example, and then motivate our idea of using the topological ordering of function words to address the problem.",
        "In Section 4, we develop our idea by introducing the pairwise dominance model, expressing function word relationships in terms of what we call the the dominance predicate.",
        "In Section 5, we describe an algorithm to estimate the parameters of the dominance predicate from parallel text.",
        "In Sections 6 and 7, we describe our experiments, and in Section 8, we analyze the output of our system and lay out a possible future direction.",
        "Section 9 discusses the relation of our approach to prior work and Section 10 wraps up with our conclusions."

        "Perhaps surprisingly, translation performance, 30.90 BLEU, was around the level we obtained when using frequency to approximate function words at N = 64.",
        "However, we observe that many of the words in the linguistically motivated function word list are quite infrequent; this suggests that data sparseness may be an additional factor worth investigating.",
        "Finally, although we believe there are strong motivations for focusing on the role of function words in reordering, there may well be value in extending the dominance model to include content categories.",
        "Verbs and many nouns have subcat-egorization properties that may influence phrase ordering, for example, and this may turn out to explain the increase in Arabic-English performance for N = 2048 using the MT08 test set.",
        "More generally, the approach we are taking can be viewed as a way of selectively lexicalizing the automatically extracted grammar, and there is a large range of potentially interesting choices in how such lex-icalization could be done."
