        "Early approaches to parsing assumed a grammar provided by human experts (Quirk et al., 1985).",
        "Later approaches avoided grammar writing by learning the grammar from sentences explicitly annotated with their syntactic structure (Black et al., 1992).",
        "While such supervised approaches have yielded accurate parsers (Charniak, 2001), the syntactic annotation of corpora such as the Penn Treebank is extremely costly, and consequently there are few treebanks of comparable size.",
        "As a result, there has been recent interest in unsupervised parsing.",
        "However, in order to attain reasonable accuracy, these methods have to be carefully biased towards the desired syntactic structure.",
        "This weak supervision has been encoded using priors and initializations (Klein and Manning, 2004; Smith, 2006), specialized models (Klein and Manning, 2004; Seginer, 2007; Bod, 2006), and implicit negative evidence (Smith, 2006).",
        "These indirect methods for leveraging prior knowledge can be cumbersome and unintuitive for a non-machine-learning expert.",
        "This paper proposes a method for directly guiding the learning of dependency parsers with naturally encoded linguistic insights.",
        "Generalized expectation (GE) (Mann and McCallum, 2008; Druck et al., 2008) is a recently proposed framework for incorporating prior knowledge into the learning of conditional random fields (CRFs) (Laf-ferty et al., 2001).",
        "GE criteria express a preference on the value of a model expectation.",
        "For example, we know that \"in English, when a determiner is directly to the left of a noun, the noun is usually the parent of the determiner\".",
        "With GE we may add a term to the objective function that encourages a feature-rich CRF to match this expectation on un-labeled data, and in the process learn about related features.",
        "In this paper we use a non-projective dependency tree CRF (Smith and Smith, 2007).",
        "While a complete exploration of linguistic prior knowledge for dependency parsing is beyond the scope of this paper, we provide several promising demonstrations of the proposed method.",
        "On the English WSJ10 data set, GE training outperforms two prominent unsupervised methods using only 20 constraints either elicited from a human or provided by an \"oracle\" simulating a human.",
        "We also present experiments on longer sentences in Dutch, Spanish, and Turkish in which we obtain accuracy comparable to supervised learning with tens to hundreds of complete parsed sentences."

        "This work is closely related to the prototype-driven grammar induction method of Haghighi and Klein (2006), which uses prototype phrases to guide the EM algorithm in learning a PCFG.",
        "Direct comparison with this method is not possible because we are interested in dependency syntax rather than phrase structure syntax.",
        "However, the approach we advocate has several significant advantages.",
        "GE is more general than prototype-driven learning because GE constraints can be uncertain.",
        "Additionally prototype-driven grammar induction needs to be used in conjunction with other unsupervised methods (distributional similarity and CCM (Klein and Manning, 2004)) to attain reasonable accuracy, and is only evaluated on length 10 or less sentences with no lexical information.",
        "In contrast, GE uses only the provided constraints and unparsed sentences, and is used to train a feature-rich discriminative model.",

        "Smith and Eisner (2007) apply entropy regularization to dependency parsing.",
        "The above methods can be applied to small seed corpora, but McDonald has criticized such methods as working from an unrealistic premise, as a significant amount of the effort required to build a treebank comes in the first 100 sentences (both because of the time it takes to create an appropriate rubric and to train annotators).",
        "There are also a number of methods for unsupervised learning of dependency parsers.",
        "Klein and Manning (2004) use a carefully initialized and structured generative model (DMV) in conjunction with the EM algorithm to get the first positive results on unsupervised dependency parsing.",
        "As empirical evidence of the sensitivity of DMV to initialization, Smith (2006) (pg.",
        "37) uses three different initializations, and only one, the method of Klein and Manning (2004), gives accuracy higher than 31% on the WSJ10 corpus (see Section 5).",
        "This initialization encodes the prior knowledge that long distance attachments are unlikely.",
        "Smith and Eisner (2005) develop contrastive estimation (CE), in which the model is encouraged to move probability mass away from implicit negative examples defined using a carefully chosen neighborhood function.",
        "For instance, Smith (2006) (pg.",
        "82) uses eight different neighborhood functions to estimate parameters for the DMV model.",
        "The best performing neighborhood function DEL1ORTRANS1 provides accuracy of 57.6% on WSJ10 (see Section 5).",
        "Another neighborhood, DEL1ORTRANS2, provides accuracy of 51.2%.",
        "The remaining six neighborhood functions provide accuracy below 50%.",
        "This demonstrates that constructing an appropriate neighborhood function can be delicate and challenging.",
        "Smith and Eisner (2006) propose structural annealing (SA), in which a strong bias for local dependency attachments is enforced early in learning, and then gradually relaxed.",
        "This method is sensitive to the annealing schedule.",

        "Finally, Seginer (2007) and Bod (2006) approach unsupervised parsing by constructing novel syntactic models.",
        "The development and tuning of the above methods constitute the encoding of prior domain knowledge about the desired syntactic structure.",

        "A generalized expectation term G(A) is defined by a constraint function G(y, x) that returns a non-negative real value given input and output variables, an empirical distribution p(x) over input variables (i.e. unlabeled data), a model distribution p\\(y |x), and a score function S:",

        "GE has been applied to logistic regression models (Mann and McCallum, 2007; Druck et al., 2008) and linear chain CRFs (Mann and McCallum, 2008).",

        "The probability of an output y conditioned on an input x is where Fj are feature functions over the cliques of the graphical model and Z (x) is a normalizing constant that ensures PA(y|x) sums to 1.",

        "Equation 2 has an intuitive interpretation.",
        "The first term (on the first line) is the difference between the model and target expectations.",
        "The second term (the rest of the equation) is the predicted covariance between the constraint function G and the model feature function Fj.",
        "Therefore, if the constraint is not satisfied, GE updates parameters for features that the model predicts are related to the constraint function.",
        "If there are constraint functions G for all model feature functions Fj, and the target expectations G are estimated from labeled data, then the globally optimal parameter setting under the GE objective function is equivalent to the maximum likelihood solution.",
        "However, GE does not require such a one-to-one correspondence between constraint functions and model feature functions.",
        "This allows bootstrapping of feature-rich models with a small number of prior expectation constraints.",
        "We now define a CRF p\\ (y |x) for unlabeled, non-projective dependency parsing.",
        "The tree y is represented as a vector of the same length as the sentence, where y is the index of the parent of word i.",
        "The probability of a tree y given sentence x is where fj are edge-factored feature functions that consider the child input (word, tag, or other feature), the parent input, and the rest of the sentence.",
        "This factorization implies that dependency decisions are independent conditioned on the input sentence x if y is a tree.",
        "Computing Zx and the edge expectations needed for partial derivatives requires summing over all possible trees for x.",
        "By relating the sum of the scores of all possible trees to counting the number of spanning trees in a graph, it can be shown that Zx is the determinant of the Kirchoff matrix K, which is constructed using the scores of possible edges.",
        "(McDonald and Satta, 2007; Smith and Smith, 2007).",
        "Computing the determinant takes O(n) time, where n is the length of the sentence.",

        "The marginal p(y = k|x; 0) can be computed by dividing this score by Zx (McDonald and Satta, 2007).",

        "Smith and Smith (2007) describe a more efficient algorithm that can compute all edge expectations in O(n) time using the inverse of the Kirchoff matrix K-1.",
        "While in general constraint functions G may consider multiple edges, in this paper we use edge-factored constraint functions.",

        "It is important to note that the model pA is still edge-factored.",
        "The sum of the scores of all trees that contain edges k – i and k' – i' can be computed by setting the scores of edges j – i such that j = k and j' – i' such that j' = k' to 0, and computing the determinant of the resulting modified Kirchoff matrix Kfc-^fc/-^/.",
        "There are O(n) pairs of possible edges, and the determinant computation takes time O(n), so this naive algorithm takes O(n) time.",
        "An improved algorithm computes, for each possible edge k – i, a modified Kirchoff matrix Kk^j that requires the presence of that edge.",
        "Then, the method of Smith and Smith (2007) can be used to compute the probability of every possible edge conditioned on the presence of k – i, Pa (yi/ = k' |y = k, x), using K-^i.",
        "Multiplying this probability by pA(y»=k|x) yields the desired two edge marginal.",
        "Because this algorithm pulls the O(n) matrix operation out of the inner loop over edges, the run time is reduced to O(n).",
        "If it were possible to perform only one O(n) matrix operation per sentence, then the gradient computation would take only O(n) time, the time required to consider all pairs of edges.",
        "Unfortunately, there is no straightforward generalization of the method of Smith and Smith (2007) to the two edge marginal problem.",
        "Specifically, Laplace expansion generalizes to second-order matrix minors, but it is not clear how to compute second-order cofactors from the inverse Kirchoff matrix alone (c.f.",
        "(Smith and Smith, 2007)).",
        "Consequently, we also propose an approximation that can be used to speed up GE training at the expense of a less accurate covariance computation.",
        "We consider different cases of the edges k – i, and k' – i'.",
        "• PA(y»=k,y»/ =k'|x)=0 when i=i' and k=k' (different parent for the same word), or when i=k' and k=i' (cycle), because these pairs of edges break the tree constraint.",
        "i', k=k'.",
        "• pa (yi = k, yi/ = k' | x) w pa (yi = k | x)pa (yi/ = k'| x) when i = i' and i = k' or i' = k (different words, do not create a cycle).",
        "This approximation assumes that pairs of edges that do not fall into one of the above cases are conditionally independent given x.",
        "This is not true because there are partial trees in which k – i and k' – i' can appear separately, but not together (for example if i = k'and the partial tree contains i' – k).",
        "Using this approximation, the covariance for one sentence is approximately equal to - Y pa (yi=k | x)pa (yfc=i | x) f j (xi, xfc, x)g (xfc, xi, x).",
        "Intuitively, the first and second terms compute a covariance over possible parents for a single word, and the third term accounts for cycles.",
        "Computing the above takes O(n) time, the time required to compute single edge marginals.",
        "In this paper, we use the O(n) exact method, though we find that the accuracy attained by approximate training is usually within 5% of the exact method.",
        "If G is not edge-factored, then we need to compute a marginal over three or more edges, making exact training intractable.",
        "An appealing alternative to a similar approximation to the above would use loopy belief propagation to efficiently approximate the marginals (Smith and Eisner, 2008).",

        "sets in which we remove sentences that are longer than 20 words and 60 words.",
        "For these experiments, we use an oracle constraint selection method motivated by the linguistic prior knowledge described in Section 4.",
        "The first set of constraints specify the most frequent head tag, attachment direction, and distance combinations for each child tag.",
        "Specifically, we select oracle constraints of the type (parent-CPOS,child-CPOS,direction,distance).",
        "We add constraints for every g such that cedge(g) > 100 for max length 60 data sets, and cedge(g) > 10 times for max length 20 data sets.",
        "In some cases, the possible parent constraints described above will not be enough to provide high accuracy, because they do not consider other tags in the sentence (McDonald et al., 2005).",
        "Consequently, we experiment with adding an additional 25 sequence constraints (for what are often called \"between\" and \"surrounding\" features).",
        "The oracle feature selection method aims to choose such constraints that help to reduce uncertainty in the possible parents constraint set.",
        "Consequently, we consider sequence features gs with p (edge|gs = 1) > 0.75, and whose corresponding (parent-CPOS,child-CPOS,direction,distance) constraint g, has edge probability p (edge|g) < 0.25.",
        "Among these candidates, we sort by c (gs = 1), and select the top 25.",
        "We compare with the constraint baseline described in Section 5.",
        "Additionally, we report the number of parsed sentences required for supervised CRF training (averaged over 5 random splits) to match the accuracy of GE training using the possible parents + sequence constraint set.",
        "The results are provided in Table 2.",
        "We first observe that GE always beats the baseline, especially on parent decisions for which there are no constraints (not reported in Table 2, but for example 53.8% vs. 20.5% on Turkish 20).",
        "Second, we note that accuracy is always improved by adding sequence constraints.",
        "Importantly, we observe that GE gives comparable performance to supervised training with tens or hundreds of parsed sentences.",
        "These parsed sentences provide a tremendous amount of information to the model, as for example in 20 Spanish length < 60 sentences, a total of 1,630,466 features are observed, 330,856 of them unique.",
        "In contrast, the constraint-based methods are provided at most a few hundred constraints.",
        "When comparing the human costs of parsing sentences and specifying constraints, remember that parsing sentences requires the development of detailed annotation guidelines, which can be extremely time-consuming (see also the discussion is Section 2).",
        "Finally, we experiment with iteratively adding constraints.",
        "We sort constraints with c (g) > 50 by p (edge|g), and ensure that 50% are (parent-CPOS,child-CPOS,direction,distance) constraints and 50% are sequence constraints.",

        "In Table 3, we present four types of analysis.",
        "First, we present the predicted and true distributions over coarsegrained parent part of speech tags.",
        "We can see that verb is being predicted as a parent tag more often then it should be, while most other tags are predicted less often than they should be.",
        "Next, we show the predicted and true distributions over attachment direction and distance.",
        "From this we see that the model is often incorrectly predicting left attachments, and is predicting too many short attachments.",
        "Finally, we show the most common parent-child tag with direction and distance features that occur on false positive edges.",
        "From this table, we see that many errors concern the attachments of punctuation.",
        "The second line indicates a prepositional phrase attachment ambiguity.",
        "This analysis could also be performed by a linguist by looking at predicted trees for selected sentences.",
        "Once errors are identified, GE constraints could be added to address these problems."
