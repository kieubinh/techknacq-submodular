        "For English and a handful of other languages, there are large, well-annotated corpora with a variety of linguistic information ranging from named entity to discourse structure.",
        "Unfortunately, for the vast majority of languages very few linguistic resources are available.",
        "This situation is likely to persist because of the expense of creating annotated corpora that require linguistic expertise (Abeille, 2003).",
        "On the other hand, parallel corpora between many resource-poor languages and resource-rich languages are ample, motivating recent interest in transferring linguistic resources from one language to another via parallel text.",
        "For example, several early works (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001; Yarowsky et al., 2001; Merlo et al., 2002) demonstrate transfer of shallow processing tools such as part-of-speech taggers and noun-phrase chunkers by using word-level alignment models (Brown et al., 1994; Och and Ney, 2000).",

        "Dependency and constituency grammar formalisms have long coexisted and competed in linguistics, especially beyond English (Mel'cuk, 1988).",
        "Recently, dependency parsing has gained popularity as a simpler, computationally more efficient alternative to constituency parsing and has spurred several supervised learning approaches (Eisner, 1996; Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003a; Nivre and Nilsson, 2005; McDonald et al., 2005) as well as unsupervised induction (Klein and Manning, 2004; Smith and Eisner, 2006).",
        "Dependency representation has been used for language modeling, textual entailment and machine translation (Haghighi et al., 2005; Chelba et al., 1997; Quirk et al., 2005; Shen et al., 2008), to name a few tasks.",
        "Dependency grammars are arguably more robust to transfer since syntactic relations between aligned words of parallel sentences are better conserved in translation than phrase structure (Fox, 2002; Hwa et al., 2005).",
        "Nevertheless, several challenges to accurate training and evaluation from aligned bitext remain: (1) partial word alignment due to non-literal or distant translation; (2) errors in word alignments and source language parses, (3) grammatical annotation choices that differ across languages and linguistic theories (e.g., how to analyze auxiliary verbs, conjunctions).",
        "In this paper, we present a flexible learning framework for transferring dependency grammars via bitext using the posterior regularization framework (Graca et al., 2008).",
        "In particular, we address challenges (1) and (2) by avoiding commitment to an entire projected parse tree in the target language during training.",
        "Instead, we explore formulations of both generative and discriminative probabilistic models where projected syntactic relations are constrained to hold approximately and only in expectation.",
        "Finally, we address challenge (3) by introducing a very small number of language-specific constraints that disambiguate arbitrary annotation choices.",
        "We evaluate our approach by transferring from an English parser trained on the Penn treebank to Bulgarian and Spanish.",
        "We evaluate our results on the Bulgarian and Spanish corpora from the CoNLL X shared task.",
        "We see that our transfer approach consistently outperforms unsupervised methods and, given just a few (2 to 7) language-specific constraints, performs comparably to a supervised parser trained on a very limited corpus (30 - 140 training sentences)."

      "text": [
        "At a high level our approach is illustrated in Figure 1(a).",
        "A parallel corpus is word-level aligned using an alignment toolkit (Graca et al., 2009) and the source (English) is parsed using a dependency parser (McDonald et al., 2005).",
        "Figure 1(b) shows an aligned sentence pair example where dependencies are perfectly conserved across the alignment.",
        "An edge from English parent p to child c is called conserved if word p aligns to word p' in the second language, c aligns to c' in the second language, and p' is the parent of c'.",
        "Note that we are not restricting ourselves to one-to-one alignments here; p, c, p', and c' can all also align to other words.",
        "After filtering to identify well-behaved sentences and high confidence projected dependencies, we learn a probabilistic parsing model using the posterior regularization framework (Graca et al., 2008).",
        "We estimate both generative and discriminative models by constraining the posterior distribution over possible target parses to approximately respect projected dependencies and other rules which we describe below.",
        "In our experiments we evaluate the learned models on dependency treebanks (Nivre et al., 2007).",
        "Unfortunately the sentence in Figure 1(b) is highly unusual in its amount of dependency conservation.",
        "To get a feel for the typical case, we used off-the-shelf parsers (McDonald et al., 2005) for English, Spanish and Bulgarian on two bi-texts (Koehn, 2005; Tiedemann, 2007) and compared several measures of dependency conservation.",
        "For the English-Bulgarian corpus, we observed that 71.9% of the edges we projected were edges in the corpus, and we projected on average 2.7 edges per sentence (out of 5.3 tokens on average).",
        "For Spanish, we saw conservation of 64.4% and an average of 5.9 projected edges per sentence (out of 11.5 tokens on average).",
        "As these numbers illustrate, directly transferring information one dependency edge at a time is unfortunately error prone for two reasons.",
        "First, parser and word alignment errors cause much of the transferred information to be wrong.",
        "We deal with this problem by constraining groups of edges rather than a single edge.",
        "For example, in some sentence pair we might find 10 edges that have both end points aligned and can be transferred.",
        "Rather than requiring our target language parse to contain each of the 10 edges, we require that the expected number of edges from this set is at least 10n, where n is a strength parameter.",
        "This gives the parser freedom to have some uncertainty about which edges to include, or alternatively to choose to exclude some of the transferred edges.",
        "A more serious problem for transferring parse information across languages are structural differences and grammar annotation choices between the two languages.",
        "For example dealing with auxiliary verbs and reflexive constructions.",
        "Hwa et al.",
        "(2005) also note these problems and solve them by introducing dozens of rules to transform the transferred parse trees.",

        "Hwa et al.",
        "(2005) found that transferring dependencies directly was not sufficient to get a parser with reasonable performance, even when both the source language parses and the word alignments are performed by hand.",
        "They adjusted for this by introducing on the order of one or two dozen language-specific transformation rules to complete target parses for unaligned words and to account for diverging annotation rules.",
        "Transferring from English to Spanish in this way, they achieve 72.1% and transferring to Chinese they achieve 53.9%.",
        "Our learning method is very closely related to the work of (Mann and McCallum, 2007; Mann and McCallum, 2008) who concurrently developed the idea of using penalties based on posterior expectations of features not necessarily in the model in order to guide learning.",
        "They call their method generalized expectation constraints or alternatively expectation regularization.",
        "In this volume (Druck et al., 2009) use this framework to train a dependency parser based on constraints stated as corpus-wide expected values of linguistic rules.",
        "The rules select a class of edges (e.g. auxiliary verb to main verb) and require that the expectation of these be close to some value.",
        "The main difference between this work and theirs is the source of the information (a linguistic informant vs. cross-lingual projection).",
        "Also, we define our regularization with respect to inequality constraints (the model is not penalized for exceeding the required model expectations), while they require moments to be close to an estimated value.",
        "We suspect that the two learning methods could perform comparably when they exploit similar information."

        "In this paper, we proposed a novel and effective learning scheme for transferring dependency parses across bitext.",
        "By enforcing projected dependency constraints approximately and in expectation, our framework allows robust learning from noisy partially supervised target sentences, instead of committing to entire parses.",
        "We show that discriminative training generally outperforms generative approaches even in this very weakly supervised setting.",
        "By adding easily specified language-specific constraints, our models begin to rival strong supervised baselines for small amounts of data.",
        "Our framework can handle a wide range of constraints and we are currently exploring richer syntactic constraints that involve conservation of multiple edge constructions as well as constraints on conservation of surface length of dependencies."
