        "Syntactic dependency parsing is attracting more and more research focus in recent years, partially due to its theory-neutral representation, but also thanks to its wide deployment in various NLP tasks (machine translation, textual entailment recognition, question answering, information extraction, etc.).",
        "In combination with machine learning methods, several statistical dependency parsing models have reached comparable high parsing accuracy (McDonald et al., 2005b; Nivre et al., 2007b).",
        "In the meantime, successful continuation of CoNLL Shared Tasks since 2006 (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006; Nivre et al., 2007a; Surdeanu et al., 2008) have witnessed how easy it has become to train a statistical syntactic dependency parser provided that there is annotated treebank.",
        "While the dissemination continues towards various languages, several issues arise with such purely data-driven approaches.",
        "One common observation is that statistical parser performance drops significantly when tested on a dataset different from the training set.",
        "For instance, when using",
        "^The first author thanks the German Excellence Cluster of Multimodal Computing and Interaction for the support of the work.",

        "the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) sections of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) as training set, tests on Brown Sections typically result in a 6-8% drop in labeled attachment scores, although the average sentence length is much shorter in BROWN than that in WSJ.",
        "The common interpretation is that the test set is heterogeneous to the training set, hence in a different \"domain\" (in a loose sense).",
        "The typical cause of this is that the model overfits the training domain.",
        "The concerns over random choice of training corpus leading to linguistically inadequate parsing systems increase over time.",
        "While the statistical revolution in the field of computational linguistics gaining high publicity, the conventional symbolic grammar-based parsing approaches have undergone a quiet period of development during the past decade, and reemerged very recently with several large scale grammar-driven parsing systems, benefiting from the combination of well-established linguistic theories and data-driven stochastic models.",
        "The obvious advantage of such systems over pure statistical parsers is their usage of hand-coded linguistic knowledge irrespective of the training data.",
        "A common problem with grammar-based parser is the lack of robustness.",

        "In recent years, two statistical dependency parsing systems, MaltParser (Nivre et al., 2007b) and MSTParser (McDonald et al., 2005b), representing different threads of research in data-driven machine learning approaches have obtained high publicity, for their state-of-the-art performances in open competitions such as CoNLL Shared Tasks.",
        "MaltParser follows the transition-based approach, where parsing is done through a series of actions deterministically predicted by an oracle model.",
        "MSTParser, on the other hand, follows the graph-based approach where the best parse tree is acquired by searching for a spanning tree which maximizes the score on either a partially or a fully connected graph with all words in the sentence as nodes (Eisner, 1996; McDonald et al., 2005b).",
        "As reported in various evaluation competitions, the two systems achieved comparable performances.",
        "More recently, approaches of combining these two parsers achieved even better dependency accuracy (Nivre and McDonald, 2008).",
        "Granted for the differences between their approaches, both systems heavily rely on machine learning methods to estimate the parsing model from an annotated corpus as training set.",
        "Due to the heavy cost of developing high quality large scale syntactically annotated corpora, even for a resource-rich language like English, only very few of them meets the criteria for training a general purpose statistical parsing model.",
        "For instance, the text style of wsj is newswire, and most of the sentences are statements.",
        "Being lack of non-statements in the training data could cause problems, when the testing data contain many interrogative or imperative sentences as in the Brown corpus.",
        "Therefore, the unbalanced distribution of linguistic phenomena in the training data leads to inadequate parser output structures.",
        "Also, the financial domain specific terminology seen in wsj can skew the interpretation of daily life sentences seen in Brown.",
        "There has been a substantial amount of work on parser adaptation, especially from wsj to Brown.",
        "Gildea (2001) compared results from different combinations of the training and testing data to demonstrate that the size of the feature model can be reduced via excluding \"domain-dependent\" features, while the performance could still be preserved.",

        "Little study has been reported on approaches of incorporating linguistic features to make the parser less dependent on the nature of training and testing dataset, without resorting to huge amount of unlabeled out-domain data.",
        "In addition, most of the previous work have been focusing on constituent-based parsing, while the domain adaptation of the dependency parsing has not been fully explored.",
        "Taking a different approach towards parsing, grammar-based parsers appear to have much linguistic knowledge encoded within the grammars.",
        "In recent years, several of these linguistically motivated grammar-driven parsing systems achieved high accuracy which are comparable to the treebank-based statistical parsers.",
        "Notably are the constraint-based linguistic frameworks with mathematical rigor, and provide grammatical analyses for a large variety of phenomena.",
        "For instance, the Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (Pollard and Sag, 1994) has been successfully applied in several parsing systems for more than a dozen of languages.",
        "Some of these grammars, such as the English Resource Grammar (ERG; Flickinger (2002)), have undergone over decades of continuous development, and provide precise linguistic analyses for a broad range of phenomena.",
        "These linguistic knowledge are encoded in highly generalized form according to linguists' reflection for the target languages, and tend to be largely independent from any specific domain.",
        "The main issue of parsing with precision grammars is that broad coverage and high precision on linguistic phenomena do not directly guarantee robustness of the parser with noisy real world texts.",
        "Also, the detailed linguistic analysis is not always of the highest interest to all NLP applications.",
        "It is not always straightforward to scale down the detailed analyses embraced by deep grammars to a shallower representation which is more accessible for specific NLP tasks.",
        "On the other hand, since the dependency representation is relatively theory-neutral, it is possible to convert from other frameworks into its backbone representation in dependencies.",
        "For HPSG, this is further assisted by the clear marking of head daughters in headed phrases.",

        "Given a sentence, each parse produced by the parser is represented by a typed feature structure, which recursively embeds smaller feature structures for lower level phrases or words.",

        "See Figure 3 for an example of such an extracted backbone.",
        "For the experiments in this paper, we used July-08 version of the ERG, which contains in total 185 grammar rules (morphological rules are not counted).",
        "Among them, 61 are unary rules, and 124 are binary.",
        "Many of the binary rules are clearly marked as headed phrases.",
        "The grammar also indicates whether the head is on the left (head-initial) or on the right (head-final).",
        "However, there are still quite a few binary rules which are not marked as headed-phrases (according to the linguistic theory), e.g. rules to handle coordinations, appositions, compound nouns, etc.",
        "For these rules, we refer to the conversion of the Penn Treebank into dependency structures used in the CoNLL 2008 Shared Task, and mark the heads of these rules in a way that will arrive at a compatible dependency backbone.",
        "For instance, the left most daughters of coordination rules are marked as heads.",
        "In combination with the right-branching analysis of coordination in ERG, this leads to the same dependency attachment in the CoNLL syntax.",
        "Eventually, 37 binary rules are marked with a head daughter on the left, and 86 with a head daughter on the right.",
        "Although the extracted dependency is similar to the CoNLL shared task dependency structures, minor systematic differences still exist for some phenomena.",
        "For example, the possessive \"'s\" is annotated to be governed by its preceding word in CoNLL dependency; while in HPSG, it is treated as the head of a \"specifier-head\" construction, hence governing the preceding word in the dependency backbone.",
        "With several simple tree rewriting rules, we are able to fix the most frequent inconsistencies.",
        "With the rule-based backbone extraction and repair, we can finally turn our HPSG parser outputs into dependency structures.",
        "The unla-beled attachment agreement between the HPSG backbone and CoNLL dependency annotation will be shown in Section 4.2.",
        "As mentioned in Section 2, one pitfall of using a precision-oriented grammar in parsing is its lack of robustness.",
        "Even with a large scale broad coverage grammar like ERG, using our settings we only achieved 75% of sentential coverage.",
        "Given that the grammar has never been fine-tuned for the financial domain, such coverage is very encouraging.",
        "But still, the remaining unparsed sentences comprise a big coverage gap.",
        "Different strategies can be taken here.",
        "One can either keep the high precision by only looking at full parses from the HPSG parser, of which the analyses are completely admitted by grammar constraints.",
        "Or one can trade precision for extra robustness by looking at the most probable incomplete analysis.",
        "Several partial parsing strategies have been proposed (Kasper et al., 1999; Zhang and Kordoni, 2008) as the robust fallbacks for the parser when no available analysis can be derived.",
        "In our experiment, we select the sequence of most likely fragment analyses according to their local disambiguation scores as the partial parse.",
        "When combined with the dependency backbone extraction, partial parses generate disjoint tree fragments.",
        "We simply attach all fragments onto the virtual root node.",
        "Besides directly using the dependency backbone of the HPSG output, we could also use it for building feature-based models of statistical dependency parsers.",
        "Since we focus on the domain adaptation issue, we incorporate a less domain dependent language resource (i.e. the HPSG parsing outputs using ERG) into the features models of statistical parsers.",
        "As mordern grammar-based parsers has achieved high runtime efficency (with our HPSG parser parsing at an average speed of ~3 sentences per second), this adds up to an acceptable overhead.",
        "As mentioned before, MSTParser is a graph-based statistical dependency parser, whose learning procedure can be viewed as the assignment of different weights to all kinds of dependency arcs.",
        "Therefore, the feature model focuses on each kind of head-child pair in the dependency tree, and mainly contains four categories of features (Mcdonald et al., 2005a): basic uni-gram features, basic bi-gram features, in-between POS features, and surrounding POS features.",
        "It is emphasized by the authors that the last two categories contribute a large improvement to the performance and bring the parser to the state-of-the-art accuracy.",
        "Therefore, we extend this feature set by adding four more feature categories, which are similar to the original ones, but the dependency relation was replaced by the dependency backbone of the HPSG outputs.",
        "The extended feature set is shown in Table 1.",
        "MaltParser is another trend of dependency parser, which is based on transitions.",
        "The learning procedure is to train a statistical model, which can help the parser to decide which operation to take at each parsing status.",
        "The basic data structures are a stack, where the constructed dependency graph is stored, and an input queue, where the unprocessed data are put.",
        "Therefore, the feature model focuses on the tokens close to the top of the stack and also the head of the queue.",
        "Provided with the original features used in MaltParser, we add extra ones about the top token in the stack and the head token of the queue derived from the HPSG dependency backbone.",

        "The difference is even larger when only the HPSG fully parsed subsets of the test sets are concerned.",
        "When we look at the performance difference between in-domain and out-domain tests for each feature model, we observe that the drop is significantly smaller for the extended models with HPSG features.",

        "Similar to our work, Sagae et al.",
        "(2007) also considered the combination of dependency parsing with an HPSG parser, although their work was to use statistical dependency parser outputs as soft constraints to improve the HPSG parsing.",
        "Nevertheless, a similar backbone extraction algorithm was used to map between different representations.",
        "Similar work also exists in the constituent-based approaches, where CFG backbones were used to improve the efficiency and robustness of HPSG parsers (Matsuzaki et al., 2007; Zhang and",
        "Kordoni, 2008).",
        "In this paper, we restricted our investigation on the syntactic evaluation using labeled/unlabeled attachment scores.",
        "Recent discussions in the parsing community about meaningful crossframework evaluation metrics have suggested to use measures that are semantically informed.",
        "In this spirit, Zhang et al.",
        "(2008) showed that the semantic outputs of the same HPSG parser helps in the semantic role labeling task.",
        "Consistent with the results reported in this paper, more improvement was achieved on the out-domain tests in their work as well.",
        "Although the experiments presented in this paper were carried out on a HPSG grammar for English, the method can be easily adapted to work with other grammar frameworks (e.g. LFG, CCG, TAG, etc.",
        "), as well as on langugages other than English.",
        "We chose to use a hand-crafted grammar, so that the effect of training corpus on the deep parser is minimized (with the exception of the lexical coverage and disambiguation model).",
        "As mentioned in Section 4.4, the performance of our HPSG parse selection model varies across different domains.",
        "This indicates that, although the deep grammar embraces domain independent linguistic knowledge, the lexical coverage and the disambiguation process among permissible readings is still domain dependent.",
        "With the mapping between HPSG analyses and their dependency backbones, one can potentially use existing dependency treebanks to help overcome the insufficient data problem for deep parse selection models.",
