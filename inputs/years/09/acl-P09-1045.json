        "Iterative bootstrapping algorithms have been proposed to extract semantic lexicons for nlp tasks with limited linguistic resources.",
        "Bootstrapping was initially proposed by Riloff and Jones (1999), and has since been successfully applied to extracting general semantic lexicons (Riloff and Jones, 1999; Thelen and Riloff, 2002), biomedical entities (Yu and Agichtein, 2003), facts (Pa§ca et al., 2006), and coreference data (Yang and Su, 2007).",
        "Bootstrapping approaches are attractive because they are domain and language independent, require minimal linguistic preprocessing and can be applied to raw text, and are efficient enough for tera-scale extraction (Pa§ca et al., 2006).",
        "Bootstrapping is minimally supervised, as it is initialised with a small number of seed instances of the information to extract.",
        "For semantic lexicons, these seeds are terms from the category ofin-terest.",
        "The seeds identify contextual patterns that express a particular semantic category, which in turn recognise new terms (Riloff and Jones, 1999).",
        "Unfortunately, semantic drift often occurs when ambiguous or erroneous terms and/or patterns are introduced into and then dominate the iterative process (Curran et al., 2007).",
        "Bootstrapping algorithms are typically compared using only a single set ofhand-picked seeds.",
        "We first show that different seeds cause these algorithms to generate diverse lexicons which vary greatly in precision.",
        "This makes evaluation unreliable - seeds which perform well on one algorithm can perform surprisingly poorly on another.",
        "In fact, random gold-standard seeds often outperform seeds carefully chosen by domain experts.",
        "Our second contribution exploits this diversity we have identified.",
        "We present an unsupervised bagging algorithm which samples from the extracted lexicon rather than relying on existing gazetteers or hand-selected seeds.",
        "Each sample is then fed back as seeds to the bootstrapper and the results combined using voting.",
        "This both improves the precision of the lexicon and the robustness of the algorithms to the choice of initial seeds.",
        "Unfortunately, semantic drift still dominates in later iterations, since erroneous extracted terms and/or patterns eventually shift the category's direction.",
        "Our third contribution focuses on detecting and censoring the terms introduced by semantic drift.",
        "We integrate a distributional similarity filter directly into WMEB (Mcintosh and Curran, 2008).",
        "This filter judges whether a new term is more similar to the earlier or most recently extracted terms, a sign of potential semantic drift.",
        "We demonstrate these methods for extracting biomedical semantic lexicons using two bootstrapping algorithms.",
        "Our unsupervised bagging approach outperforms carefully hand-picked seeds by ~ 10% in later iterations.",
        "Our distributional similarity filter gives a similar performance improvement.",
        "This allows us to produce large lexicons accurately and efficiently for domain-specific language processing."

        "Hearst (1992) exploited patterns for information extraction, to acquire is-a relations using manually devised patterns like such Z as X and/or Y where X and Y are hyponyms of Z. Riloff and Jones (1999) extended this with an automated bootstrapping algorithm, Multilevel Bootstrapping (mlb), which iteratively extracts semantic lexicons from text.",
        "In mlb, bootstrapping alternates between two stages: pattern extraction and selection, and term extraction and selection.",
        "mb is seeded with a small set of user selected seed terms.",
        "These seeds are used to identify contextual patterns they appear in, which in turn identify new lexicon entries.",
        "This process is repeated with the new lexicon terms identifying new patterns.",
        "In each iteration, the top-n candidates are selected, based on a metric scoring their membership in the category and suitability for extracting additional terms and patterns.",
        "Bootstrapping eventually extracts polysemous terms and patterns which weakly constrain the semantic class, causing the lexicon's meaning to shift, called semantic drift by Curran et al.",
        "(2007).",
        "For example, female firstnames may drift into flowers when Iris and Rose are extracted.",
        "Many variations on bootstrapping have been developed to reduce semantic drift.",
        "One approach is to extract multiple semantic categories simultaneously, where the individual bootstrapping instances compete with one another in an attempt to actively direct the categories away from each other.",
        "Multi-category algorithms outperform mlb (Thelen and Riloff, 2002), and we focus on these algorithms in our experiments.",
        "In basilisk, meb, and wmeb, each competing category iterates simultaneously between the term and pattern extraction and selection stages.",
        "These algorithms differ in how terms and patterns selected by multiple categories are handled, and their scoring metrics.",
        "In basilisk (Thelen and Riloff, 2002), candidate terms are ranked highly if they have strong evidence for a category and little or no evidence for other categories.",
        "This typically favours less frequent terms, as they will match far fewer patterns and are thus more likely to belong to one category.",
        "Patterns are selected similarly, however patterns may also be selected by different categories in later iterations.",
        "Curran et al.",
        "(2007) introduced Mutual Exclu- sion Bootstrapping (meb) which forces stricter boundaries between the competing categories than basilisk.",
        "In meb, the key assumptions are that terms only belong to a category and that patterns only extract terms of a single category.",
        "Semantic drift is reduced by eliminating patterns that collide with multiple categories in an iteration and by ignoring colliding candidate terms (for the current iteration).",
        "This excludes generic patterns that can occur frequently with multiple categories, and reduces the chance of assigning ambiguous terms to their less dominant sense.",
        "The scoring of candidate terms and patterns in meb is naive.",
        "Candidates which 1) match the most input instances; and 2) have the potential to generate the most new candidates, are preferred (Cur-ran et al., 2007).",
        "This second criterion aims to increase recall.",
        "However, the selected instances are highly likely to introduce drift.",
        "Our Weighted meb algorithm (Mcintosh and Curran, 2008), extends meb by incorporating term and pattern weighting, and a cumulative pattern pool.",
        "wmeb uses the % statistic to identify patterns and terms that are strongly associated with the growing lexicon terms and their patterns respectively.",
        "The terms and patterns are then ranked first by the number of input instances they match (as in meb), but then by their weighted score.",
        "In meb and basilisk, the top-k patterns for each iteration are used to extract new candidate terms.",
        "As the lexicons grow, general patterns can drift into the top-k and as a result the earlier precise patterns lose their extracting influence.",
        "In wmeb, the pattern pool accumulates all top-k patterns from previous iterations, to ensure previous patterns can contribute.",
        "Distributional similarity has been used to extract semantic lexicons (Grefenstette, 1994), based on the distributional hypothesis that semantically similar words appear in similar contexts (Harris, 1954).",
        "Words are represented by context vectors, and words are considered similar if their context vectors are similar.",
        "Patterns and distributional methods have been combined previously.",
        "Pantel and Ravichandran (2004) used lexical-syntactic patterns to label clusters of distributionally similar terms.",
        "Mirkin et al.",
        "(2006) used 11 patterns, and the distributional similarity score of each pair of terms, to construct features for lexical entailment.",
        "Pa§ca et al.",
        "(2006) used distributional similarity to find similar terms for verifying the names in date-of-birth facts for their tera-scale bootstrapping system.",
        "For the majority of bootstrapping tasks, there is little or no guidance on how to select seeds which will generate the most accurate lexicons.",
        "Most previous works used seeds selected based on a user's or domain expert's intuition (Curran et al., 2007), which may then have to meet a frequency criterion (Riloff et al., 2003).",
        "Eisner and Karakos (2005) focus on this issue by considering an approach called strapping for word sense disambiguation.",
        "In strapping, semi-supervised bootstrapping instances are used to train a meta-classifier, which given a bootstrapping instance can predict the usefulness (fertility) of its seeds.",
        "The most fertile seeds can then be used in place of hand-picked seeds.",
        "The design of a strapping algorithm is more complex than that of a supervised learner (Eisner and Karakos, 2005), and it is unclear how well strapping will generalise to other bootstrapping tasks.",

        "As shown above, semantic drift still dominates the later iterations of bootstrapping even after bagging.",
        "In this section, we propose distributional similarity measurements over the extracted lexicon to detect semantic drift during the bootstrapping process.",
        "Our hypothesis is that semantic drift has occurred when a candidate term is more similar to recently added terms than to the seed and high precision terms added in the earlier iterations.",
        "We experiment with a range of values of both.",
        "Given a growing lexicon of size N, LN, let L1...n correspond to the first n terms extracted into L, and L(N-TO)...N correspond to the last m terms added to LN.",
        "In an iteration, let t be the next candidate term to be added to the lexicon.",
        "We calculate the average distributional similarity (sim) of t with all terms in L1^n and those in L(nand call the ratio the drift for term t:",
        "Smaller values of drift(t, n, m) correspond to the current term moving further away from the first terms.",
        "A drift(i,n, m) of 0.2 corresponds to a 20% difference in average similarity between and L(nfor term t.",
        "Drift can be used as a post-processing step to filter terms that are a possible consequence of drift.",
        "However, our main proposal is to incorporate the drift measure directly within the wmeb bootstrapping algorithm, to detect and then prevent drift oc-curing.",
        "In each iteration, the set of candidate terms to be added to the lexicon are scored and ranked for their suitability.",
        "We now additionally determine the drift of each candidate term before it is added to the lexicon.",
        "If the term's drift is below a specified threshold, it is discarded from the extraction process.",
        "If the term has zero similarity with the last m terms, but is similar to at least one of the first n terms, the term is selected.",
        "Preventing the drifted term from entering the lexicon during the bootstrapping process, has a flow on effect as it will not be able to extract additional divergent patterns which would lead to accelerated drift.",
        "For calculating drift we use the distributional similarity approach described in Curran (2004).",
        "We extracted window-based features from the filtered 5-grams to form context vectors for each term.",
        "We used the standard t-test weight and weighted Jaccard measure functions (Curran, 2004).",
        "This system produces a distributional score for each pair of terms presented by the bootstrapping system.",
        "To evaluate our semantic drift detection we incorporate our process in wmeb.",
        "Candidate terms are still weighted in wmeb using the % statistic as described in (Mcintosh and Curran, 2008).",
        "Many of the medline categories suffer from semantic drift in wmeb in the later stages.",
        "Figure 2 shows the distribution of correct and incorrect terms appearing in the cell lexicon extracted using Shand with the term's ranks plotted against their drift scores.",
        "Firstly, it is evident that incorrect terms begin to dominate in later iterations.",
        "Encouragingly, there is a trend where low values of drift correspond to incorrect terms being added.",
        "Drift also occurs in anti and mutn, with an average precision at 8011000 terms of 41.5% and 33.0% respectively.",
        "We utilise drift in two ways with wmeb; as a post-processing filter (wmeb+post) and internally during the term selection phase (wmeb+dist).",
        "Table 6 shows the performance of drift detection with wmeb, using Shand.",
        "We use a drift threshold of 0.2 which was selected empirically.",
        "A higher value substantially reduced the lexicons' size, while a lower value resulted in little improvements.",
        "We experimented with various sizes of initial terms L1^n (n=20, n=100) and L(n(m=5, m=20).",
        "There is little performance variation observed in the various wmeb+post experiments.",
        "Overall, wmeb+post was outperformed slightly by wmeb.",
        "The post-filtering removed many incorrect terms, but did not address the underlying drift problem.",
        "This only allowed additional incorrect terms to enter the top 1000, resulting in no appreciable difference.",
        "Slight variations in precision are obtained using wmeb+dist in the first 600 terms, but noticeable gains are achieved in the 801-1000 range.",
        "This is not surprising as drift in many categories does not start until later (cf.",
        "Figure 2).",
        "With respect to the drift parameters n and m, we found values of n below 20 to be inadequate.",
        "We experimented initially with n=5 terms, but this is equivalent to comparing the new candidate terms to the initial seeds.",
        "Setting m to 5 was also less useful than a larger sample, unless n was also large.",
        "The best performance gain of 4.2% overall for 1000 terms and 17.3% at 801-1000 terms was obtained using n=100 and m=5.",
        "In different phases of wmeb+dist we reduce semantic drift significantly.",
        "In particular, at 801-1000, anti increase by 46% to 87.5% and mutn by 59% to 92.0%.",
        "For our final experiments, we report the performance of our best performing wmeb+dist system (n=100 m=5) using the 10 random gold seed sets from section 4.1, in Table 7.",
        "On average wmeb+dist performs above wmeb, especially in the later iterations where the difference is 6.3%."

      "text": [
        "In this paper, we have proposed unsupervised bagging and integrated distributional similarity to minimise the problem of semantic drift in iterative bootstrapping algorithms, particularly when extracting large semantic lexicons.",
        "There are a number of avenues that require further examination.",
        "Firstly, we would like to take our two-round unsupervised bagging further by performing another iteration of sampling and then bootstrapping, to see if we can get a further improvement.",
        "Secondly, we also intend to experiment with machine learning methods for identifying the correct cutoff for the drift score.",
        "Finally, we intend to combine the bagging and distributional approaches to further improve the lexicons.",
        "Our initial analysis demonstrated that the output and accuracy of bootstrapping systems can be very sensitive to the choice of seed terms and therefore robust evaluation requires results averaged across randomised seed sets.",
        "We exploited this variability to create both supervised and unsupervised bagging algorithms.",
        "The latter requires no more seeds than the original algorithm but performs significantly better and more reliably in later iterations.",
        "Finally, we incorporated distributional similarity measurements directly into wmeb which detect and censor terms which could lead to semantic drift.",
        "This approach significantly outperformed standard wmeb, with a 17.3% improvement over the last 200 terms extracted (801-1000).",
        "The result is an efficient, reliable and accurate system for extracting large-scale semantic lexicons."
