        "A named entity that represents a person, an organization or a geo-location may appear within and across documents in different forms.",

        "CDC is a stepping stone for achieving intelligent information access to vast and heterogeneous text corpora, which includes advanced NLP techniques such as document summarization and question answering.",
        "A related and well studied task is within document coreference (WDC), which limits the scope of disambiguation to within the boundary of a document.",
        "When namesakes appear in an article, the author can explicitly help to disambiguate, using titles and suffixes (as in the example, \"George Bush Sr. ... the younger Bush\") besides other means.",
        "Cross document coreference, on the other hand, is a more challenging task because these linguistics cues and sentence structures no longer apply, given the wide variety of context and styles in different documents.",
        "Cross document coreference research has recently become more popular due to the increasing interests in the web person search task (Artiles et al., 2007).",
        "Here, a search query for a person name is entered into a search engine and the desired outputs are documents clustered according to the identities of the entities in question.",
        "In our work, we propose to drill down to the subdocument mention level and construct an entity profile with the support of information extraction tools and reconciled with WDC methods.",
        "Hence our IE based approach has access to accurate information such as a person's mentions and geo-locations for disambiguation.",
        "Simple IR based CDC approaches (e.g. (Gooi and Allan, 2004)), on the other hand, may simply use all the terms and this can be detrimental to accuracy.",
        "For example, a biography of John F. Kennedy is likely to mention members of his family with related positions, besides references to other political figures.",
        "Even with careful word selection, these textual features can still confuse the disambiguation system about the true identity of the person.",
        "We propose to handle the CDC task using a novel kernelized fuzzy relational clustering algorithm, which allows probabilistic cluster membership assignment.",

        "We make distinctions between document level and profile based cross document coreference.",
        "Document level CDC makes a simplifying assumption that a named entity (and its variants) in a document has one underlying real identity.",
        "The assumption is generally acceptable but may be violated when a document refers to namesakes at the same time (e.g. George W. Bush and George H. W. Bush referred to as George or President Bush).",
        "Furthermore, the context surrounding the person NE President Clinton can be counterproductive for disambiguating the NE Senator Clinton, with both entities likely to appear in a document at the same time.",
        "The simplified document level CDC has nevertheless been used in the WePS evaluation (Artiles et al., 2007), called the web people task.",
        "In this work, we advocate profile based disambiguation that aims to leverage the advances in NLP techniques.",
        "Rather than treating a document as simply a bag of words, an information extraction tool first extracts NE's and their relationships.",
        "For the NE's of interest (i.e. persons in this work), a within-document coreference (WDC) module then links the entities deemed as referring to the same underlying identity into a WDC chain.",
        "This process includes both anaphora resolution (resolving 'He' and its antecedent 'President Clinton') and entity tracking (resolving 'Bill' and 'President Clinton').",
        "Let E = {e1,eN} denote the set of N chained entities (each corresponding to a WDC chain), provided as input to the CDC system.",
        "We intentionally do not distinguish which document each ej belongs to, as profile based CDC can potentially rectify WDC errors by leveraging information across document boundaries.",
        "Each ei is represented as a profile which contains the NE, its attributes and associated relationships, i.e. ej =< ejti, ...,ejtL > (ej,i can be a textual attribute or a pointer to another entity).",
        "The profile based CDC method generates a partition of E, represented by a partition matrix U (where uij denotes the membership of an entity ej to the ith identity cluster).",
        "Therefore, the chained entities placed in a name cluster are deemed as coreferent.",
        "Profile based CDC addresses a finer grained coreference problem in the mention level, enabled by the recent advances in IE and WDC techniques.",
        "In addition, profile based CDC facilitates user information consumption with structured information and short summary passages.",
        "Next, we focus on the relational clustering algorithm that lies at the core of the profile based CDC system.",
        "We then turn our attention to the specialist learning algorithm for the distance function used in clustering, capable of leveraging the available training data.",
        "Traditionally, hard clustering algorithms (where uij £ {0,1}) such as complete linkage hierarchical agglomerative clustering (Mann and Yarowsky, 2003) have been applied to the disambiguation problem.",
        "In this work, we propose to use fuzzy clustering methods (relaxing the membership condition to uij £ [0,1]) as a better way of handling uncertainty in cross document coreference.",
        "First, consider the following motivating example, Example.",
        "The named entity President Bush is extracted from the sentence \"President Bush addressed the nation from the Oval Office Monday.\"",
        "• Without additional cues, a hard clustering algorithm has to arbitrarily assign the mention \"President Bush\" to either the NE \"George W. Bush\" or \"George H. W. Bush\".",
        "• A soft clustering algorithm, on the other hand, can assign equal probability to the two identities, indicating low entropy or high uncertainty in the solution.",
        "Additionally, the soft clustering algorithm can assign lower probability to the identity \"Governor Jeb Bush\", reflecting a less likely (though not impossible) coreference decision.",
        "We first formalize the cross document corefer-ence problem as a soft clustering problem, which minimizes the following objective function:",
        "where Vi is avirtual(implicit) prototypeofthei-th cluster (ej, vi £ V) and m controls the fuzziness of the solution (m > 1; the solution approaches hard clustering as m approaches 1).",
        "We will further explain the generic distance function d : V x V – R in the next subsection.",
        "The goal of the optimization is to minimize the sum of deviations of patterns to the cluster prototypes.",
        "The clustering solution is a fuzzy partition Ve = {Ci}, where ej £ Ci if and only if uij > 0.",
        "We note from the outset that the optimization functional has the same form as the classical Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithm (Bezdek, 1981), but major differences exist.",
        "FCM, as most object clustering algorithms, deals with object data represented in a vectorial form.",
        "In our case, the data is purely relational and only the mutual relationships between entities can be determined.",
        "To be exact, we can define the similarity/dissimilarity between a pair of attributes or relationships of the same type l between entities ej and ek as s(l\\ej, ek).",
        "For instance, the similarity between the occupations 'President' and 'Commander in Chief' can be computed using the JC semantic distance (Jiang and Conrath, 1997) with WordNet; the similarity of co-occurrence with other people can be measured by the Jaccard coefficient.",
        "In the next section, we propose to compute the relation strength r(-, •) from the component similarities using aggregation weights learned from training data.",
        "Hence the N chained entities to be clustered can be represented as relational data using an nxn matrix R, where rjkk = r(ej, ek).",
        "The Any Relation Clustering Algorithm (ARCA) (Corsini et al., 2005; Cimino et al., 2006) represents relational data as object data using their mutual relation strength and uses FCM for clustering.",
        "We adopt this approach to transform (objectify) a relational pattern ej into an N dimensional vector rj (i.e. the j-throw in the matrix R) using a mapping 6 : V – RN .In other words, each chained entity is represented as a vector of its relation strengths with all the entities.",
        "Fuzzy clusters can then be obtained by grouping closely related patterns using object clustering algorithm.",
        "Furthermore, it is well known that FCM is a spherical clustering algorithm and thus is not generally applicable to relational data which may yield relational clusters of arbitrary and complicated shapes.",
        "Also, the distance in the transformed space may be non-Euclidean, rendering many clustering algorithms ineffective (many FCM extensions theoretically require the underlying distance to satisfy certain metric properties).",
        "In this work, we propose kernelized ARCA (called KARC) which uses a kernel-induced metric to handle the objectified relational data, as we introduce next.",
        "Kernelization (Scholkopf and Smola, 2002) is a machine learning technique to transform patterns in the data space to a high-dimensional feature space so that the structure of the data can be more easily and adequately discovered.",
        "Specifically, a nonlinear transformation $ maps data in RN to H of possibly infinite dimensions (Hilbert space).",
        "The key idea is the kernel trick - without explicitly specifying $ and H, the inner product in H can be computed by evaluating a kernel function K in the data space, i.e. < $(ri), $(rj) >= K(ri, rj) (one of the most frequently used kernel functions is the Gaussian RBF kernel: K(rj, rk) = exp( – \\\\\\rj – rk||)).",
        "This technique has been successfully applied to SVMs to classify non-linearly separable data (Vapnik, 1995).",
        "Kernelization preserves the simplicity in the formalism of the underlying clustering algorithm, meanwhile it yields highly nonlinear boundaries so that spherical clustering algorithms can apply (e.g. (Zhang and Chen, 2003) developed a kernelized object clustering algorithm based on FCM).",
        "Let wi denote the objectified virtual cluster vi, i.e. wi = 6(vi).",
        "Using the kernel trick, the squared distance between $(rj) and in the feature space H can be computed as:",
        "assuming K(r, r) = l. The KARC algorithm defines the generic distance d as d (ej, vi) = (we also use dji as a notational shorthand).",
        "Using Lagrange Multiplier as in FCM, the optimal solution for Equation (l) is:",
        "Since $ is an implicit mapping, Eq.",
        "(5) can not be explicitly evaluated.",
        "On the other hand, plugging Eq.",
        "(5) into Eq.",
        "(3), can be explicitly represented by using the kernel matrix,",
        "With the derivation, the kernelized fuzzy clustering algorithm KARC works as follows.",
        "The chained entities E are first objectified into the relation strength matrix R using SEG, the details of which are described in the following section.",
        "The Gram matrix K is then computed based on the relation strength vectors using the kernel function.",
        "For a given number of clusters C, the initialization step is done by randomly picking C patterns as cluster centers, equivalently, C indices [n\\, ..,nc} are randomly picked from {1,.., N}.",
        "D° is initialized by setting = 2 – 2K(rj, rni).",
        "KARC alternately updates the membership matrix U and the kernel distance matrix D until convergence or running more than maxIter iterations (Algorithm 1).",
        "Finally, the soft partition is generated based on the membership matrix U, which is the desired cross document coreference result.",
        "Algorithm 1 KARC Alternating Optimization Input: Gram matrix K; #Clusters C; threshold 6 initialize D° //1- Update membership matrix U*:",
        "// 2 Update kernel distance matrix D*:",
        "until (t > maxIter) or Output: Fuzzy partition Ve",
        "In the CDC setting, the number of true underlying identities may vary depending on the entities' level of ambiguity (e.g. name frequency).",
        "Selecting the optimal number of clusters is in general a hard research question in clustering.",
        "We adopt the Xie-Beni Index (XBI) (Xie and Beni, 1991) as in ARCA, which is one of the most popular cluster validities for fuzzy clustering algorithms.",
        "Xie-Beni Index (XBI) measures the goodness of clustering using the ratio of the intra-cluster variation and the inter-cluster separation.",
        "We measure the kernelized XBI (KXBI) in the feature space as, where the nominator is readily computed using D and the inter-cluster separation in the denominator can be evaluated using the similar kernel trick above (details omitted).",
        "Note that KXBI is only defined for C > 1.",
        "Thus we pick the C that corresponds to the first minimum of KXBI, and then compare its objective function value Jc with the cluster variance (Ji for C – 1).",
        "The optimal C is chosen from the minimum of the two.",
        "2 3 Specialist Ensemble Learning of Relation Strengths between Entities",
        "One remaining element in the overall CDC approach is how the relation strength rjyk between two entities is computed.",
        "In (Cohen et al., 2003), a binary SVM model is trained and its confidence in predicting the non-coreferent class is used as the distance metric.",
        "In our case of using information extraction results for disambiguation, however, only some of the similarity features are present based on the available relationships in two profiles.",
        "In this work, we propose to treat each similarity function as a specialist that specializes in computing the similarity of a particular type of relationship.",
        "Indeed, the similarity function between a pair of attributes or relationships may in itself be a sophisticated component algorithm.",
        "We utilize the specialist ensemble learning framework (Freund et al., 1997) to combine these component similarities into the relation strength for clustering.",
        "Here, a specialist is awakened for prediction only when the same type of relationships are present in both chained entities.",
        "A specialist can choose not to make a prediction if it is not confident enough for an instance.",
        "These aspects contrast with the traditional insomniac ensemble learning methods, where each component learner is always available for prediction (Freund et al., 1997).",
        "Also, specialists have different weights (in addition to their prediction) on the final relation strength, e.g. a match in a family relationship is considered more important than in a co-occurrence relationship.",
        "Algorithm 2 SEG (Freund et al., 1997) Input: Initial weight distribution p; learning rate n > 0; training set {< st,yt >}",

        "Otherwise: pP'+x = p\\",
        "5: end for Output: Model p",
        "The ensemble relation strength model is learned as follows.",
        "Given training data, the set of chained entities £train is extracted as described earlier.",
        "For a pair of entities ej and ek, a similarity vector s is computed using the component similarity functions for the respective attributes and relationships, and the true label is defined as y = I {ej and ek are coreferent}.",
        "The instances are subsampled to yield a balanced pairwise training set {< st,yt >}.",
        "We adopt the Specialist Exponentiated Gradient (SEG) (Freund et al., 1997) algorithm to learn the mixing weights of the specialists' prediction (Algorithm 2) in an online manner.",
        "In each training iteration, an instance < st,yt > is presented to the learner (with E* denoting the set of indices of awake specialists in s*).",
        "The SEG algorithm first predicts the value yt based on the awake specialists' decisions.",
        "The true value yt is then revealed and the learner incurs a square loss between the predicted and the true values.",
        "The current weight distribution p is updated to minimize square loss: awake specialists are promoted or demoted in their weights according to the difference between the predicted and the true value.",
        "The learning iterations can run a few passes till convergence, and the model is learned in linear time with respect to T and is thus very efficient.",
        "In prediction time, let E(jk denote the set of active specialists for the pair of entities ej and ek, and s(jk) denote the computed similarity vector.",
        "The predicted relation strength rjkk is,",
        "Before we conclude this section, we make several comments on using fuzzy clustering for cross document coreference.",
        "First, instead of conducting CDC for all entities concurrently (which can be computationally intensive with a large corpus), chained entities are first distributed into non-overlapping blocks.",
        "Clustering is performed for each block which is a drastically smaller problem space, while entities from different blocks are unlikely to be coreferent.",
        "Our CDC system uses phonetic blocking on the full name, so that name variations arising from translation, transliteration and abbreviation can be accommodated.",
        "Additional link constraints checking is also implemented to improve scalability though these are not the main focus of the paper.",
        "There are several additional benefits in using a fuzzy clustering method besides the capability of probabilistic membership assignments in the CDC solution.",
        "In the clustered web search context, splitting a true identity into two clusters is perceived as a more severe error than putting irrelevant records in a cluster, as it is more difficult for the user to collect records in different clusters (to reconstruct the real underlying identity) than to prune away noisy records.",
        "While there is no universal way to handle this with hard clustering, soft clustering algorithms can more easily avoid the false negatives by allowing records to probabilistically appear in different clusters (subject to the sum of 1) using a more lenient threshold.",
        "Also, while there is no real prototypical elements in relational clustering, soft relational clustering methods can naturally rank the profiles within a cluster according to their membership levels, which is an additional advantage for enhancing user consumption of the disambiguation results."

        "The F score peaks at 0.74 (m = 1.6) and then slightly decreases, as the gain in purity is outweighed by the loss in inverse purity.",
        "Figure 2 evaluates the impact of the different settings of 9 (the threshold of including a chained entity in the fuzzy cluster) on the coreference performance.",
        "We observe that as we increase 9, purity improves indicating less 'noise' entities are included in the solution.",
        "On the other hand, inverse purity decreases meaning more coreferent entities are not linked due to the stricter threshold.",
        "Overall, the changes in the two metrics offset each other and the F score is relatively stable across a broad range of 9 settings."
