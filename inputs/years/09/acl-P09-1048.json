        "In our increasingly global world, it is ever more likely for a monolingual speaker to require information that is only available in a foreign language document.",
        "Cross-lingual applications address this need by presenting information in the speaker's language even when it originally appeared in some other language, using machine translation (MT) in the process.",
        "In this paper, we present an evaluation and error analysis of a cross-lingual application that we developed for a government-sponsored evaluation, the 5W task.",
        "The 5W task seeks to summarize the information in a natural language sentence by distilling it into the answers to the 5W questions: Who, What, When, Where and Why.",
        "To solve this problem, a number of different problems in NLP must be addressed: predicate identification, argument extraction, attachment disambiguation, location and time expression recognition, and (partial) semantic role labeling.",
        "In this paper, we address the cross-lingual 5W task: given a source-language sentence, return the 5W's translated (comprehensibly) into the target language.",
        "Success in this task requires a synergy of successful MT and answer selection.",
        "The questions we address in this paper are:",
        "• How much does machine translation (MT) degrade the performance of cross-lingual 5W systems, as compared to monolingual performance?",
        "• Is it better to do source-language analysis and then translate, or do target-language analysis on MT?",
        "• Which specific problems in language processing and/or MT cause errors in 5W answers?",
        "In this evaluation, we compare several different approaches to the cross-lingual 5W task, two that work on the target language (English) and one that works in the source language (Chinese).",
        "A central question for many cross-lingual applications is whether to process in the source language and then translate the result, or translate documents first and then process the translation.",
        "Depending on how errorful the translation is, results may be more accurate if models are developed for the source language.",
        "However, if there are more resources in the target language, then the translate-then-process approach may be more appropriate.",
        "We present a detailed analysis, both quantitative and qualitative, of how the approaches differ in performance.",
        "We also compare system performance on human translation (which we term reference translations) and MT of the same data in order to determine how much MT degrades system performance.",
        "Finally, we do an in-depth analysis of the errors in our 5W approaches, both on the NLP side and the MT side.",
        "Our results provide explanations for why different approaches succeed, along with indications of where future effort should be spent."

        "In these tasks, a system is presented a query or question in the target language and asked to return documents or answers from a corpus in the source language.",
        "Although MT may be used in solving this task, it is only used by the algorithms - the final evaluation is done in the source language.",
        "However, in many real-life situations, such as global business, international tourism, or intelligence work, users may not be able to read the source language.",
        "In these cases, users must rely on MT to understand the system response.",
        "(Parton et al.",

        "In cross-lingual information extraction (Sudo et al.",
        "2004) the evaluation is also done on MT, but the goal is to learn knowledge from a large corpus, rather than analyzing individual sentences.",
        "The 5W task is also closely related to Semantic Role Labeling (SRL), which aims to efficiently and effectively derive semantic information from text.",
        "SRL identifies predicates and their arguments in a sentence, and assigns roles to each argument.",
        "For example, in the sentence \"I baked a cake yesterday.",
        "\", the predicate \"baked\" has three arguments.",
        "\"I\" is the subject of the predicate, \"a cake\" is the object and \"yesterday\" is a temporal argument.",
        "Since the release of large data resources annotated with relevant levels of semantic information, such as the FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) and PropBank corpora (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2003), efficient approaches to SRL have been developed (Carreras and Marquez, 2005).",
        "Most approaches to the problem of SRL follow the Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) model.",
        "First, for a given predicate, the SRL system identifies its arguments' boundaries.",
        "Second, the Argument types are classified depending on an adopted lexical resource such as PropBank or FrameNet.",
        "Both steps are based on supervised learning over labeled gold standard data.",
        "A final step uses heuristics to resolve inconsistencies when applying both steps simultaneously to the test data.",
        "Since many of the SRL resources are English, most of the SRL systems to date have been for English.",

        "While the enhancements to the parser are important for robustness and accuracy, it is even more important to train grammars matched to the conditions of use.",
        "For example, parsing a Chinese sentence containing full-width punctuation with a parser trained on half-width punctuation reduces accuracy by over 9% absolute F. In English, parsing accuracy is seriously compromised by training a grammar with punctuation and case to process sentences without them.",
        "We developed grammars for English and Chinese trained specifically for each genre by sub-sampling from available treebanks (for English, WSJ, BN, Brown, Fisher, and Switchboard; for Chinese, CTB5) and transforming them for a particular genre (e.g., for informal speech, we replaced symbolic expressions with verbal forms and remove punctuation and case) and by utilizing a large amount of genre-matched self-labeled training parses.",
        "Given these genre-specific parses, we extracted chunks and POS tags by script.",
        "We also trained grammars with a subset of function tags annotated in the treebank that indicate case role information (e.g., SBJ, OBJ, LOC, MNR) in order to produce function tags.",

        "If a system returned Incorrect answers for Who and What, then the other answers were marked Incorrect (as explained in section 5.2).",
        "For the last 3W's, the majority of errors were due to this (details in Figure 1), so our error analysis focuses on the Who and What questions.",
        "To establish a monolingual baseline, the English 5W system was run on reference (human) translations of the Chinese text.",

        "• Argument attached to wrong predicate.",
        "Figure 1 shows the performance of the best monolingual system for each 5W as a dashed line.",

        "Since English-LF preferred shorter answers, it frequently missed answers or parts of answers.",
        "English-LF also had more Partial answers on the What question: 66% Correct and 12% Partial, versus 75% Correct and 1% Partial for English-function.",
        "On the other hand, English-function was more likely to return answers that contained incorrect extra information, such as another 5W or a second predicate.",
        "The cross-lingual 5W task requires that systems return intelligible responses that are semantically equivalent to the source sentence (or, in the case of this evaluation, equivalent to the reference).",
        "As can be seen in Figure 1, MT degrades the performance of the 5W systems significantly, for all question types, and for all systems.",
        "Averaged over all questions, the best monolingual system does 19% better than the best cross-lingual system.",
        "Surprisingly, even though English-function outperformed English-LF on the reference data, English-LF does consistently better on MT.",
        "This is likely due to its use of multiple back-off methods when the parser failed.",
        "The Chinese system did slightly worse than either English system overall, but in the formal text genre, it outperformed both English systems.",

        "Nearly half (48%) of the answers can be answered correctly by both the English system and the Chinese system.",

        "The hybrid did better than its parent systems on all 5Ws, and the numbers above indicate that further improvement is possible with a better combination strategy.",
        "For each Partial or Incorrect answer, annotators were asked to select system errors, translation errors, or both.",
        "(Further analysis is necessary to distinguish between ASR errors and MT errors.)",
        "The translation errors considered were:",
        "• Word/phrase deleted.",

        "The hybrid system was able to overcome many system errors (for example, in Table 2, only 13% of the errors are due to missing answers), but still suffered from MT errors.",
        "Mistranslation was the biggest translation problem for all the systems.",
        "Consider the first example in Figure 3.",
        "Both English systems correctly extracted the Who and the When, but for MT: The Guizhou province, within a certain bank robber, under the watchful eyes of a weak woman, and, with a knife stabbed the woman.",

        "This is the correct predicate for the sentence, but it does not match the meaning of the reference.",
        "The Chinese 5W system was able to select a better translation, and instead returned \"remember a little bit.\"",
        "Garbled word order was chosen for 21-24% of the target-language system Who/What errors, but only 9% of the source-language system Who/What errors.",
        "The source-language word order problems tended to be local, within-phrase errors (e.g., \"the dispute over frozen funds\" was translated as \"the freezing of disputes\").",
        "The target-language system word order problems were often long-distance problems.",
        "For example, the second sentence in Figure 3 has many phrases in common with the reference translation, but the overall sentence makes no sense.",
        "The watchful eyes actually belong to a \"group of onlookers\" (deleted).",
        "Ideally, the robber would have \"stabbed the woman\" \"with a knife,\" rather than vice versa.",
        "Long-distance phrase movement is a common problem in Chinese-English MT, and many MT systems try to handle it (e.g., Wang et al.",
        "2007).",
        "By doing analysis in the source language, the Chinese 5W system is often able to avoid this problem - for example, it successfully returned \"robbers\" \"grabbed a weak woman\" for the Who/What of this sentence.",
        "Although we expected that the Chinese system would have fewer problems with MT deletion, since it could choose from three different MT versions, MT deletion was a problem for all systems.",
        "In looking more closely at the deletions, we noticed that over half of deletions were verbs that were completely missing from the translated sentence.",
        "Since MT systems are tuned for word-based overlap measures (such as BLEU), verb deletion is penalized equally as, for example, determiner deletion.",
        "Intuitively, a verb deletion destroys the central meaning of a sentence, while a determiner is rarely necessary for comprehension.",
        "Other kinds of deletions included noun phrases, pronouns, named entities, negations and longer connecting phrases.",
        "Deletion also affected When and Where.",
        "Deleting particles such as \"in\" and \"when\" that indicate a location or temporal argument caused the English systems to miss the argument.",
        "Word order problems in MT also caused attachment ambiguity in When and Where.",
        "The \"unreadable\" category was an option of last resort for very difficult MT sentences.",
        "The third sentence in Figure 3 is an example where ASR and MT errors compounded to create an unparseable sentence."

        "In our evaluation of various 5W systems, we discovered several characteristics of the task.",
        "The What answer was the hardest for all systems, since it is difficult to include enough information to cover the top-level predicate and object, without getting penalized for including too much.",
        "The challenge in the When, Where and Why questions is due to sparsity - these responses occur in much fewer sentences than Who and What, so systems most often missed these answers.",
        "Since this was a new task, this first evaluation showed clear issues on the language analysis side that can be improved in the future.",
        "The best cross-lingual 5W system was still 19% worse than the best monolingual 5W system, which shows that MT significantly degrades sentence-level understanding.",
        "A serious problem in MT for systems was deletion.",
        "Chinese constituents that were never translated caused serious problems, even when individual systems had strategies to recover.",
        "When the verb was deleted, no top level predicate could be found and then all 5Ws were wrong.",
        "One of our main research questions was whether to extract or translate first.",
        "We hypothesized that doing source-language analysis would be more accurate, given the noise in Chinese MT, but the systems performed about the same.",
        "This is probably because the English tools (logical form extraction and parser) were more mature and accurate than the Chinese tools.",
        "Although neither source-language nor target-language analysis was able to circumvent problems in MT, each approach had advantages relative to the other, since they did well on different sets of sentences.",
        "For example, Chinese-align had fewer problems with word order, and most of those were due to local word-order problems.",
        "Since the source-language and target-language systems made different kinds of mistakes, we were able to build a hybrid system that used the relative advantages of each system to outperform all systems.",
        "The different types of mistakes made by each system suggest features that can be used to improve the combination system in the future.",
