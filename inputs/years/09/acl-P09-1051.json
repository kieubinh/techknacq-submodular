        "A most common need in applied semantic inference is to infer the meaning of a target term from other terms in a text.",
        "For example, a Question Answering system may infer the answer to a question regarding luxury cars from a text mentioning Bentley, which provides a concrete reference to the sought meaning.",
        "Aiming to capture such lexical inferences we followed (Glickman et al., 2006), which coined the term lexical reference (LR) to denote references in text to the specific meaning of a target term.",
        "They further analyzed the dataset ofthe First Recognizing Textual Entailment Challenge (Da-gan et al., 2006), which includes examples drawn from seven different application scenarios.",
        "It was found that an entailing text indeed includes a concrete reference to practically every term in the entailed (inferred) sentence.",
        "The lexical reference relation between two terms may be viewed as a lexical inference rule, denoted LHS => RHS.",
        "Such rule indicates that the left-hand-side term would generate a reference, in some texts, to a possible meaning of the right hand side term, as the Bentley == luxury car example.",
        "In the above example the LHS is a hyponym of the RHS.",
        "Indeed, the commonly used hyponymy, synonymy and some cases of the meronymy relations are special cases of lexical reference.",
        "However, lexical reference is a broader relation.",
        "For instance, the LR rule physician == medicine may be useful to infer the topic medicine in a text categorization setting, while an information extraction system may utilize the rule Margaret Thatcher == United Kingdom to infer a UK announcement from the text \"Margaret Thatcher announced\".",
        "To perform such inferences, systems need large scale knowledge bases of LR rules.",
        "A prominent available resource is WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), from which classical relations such as synonyms, hyponyms and some cases of meronyms may be used as LR rules.",
        "An extension to WordNet was presented by (Snow et al., 2006).",
        "Yet, available resources do not cover the full scope oflexical reference.",
        "This paper presents the extraction of a large-scale rule base from Wikipedia designed to cover a wide scope of the lexical reference relation.",
        "As a starting point we examine the potential of definition sentences as a source for LR rules (Ide and Jean, 1993; Chodorow et al., 1985; Moldovan and Rus, 2001).",
        "When writing a concept definition, one aims to formulate a concise text that includes the most characteristic aspects of the defined concept.",
        "Therefore, a definition is a promising source for LR relations between the defined concept and the definition terms.",
        "In addition, we extract LR rules from Wikipedia redirect and hyperlink relations.",
        "As a guideline, we focused on developing simple extraction methods that may be applicable for other Web knowledge resources, rather than focusing on Wikipedia-specific attributes.",
        "Overall, our rule base contains about 8 million candidate lexical reference rules.",
        "Extensive analysis estimated that 66% of our rules are correct, while different portions of the rule base provide varying recall-precision tradeoffs.",
        "Following further error analysis we introduce rule filtering which improves inference performance.",
        "The rule base utility was evaluated within two lexical expansion applications, yielding better results than other automatically constructed baselines and comparable results to WordNet.",
        "A combination with WordNet achieved the best performance, indicating the significant marginal contribution of our rule base."

        "Other methods use a specialized parser or a set of regular expressions tuned to a particular dictionary (Wilks et al., 1996).",
        "Some works utilized Wikipedia to build an ontology.",

        "On the other hand, lexical reference is a special case of lexical association, which specifies concretely that a reference to the meaning of one term may be inferred from the other.",

        "The right part of Table 2 shows the performance figures for accumulated rule bases, created by adding the extraction methods one at a time in order of their precision.",
        "% obtained is the percentage of correct rules in each rule base out of the total number of correct rules extracted jointly by all methods (the union set).",

        "The score of a path is then defined as ^jjj).",

        "These instances are likely to be non-referring, since a concise definition typically does not contain terms that can be inferred from each other.",

        "We used various thresholds on the length of the expansion list derived from this resource.",

        "Using the entire rule base yields the highest recall, while filtering rules by the Dice coefficient (with 0.1 threshold) substantially increases precision without harming recall.",
        "With this configuration our automatically-constructed resource achieves comparable performance to the manually built WordNet.",
        "Finally, since a dictionary and an encyclopedia are complementary in nature, we applied the union of WordNet and the filtered Wikipedia expansions.",

        "Most relevant for our evaluation, lexical matches are detected when a Wikipedia rule's LHS appears in the text and its RHS in the hypothesis, or similarly when pairs of WordNet synonyms, hyponyms-hypernyms and derivations appear across the text and hypothesis.",
        "The system s weights were trained on the development set of RTE-3 and tested on RTE-4 (which included this year only a test set).",
        "To measure the marginal contribution of the two resources we performed ablation tests, comparing the accuracy of the full system to that achieved when removing either resource.",
        "Table 7 presents the results, which are similar in nature to those obtained for text categorization.",
        "Wikipedia obtained a marginal contribution of 1.1%, about half of the analogous contribution of WordNet s manually-constructed information.",
        "We note that for current RTE technology it is very typical to gain just a few percents in accuracy thanks to external knowledge resources, while individual resources usually contribute around 0.5-2% (Iftene and Balahur-Dobrescu, 2007; Dinu and Wang, 2009).",
