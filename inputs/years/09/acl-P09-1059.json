        "Much of statistical NLP research relies on some sort of manually annotated corpora to train their models, but these resources are extremely expensive to build, especially at a large scale, for example in treebanking (Marcus et al., 1993).",
        "However the linguistic theories underlying these annotation efforts are often heavily debated, and as a result there often exist multiple corpora for the same task with vastly different and incompatible annotation philosophies.",
        "For example just for English treebanking there have been the Chomskian-style",

        "Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) the HPSG LinGo Redwoods Treebank (Oepen et al., 2002), and a smaller dependency treebank (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006).",
        "A second, related problem is that the raw texts are also drawn from different domains, which for the above example range from financial news (PTB/WSJ) to transcribed dialog (LinGo).",
        "These two problems seem be a great waste in human efforts, and it would be nice if one could automatically adapt from one annotation standard and/or domain to another in order to exploit much larger datasets for better training.",
        "The second problem, domain adaptation, is very well-studied, e.g. by Blitzer et al.",
        "(2006) and Daumé III (2007) (and see below for discussions), so in this paper we focus on the less studied, but equally important problem of annotation-style adaptation.",
        "We present a very simple yet effective strategy that enables us to utilize knowledge from a differently annotated corpora for the training of a model on a corpus with desired annotation.",
        "The basic idea is very simple: we first train on a source corpus, resulting in a source classifier, which is used to label the target corpus and results in a \"source-style\" annotation of the target corpus.",
        "We then train a second model on the target corpus with the first classifier's prediction as additional features for guided learning.",

        "This method is very similar to some ideas in domain adaptation (Daumé III and Marcu, 2006; Daumé III, 2007), but we argue that the underlying problems are quite different.",
        "Domain adaptation assumes the labeling guidelines are preserved between the two domains, e.g., an adjective is always labeled as JJ regardless of from Wall Street Journal (WSJ) or Biomedical texts, and only the distributions are different, e.g., the word \"control\" is most likely a verb in WSJ but often a noun in Biomedical texts (as in \"control experiment\").",
        "Annotation-style adaptation, however, tackles the problem where the guideline itself is changed, for example, one treebank might distinguish between transitive and intransitive verbs, while merging the different noun types (NN, NNS, etc.",
        "), and for example one treebank (PTB) might be much flatter than the other (LinGo), not to mention the fundamental disparities between their underlying linguistic representations (CFG vs. HPSG).",
        "In this sense, the problem we study in this paper seems much harder and more motivated from a linguistic (rather than statistical) point of view.",
        "More interestingly, our method, without any assumption on the distributions, can be simultaneously applied to both domain and annotation standards adaptation problems, which is very appealing in practice because the latter problem often implies the former, as in our case study.",
        "To test the efficacy of our method we choose Chinese word segmentation and part-of-speech tagging, where the problem of incompatible annotation standards is one of the most evident: so far no segmentation standard is widely accepted due to the lack of a clear definition of Chinese words, and the (almost complete) lack of morphology results in much bigger ambiguities and heavy debates in tagging philosophies for Chinese parts-of-speech.",
        "The two corpora used in this study are the much larger People's Daily (PD) (5.86M words) corpus (Yu et al., 2001) and the smaller but more popular Penn Chinese Treebank (CTB) (0.47M words) (Xue et al., 2005).",
        "They used very different segmentation standards as well as different POS tagsets and tagging guidelines.",
        "For example, in Figure 1, People's Daily breaks \"Vice-President\" into two words while combines the phrase \"visited-China\" as a compound.",
        "Also",
        "CTB has four verbal categories (VV for normal verbs, and VC for copulas, etc.)",
        "while PD has only one verbal tag (v) (Xia, 2000).",
        "It is preferable to transfer knowledge from PD to CTB because the latter also annotates tree structures which is very useful for downstream applications like parsing, summarization, and machine translation, yet it is much smaller in size.",
        "Indeed, many recent efforts on Chinese-English translation and Chinese parsing use the CTB as the de facto segmentation and tagging standards, but suffers from the limited size of training data (Chiang, 2007; Bikel and Chiang, 2000).",
        "We believe this is also a reason why state-of-the-art accuracy for Chinese parsing is much lower than that of English (CTB is only half the size ofPTB).",
        "Our experiments show that adaptation from PD to CTB results in a significant improvement in segmentation and POS tagging, with error reductions of 30.2% and 14%, respectively.",
        "In addition, the improved accuracies from segmentation and tagging also lead to an improved parsing accuracy on CTB, reducing 38% of the error propagation from word segmentation to parsing.",
        "We envision this technique to be general and widely applicable to many other sequence labeling tasks.",
        "In the rest of the paper we first briefly review the popular classification-based method for word segmentation and tagging (Section 2), and then describe our idea of annotation adaptation (Section 3).",
        "We then discuss other relevant previous work including co-training and classifier combination (Section 4) before presenting our experimental results (Section 5)."

        "In addition, the performance of the adapted model for Joint S&T obviously surpass that of (Jiang et al., 2008), which achieves an Fi of 93.41% for Joint S&T, although with more complicated models and features.",
        "Due to the obvious improvement brought by annotation adaptation to both word segmentation and Joint S&T, we can safely conclude that the knowledge can be effectively transferred from on annotation standard to another, although using such a simple strategy.",
        "To obtain further information about what kind of errors be alleviated by annotation adaptation, we conduct an initial error analysis for Joint S&T on the developing set ofCTB.",
        "It is reasonable to investigate the error reduction of Recall for each word cluster grouped together according to their POS tags.",
        "From Table 4 we find that out of 30 word clusters appeared in the developing set of CTB, 13 clusters benefit from the annotation adaptation strategy, while 4 clusters suffer from it.",
        "However, the compositive error rate of Recall for all word clusters is reduced by 20.66%, such a fact invalidates the effectivity ofannotation adaptation.",
        "We adopt the Chinese parser of Xiong et al.",
        "(2005), and train it on the training set of CTB 5.0 as described before.",
        "To sketch the error propagation to parsing from word segmentation, we redefine the constituent span as a constituent subtree from a start character to a end character, rather than from a start word to a end word.",
        "Note that if we input the gold-standard segmented test set into the parser, the F-measure under the two definitions are the same.",
        "Table 5 shows the parsing accuracies with different word segmentation results as the parser's input.",
        "The parsing F-measure corresponding to the gold-standard segmentation, 82.35, represents the \"oracle\" accuracy (i.e., upperbound) of parsing on top of automatic word segmention.",
        "After integrating the knowledge from PD, the enhanced word segmenter gains an F-measure increment of 0.8 points, which indicates that 38% of the error propagation from word segmentation to parsing is reduced by our annotation adaptation strategy."
