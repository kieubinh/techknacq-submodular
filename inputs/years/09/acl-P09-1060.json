        "Real-time captioning is a technique for supporting the speech understanding of deaf persons, elderly persons, or foreigners by displaying transcribed texts of monologue speech such as lectures.",
        "In recent years, there exist a lot of researches about automatic captioning, and the techniques of automatic speech recognition (ASR) aimed for captioning have been developed (Bou-lianne et al., 2006; Holter et al., 2000; Imai et al., 2006; Munteanu et al., 2007; Saraclar et al., 2002; Xue et al., 2006).",
        "However, in order to generate captions which is easy to read, it is important not only to recognize speech with high recognition rate but also to properly display the transcribed text on a screen (Hoogenboom et al., 2008).",
        "Especially, in spoken monologue, since a sentence tends to be long, each sentence is often displayed as a multi-line text on a screen.",
        "Therefore, proper linefeed insertion for the displayed text is desired so that the text becomes easy to read.",
        "Until now, there existed few researches about how to display text on a screen in automatic captioning.",
        "As the research about linefeed insertion, Monma et al.",
        "proposed a method based on patterns of a sequence of morphemes (Monma et al., 2003).",
        "However, the target of the research is closed-captions of Japanese TV shows, in which less than or equal to 2 lines text is displayed on a screen and the text all switches to other text at a time.",
        "In the work, the highest priority concept on captioning is that one screen should be filled with as much text as possible.",
        "Therefore, a semantic boundary in a sentence is hardly taken into account in linefeed insertion, and the readability of the caption is hardly improved.",
        "This paper proposes a technique for inserting linefeeds into transcribed texts of Japanese monologue speech as an elemental technique to generate readable captions.",
        "We assume that a screen for displaying only multi-line caption is placed to provide the caption information to the audience on the site of a lecture.",
        "In our method, the linefeeds are inserted into only the boundaries between bunset-sus, and the linefeeds are appropriately inserted into a sentence by machine learning, based on the information such as morphemes, dependencies, clause boundaries, pauses and line length.",
        "We conducted an experiment on inserting linefeeds by using Japanese spoken monologue data.",
        "As the results of inserting linefeeds for 1,714 sentences, the recall and precision of our method were 82.66% and 80.24%, respectively.",

        "In the subjective evaluation, examinees looked at the two texts placed side-by-side between which the only difference is linefeed points, and then selected the one which was felt more readable.",
        "Here, we compared our method with the baseline 3, of which F-measure was highest among four baselines described in Section 5.1.",
        "Ten examinees evaluated 50 pairs of the results generated from the same 50 randomly selected sentences.",

        "On the other hand, there existed three sentences for which more than 5 examinees judged that the results of baseline 3 were more readable than those of our method.",

        "• Japanese syllabary characters (Hiragana) are successionally displayed across a bunsetsu boundary.",
        "• The length of anteroposterior lines is extremely different each other.",
        "Each example of the two causes is shown in Figure 9 and 10, respectively.",
        "In Figure 9, a bunsetsu boundary existed between Japanese syllabary characters \"M> h (I)\" and \"^<^5 (if truth be told)\" and these characters are succes-sionally displayed in the same line.",
        "In these cases, it becomes more difficult to identify the bunsetsu boundary, therefore, the text is thought to become difficult to read.",
        "In Figure 10, since the length of the second line is extremely shorter than the first line or third line, the text is thought to become difficult to read.",

        "An experiment by using transcribed data of Japanese discourse speech showed the recall and precision was 82.66% and 80.24%, respectively, and we confirmed the effectiveness of our method.",
        "In applying the linefeed insertion technique to practical real-time captioning, we have to consider not only the readability but also the simultaneity.",
        "Since the input of our method is a sentence which tends to be long in spoken monologue, in the future, we will develop more simultaneous a technique in which the input is shorter than a sentence.",
        "In addition, we assumed the speech recognition system with perfect performance.",
        "To demonstrate practicality of our method for automatic speech transcription, an experiment using a continuous speech recognition system will be performed in the future."
