        "Prosody represents suprasegmental information in speech since it normally extends over more than one phoneme segment.",
        "Prosodic phenomena manifest themselves in speech in different ways, including changes in relative intensity to emphasize specific words or syllables, variations of the fundamental frequency range and contour, and subtle timing variations, such as syllable lengthening and insertion of pause.",
        "In spoken utterances, speakers use prosody to convey emphasis, intent, attitude, and emotion.",
        "These are important cues to aid the listener for interpretation of speech.",
        "Prosody also plays an important role in automatic spoken language processing tasks, such as speech act detection and natural speech synthesis, because it includes aspect of higher level information that is not completely revealed by segmental acoustics or lexical information.",
        "To represent prosodic events for the categorical annotation schemes, one of the most popular labeling schemes is the Tones and Break Indices (ToBI) framework (Silverman et al., 1992).",
        "The most important prosodic phenomena captured within this framework include pitch accents (or prominence) and prosodic phrase boundaries.",
        "Within the ToBI framework, prosodic phrasing refers to the perceived grouping of words in an utterance, and accent refers to the greater perceived strength or emphasis of some syllables in a phrase.",
        "Corpora annotated with prosody information can be used for speech analysis and to learn the relationship between prosodic events and lexical, syntactic and semantic structure of the utterance.",
        "However, it is very expensive and time-consuming to perform prosody labeling manually.",
        "Therefore, automatic labeling of prosodic events is an attractive alternative that has received attention over the past decades.",
        "In addition, automatically detecting prosodic events also benefits many other speech understanding tasks.",
        "Many previous efforts on prosodic event detection were supervised learning approaches that used acoustic, lexical, and syntactic cues.",
        "However, the major drawback with these methods is that they require a hand-labeled training corpus and depend on specific corpus used for training.",
        "Limited research has been conducted using unsupervised and semi-supervised methods.",
        "In this paper, we exploit semi-supervised learning with the co-training algorithm (Blum and Mitchell, 1998) for automatic prosodic event labeling.",
        "Two different views according to acoustic and lexical-syntactic knowledge sources are used in the co-training framework.",
        "We propose a confidence-based method to assign labels to unlabeled data in training iterations and evaluate its performance combined with different informative sample selection methods.",
        "Our experiments on the Boston Radio News corpus show that the use of unla-beled data can lead to significant improvement of prosodic event detection compared to using the original small training set, and that the semi-supervised learning result is comparable with supervised learning with similar amount of training data.",

        "At the end, a final hypothesis is created by combining the predictions of the classifiers learned in each view.",
        "As described in Section 4, we use two classifiers for the prosodic event detection task based on two different information sources: one is the acoustic evidence extracted from the speech signal of an utterance; the other is the lexical and syntactic evidence such as syllables, words, POS tags and phrasal boundary information.",
        "These are two different views for prosodic event detection and fit the co-training framework.",
        "The general co-training algorithm we used is described in Algorithm 1.",

        "Then we select some samples to add to L. Finally, the pool U is recreated from U at random.",

        "However, when this agreement-based approach is used for prosodic event detection, we notice that there is not only difference in the labeling accuracy between positive and negative samples, but also an imbalance of the self-labeled positive and negative examples (details in Section 6).",
        "Therefore we believe that using the hard decisions from the two classifiers along with the agreement-based rule is not enough to label the unlabeled samples.",
        "To address this problem, we propose an approximated confidence measure based on the combined classifier (Equation 3).",

        "Active learning approaches, such as Muslea et al.",
        "(2000), can generally select more informative samples, for example, samples for which two classifiers disagree (since one of two classifiers is wrong) and ask for human labels.",
        "Co-training approaches cannot, however, use this selection method since there is a risk to label the disagreed samples.",
        "Usually co-training selects samples for which two classifiers have the same prediction but high difference in their confidence measures.",
        "Based on this idea, we applied three sampling strategies on top of our confidence-based labeling method:",
        "• Random selection: randomly select samples from those that the two classifiers have different posterior probabilities.",
        "• Most confident selection: select samples that have the highest posterior probability based on one classifier, and at the same time there is certain posterior probability difference between the two classifiers.",
        "• Most different selection: select samples that have the most difference between the two classifiers' posterior probabilities.",
        "The first strategy is appropriate for base classifiers that lack the capability of estimating the posterior probability of their predictions.",

        "In this paper, we exploit the co-training method for automatic prosodic event detection.",
        "We introduced a confidence-based method to assign possible labels to unlabeled data and evaluated the performance combined with informative sample selection methods.",
        "Our experimental results using co-training are significantly better than the original supervised results using the small amount of training data, and closer to that using supervised learning with a large amount of data.",
        "This suggests that the use of unlabeled data can lead to significant improvement for prosodic event detection.",
        "In our experiment, we used some labeled data as development set to estimate some parameters.",
        "For the future work, we will perform analysis of loss function of each classifier in order to estimate parameters without labeled development data.",
        "In addition, we plan to compare this to other semi-supervised learning techniques such as active learning.",
        "We also plan to use this algorithm to annotate different types of data, such as spontaneous speech, and incorporate prosodic events in spoken language applications."
