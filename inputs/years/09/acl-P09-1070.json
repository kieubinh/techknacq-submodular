        "We present a Bayesian approach for simultaneously extending Is-A hierarchies such as those found in WordNet (WN) (Fellbaum, 1998) with additional concepts, and annotating the resulting concept graph with attributes, i.e., generic property fields shared by instances of that concept.",
        "Examples of attributes include \"height\" and \"eye-color\" for the concept Person or \"gdp\" and \"president\" for Country.",
        "Identifying and extracting such attributes relative to a set of flat (i.e., non-hierarchically organized) labeled classes of instances has been extensively studied, using a variety of data, e.g., Web search query logs (Pa§ca and Van Durme, 2008), Web documents (Yoshinaga and Torisawa, 2007), and Wikipedia (Suchanek et al., 2007; Wu and Weld, 2008).",
        "Building on the current state of the art in attribute extraction, we propose a model-based approach for mapping flat sets of attributes annotated with class labels into an existing ontology.",
        "This inference problem is divided into two main components: (1) identifying the appropriate parent concept for each labeled class and (2) learning",
        "*Contributions made during an internship at Google.",
        "the correct level of abstraction for each attribute in the extended ontology.",
        "For example, consider the task of annotating WN with the labeled class renaissance painters containing the class instances Pisanello, Hieronymus Bosch, and Jan van Eyck and associated with the attributes \"famous works\" and \"style.\"",
        "Since there is no WN concept for renaissance painters, the latter would need to be mapped into WN under, e.g., Painter.",
        "Furthermore, since \"famous works\" and \"style\" are not specific to renaissance painters (or even the WN concept Painter), they should be placed at the most appropriate level of abstraction, e.g., Artist.",
        "In this paper, we show that both of these goals can be realized jointly using a probabilistic topic model, namely hierarchical Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003b).",
        "There are three main advantages to using a topic model as the annotation procedure: (1) Unlike hierarchical clustering (Duda et al., 2000), the attribute distribution at a concept node is not composed of the distributions of its children; attributes found specific to the concept Painter would not need to appear in the distribution of attributes for Person, making the internal distributions at each concept more meaningful as attributes specific to that concept; (2) Since LDA is fully Bayesian, its model semantics allow additional prior information to be included, unlike standard models such as Latent Semantic Analysis (Hofmann, 1999), improving annotation precision; (3) Attributes with multiple related meanings (i.e., polysemous attributes) are modeled implicitly: if an attribute (e.g., \"style\") occurs in two separate input classes (e.g., poets and car models), then that attribute might attach at two different concepts in the ontology, which is better than attaching it at their most specific common ancestor (Whole) if that ancestor is too general to be useful.",
        "However, there is also a pressure for these two occurrences to attach to a single concept.",

        "White nodes depict the top attributes predicted for each WN concept.",
        "These inferred annotations exhibit a high degree of concept specificity, naturally becoming more general at higher levels of the ontology.",
        "Some annotations, such as for the concepts Agent, Substance, Living Thing and Person have high precision and specificity while others, such as Liquor and Actor need improvement.",
        "Overall, the more general concepts yield better annotations as they are averaged over many labeled attribute sets, reducing noise.",
