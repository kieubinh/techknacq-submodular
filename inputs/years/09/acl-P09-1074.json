        "As is common for many natural language processing problems, the state-of-the-art in noun phrase (NP) coreference resolution is typically quantified based on system performance on manually annotated text corpora.",
        "In spite of the availability of several benchmark data sets (e.g. MUC-6 (1995), ACE NIST (2004)) and their use in many formal evaluations, as a field we can make surprisingly few conclusive statements about the state-of-the-art in NP coreference resolution.",
        "In particular, it remains difficult to assess the effectiveness of different coreference resolution approaches, even in relative terms.",
        "For example, the 91.5 F-measure reported by McCallum and Wellner (2004) was produced by a system using perfect information for several linguistic subproblems.",
        "In contrast, the 71.3 F-measure reported by Yang et al.",
        "(2003) represents a fully automatic end-to-end resolver.",
        "It is impossible to assess which approach truly performs best because of the dramatically different assumptions of each evaluation.",
        "Results vary widely across data sets.",
        "Corefer-ence resolution scores range from 85-90% on the ACE 2004 and 2005 data sets to a much lower 6070% on the MUC 6 and 7 data sets (e.g.",
        "Soon et al.",
        "(2001) and Yang et al.",
        "(2003)).",
        "What accounts for these differences?",
        "Are they due to properties of the documents or domains?",
        "Or do differences in the coreference task definitions account for the differences in performance?",
        "Given a new text collection and domain, what level of performance should we expect?",
        "We have little understanding ofwhich aspects ofthe coreference resolution problem are handled well or poorly by state-of-the-art systems.",
        "Except for some fairly general statements, for example that proper names are easier to resolve than pronouns, which are easier than common nouns, there has been little analysis of which aspects of the problem have achieved success and which remain elusive.",
        "The goal of this paper is to take initial steps toward making sense of the disparate performance results reported for NP coreference resolution.",
        "For our investigations, we employ a state-of-the-art classification-based NP coreference resolver and focus on the widely used MUC and ACE corefer-ence resolution data sets.",
        "We hypothesize that performance variation within and across coreference resolvers is, at least in part, a function of (1) the (sometimes unstated) assumptions in evaluation methodologies, and (2) the relative difficulty of the benchmark text corpora.",
        "With these in mind, Section 3 first examines three subproblems that play an important role in coreference resolution: named entity recognition, anaphoricity determination, and coreference element detection.",
        "We quantitatively measure the impact of each of these subproblems on coreference resolution performance as a whole.",
        "Our results suggest that the availability of accurate detectors for anaphoricity or coreference elements could substantially improve the performance of state-of-the-art resolvers, while improvements to named entity recognition likely offer little gains.",
        "Our results also confirm that the assumptions adopted in",
        "Table 1: Coreference Definition Differences for MUC and ACE.",
        "(GPE refers to geopolitical entities.)",
        "some evaluations dramatically simplify the resolution task, rendering it an unrealistic surrogate for the original problem.",
        "In Section 4, we quantify the difficulty of a text corpus with respect to coreference resolution by analyzing performance on different resolution classes.",
        "Our goals are twofold: to measure the level of performance of state-of-the-art corefer-ence resolvers on different types of anaphora, and to develop a quantitative measure for estimating coreference resolution performance on new data sets.",
        "We introduce a coreference performance prediction (CPP) measure and show that it accurately predicts the performance of our coreference re-solver.",
        "As a side effect of our research, we provide a new set of much-needed benchmark results for coreference resolution under common sets of fully-specified evaluation assumptions."

        "In this section, we outline the differences between the MUC and ACE coreference resolution tasks, and define terminology for the rest of the paper.",
        "Noun phrase coreference resolution is the process of determining whether two noun phrases (NPs) refer to the same real-world entity or concept.",

        "The ACE definition, on the other hand, includes relative pronouns and gerunds, excludes all nested nouns that are not themselves NPs, and allows premodifier NE mentions of geopolitical entities and locations, such as \"Russian\" in \"Russian politicians\".",

        "The B algorithm (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998) computes a precision and recall score for each CE: precision(ce) = \\Rce n Kce\\/\\Rce\\ recall(ce) = \\Rœ n Kce\\/\\Kce\\, where Rce is the coreference chain to which ce is assigned in the response (i.e. the system-generated output) and Kce is the coreference chain that contains ce in the key (i.e. the gold standard).",

        "B Complications.",
        "Unlike the MUC score, which counts links between CEs, B presumes that the gold standard and the system response are clusterings over the same set of CEs.",
        "This, of course, is not the case when the system automatically identifies the CEs, so the scoring algorithm requires a mapping between extracted and annotated CEs.",
        "We will use the term twin(ce) to refer to the unique annotated/extracted CE to which the extracted/annotated CE is matched.",
        "We say that a CE is twinless (has no twin) if no corresponding CE is identified.",
        "A twinless extracted CE signals that the resolver extracted a spurious CE, while an annotated CE is twinless when the resolver fails to extract it.",
        "Unfortunately, it is unclear how the B score should be computed for twinless CEs.",
        "Bengtson and Roth (2008) simply discard twinless CEs, but this solution is likely too lenient – it doles no punishment for mistakes on twinless annotated or extracted CEs and it would be tricked, for example, by a system that extracts only the CEs about which it is most confident.",
        "We propose two different ways to deal with twinless CEs for B.",
        "One option, Ball, retains all twinless extracted CEs.",
        "It computes the precision as above whence has a twin, and computes the precision as 1/\\Rce\\ if ce is twinless.",
        "(Similarly, recall(ce) = 1/\\Kce\\ if ce is twinless.)",
        "The second option, B0, discards twinless extracted CEs, but penalizes recall by setting recall(ce) = 0 for all twinless annotated CEs.",

        "The MUC score is highest for the MUC6 data set, while the four ACE data sets show much higher B scores as compared to the two MUC data sets.",
        "The latter occurs because the ACE data sets include singletons.",
        "The classification threshold, however, can be gainfully employed to control the trade-off between precision and recall.",
        "This has not traditionally been done in learning-based coreference resolution research – possibly because there is not much training data available to sacrifice as a validation set.",
        "Nonetheless, we hypothesized that estimating a threshold from just the training data might be effective.",
        "Our results (baseline box in Table 3) indicate that this indeed works well.With the exception of MUC6, results on all data sets and for all scoring algorithms improve; moreover, the scores approach those for runs using an optimal threshold (box 3) for the experiment as determined by using the test set.",
        "In all remaining experiments, we learn the threshold from the training set as in the baseline system.",
        "Below, we resume our investigation of the role of three coreference resolution subtasks and measure the impact of each on overall performance.",
        "Previous work has shown that resolving corefer-ence between proper names is relatively easy (e.g. Kameyama (1997)) because string matching functions specialized to the type of proper name (e.g. person vs. location) are quite accurate.",
        "Thus, we would expect a coreference resolution system to depend critically on its Named Entity (NE) extractor.",
        "On the other hand, state-of-the-art NE taggers are already quite good, so improving this component may not provide much additional gain.",

        "Table 3: Impact of Three Subtasks on Coreference Resolution Performance.",

        "The improvements tend to be small, however, between 0.5 to 3 performance points.",
        "We attribute this to two factors.",
        "First, as noted above, although far from perfect, NE taggers generally perform reasonably well.",
        "Second, only 20 to 25% of the coreference element resolutions required for these data sets involve a proper name (see Section 4).",
        "Conclusion #1: Improving the performance of NE taggers is not likely to have a large impact on the performance of state-of-the-art coreference resolution systems.",
        "We expect CE detection to be an important subproblem for an end-to-end coreference system.",
        "Results for a system that assumes perfect CEs are shown in box 5 of Table 3.",
        "For these runs, ReconcilEaclot uses only the annotated CEs for both training and testing.",
        "Using perfect CEs solves a large part of the coreference resolution task: the annotated CEs divulge anaphoricity information, perfect NP boundaries, and perfect information regarding the coreference relation defined for the data set.",
        "We see that focusing attention on all and only the annotated CEs leads to (often substantial) improvements in performance on all metrics over all data sets, especially when measured using the MUC score.",
        "Conclusion #2: Improving the ability of coreference resolvers to identify coreference elements would likely improve the state-of-the-art immensely – by 10-20 points in MUC F1 score and from 2-12 F1 points for B.",
        "This finding explains previously published results that exhibit striking variability when run with annotated CEs vs. system-extracted CEs.",
        "On the MUC6 data set, for example, the best published MUC score using extracted CEs is approximately 71 (Yang et al., 2003), while multiple systems have produced MUC scores of approximately 85 when using annotated CEs (e.g. Luo et al.",
