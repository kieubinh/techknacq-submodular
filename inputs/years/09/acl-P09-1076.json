        "Articles in the Penn TreeBank were identified as being reviews, summaries, letters to the editor, news reportage, corrections, wit and short verse, or quarterly profit reports.",
        "All but the latter three were then characterised in terms of features manually annotated in the Penn Discourse TreeBank – discourse connectives and their senses.",
        "Summaries turned out to display very different discourse features than the other three genres.",
        "Letters also appeared to have some different features.",
        "The two main findings involve (1) differences between genres in the senses associated with intra-sentential discourse connectives, inter-sentential discourse connectives and inter-sentential discourse relations that are not lexically marked; and (2) differences within all four genres between the senses of discourse relations not lexically marked and those that are marked.",
        "The first finding means that genre should be made a factor in automated sense labelling of non-lexically marked discourse relations.",
        "The second means that lexically marked relations provide a poor model for automated sense labelling of relations that are not lexically marked."

        "It is well-known that texts differ from each other in a variety of ways, including their topic, the reading level of their intended audience, and their intended purpose (eg, to instruct, to inform, to express an opinion, to summarize, to take issue with or disagree, to correct, to entertain, etc.).",
        "This paper considers differences in texts in the well-known Penn TreeBank (hereafter, PTB) and in particular, how these differences show up in the Penn Discourse TreeBank (Prasad et al., 2008).",
        "It first describes ways in which texts can vary (Section 2).",
        "It then illustrates the variety of texts to be found in the the PTB and suggests their grouping into four broad genres (Section 3).",
        "After a brief introduction to the Penn Discourse Tree-Bank (hereafter, PDTB) in Section 4, Sections 5 and 6 show that these four genres display differences in connective frequency and in terms of the senses associated with intra-sentential connectives (eg, subordinating conjunctions), inter-sentential connectives (eg, inter-sentential coordinating conjunctions) and those inter-sentential relations that are not lexically marked.",
        "Section 7 considers recent efforts to induce effective procedures for automated sense labelling of discourse relations that are not lexically marked (Elwell and Baldridge, 2008; Marcu and Echihabi, 2002; Pitler et al., 2008).",
        "It makes two points.",
        "First, because genres differ from each other in the senses associated with such relations, genre should be made a factor in their automated sense labelling.",
        "Secondly, because different senses are being conveyed when a relation is lexically marked than when it isn't, lexically marked relations provide a poor model for automated sense labelling of relations that are not lexically marked."

        "The dimension of text variation of interest here is genre, which can be viewed externally, in terms of the communicative purpose of a text (Swales, 1990), or internally, in terms of features common to texts sharing a communicative purpose.",
        "(Kessler et al., 1997) combine these views by saying that a genre should not be so broad that the texts belonging to it don't share any distinguishing properties – ... we would probably not use the term \"genre\" to describe merely the class of texts that have the objective of persuading someone to do something, since that class - which would include editorials, sermons, prayers, advertisements, and so forth - has no distinguishing formal properties (Kessler et al., 1997, p. 33).",
        "A balanced corpus like the Brown Corpus of American English or the British National Corpus, will sample texts from different genres, to give a representative view of how the language is used.",
        "For example, the fifteen categories of published material sampled for the Brown Corpus include Press Reportage, Press Editorials, Press Reviews and five different types of Fiction.",
        "In contrast, experiments on what genres would be helpful in web search for particular types of information on a topic led (Rosso, 2008), to 18 class labels that his subjects could reliably apply to web pages (here, ones from an .edu domain) with over 50% agreement.",
        "These class labels included article, course description, course list, diary, weblog or blog, FAQ/help and form.",
        "in both Brown's published material and Rosso's web pages, the selected class labels (genres) reflect external purpose rather than distinctive internal features.",
        "Such features are, however, of great interest in both text analysis and text processing.",
        "Text analysts have shown that there are indeed interesting features that correlate more strongly with certain genres than with others.",
        "For example, (Biber, 1986) considered 41 linguistic features previously mentioned in the literature, including type/token ratio, average word length, and such frequencies as that of particular words (eg, I/you, it, the proverb do), particular word types (eg, place adverbs, hedges), particular parts-of-speech (eg, past tense verbs, adjectives), and particular syntactic constructions (eg, that-clauses, if -clauses, reduced relative clauses).",
        "He found certain clusters of these features (i.e. their presense or absense) correlated well with certain text types.",
        "For example, press reportage scored the highest with respect to high frequency of that-clauses and contractions, and low type-token ratio (i.e. a varied vocabulary for a given length of text), while general and romantic fiction scored much lower on these features.",
        "(Biber, 2003) showed significant differences in the internal structure of noun phrases used in fiction, news, academic writing and face-to-face conversations.",
        "Such features are of similar interest in text processing - in particular, automated genre classification (Dewdney et al., 2001; Finn and Kushmer-ick, 2006; Kessler et al., 1997; Stamatatos et al., 2000; Wolters and Kirsten, 1999) - which relies on there being reliably detectable features that can be used to distinguish one class from another.",
        "This is where the caveat from (Kessler et al., 1997) becomes relevant: A particular genre shouldn't be taken so broadly as to have no distinguishing features, nor so narrowly as to have no general applicability.",
        "But this still allows variability in what is taken to be a genre.",
        "There is no one \"right set\"."

        "First, the PDTB annotates the arguments of explicit discourse connectives:",
        "(1) Even so, according to Mr. Salmore, the ad was \"devastating\" because it raised questions about Mr. Courter's credibility.",

        "The number 0041 indicates that the example comes from subsection wsj_0041 ofthePTB.",
        "Secondly, the PDTB annotates implicit discourse relations between adjacent sentences within the same paragraph, where the second does not contain an explicit inter-sentential connective:",
        "(2) The projects already under construction will increase Las Vegas's supply of hotel rooms by 11,795, or nearly 20%, to 75,500.",
        "[Implicit \"so\"] By a rule of thumb of 1.5 new jobs for each new hotel room, Clark County will have nearly 18,000 new jobs.",
        "(0994)",
        "With implicit discourse relations, annotators were asked to identify one or more explicit connectives that could be inserted to lexicalize the relation between the arguments.",
        "Here, they have been identified as the connective \"so\".",
        "Where annotators could not identify such an implicit connective, they were asked if they could identify a non-connective phrase in arg2 (e.g.",
        "\"this means\") that realised the implicit discourse relation instead (AltLex), or a relation holding between the second sentence and an entity mentioned in the first (EntRel), rather than the interpretation of the previous sentence itself:",
        "(3) Rated triple-A by Moody's and S&P, the issue will be sold through First Boston Corp.",
        "The issue is backed by a 12% letter of credit from Credit Suisse.",
        "If the annotators couldn't identify either, they would assert that no discourse relation held between the adjacent sentences (NoRel).",
        "Note that because resource limitations meant that implicit discourse relations (comprising implicit connectives, AltLex, EntRel and NoRel) were only annotated within paragraphs, longer paragraphs (as there were in essays) could potentially mean more implicit discourse relations were annotated.",
        "The third element of PDTB annotation is that of the senses of connectives, both explicit and implicit.",
        "These have been manually annotated using the three-level sense hierarchy described in detail in (Miltsakaki et al., 2008).",
        "Briefly, there are four top-level classes:",
        "• Temporal, where the situations described in the arguments are related temporally;",
        "• Contingency, where the situation described in one argument causally influences that described in the other;",
        "• Comparison, used to highlight some prominent difference that holds between the situations described in the two arguments;",
        "• Expansion, where one argument expands the situation described in the other and moves the narrative or exposition forward.",
        "Temporal relations can be further specified to Asynchronous and Synchronous, depending on whether or not the situations described by the arguments are temporally ordered.",
        "Contingency can be further specified to Cause and Condition, depending on whether or not the existential status of the arguments depends on the connective (i.e. no for Cause, and yes for Condition).",
        "Comparison can be further specified to Contrast, where the two arguments share a predicate or property whose difference is being highlighted, and Concession, where \"the highlighted differences are related to expectations raised by one argument which are then denied by the other\" (Miltsakaki et al., 2008, p.282).",
        "Finally, Expansion has six subtypese, including CONJUNCTION, where the situation described in ARG2, provides new information related to the situation described in arg1; Restatement, where arg2 restates or redescribes the situation described in ARG1; and ALTERNATIVE, where the two arguments evoke situations taken to be alternatives.",
        "These two levels are sufficient to show significant differences between genres.",
        "The only other thing to note is that annotators could be as specific as they chose in annotating the sense of a connective: If they could not decide on the specific type of Comparison holding between the two arguments of a connective, or they felt that both subtypes of Comparison were being expressed, they could simply sense annotate the connective with the label Comparison.",
        "I will comment on this in Section 6.",
        "The fourth element of PDTB annotation is attribution (Prasad et al., 2007; Prasad et al., 2008).",

        "This paper has, for the first time, provided genre information about the articles in the Penn Tree-Bank.",
        "It has characterised each genre in terms of features manually annotated in the Penn Discourse TreeBank, and used this to show that genre should be made a factor in automated sense labelling of discourse relations that are not explicitly marked.",
        "There are clearly other potential differences that one might usefully investigate: For example, following (Pitler et al., 2008), one might look at whether connectives with multiple senses occur with only one of those senses (or mainly so) in a particular genre.",
        "Or one might investigate how patterns of attribution vary in different genres, since this is relevant to subjectivity in text.",
        "Other aspects of genre may be even more significant for language technology.",
        "For example, whereas the first sentence of a news article might be an effective summary of its contents - e.g.",
        "(4) Singer Bette Midler won a $400,000 federal court jury verdict against Young & Rubicam in a case that threatens a popular advertising industry practice of using \"sound-alike\" performers to tout products.",
        "(wsj_0485) it might be less so in the case of an essay, even one of about the same length - e.g.",
        "Of course, to exploit these differences, it is important to be able to automatically identify what genre or genres a text belongs to.",
        "Fortunately, there is a growing body of work on genre-based text classification, including (Dewdney et al., 2001; Finn and Kushmerick, 2006; Kessler et al., 1997; Stamatatos et al., 2000; Wolters and Kirsten, 1999).",
        "Of particular interest in this regard is whether other news corpora, such as the New York Times Annotated Corpus (Linguistics Data Consortium Catalog Number: LDC2008T19) manifest similar properties to the WSJ in their different genres.",
        "If so, then genre-specific extrapolation from the WSJ Corpus may enable better performance on a wider range of corpora."
