        "The lexical gap (or lexical chasm) often observed between queries and documents or questions and answers is a pervasive problem both in Information Retrieval (IR) and Question Answering (QA).",
        "This problem arises from alternative ways of conveying the same information, due to synonymy or paraphrasing, and is especially severe for retrieval over shorter documents, such as sentence retrieval or question retrieval in Question & Answer archives.",
        "Several solutions to this problem have been proposed including query expansion (Riezler et al., 2007; Fang, 2008), query reformulation or paraphrasing (Hermjakob et al., 2002; Tomuro, 2003; Zukerman and Raskutti, 2002) and semantic information retrieval (Miiller et al., 2007).",
        "Berger and Lafferty (1999) have formulated a further solution to the lexical gap problem consisting in integrating monolingual statistical translation models in the retrieval process.",
        "Monolingual translation models encode statistical word associations which are trained on parallel monolingual corpora.",
        "The major drawback of this approach lies in the limited availability of truly parallel monolingual corpora.",
        "In practice, training data for translation-based retrieval often consist in question-answer pairs, usually extracted from the evaluation corpus itself (Riezler et al., 2007; Xue et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2008).",
        "While collection-specific translation models effectively encode statistical word associations for the target document collection, it also introduces a bias in the evaluation and makes it difficult to assess the quality of the translation model per se, independently from a specific task and document collection.",
        "In this paper, we propose new kinds of datasets for training domain-independent monolingual translation models.",
        "We use the definitions and glosses provided for the same term by different lexical semantic resources to automatically train the translation models.",
        "This approach has been very recently made possible by the emergence of new kinds of lexical semantic and encyclopedic resources such as Wikipedia and Wiktionary.",
        "These resources are freely available, up-to-date and have a broad coverage and good quality.",
        "Thanks to the combination of several resources, it is possible to obtain monolingual parallel corpora which are large enough to train domain-independent translation models.",
        "In addition, we collected question-answer pairs and manually-tagged question reformulations from a social Q&A site.",
        "We use these datasets to build further translation models.",
        "Translation-based retrieval models have been widely used in practice by the IR and QA community.",
        "However, the quality of the semantic information encoded in the translation tables has never been assessed intrinsically.",
        "To do so, we compare translation probabilities with concept vector based semantic relatedness measures with respect to human relatedness rankings for reference word pairs.",
        "This study provides empirical evidence for the high quality of the semantic information encoded in statistical word translation tables.",
        "We then use the translation models in an answer finding task based on a new question-answer dataset which is totally independent from the resources used for training the translation models.",
        "This extrinsic evaluation shows that our translation models significantly improve the results over the query likelihood and the vector-space model.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organised as follows.",
        "Section 2 discusses related work on semantic relatedness and statistical translation models for retrieval.",
        "Section 3 presents the monolingual parallel datasets we used for obtaining monolingual translation probabilities.",
        "Semantic relatedness experiments are detailed in Section 4.",
        "Section 5 presents answer finding experiments.",
        "Finally, we conclude in Section 6."

        "These models attempt to address synonymy and polysemy problems by encoding statistical word associations trained on monolingual parallel corpora.",
        "This method offers several advantages.",
        "First, it bases upon a sound mathematical formulation of the retrieval model.",
        "Second, it is not as computationally expensive as other semantic retrieval models, since it only relies on a word translation table which can easily be computed before retrieval.",
        "The main drawback lies in the availability of suitable training data for the translation probabilities.",
        "Berger and Laf-ferty (1999) initially built synthetic training data consisting of queries automatically generated from documents.",
        "Berger et al.",
        "(2000) proposed to train translation models on question-answer pairs taken from Usenet FAQs and call-center dialogues, with answers corresponding to the \"source\" language and questions to the \"target\" language.",

        "(2005) automatically clustered semantically similar questions based on their answers.",
        "Murdock and Croft (2005) created a first parallel corpus of synonym pairs extracted from WordNet, and an additional parallel corpus of English words translating to the same Arabic term in a parallel English-Arabic corpus.",
        "Similar work has also been performed in the area of query expansion using training data consisting of FAQ pages (Riezler et al., 2007) or queries and clicked snippets from query logs (Riezler et al., 2008).",
        "All in all, translation models have been shown to significantly improve the retrieval results over traditional baselines for document retrieval (Berger and Lafferty, 1999), question retrieval in Question & Answer archives (Jeon et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2008; Xue et al., 2008) and for sentence retrieval (Murdock and Croft, 2005).",
        "Many of the approaches previously described have used parallel data extracted from the retrieval corpus itself.",
        "The translation models obtained are therefore domain and collection-specific, which introduces a bias in the evaluation and makes it difficult to assess to what extent the translation model may be reused for other tasks and document collections.",
        "We henceforth propose a new approach for building monolingual translation models relying on domain-independent lexical semantic resources.",
        "Moreover, we extensively compare the results obtained by these models with models obtained from a different type of dataset, namely Question & Answer archives.",
        "The rationale behind translation-based retrieval models is that monolingual translation probabilities encode some form of semantic knowledge.",
        "The semantic similarity and relatedness of words has traditionally been assessed through corpus-based and knowledge-based measures.",
        "Corpus-based measures include Hyperspace Analogue to",
        "Language (HAL) (Lund and Burgess, 1996) and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Landauer et al., 1998).",
        "Knowledge-based measures rely on lexical semantic resources such as WordNet and comprise path length based measures (Rada et al., 1989) and concept vector based measures (Qiu and Frei, 1993).",
        "These measures have recently also been applied to new collaboratively constructed resources such as Wikipedia (Zesch et al., 2007) and Wik-tionary (Zesch et al., 2008), with good results.",
        "While classical measures of semantic relatedness have been extensively studied and compared, based on comparisons with human relatedness judgements or word-choice problems, there is no comparable intrinsic study of the relatedness measures obtained through word translation probabilities.",
        "In this study, we use the correlation with human rankings for reference word pairs to investigate how word translation probabilities compare with traditional semantic relatedness measures.",
        "To our knowledge, this is the first time that word-to-word translation probabilities are used for ranking word-pairs with respect to their semantic relatedness."

        "The results reported in Table 4 show that models incorporating monolingual translation probabilities perform consistently better than both baseline systems especially when they are used in combination.",
        "It is however difficult to provide a ranking of the different types of training data based on the retrieval results: it seems that LSR is slightly more performant than WAQ and WAQA, both alone and in combination, but the improvement is minor.",
        "It is worth noticing that while the LSR training data are comparatively smaller than WAQ and WAQA, they however yield comparable results.",
        "The linear combination of datasets (WAQ+WAQA+LSRLin) yields statistically significant performance improvement when compared to the models without combinations (except when compared to WAQA for R-Prec1, p>0.05), which shows that the different datasets and resources used are complementary and each contribute to the overall result.",

        "We have presented three datasets for training statistical word translation models for use in answer finding: question-answer pairs, manually-tagged question reformulations and glosses for the same term extracted from several lexical semantic resources.",
        "It is the first time that the two latter types of datasets have been used for this task.",
        "We have also provided the first intrinsic evaluation of word translation probabilities with respect to human relatedness rankings for reference word pairs.",
        "This evaluation has shown that, despite the simplicity of the method, monolingual translation models are comparable to concept vector semantic relatedness measures for this task.",
        "Moreover, models based on translation probabilities yield significant improvement over baseline approaches for answer finding, especially when different types of training data are combined.",
        "The experiments bear strong evidence that several datasets encode different and complementary types of knowledge, which are all useful for retrieval.",
        "In order to integrate semantics in retrieval, it is therefore advisable to combine both knowledge specific to the task at hand, e.g. question-answer pairs, and external knowledge, as contained in lexical semantic resources.",
        "In the future, we would like to further evaluate the models presented in this paper for different tasks, such as question paraphrase retrieval, and larger datasets.",
        "We also plan to improve question analysis by automatically identifying question topic and question focus.",
