        "Question Answering (QA), which aims to provide answers to human-generated questions automatically, is an important research area in natural language processing (NLP) and much progress has been made on this topic in previous years.",
        "However, the objective of most state-of-the-art QA systems is to find answers to factual questions, such as \"What is the longest river in the United States?\"",
        "and \"Who is Andrew Carnegie?\"",
        "In fact, rather than factual information, people would also like to know about others' opinions, thoughts and feelings toward some specific objects, people and events.",
        "Some examples of these questions are: \"How is Bush's decision not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol looked upon by Japan and other US allies?",
        "\"(Stoyanov et al., 2005) and \"Why do people like Subway Sandwiches?\"",
        "from TAC 2008 (Dang, 2008).",
        "Systems designed to deal with such questions are called opinion QA systems.",
        "Researchers (Stoyanov et al., 2005) have found that opinion questions have very different characteristics when compared with fact-based questions: opinion questions are often much longer, more likely to represent partial answers rather than complete answers and vary much more widely.",
        "These features make opinion QA a harder problem to tackle than fact-based QA.",
        "Also as shown in (Stoy-anov et al., 2005), directly applying previous systems designed for fact-based QA onto opinion QA tasks would not achieve good performances.",
        "Similar to other complex QA tasks (Chen et al., 2006; Cui et al., 2007), the problem of opinion QA can be viewed as a sentence ranking problem.",
        "The Opinion QA task needs to consider not only the topic relevance of a sentence (to identify whether this sentence matches the topic of the question) but also the sentiment of a sentence (to identify the opinion polarity of a sentence).",
        "Current solutions to opinion QA tasks are generally in ad hoc styles: the topic score and the opinion score are usually separately calculated and then combined via a linear combination (Varma et al., 2008) or just filter out the candidate without matching the question sentiment (Stoyanov et al., 2005).",
        "However, topic and opinion are not independent in reality.",
        "The opinion words are closely associated with their contexts.",
        "Another problem is that existing algorithms compute the score for each answer candidate individually, in other words, they do not consider the relations between answer candidates.",
        "The quality of a answer candidate is not only determined by the relevance to the question, but also by other candidates.",
        "For example, the good answer may be mentioned by many candidates.",
        "In this paper, we propose two models to address the above limitations of previous sentence ranking models.",
        "We incorporate both the topic relevance information and the opinion sentiment information into our sentence ranking procedure.",
        "Meanwhile, our sentence ranking models could naturally consider the relationships between different answer candidates.",
        "More specifically, our first model, called Opinion PageRank, incorporates opinion sentiment information into the graph model as a condition.",
        "The second model, called Opinion HITS model, considers the sentences as authorities and both question topic information and opinion sentiment information as hubs.",
        "The experiment results on the TAC QA data setdemon-strate the effectiveness of the proposed Random Walk based methods.",
        "Our proposed method performs better than the best method in the TAC 2008 competition.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces some related works.",
        "We will discuss our proposed models in Section 3.",
        "In Section 4, we present an overview of our opinion QA system.",
        "The experiment results are shown in Section 5.",

        "Few previous studies have been done on opinion QA.",
        "To our best knowledge, (Stoyanov et al., 2005) first created an opinion QA corpus OpQA.",
        "They find that opinion QA is a more challenging task than factual question answering, and they point out that traditional fact-based QA approaches may have difficulty on opinion QA tasks if unchanged.",
        "(Somasundaran et al., 2007) argues that making finer grained distinction of subjective types (sentiment and arguing) further improves the QA system.",
        "For non-English opinion QA, (Ku et al., 2007) creates a Chinese opinion QA corpus.",
        "They classify opinion questions into six types and construct three components to retrieve opinion answers.",
        "Relevant answers are further processed by focus detection, opinion scope identification and polarity detection.",
        "Some works on opinion mining are motivated by opinion question answering.",
        "(Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003) discusses a necessary component for an opinion question answering system: separating opinions from fact at both the document and sentence level.",
        "(Soo-Min and Hovy, 2005) addresses another important component of opinion question answering: finding opinion holders.",
        "More recently, TAC 2008 QA track (evolved from TREC) focuses on finding answers to opinion questions (Dang, 2008).",
        "Opinion questions retrieve sentences or passages as answers which are relevant for both question topic and question sentiment.",
        "Most TAC participants employ a strategy of calculating two types of scores for answer candidates, which are the topic score measure and the opinion score measure (the opinion information expressed in the answer candidate).",
        "However, most approaches simply combined these two scores by a weighted sum, or removed candidates that didn't match the polarity of questions, in order to extract the opinion answers.",
        "Algorithms based on Markov Random Walk have been proposed to solve different kinds of ranking problems, most of which are inspired by the PageRank algorithm (Page et al., 1998) and the HITS algorithm (Kleinberg, 1999).",
        "These two algorithms were initially applied to the task of Web search and some of their variants have been proved successful in a number of applications, including fact-based QA and text summarization (Erkan and Radev, 2004; Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004; Otterbacher et al., 2005; Wan and Yang, 2008).",
        "Generally, such models would first construct a directed or undirected graph to represent the relationship between sentences and then certain graph-based ranking methods are applied on the graph to compute the ranking score for each sentence.",
        "Sentences with high scores are then added into the answer set or the summary.",
        "However, to the best of our knowledge, all previous Markov Random Walk-based sentence ranking models only make use of topic relevance information, i.e. whether this sentence is relevant to the fact we are looking for, thus they are limited to fact-based QA tasks.",
        "To solve the opinion QA problems, we need to consider both topic and sentiment in a non-trivial manner."

        "In this section, we formulate the opinion question answering problem as a topic and sentiment based sentence ranking task.",
        "In order to naturally integrate the topic and opinion information into the graph based sentence ranking framework, we propose two random walk based models for solving the problem, i.e. an Opinion PageRank model and an Opinion HITS model.",
        "In order to rank sentence for opinion question answering, two aspects should be taken into account.",
        "First, the answer candidate is relevant to the question topic; second, the answer candidate is suitable for question sentiment.",
        "Considering Question Topic: We first introduce how to incorporate the question topic into the Markov Random Walk model, which is similar as the Topic-sensitive LexRank (Otterbacher et al., 2005).",
        "Given the set Vs = [vi] containing all the sentences to be ranked, we construct a graph where each node represents a sentence and each edge weight between sentence viand sentence Vj is induced from sentence similarity measure as follows: p(i ->■ j) = |ff7/} where f(i ->■ j) represents the similarity between sentence viand sentence Vj, here is cosine similarity (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999).",
        "We define f (i – i) = 0 to avoid self transition.",
        "Note that p(i – j) is usually not equal to p(j – i).",
        "We also compute the similarity rel(vi\\q) of a sentence vi to the question topic q using the cosine measure.",
        "This relevance score is then normalized as follows to make the sum of all relevance values of the sentences equal",
        "The saliency score Score(vi) for sentence vican be calculated by mixing topic relevance score and scores of all other sentences linked with it as follows: Score(vi) = j=iScore(vj) • p(j – i) + (1 – y)rel' (vi\\q), where y is the damping factor as in the PageRank algorithm.",
        "The matrix form is: p = p + (1 /x)a, where p = [Score(vi)}\\Vs|x1 is the vector of saliency scores for the sentences; M = [p(i – j)]|vs |x|vs| is the graph with each entry corresponding to the transition probability; a = [re1/(vi|q)]|ys|x1 is the vector containing the relevance scores of all the sentences to the question.",
        "The above process can be considered as a Markov chain by taking the sentences as the states and the corresponding transition matrix is given by",
        "A = \\xMT + (1 - ^)gaT.",
        "Considering Topics and Sentiments Together: In order to incorporate the opinion information and topic information for opinion sentence ranking in an unified framework, we propose an Opinion PageRank model (Figure 1) based on a two-layer link graph (Liu and Ma, 2005; Wan and Yang, 2008).",
        "In our opinion PageRank model, the first layer contains all the sentiment words from a lexicon to represent the opinion information, and the second layer denotes the sentence relationship in the topic sensitive Markov Random Walk model discussed above.",
        "The dashed lines between these two layers indicate the conditional influence between the opinion information and the sentences to be ranked.",
        "Formally, the new representation for the two-layer graph is denoted as G* = (Vs, Vo, Ess, Eso), where Vs = [vi] is the set of sentences and Vo = [oj ] is the set of sentiment words representing the opinion information; Ess = [eijlvi,vj £ Vs] corresponds to all links between sentences and Eso = [eij|vi £ Vs,oj £ Vo] corresponds to the opinion correlation between a sentence and the sentiment words.",
        "For further discussions, we let n(oj) £ [0,1] denote the sentiment strength of word oj, and let ui(vi,oj) £ [0,1] denote the strength of the correlation between sentence viand word oj.",
        "We incorporate the two factors into the transition probability from vi to vj and the new transition probability p(i – j|Op(vi), Op(vj)) is defined as /(^l°PK),Opfe)) when ^ f + 0, and defined as 0 otherwise, where Op(vi) is denoted as the opinion information of sentence vi, and f (i – j|Op(vi), Op(vj)) is the new similarity score between two sentences viand vj, conditioned on the opinion information expressed by the sentiment words they contain.",
        "We propose to compute the conditional similarity score by linearly combining the scores conditioned on the source opinion (i.e. f (i – j|Op(vi))) and the destination opinion (i.e. f (i – j|Op(vj))) as follows:",
        "where X £ [0,1] is the combination weight controlling the relative contributions from the source opinion and the destination opinion.",
        "In this study, for simplicity, we define n(oj) as 1, if oj exists in the sentiment lexicon, otherwise 0.",
        "And ui(vi, oj) is described as an indicative function.",
        "In other words, if word oj appears in the sentence vi, tv(vi,oj) is equal to 1.",
        "Otherwise, its value is 0.",
        "Then the new row-normalized matrix M* is defined as follows: M* = p(i – j|Op(i), Opj).",
        "The final sentence score for Opinion PageRank model is then denoted by: Score(vi) = y • Score(vj) • M**% + (1 – y) • rel'(s%|q).",
        "The matrix form is: p = yM*Tp + (1 – y) • a.",
        "The final transition matrix is then denoted as: A* = yM*T + (1 – y)eaT and the sentence scores are obtained by the principle eigenvector of the new transition matrix A* .",
        "The word's sentiment score is fixed in Opinion PageRank.",

        "This model can dynamically learn the word sentiment score towards a specific question.",
        "HITS algorithm distinguishes the hubs and authorities in the objects.",
        "A hub object has links to many authorities, and an authority object has high-quality content and there are many hubs linking to it.",
        "The hub scores and authority scores are computed in a recursive way.",

        "The upper level contains all the sentiment words from a lexicon, which represent their opinion information.",
        "The lower level contains all the words, which represent their topic information.",
        "The middle level contains all the opinion sentences to be ranked.",

        "Figure 2 gives the bipartite graph representation, where the upper opinion layer is merged with lower topic layer together as the hubs, and the middle sentence layer is considered as the authority.",
        "Formally, the representation for the bipartite graph is denoted as G# = (Vs,V>,Vt, Eso, Est), where Vs = [ vi] is the set of sentences.",

        "tfj • idfj (Otterbacher et al., 2005).",
        "Our new opinion HITS model is different from the basic HITS algorithm in two aspects.",
        "First, we consider the topic relevance when computing the sentence authority score based on the topic hub level as follows: Authsen(vi) oc tWij >o twij • topic_score(j) -hubtopicli), where topic_score(j) is empirically defined as 1, if the word j is in the topic set (we will discuss in next section), and 0.1 otherwise.",
        "Second, in our opinion HITS model, there are two aspects to boost the sentence authority score: we simultaneously consider both topic information and opinion information as hubs.",
        "The final scores for authority sentence, hub topic and hub opinion in our opinion HITS model are defined as:",

        "For computation of the final scores, the initial scores of all nodes, including sentences, topic words and opinion words, are set to 1 and the above iterative steps are used to compute the new scores until convergence.",
        "Usually the convergence of the iteration algorithm is achieved when the difference between the scores computed at two successive iterations for any nodes falls below a given threshold (10e-6 in this study).",

        "We vary from 0 to 1 with an interval of 0.1, and find that the best baseline result 0.170 is achieved when a=0.1.",
        "This is because the topic information has been considered during candidate extraction, the system considering more opinion information (lower ) achieves better.",
        "We will use this best result as baseline score in following experiments.",

        "The best result is achieved when / = 0.8.",
        "This figure also shows the importance of reinforcement between answer candidates.",
        "If we don't consider the sentence similarity(/x = 0), the performance drops significantly.",
        "The parameter 7 combines the opinion hub score and topic hub score in the Opinion HITS model.",

        "People like it because it is easily used, accurate and sometimes free.",
        "From the Table 2, we can see that the top topic words are the most related with question topic, and the top opinion words are question-specific sentiment words, such as \"accurate\", \"easily\", \"free\", not just general opinion words, like \"great\", \"excellent\" and \"good\".",
