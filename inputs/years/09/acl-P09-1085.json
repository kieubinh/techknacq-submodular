        "While OOV is always a problem for most languages in ASR, in the Chinese case the problem can be avoided by utilizing character n-grams and moderate performances can be obtained.",
        "However, character n-gram has its own limitation and proper addition of new words can increase the ASR performance.",
        "Here we propose a discriminative lexicon adaptation approach for improved character accuracy, which not only adds new words but also deletes some words from the current lexicon.",
        "Different from other lexicon adaptation approaches, we consider the acoustic features and make our lexicon adaptation criterion consistent with that in the decoding process.",

        "Generally, an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system requires a lexicon.",
        "The lexicon defines the possible set of output words and also the building units in the language model (LM).",
        "Lexical words offer local constraints to combine phonemes into short chunks while the language model combines phonemes into longer chunks by more global constraints.",
        "However, it's almost impossible to include all words into a lexicon both due to the technical difficulty and also the fact that new words are created continuously.",
        "The missed out words will never be recognized, which is the well-known OOV problem.",
        "Using graphemes for OOV handling is proposed in English (Bisani and Ney, 2005).",
        "Although this sacrifices some of the lexical constraints and introduces a further difficulty to combine graphemes back into words, it is compensated by its ability for open vocabulary ASR.",
        "Morphs are another possibility, which are longer than graphemes but shorter than words, in other western languages (Hirsimaki etal.,2005).",
        "Chinese language, on the other hand, is quite different from western languages.",
        "There are no blanks between words and the definition for words is vague.",
        "Since almost all characters in Chinese have their own meanings and words are composed of the characters, there is an obvious solution for the OOV problem: simply using all characters as the lexicon.",
        "In Table 1 we see the differences in character recognition accuracy by using only 5.8K characters and a full set of 61.5K lexicon.",
        "The training set and testing set are the same as those that will be introduced in Section 4.1.",
        "It is clear that characters alone can provide moderate recognition accuracies while augmenting new words significantly improves the performance.",
        "If the words' semantic functionality can be abandoned, which definitely can not be replaced by characters, we can treat words as a means to enhance character recognition accuracy.",
        "Such arguments stand at least for Chinese ASR since they evaluate on character error rate and do not add explicit blanks between words.",
        "Here we formulate a lexicon adaptation problem and try to discriminatively find out not only OOV words beneficial for ASR but also those existing words that can be deleted.",

        "Based on the character PPs, we adapt the current lexicon.",
        "The language model is then retrained according the new lexicon.",
        "Such procedure can be iterated until convergence.",
        "Characters, are not only the output units in Chinese ASR but also have their roles in spoken document retrieval (SDR).",
        "It has been shown that characters are good indexing units.",
        "Generally, characters can at least help OOV query handling; in the subword-based confusion network (S-CN) proposed by Pan et al.",
        "(2007), characters are even better than words for in-vocabulary (IV) queries.",
        "In addition to evaluating the proposed approach on ASR performance, we investigate its helpfulness when integrated with an S-CN framework."

        "Previous works for lexicon adaptation were focused on OOV rate reduction.",
        "Given an adaptation corpus, the standard way is to first identify OOV words.",
        "These OOV words are selected into the current lexicon based on the criterion of frequency or recency (Federico and Bertoldi, 2004).",
        "The language model is also re-estimated according to the new corpus and new derived words.",
        "For Chinese, it is more difficult to follow the same approach since OOV words are not readily identifiable.",
        "Several methods have been proposed to extract OOV words from the new corpus based on different statistics, which include associate norm and context dependency (Chien, 1997), mutual information (Gao et al., 2002), morphological and statistical rules (Chen and Ma, 2002), and strength and spread measure (Fung, 1998).",
        "The used statistics generally help find sequences of characters that are consistent to the general concept of words.",
        "However, if we focus on ASR performance, the constraint of the extracted character strings to be word-like is unnecessary.",
        "Yang et al.",
        "(1998) proposed a way to select new character strings based on average character perplexity reduction.",
        "The word-like constraint is not required and they show a significant improvement on character-based perplexity.",
        "Similar ideas were found to use mutual probability as an effective measure to combine two existing lexicon words into a new word (Saon and Padmanabhan, 2001).",
        "Though proposed for English, this method is effective for Chinese ASR (Chen et al., 2004).",
        "Gao et al.",
        "(2002) combined an information gain-like metric and the perplexity reduction criterion for lexicon word selection.",
        "The application is on Chinese pinyin-to-character conversion, which has very good correlation with the underlying language model perplexity.",
        "The above works actually are all focused on the text level and only consider perplexity effect.",
        "However, as pointed by Rosenfeld (2000), lower perplexity does not always imply lower ASR error rate.",
        "Here we try to face the lexicon adaptation problem from another aspect and take the acoustic signals involved in the decoding procedure into account."

        "(3.",
        "where a(T) and P(t) denote the forward and backward probability masses accumulated up to time t and t obtained by the standard forward-backward algorithm, P(xT |W) is the acoustic likelihood function, PLM (W) the language model score, and Pstart the sum of all path scores in the lattice.",
        "Equation (1) can be extended to the PP of a character of W, say c1 with edge e1:",
        "P.",
        "Here we need two new probabilities, PLM(ci) and P(ti).",
        "Since neither is easy to estimate, we make some approximations.",
        "First, we assume PLM(ci) w PLM(W).",
        "Of course this is not true, the actual relation being PLM(ci) > PLM(W), since the set of events having ci given its history includes a set of events having W given the same history.",
        "We used the above approximation for easier implementation.",
        "Second, we assume that after ci there is only one path from ti to t: through c2 and c3.",
        "This is more reasonable since we restrain the hypotheses space to be inside the word lattice, and pruned paths are simply neglected.",
        "With this approximation we have P(ti) = P(x^ |c2c3) â¢ P(t).",
        "Substituting these two approximate values for PLM (ci) and P(ti) in Equation (2), the result turns out to be very simple: P(ei|A) w P(e|A).",
        "With similar assumptions for the character edges e2 and e3, we have P(e2|A) w P(e3|A) w P(e|A).",
        "Similar results were obtained by Yao et al.",
        "(2008) from a different point of view.",
        "The result that P(eÂ»|A) w P(e|A) seems to diverge from the intuition: approximating an n-segment word by splitting the probability of the entire edge over the segments - P (eÂ»|A) w nP(e|A).",
        "The basic meaning of Equation (1) is to calculate the ratio of the paths going through a specific edge divided by the total paths while each path is weighted properly.",
        "Of course the paths going through a sub-edge eÂ» should be definitely more than the paths through the corresponding full-edge e. As a result, P(eÂ»| A) should usually be greater than P(e| A), as implied by the intuition.",
        "However, the interconnectivity between all sub-edges and the proper weights of them are not easy to be handled well.",
        "Here we constrain the interconnectivity of sub-edges to be only inside its own word edge and also simplify the calculation of the weights of paths.",
        "This offers a tractable solution and the performance is quite acceptable.",
        "After we obtain the PPs for each character arc in the lattice, such as P(eÂ»| A) as mentioned above, we can perform the same clustering method proposed by Mangu et al.",
        "(2000) to convert the word lattice to a strict linear sequence of clusters, each consisting of a set of alternatives of character hypotheses, or a character-based confusion network (CCN) (Fu et al., 2006; Qian et al., 2008).",
        "In CCN we collect the PPs for all character arc c with beginning time t and end time t as P([c; t, t] | A) (based on the above mentioned approximation):",

        "where H stands for a path in the word lattice.",
        "P (H) is the language model score of H (after proper scaling) and P(A|H) is the acoustic model score.",
        "CCN was known to be very helpful in reducing character error rate (CER) since it minimizes the expected CER (Fu et al., 2006; Qian et al., 2008).",
        "Given a CCN, we simply choose the characters with the highest PP from each cluster as the recognition results.",
        "In Figure 3 we show a piece of a character-based confusion network (CCN) aligned with the corresponding manual transcription characters.",

        "For cases (2) and (3), the reference character will be incorrectly recognized.",
        "The basic idea of the proposed lexicon adaptation with an improved character accuracy (LAICA) approach is to enhance the PPs of those incorrectly recognized characters by adding new words and deleting existing words in the lexicon.",
        "Here we only focus on those characters of case (2) mentioned above.",
        "This is primarily motivated by the minimum classification error (MCE) discriminative training approach proposed by Juang et al.",
        "(1997), where a sigmoid function was used to suppress the impacts of those perfectly and very poorly recognized training samples.",
        "In our approach, the case (1) is the perfect case and case (3) is the very poor one.",
        "Another motivation is that for characters in case (1), since they are already correctly recognized we do not try to enhance their PPs.",

        "By investigating Equation (3), to enhance the PP of a specific character we can adjust the language model (P(H)), and the acoustic model (P(A|H)), or we can simply modify the lexicon (the constraint under summation).",
        "We should add new words to cover the characters of case (2) to enlarge the numerator of Equation (3) and at the same time delete some existing words to suppress the denominator.",
        "In Figure 3, reference characters [Rm Rm+1Rm+2=opq] and the clusters",
        "{Calign(m), Calign(m+2)} show an example of our focus segment.",

        ".",
        ".",
        ", Calign(m+2)}.",
        "This is also motivated by MCE that we only suppress the strongest competitors' probabilities.",
        "Note that we do not delete single-characters in the procedure.",
        "The \"at most one\" constraint here is motivated by previous language model adaptation works (Federico, 1999) which usually try to introduce new evidences in the adaptation corpus but with the least modification of the original model.",
        "Of course the modification of language models led by the addition and deletion of words is hard to quantify and we choose to add and delete as fewer words as possible, which is just a simple heuristic.",
        "On the other hand, adding fewer words means that longer words are added.",
        "It has been shown that longer words are more helpful for ASR (Gao et al., 2004; Saon and Padmanabhan, 2001).",
        "The proposed LAICA approach can be regarded as a discriminative one since it not only considers the reference characters but also those wrongly recognized characters.",
        "This can be beneficial since it reduces potential ambiguities existing in the lexicon.",
        "If we regard the word segmentation process as a hidden variable, then we can apply EM algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977) to train the underlying n-gram language model.",
        "The procedure is described in Table 2.",
        "In the algorithm we can see two expectation phases.",
        "This is natural since at the beginning the bootstrap segmentation can not give reliable statistics for higher order n-gram and we choose to only use the unigram marginal probabilities.",
        "The procedure was well established by Hwang et al.",
        "(2006).",
        "Actually, the EM algorithm proposed here is similar to the n-multigram model training procedure proposed by Deligne and Sagisaka (2000).",
        "The role of multigrams can be regarded as the words here, except that multigrams begin from scratch while here we have an initial lexicon and use maximum-matching algorithm to offer an acceptable initial unigram probability distributions.",
        "If the initial lexicon is not available, the procedure proposed by Deligne and Sagisaka (2000) is preferred."

        "It includes 61521 words in total, of which 5856 are single-characters.",
        "The key principles of the PAT-tree-based approach to extract a sequence of characters as a word are: (1) high enough frequency count; (2) high enough mutual information between component characters; (3) large enough number of context variations on both sides; (4) not dominated by the most frequent context among all context variations.",
        "In general the words extracted have high frequencies and clear boundaries, thus very often they have good semantic meanings.",
        "Since all the above statistics of all possible character sequences in a raw corpus are combinatorially too many, we need an efficient data structure such as the PAT-tree to record and access all such information.",

        "A key factor making the proposed LAICA approach advantageous is that we try to extensively raise the incorrectly recognized character posterior probabilities, by means of adding effective OOV words and deleting ambiguous words.",
