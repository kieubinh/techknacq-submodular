        "However, their benefits generally come with high computational costs, particularly when chart parsing, such as CKY, is integrated with language models of high orders (Wu, 1996).",

        "This lack of significant difference may not be completely surprising.",

        "While context-free decoding algorithms (CKY, Earley, etc.)",

        "The edge between who and hired causes this tree to be non-projective.",
        "Such a head-modifier relationship is difficult to represent with a CFG, since all words directly or indirectly headed by hired (i.e., who, think, they, and hired) do not constitute a contiguous sequence of words.",
        "as we will see later in this section.",
        "The most standardly used algorithm for parsing with dependency grammars is presented in (Eisner, 1996; Eisner and Satta, 1999).",
        "It runs in time O(n), where n is the length of the sentence.",
        "Their algorithm exploits the special properties of dependency trees to reduce the worst-case complexity of bilexical parsing, which otherwise requires O(n) for bilexical constituency-based parsing.",
        "While it seems difficult to improve the asymptotic running time of the Eisner algorithm beyond what is presented in (Eisner and Satta, 1999), McDonald et al.",
        "(2005b) show O(n)-time parsing is possible if trees are not required to be projective.",
        "This relaxation entails that dependencies may cross each other rather than being required to be nested, as shown in Fig. 1.",
        "More formally, a non-projective tree is any tree that does not satisfy the following definition of a projective tree:",
        "Definition.",
        "Let x = x1 ••• xn be an input sentence, and let y be a rooted tree represented as a set in which each element (i, j) e y is an ordered pair of word indices of x that defines a dependency relation between a head xi and a modifier Xj.",
        "By definition, the tree y is said to be projective if each dependency (i, j) satisfies the following property: each word in xi+1 • • • xj-1 (if i < j) or in xj+1 • • • xi-1 (if j < i) is a descendent of head word xi.",
        "This relaxation is key to computational efficiency, since the parser does not need to keep track of whether dependencies assemble into contiguous spans.",
        "It is also linguistically desirable in the case of free word order languages such as Czech, Dutch, and German.",
        "Non-projective dependency structures are sometimes even needed for languages like English, e.g., in the case of the wh-movement shown in Fig. 1.",
        "For languages with relatively rigid word order such as English, there may be some concern that searching the space of non-projective dependency trees, which is considerably larger than the space of projective dependency trees, would yield poor performance.",
        "That is not the case: dependency accuracy for non-projective parsing is 90.2% for English (McDonald et al., 2005b), only 0.7% lower than a projective parser (McDonald et al., 2005a) that uses the same set of features and learning algorithm.",
        "In the case of dependency parsing for Czech, (McDonald et al., 2005b) even outperforms projective parsing, and was one of the top systems in the CoNLL-06 shared task in multilingual dependency parsing.",
        "We now formalize weighted non-projective dependency parsing similarly to (McDonald et al., 2005b) and then describe a modified and more efficient version that can be integrated into a phrase-based decoder.",
        "Given the single-head constraint, parsing an input sentence x = (x0,x1, • • • ,xn) is reduced to labeling each word xj with an index i identifying its head word xi.",
        "We include the dummy root symbol x0 = (root) so that each word can be a modifier.",
        "We score each dependency relation using a standard linear model whose weight vector A is trained using MIRA (Crammer and Singer, 2003) to optimize dependency parsing accuracy (McDonald et al., 2005a).",
        "As is commonly the case in statistical parsing, the score of the full tree is decomposed as the sum of the score of all edges:",
        "When there is no need to ensure projectivity, one can independently select the highest scoring edge (i, j) for each modifier xj, yet we generally want to ensure that the resulting structure is a tree, i.e., that it does not contain any circular dependencies.",
        "This optimization problem is a known instance of the maximum spanning tree (MST) problem.",
        "In our case, the graph is directed – indeed, the equality s(i, j) = s( j, i) is generally not true and would be linguistically aberrant – so the problem constitutes an instance of the less-known MST problem for directed graphs.",
        "This problem is solved with the",
        "Chu-Liu-Edmonds (CLE) algorithm (Chu and Liu, 1965; Edmonds, 1967).",
        "Formally, we represent the graph G = (V, E) with a vertex set V = x = {x0, • • •,xn} and a set of directed edges E = [0,n] x [1,n], in which each edge (i, j), representing the dependency xi – xj, is assigned a score s(i, j).",
        "Finding the spanning tree y C E rooted at x0 that maximizes s(x, y) as defined in Equation 2 has a straightforward solution in O(nlog(n)) time for dense graphs such as G, though Tarjan (1977) shows that the problem can be solved in O(n).",
        "Hence, non-projective dependency parsing is solved in quadratic time.",
        "The main idea behind the CLE algorithm is to first greedily select for each word xj the incoming edge (i, j) with highest score, then to successively repeat the following two steps: (a) identify a loop in the graph, and if there is none, halt; (b) contract the loop into a single vertex, and update scores for edges coming in and out of the loop.",
        "Once all loops have been eliminated, the algorithm maps back the maximum spanning tree of the contracted graph onto the original graph G, and it can be shown that this yields a spanning tree that is optimal with respect to G and s (Georgiadis, 2003).",
        "The greedy approach of selecting the highest scoring edge (i, j) for each modifier xj can easily be applied left-to-right during phrase-based decoding, which proceeds in the same order.",

        "We plan to pursue other research directions using dependency models discussed in this paper.",
        "While we use a dependency language model to exemplify the use of hierarchical structure within phrase based decoders, we could extend this work to incorporate dependency features of both source-and target side.",
        "Since parsing of the source is relatively inexpensive compared to the target side, it would be relatively easy to condition head-modifier dependencies not only on the two target words, but also on their corresponding Chinese words and their relative positions in the Chinese tree.",
        "This would enable the decoder to capture syntactic reordering without requiring trees to be isomorphic or even projective.",
