        "The field of machine translation has seen many advances in recent years, most notably the shift from word-based (Brown et al., 1993) to phrase-based models which use token n-grams as translation units (Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "Although very few researchers use word-based models for translation per se, such models are still widely used in the training of phrase-based models.",
        "These word-based models are used to find the latent word-alignments between bilingual sentence pairs, from which a weighted string transducer can be induced (either finite state (Koehn et al., 2003) or synchronous context free grammar (Chiang, 2007)).",
        "Although wide-spread, the disconnect between the translation model and the alignment model is artificial and clearly undesirable.",
        "Word-based models are incapable of learning translational equivalences between non-compositional phrasal units, while the algorithms used for inducing weighted transducers from word-alignments are based on heuristics with little theoretical justification.",

        "Unfortunately none of these approaches resulted in an unqualified success, due largely to intractable estimation.",
        "Large training sets with hundreds of thousands of sentence pairs are common in machine translation, leading to a parameter space of billions or even trillions of possible bilingual phrase-pairs.",
        "Moreover, the inference procedure for each sentence pair is non-trivial, proving NP-complete for learning phrase based models (DeNero and Klein, 2008) or a high order polynomial (O(|f ||e|)) for a subclass of weighted synchronous context free grammars (Wu, 1997).",
        "Consequently, for such models both the param-eterisation and approximate inference techniques are fundamental to their success.",
        "In this paper we present a novel SCFG translation model using a non-parametric Bayesian formulation.",
        "The model includes priors to impose a bias towards small grammars with few rules, each of which is as simple as possible (e.g., terminal productions consisting of short phrase pairs).",

        "The sampler performs local edit operations to nodes in the synchronous trees, each of which is very fast, leading to a highly efficient inference technique.",
        "This allows us to train the model on large corpora without resort to punitive length limits, unlike previous approaches which were only applied to small data sets with short sentences.",

In the context of SMT, by assigning the source and target languages to the respective sides of a probabilistic SCFG it is possible to describe translation as the process of parsing the source sentence, which induces a parallel tree structure and translation in the target language (Chiang, 2007).",

        "This avoids explicitly representing the full derivation forest required by dynamic programming approaches, and thus we are able to perform inference without resorting to heuristic restrictions on the model.",

        "These results open the way for the development of more sophisticated models employing grammars capable of capturing a wide range of translation phenomena.",
