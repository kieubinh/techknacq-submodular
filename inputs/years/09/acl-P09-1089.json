        "Machine Translation systems frequently encounter terms they are not able to translate due to some missing knowledge.",
        "For instance, a Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) system translating the sentence \"Cisco filed a lawsuit against Apple for patent violation\" may lack words like filed and lawsuit in its phrase table.",
        "The problem is especially severe for languages for which parallel corpora are scarce, or in the common scenario when the SMT system is used to translate texts of a domain different from the one it was trained on.",
        "A previously suggested solution (Callison-Burch et al., 2006) is to learn paraphrases of source terms from multilingual (parallel) corpora, and expand the phrase table with these para-phrases.",
        "Such solutions could potentially yield a paraphrased sentence like \"Cisco sued Apple for patent violation\", although their dependence on bilingual resources limits their utility.",
        "In this paper we propose an approach that consists in directly replacing unknown source terms, using source-language resources and models in order to achieve two goals.",
        "The first goal is coverage increase.",
        "The availability of bilingual corpora, from which paraphrases can be learnt, is in many cases limited.",
        "On the other hand, monolingual resources and methods for extracting paraphrases from monolingual corpora are more readily available.",
        "These include manually constructed resources, such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), and automatic methods for paraphrases acquisition, such as DIRT (Lin and Pantel, 2001).",
        "However, such resources have not been applied yet to the problem of substituting unknown terms in SMT.",
        "We suggest that by using such monolingual resources we could provide paraphrases for a larger number of texts with unknown terms, thus increasing the overall coverage of the SMT system, i.e. the number of texts it properly translates.",
        "Even with larger paraphrase resources, we may encounter texts in which not all unknown terms are successfully handled through paraphrasing, which often results in poor translations (see Section 2.1).",
        "To further increase coverage, we therefore propose to generate and translate texts that convey a somewhat more general meaning than the original source text.",
        "For example, using such approach, the following text could be generated: \"Cisco accused Apple ofpatent violation\".",
        "Although less informative than the original, a translation for such texts may be useful.",
        "Such non-symmetric relationships (as between filed a lawsuit and accused) are difficult to learn from parallel corpora and therefore monolingual resources are more appropriate for this purpose.",
        "The second goal we wish to accomplish by employing source-language resources is to rank the alternative generated texts.",
        "This goal can be achieved by using context-models on the source language prior to translation.",
        "This has two advantages.",
        "First, the ranking allows us to prune some candidates before supplying them to the translation engine, thus improving translation efficiency.",
        "Second, the ranking may be combined with target language information in order to choose the best translation, thus improving translation quality.",
        "We position the problem of generating alternative texts for translation within the Textual Entailment (TE) framework (Giampiccolo et al., 2007).",
        "TE provides a generic way for handling language variability, identifying when the meaning of one text is entailed by the other (i.e. the meaning of the entailed text can be inferred from the meaning of the entailing one).",
        "When the meanings of two texts are equivalent (paraphrase), entailment is mutual.",
        "Typically, a more general version of a certain text is entailed by it.",
        "Hence, through TE we can formalize the generation of both equivalent and more general texts for the source text.",
        "When possible, a paraphrase is used.",
        "Otherwise, an alternative text whose meaning is entailed by the original source is generated and translated.",
        "We assess our approach by applying an SMT system to a text domain that is different from the one used to train the system.",
        "We use WordNet as a source language resource for entailment relationships and several common statistical context-models for selecting the best generated texts to be sent to translation.",
        "We show that the use of source language resources, and in particular the extension to non-symmetric textual entailment relationships, is useful for substantially increasing the amount of texts that are properly translated.",
        "This increase is observed relative to both using paraphrases produced by the same resource (WordNet) and using paraphrases produced from multilingual parallel corpora.",
        "We demonstrate that by using simple context-models on the source, efficiency can be improved, while translation quality is maintained.",
        "We believe that with the use of more sophisticated context-models further quality improvement can be achieved."

      "text": [
        "A very common problem faced by machine translation systems is the need to translate terms (words or multi-word expressions) that are not found in the system's lexicon or phrase table.",
        "The reasons for such unknown terms in SMT systems include scarcity of training material and the application of the system to text domains that differ from the ones used for training.",
        "In SMT, when unknown terms are found in the source text, the systems usually omit or copy them literally into the target.",
        "Though copying the source words can be of some help to the reader if the unknown word has a cognate in the target language, this will not happen in the most general scenario where, for instance, languages use different scripts.",
        "In addition, the presence of a single unknown term often affects the translation of wider portions of text, inducing errors in both lexical selection and ordering.",
        "This phenomenon is demonstrated in the following sentences, where the translation of the English sentence (1) is acceptable only when the unknown word (in bold) is replaced with a translatable paraphrase (3):",
        "1.",
        "\"..., despite bearing the heavy burden of the unemployed 10% or more of the labor force.\"",
        "2.",
        "\"..., maigre la lourde charge de compte le 10% ou plus de chômeurs labor la force .\"",
        "3.",
        "\"..., malgré la lourde charge des chomeurs de 10% ou plus de la force du travail.\"",
        "Several approaches have been proposed to deal with unknown terms in SMT systems, rather than omitting or copying the terms.",
        "For example, (Eck et al., 2008) replace the unknown terms in the source text by their definition in a monolingual dictionary, which can be useful for gisting.",
        "To translate across languages with different alphabets approaches such as (Knight and Graehl, 1997; Habash, 2008) use transliteration techniques to tackle proper nouns and technical terms.",
        "For translation from highly inflected languages, certain approaches rely on some form of lexical approximation or morphological analysis (Koehn and Knight, 2003; Yang and Kirchhoff, 2006; Langlais and Patry, 2007; Arora et al., 2008).",
        "Although these strategies yield gain in coverage and translation quality, they only account for unknown terms that should be transliterated or are variations of known ones.",
        "A recent strategy to broadly deal with the problem of unknown terms is to paraphrase the source text with terms whose translation is known to the system, using paraphrases learnt from multilingual corpora, typically involving at least one \"pivot\" language different from the target language of immediate interest (Callison-Burch et al., 2006; Cohn and Lapata, 2007; Zhao et al., 2008; Callison-Burch, 2008; Guzman and Gar-rido, 2008).",
        "The procedure to extract paraphrases in these approaches is similar to standard phrase extraction in SMT systems, and therefore a large amount of additional parallel corpus is required.",
        "Moreover, as discussed in Section 5, when unknown texts are not from the same domain as the SMT training corpus, it is likely that paraphrases found through such methods will yield misleading translations.",
        "Bond et al.",
        "(2008) use grammars to paraphrase the whole source sentence, covering aspects like word order and minor lexical variations (tenses etc.",
        "), but not content words.",
        "The paraphrases are added to the source side of the corpus and the corresponding target sentences are duplicated.",
        "This, however, may yield distorted probability estimates in the phrase table, since these were not computed from parallel data.",
        "The main use of monolingual paraphrases in MT to date has been for evaluation.",
        "For example, (Kauchak and Barzilay, 2006) paraphrase references to make them closer to the system translation in order to obtain more reliable results when using automatic evaluation metrics like BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002).",
        "Textual Entailment (TE) has recently become a prominent paradigm for modeling semantic inference, capturing the needs of a broad range of text understanding applications (Giampiccolo et al., 2007).",
        "Yet, its application to SMT has been so far limited to MT evaluation (Padó et al., 2009).",
        "TE defines a directional relation between two texts, where the meaning of the entailed text (hypothesis, h) can be inferred from the meaning of the entailing text, t. Under this paradigm, paraphrases are a special case of the entailment relation, when the relation is symmetric (the texts entail each other).",
        "Otherwise, we say that one text directionally entails the other.",
        "A common practice for proving (or generating) h from t is to apply entailment rules to t. An entailment rule, denoted LHS => RHS, specifies an entailment relation between two text fragments (the Left-and Right-Hand Sides), possibly with variables (e.g. build X in Y => X is completed in Y).",
        "A paraphrasing rule is denoted with <<=K When a rule is applied to a text, a new text is inferred, where the matched LHS is replaced with the RHS.",
        "For example, the rule skyscraper => building is applied to \"The world's tallest skyscraper was completed in Taiwan\" to infer \"The world's tallest building was completed in Taiwan\".",
        "In this work, we employ lexical entailment rules, i.e. rules without variables.",
        "Various resources for lexical rules are available, and the prominent one is WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), which has been used in virtually all TE systems (Giampiccolo et al., 2007).",
        "Typically, a rule application is valid only under specific contexts.",
        "For example, mouse => rodent should not be applied to \"Use the mouse to mark your answers\".",
        "Context-models can be exploited to validate the application of a rule to a text.",
        "In such models, an explicit Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is not necessarily required; rather, an implicit sense-match is sought after (Dagan et al., 2006).",
        "Within the scope of our paper, rule application is handled similarly to Lexical Substitution (McCarthy and Navigli, 2007), considering the contextual relationship between the text and the rule.",
        "However, in general, entailment rule application addresses other aspects of context matching as well (Szpektor et al., 2008)."

        "In this paper we propose a new entailment-based approach for addressing the problem of unknown terms in machine translation.",
        "Applying this approach with lexical entailment rules from WordNet, we show that using monolingual resources and textual entailment relationships allows substantially increasing the quality of translations produced by an SMT system.",
        "Our experiments also show that it is possible to perform the process efficiently by relying on source language context-models as a filter prior to translation.",
        "This pipeline maintains translation quality, as assessed by both human annotators and standard automatic measures.",
        "For future work we suggest generating entailed texts with a more extensive set of rules, in particular lexical-syntactic ones.",
        "Combining rules from monolingual and bilingual resources seems appealing as well.",
        "Developing better context-models to be applied on the source is expected to further improve our method's performance.",
        "Specifically, we suggest taking into account the prior likelihood that a rule is correct as part of the model score.",
        "Finally, some researchers have advocated recently the use of shared structures such as parse forests (Mi and Huang, 2008) or word lattices (Dyer et al., 2008) in order to allow a compact representation of alternative inputs to an SMT system.",
        "This is an approach that we intend to explore in future work, as a way to efficiently handle the different source language alternatives generated by entailment rules.",
        "However, since most current MT systems do not accept such type of inputs, we consider the results on pruning by source-side context models as broadly relevant."
