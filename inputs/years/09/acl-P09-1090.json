        "Hindi is a relatively free word-order language, and makes use of a comparatively richer set of case markers and morphological suffixes for correct meaning representation.",
        "From our experience of large-scale English-Hindi MT, we are convinced that fluency and fidelity in the Hindi output get an order of magnitude facelift if accurate case markers and suffixes are produced.",
        "Now, the moot question is: what entity on the English side encodes the information contained in case markers and suffixes on the Hindi side?",
        "Our studies of correspondences in the two languages show that case markers and suffixes in Hindi are predominantly determined by the combination of suffixes and semantic relations on the English side.",
        "We, therefore, augment the aligned corpus of the two languages, with the correspondence of English suffixes and semantic relations with Hindi suffixes and case markers.",
        "Our results on 400 test sentences, translated using an SMT system trained on around 13000 parallel sentences, show that suffix + semantic relation – case marker/suffix is a very useful translation factor, in the sense of making a significant difference to output quality as indicated by subjective evaluation as well as BLEU scores."

      "text": [
        "Two fundamental problems in applying statistical machine translation (SMT) techniques to English-Hindi (and generally to Indian language) MT are: i) the wide syntactic divergence between the language pairs, and ii) the richer morphology and case marking of Hindi compared to English.",
        "The first problem manifests itself in poor word-order in the output translations, while the second one leads to incorrect inflections (word-endings) and case marking.",
        "Being a free word-order language, Hindi suffers badly when morphology and case markers are incorrect.",
        "To solve the former, word-order related, problem, we use a preprocessing technique, which we have discussed in (Ananthakrishnan et al., 2008).",
        "This procedure is similar to what is suggested in (Collins et al., 2005) and (Wang, 2007), and results in the input sentence being reordered to follow Hindi structure.",
        "The focus of this paper, however, is on the thorny problem of generating case markers and morphology.",
        "It is recognized that translating from poor to rich morphology is a challenge (Avramidis and Koehn, 2008) that calls for deeper linguistic analysis to be part of the translation process.",
        "Such analysis is facilitated by factored models (Koehn et al., 2007), which provide a framework for incorporating lemmas, suffixes, POS tags, and any other linguistic factors in a log-linear model for phrase-based SMT.",
        "In this paper, we motivate a factorization well-suited to English-Hindi translation.",
        "The factorization uses semantic relations and suffixes to generate inflections and case markers.",
        "Our experiments include two different kinds of semantic relations, namely, dependency relations provided by the Stanford parser, and the deeper semantic roles (agent, patient, etc.)",
        "provided by the universal networking language (UNL).",
        "Our experiments show that the use of semantic relations and syntactic reordering leads to substantially better quality translation.",
        "The use of even moderately accurate semantic relations has an especially salubrious effect on fluency."

        "NieBen and Ney (2004) propose some restructuring steps for German-English SMT.",

        "SMT.",
        "The fundamental differences between English and Hindi are:",
        "• English follows SVO order, whereas Hindi follows SOV order",
        "• English uses post-modifiers, whereas Hindi uses pre-modifiers",
        "• Hindi allows greater freedom in word-order, identifying constituents through case marking",
        "• Hindi has a relatively richer system of morphology",
        "We resolve the first two syntactic differences by reordering the English sentence to conform to Hindi word-order in a preprocessing step as described in (Ananthakrishnan et al., 2008).",
        "The focus of this paper, however, is on the last two of these differences, and here we dwell a bit on why this focus on case markers and morphology is crucial to the quality of translation.",
        "While in English, the major constituents of a sentence (subject, object, etc.)",
        "can usually be identified by their position in the sentence, Hindi is a relatively free word-order language.",
        "Constituents can be moved around in the sentence without impacting the core meaning.",
        "For example, the following sentence pair conveys the same meaning (John saw Mary), albeit with different emphases.",
        "John ne Mary ko dekhaa John-nom Mary-acc saw Mary ko John ne dekhaa Mary-acc John-nom saw",
        "The identity of John as the subject and Mary as the object in both sentences comes from the case markers % (ne - nominative) and (ko -accusative).",
        "Therefore, even though Hindi is predominantly SOV in its word-order, correct case marking is a crucial part of making translations convey the right meaning.",
        "The following examples illustrate the richer morphology of Hindi compared to English:",
        "Oblique case: The plural-marker in the word \"boys\" in English is translated as e (e - plural direct) or at (on - plural oblique):",

        "Causative constructions: The 3TRTT (aayaa) suffix indicates causativity: The boys made them cry.",
        "ladakon ne unhe rulaayaa",
        "Using a standard SMT system for English-Hindi translation will cause severe data sparsity with respect to case marking and morphology.",
        "For example, the fact that the word boys in oblique case (say, when followed by % (ne)) should take the form Hs«hl (ladakon) will be learnt only if the correspondence between boys and hs*1 % (ladakon ne) exists in the training corpus.",
        "The more general rule that % (ne) should be preceded by the oblique case ending at\" (on) cannot be learnt.",
        "Similarly, the plural form of boys will be produced only if that form exists in the training corpus.",
        "Essentially, all morphological forms of a word and its translations have to exist in the training corpus, and every word has to appear with every possible case marker, which will require an impossible amount of training data.",
        "Therefore, it is imperative to make it possible for the system to learn general rules for morphology and case marking.",
