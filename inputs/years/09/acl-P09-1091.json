        "Sentence realization can be described as the process of converting the semantic and syntactic representation of a sentence or series of sentences into meaningful, grammatically correct and fluent text of a particular language.",
        "Most previous general-purpose realization systems are developed via the application of a set of grammar rules based on particular linguistic theories, e.g. Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG), Head Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG), Combinatory Categorical Grammar (CCG), Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) etc.",
        "The grammar rules are either developed by hand, such as those used in LinGo (Carroll et al., 1999), OpenCCG (White, 2004) and XLE (Crouch et al., 2007), or extracted automatically from annotated corpora, like the HPSG (Nakanishi et al., 2005), LFG (Cahill and van Genabith, 2006; Hogan et al., derived from the Penn-II Treebank.",
        "Over the last decade, there has been a lot of interest in a generate-and-select paradigm for surface realization.",
        "The paradigm is characterized by a separation between realization and selection, in which rule-based methods are used to generate a space of possible paraphrases, and statistical methods are used to select the most likely realization from the space.",
        "Usually, two statistical models are used to rank the output candidates.",
        "One is n-gram model over different units, such as word-level bigram/trigram models (Bangalore and Rambow, 2000; Langkilde, 2000), or factored language models integrated with syntactic tags (White et al.",
        "2007).",
        "The other is log-linear model with different syntactic and semantic features (Velldal and Oepen, 2005; Nakanishi et al., 2005; Cahill et al., 2007).",
        "However, little work has been done on probabilistic models learning direct mapping from input to surface strings, without the effort to construct a grammar.",

        "Wan et al.",
        "(2009) present a dependency-spanning tree algorithm for word ordering, which first builds dependency trees to decide linear precedence between heads and modifiers then uses an n-gram language model to order siblings.",
        "Compared with n-gram model, log-linear model is more powerful in that it is easy to integrate a variety of features, and to tune feature weights to maximize the probability.",
        "A few papers have presented maximum entropy models for word or phrase ordering (Ratnaparkhi, 2000; Filippova and Strube, 2007).",
        "However, those attempts have been limited to specialized applications, such as air travel reservation or ordering constituents of a main clause in German.",
        "This paper presents a general-purpose realizer based on log-linear models for directly linearizing dependency relations given dependency structures.",
        "We reduce the generation space by two techniques: the first is dividing the entire dependency tree into one-depth sub-trees and solving linearization in sub-trees; the second is the determination of relative positions between dependents and heads according to dependency relations.",
        "Then the best linearization for each sub-tree is selected by the log-linear model that incorporates three types of feature functions, including dependency relations, surface words and headwords.",
        "The evaluation shows that our realizer achieves competitive generation accuracy.",

        "This can be explained by the reason that the linearizations of 72% sub-trees can be definitely determined by the RPD method.",
        "All of the four feature functions we have tested achieve considerable improvement in BLEU scores.",

        "On the foundation of relative position determination method, the combination of dependency relation and bigram word model achieves a BLEU score of 0.8615, and the combination of dependency relation and trigram word model achieves a BLEU score of 0.8772.",

        "In the treebank-tree test set, there are 7 predependents classified as postdependents and 3 postdependents classified as predependents by error.",
        "Among the 9,384 dependents, the error rate of the relative position determination method is very small (0.1%).",
        "Then we make a classification on the errors in the experiment of dependency relation model (with relative position determination method).",
        "Table 4 shows the distribution of the errors.",
        "The first type of errors is caused by duplicate dependency relations, i.e. a head with two or more dependents that have the same dependency relations.",
        "In this situation, only using the dependency relation model cannot generate the right linearization.",
        "However, word models, which utilize the word information, can make distinctions between the dependencies.",

        "The word models tend to combine the nodes that have strong correlation together.",
        "For example in Figure 6, node 2 is more likely to precede node 3 because the words \" UP /protect\" and \" 7^7^ /future\" have strong correlation, but the correct order is <node 3, node 2>.",
        "Headword model only consider the words occur at head nodes, which is helpful in the situation like Figure 6.",
        "In our experiments, the headword model gets a relatively low performance by itself, however, the addition of headword model to the combination of the other two feature functions improves the result from 0.8772 to 0.8874.",
        "This indicates that the headword model is complementary to the other feature functions."
