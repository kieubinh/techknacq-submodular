        "We introduce cause identification, a new problem involving classification of incident reports in the aviation domain.",
        "Specifically, given a set of predefined causes, a cause identification system seeks to identify all and only those causes that can explain why the aviation incident described in a given report occurred.",
        "The difficulty of cause identification stems in part from the fact that it is a multi-class, multilabel categorization task, and in part from the skewness of the class distributions and the scarcity of annotated reports.",
        "To improve the performance of a cause identification system for the minority classes, we present a bootstrapping algorithm that automatically augments a training set by learning from a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data.",
        "Experimental results show that our algorithm yields a relative error reduction of 6.3% in F-measure for the minority classes in comparison to a baseline that learns solely from the labeled data."

        "Automatic text classification is one of the most important applications in natural language processing (NLP).",
        "The difficulty of a text classification task depends on various factors, but typically, the task can be difficult if (1) the amount of labeled data available for learning the task is small; (2) it involves multiple classes; (3) it involves multilabel categorization, where more than one label can be assigned to each document; (4) the class distributions are skewed, with some categories significantly outnumbering the others; and (5) the documents belong to the same domain (e.g., movie review classification).",
        "In particular, when the documents to be classified are from the same domain, they tend to be more similar to each other with respect to word usage, thus making the classes less easily separable.",
        "This is one of the reasons why topic-based classification, even with multiple classes as in the 20 Newsgroups dataset , tends to be easier than review classification, where reviews from the same domain are to be classified according to the sentiment expressed .",
        "In this paper, we introduce a new text classification problem involving the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) that can be viewed as a difficult task along each of the five dimensions discussed above.",
        "Established in 1967, ASRS collects voluntarily submitted reports about aviation safety incidents written by flight crews, attendants, controllers, and other related parties.",
        "These incident reports are made publicly available to researchers for automatic analysis, with the ultimate goal of improving the aviation safety situation.",
        "One central task in the automatic analysis of these reports is cause identification, or the identification of why an incident happened.",
        "Aviation safety experts at NASA have identified 14 causes (or shaping factors in NASA terminology) that could explain why an incident occurred.",
        "Hence, cause identification can be naturally recast as a text classification task: given an incident report, determine which of a set of 14 shapers contributed to the occurrence of the incident described in the report.",
        "As mentioned above, cause identification is considered challenging along each of the five aforementioned dimensions.",
        "First, there is a scarcity of incident reports labeled with the shapers.",
        "This can be attributed to the fact that there has been very little work on this task.",
        "While the NASA researchers have applied a heuristic method for labeling a report with shapers (Posse et al., 2005), the method was evaluated on only 20 manually labeled reports, which are not made publicly available.",
        "Second, the fact that this is a 14-class classification problem makes it more challenging than a binary classification problem.",
        "Third, a report can be labeled with more than one category, as several shapers can contribute to the occurrence of an aviation incident.",
        "Fourth, the class distribution is very skewed: based on an analysis of our 1,333 annotated reports, 10 of the 14 categories can be considered minority classes, which account for only 26% of the total number of labels associated with the reports.",
        "Finally, our cause identification task is domain-specific, involving the classification of documents that all belong to the aviation domain.",
        "This paper focuses on improving the accuracy of minority class prediction for cause identification.",
        "Not surprisingly, when trained on a dataset with a skewed class distribution, most supervised machine learning algorithms will exhibit good performance on the majority classes, but relatively poor performance on the minority classes.",
        "Unfortunately, achieving good accuracies on the minority classes is very important in our task ofidentify-ing shapers from aviation safety reports, where 10 out of the 14 shapers are minority classes, as mentioned above.",
        "Minority class prediction has been tackled extensively in the machine learning literature, using methods that typically involve sampling and re-weighting of training instances, with the goal ofcreating a less skewed class distribution (e.g., Pazzani et al.",
        "(1994), Fawcett (1996), Ku-bat and Matwin (1997)).",
        "Such methods, however, are unlikely to perform equally well for our cause identification task given our small labeled set, as the minority class prediction problem is complicated by the scarcity of labeled data.",
        "More specifically, given the scarcity of labeled data, many words that are potentially correlated with a shaper (especially a minority shaper) may not appear in the training set, and the lack of such useful indicators could hamper the acquisition of an accurate classifier via supervised learning techniques.",
        "We propose to address the problem of minority class prediction in the presence of a small training set by means of a bootstrapping approach, where we introduce an iterative algorithm to (1) use a small set of labeled reports and a large set of unla-beled reports to automatically identify words that are most relevant to the minority shaper under consideration, and (2) augment the labeled data by using the resulting words to annotate those unlabeled reports that can be confidently labeled.",
        "We evaluate our approach using cross-validation on 1,333 manually annotated reports.",
        "In comparison to a supervised baseline approach where a classifier is acquired solely based on the training set, our bootstrapping approach yields a relative error reduction of 6.3% in F-measure for the minority classes.",
        "In sum, the contributions of our work are threefold.",
        "First, we introduce a new, challenging text classification problem, cause identification from aviation safety reports, to the NLP community.",
        "Second, we created an annotated dataset for cause identification that is made publicly available for stimulating further research on this problem.",
        "Third, we introduce a bootstrapping algorithm for improving the prediction of minority classes in the presence of a small training set.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we present the 14 shapers.",
        "Section 3 explains how we preprocess and annotate the reports.",
        "Sections 4 and 5 describe the baseline approaches and our bootstrapping algorithm, respectively.",
        "We present results in Section 6, discuss related work in Section 7, and conclude in Section 8."

        "As we can see, the 14 classes are not mutually exclusive.",
        "For instance, a lack of familiarity with equipment often implies a deficit in proficiency in its use, so the two shapers frequently co-occur.",
        "In addition, while some classes cover a specific and well-defined set of issues (e.g., Illusion), some encompass a relatively large range of situations.",
        "For instance, resource deficiency can include problems with equipment, charts, or even aviation personnel.",
        "Furthermore, ten shaping factors can be considered minority classes, as each of them account for less than 10% of the labels.",

        "Each report is a free text narrative that describes not only why an incident happened, but also what happened, where it happened, how the reporter felt about the incident, the reporter's opinions of other people involved in the incident, and any other comments the reporter cared to include.",
        "In other words, a lot of information in the report is irrelevant to (and thus complicates) the task of cause identification.",
        "Unlike newswire articles, at which many topic-based text classification tasks are targeted, the ASRS reports are informally written using various domain-specific abbreviations and acronyms, tend to contain poor grammar, and have capitalization information removed, as illustrated in the following sentence taken from one of the reports.",

        "After creating training instances, we train a binary classifier, ci, for predicting si, employing as features the top 50 unigrams that are selected according to information gain computed over the training data (see Yang and Pedersen (1997)).",
        "The SVM learning algorithm as implemented in the LIBSVM software package (Chang and Lin, 2001) is used for classifier training, owing to its robust performance on many text classification tasks.",
        "In our first baseline, we set all the learning parameters to their default values.",
        "As noted before, we divide the 1,333 annotated reports into five folds of roughly equal size, training the classifiers on four folds and applying them separately to the remaining fold.",
        "Results are reported in terms of precision (P), recall (R), and F-measure (F), which are computed by aggregating over the 14 shapers as follows.",

        "Then,",
        "Our second baseline is similar to the first, except that we tune the classification threshold (CT) to optimize F-measure.",
        "More specifically, recall that LIBSVM trains a classifier that by default employs a CT of 0.5, thus classifying an instance as positive if and only if the probability that it belongs to the positive class is at least 0.5.",
        "However, this may not be the optimal threshold to use as far as performance is concerned, especially for the minority classes, where the class distribution is skewed.",
        "This is the motivation behind tuning the CT of each classifier.",
        "To ensure a fair comparison with the first baseline, we do not employ additional labeled data for parameter tuning; rather, we reserve 25% of the available training data for tuning, and use the remaining 75% for classifier acquisition.",
        "This amounts to using three folds for training and one fold for development in each cross validation experiment.",
        "Using the development data, we tune the 14 CTs jointly to optimize overall F-measure.",

        "This could have an adverse effect on the accuracy of the resulting classifiers, especially those for the minority classes.",
        "The situation is somewhat aggravated by the fact that we are adopting a one-versus-all scheme for generating training instances for a particular shaper, which, together with the small amount of labeled data, implies that only a couple of positive instances may be available for training the classifier for a minority class.",
        "To alleviate the data scarcity problem and improve the accuracy of the classifiers, we propose in this section a bootstrapping algorithm that automatically augments a training set by exploiting a large amount of unlabeled data.",
        "The basic idea behind the algorithm is to iteratively identify words that are high-quality indicators of the positive or negative examples, and then automatically label unlabeled documents that contain a sufficient number of such indicators.",

If this ratio is large, we posit that t is a good indicator of P. Note that incrementing the count in the denominator by one has a smoothing effect: it avoids selecting words that appears infrequently in P and not at all in N.",
        "There is a reason for selecting multiple words (rather than just one word) in each bootstrapping iteration: we want to prevent the algorithm from selecting words that are too specific to one subcategory of a shaping factor.",
        "For example, shaping factor 7 (Physical Environment) is composed largely of incidents influenced by weather phenomena.",
        "In one experiment, we tried selecting only one word per bootstrapping iteration.",
        "For shaper 7, the first word added to PW was \"snow\".",
        "Upon the next iteration, the algorithm added \"plow\" to PW.",
        "While \"plow\" may itself be indicative of shaper 7, we believe its selection was due to the recent addition to P of a large number of narratives containing \"snow\".",
        "Hence, by selecting four words per iteration, we are forcing the algorithm to \"branch out\" among these subcategories.",
        "After adding the selected words to PW, we augment P with all the unlabeled documents containing at least three words from PW.",
        "The reason we impose the \"at least three\" requirement is precision: we want to ensure, with a reasonable level of confidence, that the unlabeled documents chosen to augment P should indeed be labeled with the shaper under consideration, as incorrectly labeled documents would contaminate the labeled data, thus accelerating the deterioration of the quality of the automatically labeled data in subsequent bootstrapping iterations and adversely affecting the accuracy of the classifier trained on it (Pierce and Cardie, 2001).",
        "The above procedure is repeated in each bootstrapping iteration.",
        "As mentioned above, if N is smaller in size than P, we will expand N instead, adding to NW the four words that are the strongest indicators of a narrative being a negative example of the shaper under consideration, and augmenting N with those unlabeled narratives that contain at least three words from NW.",
        "The number of bootstrapping iterations is controlled by the input parameter k. As we will see in the next section, we run the bootstrapping algorithm for up to five iterations only, as the quality of the bootstrapped data deteriorates fairly rapidly.",
        "The exact value of k will be determined automatically using development data, as discussed below.",
        "After bootstrapping, the augmented training data can be used in combination with any of the two baseline approaches to acquire a classifier for identifying a particular shaper.",
        "Whichever baseline is used, we need to reserve one of the five folds to tune the parameter k in our cross validation experiments.",
        "In particular, if the second baseline is used, we will tune CT and k jointly on the development data using the local search algorithm described previously, where we adjust the values of both CT and k for one of the 14 classifiers in each step of the search process to optimize the overall F-measure score."

        "Micro-averaged 5-fold cross validation results of this baseline for all 14 shapers and for just 10 minority classes (due to our focus on improving minority class prediction) are expressed as percentages in terms of precision (P), recall (R), and F-measure (F) in the first row of Table 4.",
        "As we can see, the baseline achieves an F-measure of 45.4 (14 shapers) and 35.4 (10 shapers).",
        "Comparing these two results, the higher F-measure achieved using all 14 shapers can be attributed primarily to improvements in recall.",
        "This should not be surprising: as mentioned above, the number of positive instances of a minority class may be small, thus causing the resulting classifier to be biased towards classifying a document as negative.",
        "Instead of employing a CT value of 0.5, our second baseline, Bct, tunes CT using one of the training folds and simply trains a classifier on the remaining three folds.",
        "For parameter tuning, we tested CTs of 0.0, 0.05, ..., 1.0.",
        "Results of this baseline are shown in row 2 of Table 4.",
        "In comparison to the first baseline, we see that F-measure improves considerably by 7.4% and 4.5% for 14 shapers and 10 shapers respectively , which illus-",
        "Table 4: 5-fold cross validation results.",
        "trates the importance of employing the right CT for the cause identification task.",
        "Next, we evaluate the effectiveness of our bootstrapping algorithm in improving classifier performance.",
        "More specifically, we apply the two baselines separately to the augmented training set produced by our bootstrapping algorithm.",
        "When combining our bootstrapping algorithm with the first baseline, we produce a system that we call E0 5 (due to its being trained on the expanded training set with a CT of 0.5).",

        "When our algorithm is used in combination with the second baseline, we produce another system, Ect, which has both k and the CT as its parameters.",
        "The allowable values of these parameters, which are to be tuned jointly, are the same as those employed by Bct and E0 5.",
        "Results of E0 5 are shown in row 3 of Table 4.",
        "In comparison to B0.5, we see that F-measure increases by 3.2% and 7.0% for 14 shapers and 10 shapers, respectively.",
        "Such increases can be attributed to less imbalanced recall and precision values, as a result of a large gain in recall accompanied by a roughly equal drop in precision.",
        "These results are consistent with our intuition: recall can be improved with a larger training set, but precision can be hampered when learning from noisily labeled data.",
        "Overall, these results suggest that learning from the augmented training set is useful, especially for the minority classes.",
        "Results of Ect are shown in row 4 of Table 4.",
        "In comparison to Bct, we see mixed results: F-measure increases by 3.8% for 10 shapers (which represents a relative error reduction of 6.3%, but drops by 0.1% for 14 shapers.",
        "Overall, these results suggest that when the CT is tunable, training set expansion helps the minority classes but hurts the remaining classes.",
        "A closer look at the results reveals that the 0.1% F-measure drop is due",
        "simply extracted from the 14-shaper experiments.",
        "to a large drop in recall accompanied by a smaller gain in precision.",
        "In other words, for the four non-minority classes, the benefits obtained from using the bootstrapped documents can also be obtained by simply adjusting the CT.",
        "This could be attributed to the fact that a decent classifier can be trained using only the hand-labeled training examples for these four shapers, and as a result, the automatically labeled examples either provide very little new knowledge or are too noisy to be useful.",
        "On the other hand, for the 10 minority classes, the 3.8% gain in F-measure can be attributed to a simultaneous rise in recall and precision.",
        "Note that such gain cannot possibly be obtained by simply adjusting the CT, since adjusting the CT always results in higher recall and lower precision or vice versa.",
        "Overall, the simultaneous rise in recall and precision implies that the bootstrapped documents have provided useful knowledge, particularly in the form of positive examples, for the classifiers.",
        "Even though the bootstrapped documents are noisily labeled, they can still be used to improve the classifiers, as the set of initially labeled positive examples for the minority classes is too small.",
        "Quality of the bootstrapped data.",
        "Since the bootstrapped documents are noisily labeled, a natural question is: How noisy are they?",
        "To get a sense of the accuracy of the bootstrapped documents without further manual labeling, recall that our experimental setup resembles a transductive setting where the test documents are part of the unlabeled data, and consequently, some of them may have been automatically labeled by the bootstrapping algorithm.",
        "In fact, 137 documents in the five test folds were automatically labeled in the 14-shaper Ect experiments, and 69 automatically labeled documents were similarity obtained from the 10-shaper Ect experiments.",
        "For 14 shapers, the accuracies of the positively and negatively labeled documents are 74.6% and 97.1%, respectively, and the corresponding numbers for 10 shapers are 43.2% and 81.3%.",
        "These numbers suggest that negative examples can be acquired with high accuracies, but the same is not true for positive examples.",

        "On the other hand, while none of the negative expanders seem directly meaningful in relation to the shaper for which they were selected, some of them do appear to be related to other phenomena that may be negatively correlated with the shaper.",
