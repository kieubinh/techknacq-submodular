        "Inversion transduction grammar (ITG) constraints (Wu, 1997) provide coherent structural constraints on the relationship between a sentence and its translation.",
        "ITG has been extensively explored in unsupervised statistical word alignment (Zhang and Gildea, 2005; Cherry and Lin, 2007a; Zhang et al., 2008) and machine translation decoding (Cherry and Lin, 2007b; Petrov et al., 2008).",
        "In this work, we investigate large-scale, discriminative ITG word alignment.",
        "Past work on discriminative word alignment has focused on the family of at-most-one-to-one matchings (Melamed, 2000; Taskar et al., 2005; Moore et al., 2006).",
        "An exception to this is the work of Cherry and Lin (2006), who discrim-inatively trained one-to-one ITG models, albeit with limited feature sets.",
        "As they found, ITG approaches offer several advantages over general matchings.",
        "First, the additional structural constraint can result in superior alignments.",
        "We confirm and extend this result, showing that one-to-one ITG models can perform as well as, or better than, general one-to-one matching models, either using heuristic weights or using rich, learned features.",
        "A second advantage of ITG approaches is that they admit a range of training options.",
        "As with general one-to-one matchings, we can optimize margin-based objectives.",
        "However, unlike with general matchings, we can also efficiently compute expectations over the set of ITG derivations, enabling the training of conditional likelihood models.",
        "A major challenge in both cases is that our training alignments are often not one-to-one ITG alignments.",
        "Under such conditions, directly training to maximize margin is unstable, and training to maximize likelihood is ill-defined, since the target alignment derivations don't exist in our hypothesis class.",
        "We show how to adapt both margin and likelihood objectives to learn good ITG aligners.",
        "In the case of likelihood training, two innovations are presented.",
        "The simple, two-rule ITG grammar exponentially over-counts certain alignment structures relative to others.",
        "Because of this, Wu (1997) and Zens and Ney (2003) introduced a normal form ITG which avoids this over-counting.",
        "We extend this normal form to null productions and give the first extensive empirical comparison of simple and normal form ITGs, for posterior decoding under our likelihood models.",
        "Additionally, we show how to deal with training instances where the gold alignments are outside of the hypothesis class by instead optimizing the likelihood of a set of minimum-loss alignments.",
        "Perhaps the greatest advantage of ITG models is that they straightforwardly permit blockstructured alignments (i.e. phrases), which general matchings cannot efficiently do.",
        "The need for block alignments is especially acute in Chinese-English data, where oracle AERs drop from 10.2 without blocks to around 1.2 with them.",
        "Indeed, blocks are the primary reason for gold alignments being outside the space of one-to-one ITG alignments.",
        "We show that placing linear potential functions on many-to-one blocks can substantially improve performance.",
        "Finally, to scale up our system, we give a combination of pruning techniques that allows us to sum ITG alignments two orders of magnitude faster than naive inside-outside parsing.",
        "All in all, our discriminatively trained, block ITG models produce alignments which exhibit the best AER on the NIST 2002 Chinese-English alignment data set.",
        "Furthermore, they result in a 1.1 BLEU-point improvement over GIZA++ alignments in an end-to-end Hiero (Chiang, 2007) machine translation system."

        "The alignment that maximizes a set of potentials factored as in Equation (1) can be found in O(n) time using a bipartite matching algorithm (Kuhn, 1955).",
        "On the other hand, summing over A1-1 is #P-hard (Valiant, 1979).",
        "Initially, we consider heuristic alignment potentials given by Dice coefficients where Cef is the joint count of words (e, f) appearing in aligned sentence pairs, and Ce and Cf are monolingual unigram counts.",
        "We extracted such counts from 1.1 million French-English aligned sentence pairs of Hansards data (see Section 6.1).",
        "For each sentence pair in the Hansards test set, we predicted the alignment from A1-1 which maximized the sum of Dice potentials.",
        "This yielded 30.6 AER.",
        "Wu (1997)'s inversion transduction grammar (ITG) is a synchronous grammar formalism in which derivations of sentence pairs correspond to alignments.",
        "In its original formulation, there is a single non-terminal X spanning a bitext cell with an English and foreign span.",
        "There are three rule types: Terminal unary productions X – (e, f), where e and f are an aligned English and foreign word pair (possibly with one being null); normal binary rules X – X(L)Xwhere the English and foreign spans are constructed from the children as (X(L)X(R),X(L)Xand inverted binary rules X ^ X(L)Xwhere the foreign span inverts the order of the children (X(L)XX(R)X(L)).",
        "In general, we will call a bitext cell a normal cell if it was constructed with a normal rule and inverted if constructed with an inverted rule.",

        "Using the same heuristic Dice potentials on the Hansards test set, the maximal scoring alignment from Aitg yields 28.4 AER – 2.4 better than A1-1 – indicating that ITG can be beneficial as a constraint on heuristic alignments.",

        "While not prevalent in our hand-aligned French Hansards dataset, blocks occur frequently in our hand-aligned Chinese-English NIST data.",
        "Figure 1 contains an example.",
        "Extending A1-1 to include blocks is problematic, because finding a maximal 1-1 matching over phrases is NP-hard (DeNero and Klein, 2008).",
        "With ITG, it is relatively easy to allow contiguous many-to-one alignment blocks without added complexity.",
        "This is accomplished by adding additional unary terminal productions aligning a foreign phrase to a single English terminal or vice versa.",
