        "Data-driven approaches have been quite active in recent machine translation (MT) research.",

        "The quality of the parallel data and the word alignment have significant impacts on the learned translation models and ultimately the quality of translation output.",
        "Due to the high cost of commissioned translation, many parallel sentences are automatically extracted from comparable corpora, which inevitably introduce many \"noises\", i.e., inaccurate or non-literal translations.",
        "Given the huge amount of bilingual training data, word alignments are automatically generated using various algorithms ((Brown et al., 1994), (Vogel et al., 1996) and (Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2005)), which also introduce many word alignment errors.",
        "The example in Figure 1 shows the word alignment of the given Chinese and English sentence pair, where the English words following each Chinese word is its literal translation.",
        "We find untranslated Chinese and English words (marked with underlines).",
        "These spurious words cause significant word alignment errors (as shown with dash lines), which in turn directly affect the quality of phrase translation tables or translation rules that are learned based on word alignment.",
        "In this paper we introduce a confidence measure for word alignment, which is robust to extra or missing words in the bilingual sentence pairs, as well as word alignment errors.",
        "We propose a sentence alignment confidence measure based on the alignment's posterior probability, and extend it to the alignment link confidence measure.",
        "We illustrate the correlation between the alignment confidence measure and the alignment quality on the sentence level, and present several approaches to improve alignment accuracy based on the proposed confidence measure: sentence alignment selection, alignment link combination and alignment link filtering.",
        "Finally we demonstrate the improved alignments also lead to better MT quality.",
        "The paper is organized as follows: In section 2 we introduce the sentence and alignment link confidence measures.",
        "In section 3 we demonstrate two approaches to improve alignment accuracy through alignment combination.",
        "In section 4 we show how to improve a MaxEnt word alignment quality by removing low confidence alignment links, which also leads to improved translation quality as shown in section 5."

        "If a word t occurs N times in the target sentence, for any i e {1,}, thus for any tj = t,",
        "This indicates that the confidence score of any link connecting tj to any source word is at most 1/N.",
        "On the one hand this is expected because multiple occurrences of the same word does increase the confusion for word alignment and reduce the link confidence.",
        "On the other hand, additional information (such as the distance of the word pair, the alignment of neighbor words) could indicate higher likelihood for the alignment link.",
