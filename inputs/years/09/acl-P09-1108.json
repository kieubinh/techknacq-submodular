        "The most efficient known algorithm for k-best parsing (Jimenez and Marzal, 2000; Huang and Chiang, 2005) performs an initial bottom-up dynamic programming pass before extracting the k-best parses.",

        "A* parsing can avoid significant amounts of computation by guiding 1-best search with heuristic estimates of parse completion costs, and has been applied successfully in several domains (Klein and Manning, 2002; Klein and Manning, 2003c; Haghighi et al., 2007).",

        "Finally, our algorithm can be written down in terms of deduction rules, and thus falls into the well-understood view of parsing as weighted deduction (Shieber et al., 1995; Goodman, 1998; Nederhof, 2003).",
        "In addition to presenting the algorithm, we show experiments in which we extract k-best lists for three different kinds of grammars: the lexi-calized grammars of Klein and Manning (2003b), the state-split grammars of Petrov et al.",

Without loss of generality, we assume Chomsky normal form, so each non-terminal rule r in G has the form r = A – BC with weight wr(the negative log-probability of the rule).",

        "The correctness of this k-best algorithm follows from the correctness of A* parsing.",
        "The derivation space of full trees is simply the edge space of a much larger grammar (see Section 2.5).",
        "Note that the DERIV schema's priority includes a heuristic just like 1-best A*.",
        "Because of the context freedom of the grammar, any consistent heuristic for inside edge items usable in 1-best A*is also consistent for inside derivation items (and vice versa).",
        "In particular, the 1-best Viterbi outside score for an edge is a \"perfect\" heuristic for any derivation of that edge.",
        "While correct, NAIVE is massively inefficient.",

        "Even for reasonable heuristics, this number can be very large; see Section 3 for empirical results.",
        "This naive algorithm is, of course, not novel, either in general approach or specific computation.",
        "Early k-best parsers functioned by abandoning dynamic programming and performing beam search on derivations (Ratnaparkhi, 1999; Collins, 2000).",
        "Huang (2005) proposes an extension of Knuth's algorithm (Knuth, 1977) to produce k-best lists by searching in the space of derivations, which is essentially this algorithm.",
        "While Huang (2005) makes no explicit mention of a heuristic, it would be easy to incorporate one into their formulation.",
        "While NAIVE suffers severe performance degradation for loose heuristics, it is in fact very efficient if h(-) is \"perfect,\" i.e. h(e) = a(e) Ve.",
        "In this case, the ordering property of A* guarantees that only inside derivation items d satisfying will be placed in the chart.",
        "The set of derivation items d satisfying this inequality is exactly the set which appear in the k-best derivations of(G, 0, n) (as always, modulo ties).",
        "We could therefore use NAIVE quite efficiently if we could obtain exact Viterbi outside scores.",
        "One option is to compute outside scores with exhaustive dynamic programming over the original grammar.",
        "In a certain sense, described in greater detail below, this precomputation of exact heuristics is equivalent to the k-best extraction algorithm of Huang and Chiang (2005).",
        "However, this exhaustive 1-best work is precisely what we want to use A* to avoid.",
        "Our algorithm solves this problem by integrating three searches into a single agenda-driven process.",
        "First, an A* search in the space of inside edge items with an (imperfect) external heuristic h( ) finds exact inside scores.",
        "Second, exact outside scores are computed from inside and outside items.",
        "Finally, these exact outside scores guide the search over derivations.",
        "It can be useful to imagine these three operations as operating in phases, but they are all interleaved, progressing in order of their various priorities.",
        "In order to calculate outside scores, we introduce outside items O(A, i, j), which represent best derivations of G – s1... Sj A sj+1... sn; see Figure 1(b).",
        "Where the weights of inside items compute Viterbi inside scores, the weights of outside items compute Viterbi outside scores.",
        "Table 3 shows deduction schemata for building outside items.",
        "These schemata are adapted from the schemata used in the general hierarchical A*algorithm of Felzenszwalb and McAllester (2007).",
        "In that work, it is shown that such schemata maintain the property that the weight of an outside item is the true Viterbi outside score when it is removed from the agenda.",
        "They also show that outside items o follow an ordering property, namely that they are processed in increasing order of",
        "This quantity is the score of the best root derivation which includes the edge corresponding to o. Felzenszwalb and McAllester (2007) also show that both inside and outside items can be processed on the same queue and the ordering property holds jointly for both types of items.",
        "If we delay the construction of a derivation item until its corresponding outside item has been popped, then we can gain the benefits of using an exact heuristic h( ) in the naive algorithm.",
        "We realize this delay by modifying the DERIV deduction schema as shown in Table 4 to trigger on and prioritize with the appropriate outside scores.",
        "We now have our final algorithm, which we call KA*.",
        "It is the union of the IN, OUT, and new \"delayed\" DERIV deduction schemata.",
        "In words, our algorithm functions as follows: we initialize the agenda with I(s», i + 1, i) and D(s», i + 1, i) for i = 1... n. We compute inside scores in standard A* fashion using the IN deduction rule, using any heuristic we might provide to 1-best A*.",
        "Once the inside item I(G, 0, n) is found, we automatically begin to compute outside scores via the OUT deduction rules.",
        "Once O(sj,i + is found, we can begin to also search in the space of derivation items, using the perfect heuristics given by the just-computed outside scores.",
        "Note, however, that all computation is done with a single agenda, so the processing of all three types of items is interleaved, with the k-best search possibly terminating without a full inside computation.",
        "As with NAIVE, the algorithm terminates when ak-thgoal derivation is dequeued.",
        "We prove the correctness of this algorithm by a reduction to the hierarchical A* (HA*) algorithm of Felzenszwalb and McAllester (2007).",
        "The input to HA* is a target grammar Gm and a list of grammars G0 ... Gm-1 in which Gt-1 is a relaxed projection of Gt for all t = 1... m. A grammar Gt-1is a projection of Gt if there exists some onto function nt : Et – Et-1 defined for all symbols in Gt.",
        "We use At-1 to represent nt(At).",
        "A projection is relaxed if, for every rule r = At – BtCt with weight wr there is a rule r' = At-1 – Bt-1Ct-1in Gt-1 with weight wr/ < wr.",
        "We assume that our external heuristic function h( ) is constructed by parsing our input sentence with a relaxed projection of our target grammar.",
        "This assumption, though often true anyway, is to allow proof by reduction to Felzenszwalb and",
        "We construct an instance ofHA* as follows: Let G0 be the relaxed projection which computes the heuristic.",
        "Let G1 be the input grammar G, and let G2, the target grammar of our HA* instance, be the grammar of derivations in G formed by expanding each symbol A in G to all possible inside derivations Ta rooted at A.",
        "The rules in G2 have the form Ta – TB TC with weight given by the weight of the rule A – B C .By construction, G1 is a relaxed projection of G2; by assumption G0 is a relaxed projection of G1 .",
        "The deduction rules that describe KA* build the same items as HA* with same weights and priorities, and so the guarantees from HA* carry over to KA*.",
        "We can characterize the amount of work done using the ordering property.",
        "Let gk be the kth-best derivation item for the goal edge g. Our algorithm processes all derivation items d, outside items o, and inside items i satisfying",
        "We have already argued that the set of derivation items satisfying the first inequality is the set of subtrees that appear in the optimal k-best parses, modulo ties.",
        "Similarly, it can be shown that the second inequality is satisfied only for edges that appear in the optimal k-best parses.",
        "The last inequality characterizes the amount of work done in the bottom-up pass.",
        "We compare this to 1-best A*, which pops all inside items i satisfying",
        "Thus, the \"extra\" inside items popped in the bottom-up pass during A;-best parsing as compared to 1-best parsing are those items i satisfying",
        "The question of how many items satisfy these inequalities is empirical; we show in our experiments that it is small for reasonable heuristics.",
        "At worst, the bottom-up phase pops all inside items and reduces to exhaustive dynamic programming.",
        "Additionally, it is worth noting that our algorithm is naturally online in that it can be stopped at any k without advance specification.",
        "The global ordering property guarantees that we will only dequeue derivation fragments of top parses.",
        "However, we will enqueue all combinations of such items, which is wasteful.",
        "By exploiting a local ordering amongst derivations, we can be more conservative about combination and gain the advantages of a lazy successor function (Huang and Chiang, 2005).",
        "To do so, we represent inside derivations not by explicitly specifying entire trees, but rather by using ranked backpointers.",
        "In this representation, inside derivations are represented in two ways, shown in Figure 1(d) and (e).",
        "The first way (d) simply adds a rank u to an edge, giving a tuple (A, i, j, u).",
        "The corresponding item is the ranked derivation item K(A, i, j, u), which represents the uth-best derivation of A over The second representation (e) is a backpointer of the form (A,i,j,l,r,u,v), specifying the derivation formed by combining the uth-best derivation of (B, i, I) and the vth-best derivation of (C, I, j) using rule r = A – > B C. The corresponding items D(A, i, j, I, r, u, v) are the new form of our inside derivation items.",
        "The modified deduction schemata for the NAIVE algorithm over these representations are shown in Table 5.",
        "The BUILD schema produces new inside derivation items from ranked derivation items, while the RANK schema assigns each derivation item a rank; together they function like DERIV.",
        "We can find the fc-best list by searching until K(G, 0, n, k) is removed from the agenda.",
        "The A;-best derivations can then be extracted by following the backpointers for K(G,0,n,l) ... K(G,0,n,k).",
        "The KA* algorithm can be modified in the same way, shown in Table 6.",
        "Heuristic",
        "Figure 2: Number of derivation items enqueued as a function of heuristic.",
        "Heuristics are shown in decreasing order of tightness.",
        "The y-axis is on a log-scale.",
        "The actual laziness is provided by additionally delaying the combination of ranked items.",
        "When an item K(B,i,l,u) is popped off the queue, a naive implementation would loop over items K(C, I, j, v) for all v, C, and j (and similarly for left combinations).",
        "Fortunately, little looping is actually necessary: there is a partial ordering of derivation items, namely, that D(A,i,j,l,r,u,v) will have a lower computed priority than D(A,i,j,l,r,u – l,v) and D(A,i,j,l,r,u,v – 1) (Jimenez and Marzal, 2000).",
        "So, we can wait until one of the latter two is built before \"triggering\" the construction of the former.",
