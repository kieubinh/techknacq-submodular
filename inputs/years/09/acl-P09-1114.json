        "Relation extraction is the task of detecting and characterizing semantic relations between entities from free text.",
        "Recent work on relation extraction has shown that supervised machine learning coupled with intelligent feature engineering or kernel design provides state-of-the-art solutions to the problem (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004; Zhou et al., 2005; Bunescu and Mooney, 2005; Qian et al., 2008).",
        "However, supervised learning heavily relies on a sufficient amount of labeled data for training, which is not always available in practice due to the labor-intensive nature of human annotation.",
        "This problem is especially serious for relation extraction because the types of relations to be extracted are highly dependent on the application domain.",
        "For example, when working in the financial domain we may be interested in the employment relation, but when moving to the terrorism domain we now may be interested in the ethnic and ideology affiliation relation, and thus have to create training data for the new relation type.",
        "However, is the old training data really useless?",
        "Inspired by recent work on transfer learning and domain adaptation, in this paper, we study how we can leverage labeled data of some old relation types to help the extraction of a new relation type in a weakly-supervised setting, where only a few seed instances of the new relation type are available.",
        "While transfer learning was proposed more than a decade ago (Thrun, 1996; Caruana, 1997), its application in natural language processing is still a relatively new territory (Blitzer et al., 2006; Daumé III, 2007; Jiang and Zhai, 2007a; Arnold et al., 2008; Dredze and Crammer, 2008), and its application in relation extraction is still unexplored.",
        "Our idea of performing transfer learning is motivated by the observation that different relation types share certain common syntactic structures, which can possibly be transferred from the old types to the new type.",
        "We therefore propose to use a general multi-task learning framework in which classification models for a number of related tasks are forced to share a common model component and trained together.",
        "By treating classification of different relation types as related tasks, the learning framework can naturally model the common syntactic structures among different relation types in a principled manner.",
        "It also allows us to introduce human guidance in separating the common model component from the type-specific components.",
        "The framework naturally transfers the knowledge learned from the old relation types to the new relation type and helps improve the recall of the relation extractor.",
        "We also exploit additional human knowledge about the entity type constraints on the relation arguments, which can usually be derived from the definition of a relation type.",
        "Imposing these constraints further improves the precision of the final relation extractor.",
        "Empirical evaluation on the ACE 2004 data set shows that our proposed method largely outperforms two baseline methods, improving the average F1 measure from 0.1532 to 0.4132 when only 10 seed instances of the new relation type are used."

        "BL-A performs better than BL in terms of F1 because it gives better recall.",
        "However, BL-A still cannot achieve as high recall as the TL methods.",
        "This is probably because the model learned by BL-A still focuses more on type-specific features for each relation type rather than on the commonly useful general features, and therefore does not help much in classifying the target relation type.",
        "The four TL methods all outperform the two baseline methods.",
        "TL-comb performs better than both TL-auto and TL-guide, which shows that while we can either choose general features automatically by the learning algorithm or manually with human knowledge, it is more effective to combine human knowledge with the multi-task learning framework.",
        "Not surprisingly, TL-NE improves the precision over TL-comb without hurting the recall much.",
        "Ideally, TL-NE should not decrease recall if the type constraints are strictly observed in the data.",
        "We find that it is not always the case with the ACE data, leading to the small decrease of recall from TL-comb to TL-NE.",
        "Let us now take a look at the effect of using different X .",
        "As we can see from Table 4, smaller X gives higher precision while larger X gives higher recall.",
        "These results make sense because the larger X is, the more we penalize large weights of \\xr.",
        "As a result, the model for the target type is forced to conform to the shared model v and prevented from overfitting the few seed target instances.",
        "X is therefore a useful parameter to help us control the tradeoff between precision and recall for the target type.",
        "While varying Xk also gives similar effect for type Ak, we found that setting Xk to smaller values would not help T because in this case the auxiliary relation instances would be used more for training the type-specific component /j,k rather than the common component v.",
        "Another parameter in the multi-task transfer learning framework is the number of general features H, i.e. the number of non-zero entries in the shared weight vector v. To see how the performance may vary as H changes, we plot the performance of TL-comb and TL-auto in terms of the average F1 across the seven target relation types, with H ranging from 100 to 50000.",
        "As we can see in Figure 2, the performance is relatively stable, and always above BL-A.",
        "This suggests that the performance of TL-comb and TL-auto is not very sensitive to the value of H.",
        "In Section 4.3, we showed two sets of hypothesized type-specific features, namely, arg-word features and arg-NE features.",
        "We also experimented with each set separately to see whether both sets are useful.",
        "The comparison is shown in Table 5.",

        "The comparison of the performance is shown in Figure 3.",
        "We see that as S increases, both BL and BL-4 catch up, and BL overtakes BL-„4 when S is sufficiently large because BL uses positive training examples only from the target type.",

        "In this paper, we applied multi-task transfer learning to solve a weakly-supervised relation extraction problem, leveraging both labeled instances of auxiliary relation types and human knowledge including hypotheses on feature generality and entity type constraints.",
        "In the multi-task learning framework that we introduced, different relation types are treated as different but related tasks that are learned together, with the common structures among the relation types modeled by a shared weight vector.",
        "The shared weight vector corresponds to the general features across different relation types.",
        "We proposed to choose the general features either automatically inside the learning algorithm or guided by human knowledge.",
        "We also leveraged additional human knowledge about the target relation type in the form of entity type constraints.",
        "Experiment results on the ACE 2004 data show that the multi-task transfer learning method achieves the best performance when we combine human guidance with automatic general feature selection, followed by imposing the entity type constraints.",
        "The final method substantially outperforms two baseline methods, improving the average F1 measure from 0.1532 to 0.4132 when only 10 seed target instances are used.",
        "Our work is the first to explore transfer learning for relation extraction, and we have achieved very promising results.",
        "Because of the practical importance of transfer learning and adaptation for relation extraction due to lack of training data in new domains, we hope our study and findings will lead to further investigation into this problem.",
        "There are still many issues that remain unsolved.",
        "For example, we have not looked at the degrees of relatedness between different pairs of relation types.",
        "Presumably, when adapting to a specific target relation type, we want to choose the most similar auxiliary relation types to use.",
        "Our current study is based on ACE relation types.",
        "It would also be interesting to study similar problems in other domains, for example, the protein-protein interaction extraction problem in biomedical text mining.",
