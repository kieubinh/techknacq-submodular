        "Active Learning (AL) has recently shaped as a much more efficient alternative for the creation of precious training material.",
        "In the AL paradigm, only examples of high training utility are selected for manual annotation in an iterative manner.",
        "Different approaches to AL have been successfully applied to a wide range of NLP tasks (Engel-son and Dagan, 1996; Ngai and Yarowsky, 2000; Tomanek et al., 2007; Settles and Craven, 2008).",
        "When used for sequence labeling tasks such as POS tagging, chunking, or named entity recognition (NER), the examples selected by AL are sequences of text, typically sentences.",
        "Approaches to AL for sequence labeling are usually unconcerned about the internal structure of the selected sequences.",
        "Although a high overall training utility might be attributed to a sequence as a whole, the subsequences it is composed of tend to exhibit different degrees of training utility.",
        "In the NER scenario, e.g., large portions of the text do not contain any target entity mention at all.",
        "To further exploit this observation for annotation purposes, we here propose an approach to AL where human annotators are required to label only uncertain subsequences within the selected sentences, while the remaining subsequences are labeled automatically based on the model available from the previous AL iteration round.",
        "The hardness of subsequences is characterized by the classifier's confidence in the predicted labels.",
        "Accordingly, our approach is a combination of AL and self-training to which we will refer as semi-supervised Active Learning (SeSAL) for sequence labeling.",
        "While self-training and other bootstrapping approaches often fail to produce good results on NLP tasks due to an inherent tendency of deteriorated data quality, SeSAL circumvents this problem and still yields large savings in terms annotation decisions, i.e., tokens to be manually labeled, compared to a standard, fully supervised AL approach.",
        "After a brief overview of the formal underpinnings of Conditional Random Fields, our base classifier for sequence labeling tasks (Section 2), a fully supervised approach to AL for sequence labeling is introduced and complemented by our semi-supervised approach in Section 3.",

        "Our experiments in the context of the NER scenario render evidence to the hypothesis that the proposed approach to semi-supervised AL (SeSAL) for sequence labeling indeed strongly reduces the amount of tokens to be manually annotated â€“ in terms of numbers, about 60% compared to its fully supervised counterpart (FuSAL), and over 80% compared to a totally passive learning scheme based on random selection.",
        "For SeSAL to work well, a high and, by this, restrictive threshold has been shown to be crucial.",
        "Otherwise, large amounts of tagging errors lead to a poorer overall model performance.",
        "In our experiments, tagging errors in such a scenario were OuTSIDE labelings, while an entity class would have been correct - with the effect that the resulting models showed low recall rates.",
        "The delay rate is important when SeSAL is run with a low threshold as early tagging errors can be avoided which otherwise reinforce themselves.",
        "Finding the right balance between the delay factor and low thresholds requires experimental calibration.",
        "For the most restrictive threshold (t = 0.99) though such a delay is unimportant so that it can be set to d = 0 circumventing this calibration step.",
        "In summary, the self-tagging component of SeSAL gets more influential when the confidence threshold and the delay factor are set to lower values.",
        "At the same time though, under these conditions negative side-effects such as deteriorated data quality and, by this, inferior models emerge.",
        "These problems are major drawbacks of many bootstrapping approaches.",
        "However, our experiments indicate that as long as self-training is cautiously applied (as is done for SeSAL with restrictive parameters), it can definitely outperform an entirely supervised approach.",
        "From an annotation point of view, SeSAL efficiently guides the annotator to regions within the selected sentence which are very useful for the learning task.",
        "In our experiments on the NER scenario, those regions were mentions of entity names or linguistic units which had a surface appearance similar to entity mentions but could not yet be correctly distinguished by the model.",
        "While we evaluated SeSAL here in terms of tokens to be manually labeled, an open issue remains, namely how much of the real annotation effort - measured by the time needed - is saved by this approach.",
        "We here hypothesize that human annotators work much more efficiently when pointed to the regions of immediate interest instead of making them skim in a self-paced way through larger passages of(probably) semantically irrelevant but syntactically complex utterances a tiring and error-prone task.",
        "Future research is needed to empirically investigate into this area and quantify the savings in terms of the time achievable with SeSAL in the NER scenario."
