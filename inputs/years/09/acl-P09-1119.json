        "One of the grand challenges in information retrieval is to bridge the vocabulary gap between a user and her information need on the one hand and the relevant documents on the other (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999).",
        "In the setting of blogs or other types of user generated content, bridging this gap becomes even more challenging.",
        "This has several causes: (i) the spelling errors, unusual, creative or unfocused language usage resulting from the lack of top-down rules and editors in the content creation process, and (ii) the (often) limited length of user generated documents.",
        "Query expansion, i.e., modifying the query by adding and reweighing terms, is an often used technique to bridge the vocabulary gap.",
        "In general, query expansion helps more queries than it hurts (Balog et al., 2008b; Manning et al., 2008).",
        "However, when working with user generated content, expanding a query with terms taken from the very corpus in which one is searching tends to be less effective (Arguello et al., 2008a; Weerkamp and de Rijke, 2008b) – topic drift is a frequent phenomenon here.",
        "To be able to arrive at a richer representation of the user's information need, while avoiding topic drift resulting from query expansion against user generated content, various authors have proposed to expand the query against an external corpus, i.e., a corpus different from the target (user generated) corpus from which documents need to be retrieved.",
        "Our aim in this paper is to define and evaluate generative models for expanding queries using external collections.",
        "We propose a retrieval framework in which dependencies between queries, documents, and expansion documents are explicitly modeled.",
        "We instantiate the framework in multiple ways by making different (in)dependence assumptions.",
        "As one of the instantiations we obtain the mixture of relevance models originally proposed by Diaz and Metzler (2006).",
        "We address the following research questions: (i) Can we effectively apply external expansion in the retrieval of user generated content?",
        "(ii) Does conditioning the external collection on the query help improve retrieval performance?",
        "(iii) Can we obtain a good estimate of this query-dependent collection probability?",
        "(iv) Which of the collection, the query, or the document should the selection of an expansion term be dependent on?",
        "In other words, what are the strongest simplifications in terms of conditional independencies between variables that can be assumed, without hurting performance?",
        "(v) Do our models show similar behavior across topics or do we observe strong per-topic differences between models?",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",

        "We start by shortly introducing the general ideas behind query modeling, and continue with a quick overview of work related to external expansion.",
        "Query modeling, i.e., transformations of simple keyword queries into more detailed representations of the user's information need (e.g., by assigning (different) weights to terms, expanding the query, or using phrases), is often used to bridge the vocabulary gap between the query and the document collection.",
        "Many query expansion techniques have been proposed, and they mostly fall into two categories, i.e., global analysis and local analysis.",
        "The idea of global analysis is to expand the query using global collection statistics based, for instance, on a co-occurrence analysis of the entire collection.",
        "Thesaurus- and dictionary-based expansion as, e.g., in Qiu and Frei (1993), also provide examples of the global approach.",
        "Our focus in this paper is on local approaches to query expansion, that use the top retrieved documents as examples from which to select terms to improve the retrieval performance (Rocchio, 1971).",
        "In the setting of language modeling approaches to query expansion, the local analysis idea has been instantiated by estimating additional query language models (Lafferty and Zhai, 2003; Tao and Zhai, 2006) or relevance models (Lavrenko and Croft, 2001) from a set of feedback documents.",
        "Yan and Hauptmann (2007) explore query expansion in a multimedia setting.",
        "Balog et al.",
        "(2008b) compare methods for sampling expansion terms to support query-dependent and query-independent query expansion; the latter is motivated by the wish to increase \"aspect recall\" and attempts to uncover aspects of the information need not captured by the query.",

        "(2005) also try to uncover multiple aspects of a query, and to that they provide an iterative \"pseudo-query\" generation technique, using cluster-based language models.",
        "The notion of \"aspect recall\" is mentioned in (Buckley, 2004; Har-man and Buckley, 2004) and identified as one of the main reasons of failure of the current information retrieval systems.",
        "Even though we acknowledge the possibilities of our approach in improving aspect recall, by introducing aspects mainly covered by the external collection being used, we are currently unable to test this assumption.",
        "The use of external collections for query expansion has a long history, see, e.g., (Kwok et al., 2001; Sakai, 2002).",
        "Diaz and Metzler (2006) were the first to give a systematic account of query expansion using an external corpus in a language modeling setting, to improve the estimation of relevance models.",
        "As will become clear in §4, Diaz and Metzler's approach is an instantiation of our general model for external expansion.",
        "Typical query expansion techniques, such as pseudo-relevance feedback, using a blog or blog post corpus do not provide significant performance improvements and often dramatically hurt performance.",
        "For this reason, query expansion using external corpora has been a popular technique at the TREC Blog track (Ounis et al., 2007).",
        "For blog post retrieval, several TREC participants have experimented with expansion against external corpora, usually a news corpus, Wikipedia, the web, or a mixture of these (Zhang and Yu, 2007; blog finding task introduced in 2007, TREC participants again used expansion against an external corpus, usually Wikipedia (Elsas et al., 2008a; and Savoy, 2008; Arguello et al., 2008b).",
        "The motivation underlying most of these approaches is to improve the estimation of the query representation, often trying to make up for the unedited nature of the corpus from which posts or blogs need to be retrieved.",
        "Elsas et al.",
        "(2008b) go a step further and develop a query expansion technique using the links in Wikipedia.",
        "Finally, Weerkamp and de Rijke (2008b) study external expansion in the setting of blog retrieval to uncoveradditionalperspectives ofagiventopic.",
        "We are driven by the same motivation, but where they considered rank-based result combinations and simple mixtures of query models, we take a more principled and structured approach, and develop four versions of a generative model for query expansion using external collections."

        "The largest drop (20% AP) is for topic 1043 (a million little pieces, a controversial memoir that was in the news during the time coverd by the blog crawl); because we do not do phrase or entity recognition in the query, but apply stopword removal, it is reduced to million pieces which introduced a lot of topic drift.",
        "Let us examine the \"collection preference\" of topics: 35 had a clear preference for Wikipedia, 32 topics for news, and the remainder (83 topics) required a mixture of both collections.",
        "First, we look at topics that require equal weights for both collections; topic 880 (natalie portman, +21% AP) concerns a celebrity with a large Wikipedia biography, as well as news coverage due to new movie releases during the period covered by the blog crawl.",
        "Topic 923 (challenger, +7% AP) asks for information on the space shuttle that exploded during its launch; the 20th anniversary of this event was commemorated during the period covered by the crawl and therefore it is newsworthy as well as present in Wikipedia (due to its historic impact).",
        "Finally, topic 869 (muhammad cartoon, +20% AP) deals with the controversy surrounding the publication of cartoons featuring Muhammad: besides its obvious news impact, this event is extensively discussed in multiple Wikipedia articles.",
        "As to topics that have a preference for Wikipedia, we see some very general ones (as is to be expected): Topic 942 (lawful access, +30% AP) on the government accessing personal files; Topic 1011 (chipotle restaurant, +13% AP) on information concerning the Chipotle restaurants; Topic 938 (plug awards, +21% AP) talks about an award show.",
        "Although this last topic could be expected to have a clear preference for expansion terms from the news corpus, the awards were not handed out during the period covered by the news collection and, hence, full weight is given to Wikipedia.",
        "At the other end of the scale, topics that show a preference for the news collection are topic 1042 (david irving, +28% AP), who was on trial during the period of the crawl for denying the Holocaust and received a lot of media attention.",
        "Further examples include Topic 906 (davos, +20% AP), which asks for information on the annual world economic forum meeting in Davos in January, something typically related to news, and topic 949 (ford bell, +304% AP), which seeks information on Ford Bell, Senate candidate at the start of 2006.",
        "Next we turn to a comparison between EEM1 and EEM3.",
        "Theoretically, the main difference between these two instantiations of our general model is that EEM3 makes much stronger simplifying indepence assumptions than EEM1.",
        "In Figure 1 we compare the two, not only against the baseline, but, more interestingly, also in terms of the difference in performance brought about by switching from uniform estimation of P(c| Q) to oracle estimation.",
        "Most topics gain in AP when going from the uniform distribution to the oracle setting.",
        "This happens for both models, EEM1 and EEM3, leading to less topics decreasing in AP over the baseline (the right part of the plots) and more topics increasing (the left part).",
        "A second observation is that both gains and losses are higher for EEM3 than for EEM1.",
        "Zooming in on the differences between EEM1 and EEM3, we compare the two in the same way, now using EEM3 as \"baseline\" (Figure 2).",
        "We observe that EEM3 performs better than EEM1 in 87 for (Left): uniform P(c|Q) and (Right): oracle.",
        "cases, while EEM1 performs better for 60 topics.",
        "(oregon death with dignity act, 32% AP), and 1032 (I walk the line, 32% AP) have the highest difference in favor of EEM3; Topics 877 (sonic food industry, 139% AP), 1013 (iceland european union, 25% AP), and 1002 (wikipedia primary source, 23% AP) are helped most by EEM1.",
        "Overall, EEM3 performs significantly better than EEM1 in terms of MAP (for a = .",
        "05), but not in terms of the early precision metrics (P5, P10, and MRR).",
        "One observation to come out of §8.1 and 8.2 is that different topics prefer not only different external expansion corpora but also different external expansion methods.",
        "To examine this phenomemon, we created an articificial run by taking, for every topic, the best performing model (with settings optimized for the topic).",
        "Twelve topics preferred the baseline, 37 EEM1, 20 EEM2, and 81 EEM3.",
        "The articifical run produced the following results:",
        "MAP 0.4280, P5 0.7600, P10 0.7480, and MRR 0.8452; the differences in MAP and P10 between this run and EEM3 are significant for a = .01.",
        "We leave it as future work to (learn to) predict for a given topic, which approach to use, thus refining ongoing work on query difficulty prediction."

        "We explored the use of external corpora for query expansion in a user generated content setting.",
        "We introduced a general external expansion model, which offers various modeling choices, and instantiated it based on different (in)dependence assumptions, leaving us with four instances.",
        "Query expansion using external collection is effective for retrieval in a user generated content setting.",
        "Furthermore, conditioning the collection on the query is beneficial for retrieval performance, but estimating this component remains difficult.",
        "Dropping the dependencies between terms and collection and terms and query leads to better performance.",
        "Finally, the best model is topic-dependent: constructing an artificial run based on the best model per topic achieves significant better results than any of the individual models.",
        "Future work focuses on two themes: (i) topic-dependent model selection and (ii) improved estimates of components.",
        "As to (i), we first want to determine whether a query should be expanded, and next select the appropriate expansion model.",
        "For (ii), we need better estimates of P(Q| c); one aspect that could be included is taking P(c) into account in the query-likelihood estimate of P(Q| c).",
        "One can make this dependent on the task at hand (blog post retrieval vs. blog feed search).",
        "Another possibility is to look at solutions used in distributed IR.",
        "Finally, we can also include the estimation of P(D|c), the importance of a document in the collection."
