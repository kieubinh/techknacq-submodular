        "The language identification problem refers to the task of deciding in which natural language a given text is written.",
        "Although the problem is heavily studied by the Natural Language Processing community, most of the research carried out to date has been concerned with relatively long texts such as articles or web pages which usually contain enough text for the systems built for this task to reach almost perfect accuracy.",
        "Figure 1 shows the performance of 6 different language identification methods on written texts of 10 European languages that use the Roman Alphabet.",
        "It can be seen that the methods reach a very high accuracy when the text has 100 or more characters.",
        "However, search engine queries are very short in length; they have about 2 to 3 words on average,",
        "Figure 1: Performance of six Language Identification methods on varying text size.",
        "Adapted from (Poutsma, 2001).",
        "which requires a reconsideration of the existing methods built for this problem.",
        "Correct identification of the language of the queries is of critical importance to search engines.",
        "Major search engines such as Yahoo!",
        "Search (www.yahoo.com), or Google (www.google.com) crawl billions of web pages in more than 50 languages, and about a quarter of their queries are in languages other than English.",
        "Therefore a correct identification of the language of a query is needed in order to aid the search engine towards more accurate results.",
        "Moreover, it also helps further processing of the queries, such as stemming or spell checking of the query terms.",
        "One of the challenges in this problem is the lack of any standard or publicly available data set.",
        "Furthermore, creating such a data set is expensive as it requires an extensive amount of work by human annotators.",
        "In this paper, we introduce a new method to overcome this bottleneck by automatically generating a data set of queries with language annotations.",
        "We show that the data generated this way is highly reliable and can be used to train a machine learning algorithm.",
        "We also distinguish the problem of identifying the textual language vs. the language intended by the users for the search engine queries.",
        "For search engines, there are cases where a correct identifi-",
        "We consider t problem for sewe propose a generate a da through logs o gine to derive tl rectly from the clicked by the users.",
        "Next, we use this data set to train two decision tree classifiers; one that only uses linguistic features and is aimed for textual language identification, and one that additionally uses a non-linguistic feature, and is geared towards the identification of the language intended by the users of the search engine.",
        "Our results show that our method produces a highly reliable data set very efficiently, and our decision tree classifier outperforms some of the best methods that have been proposed for the task of written language identification on the domain of search engine queries.",
        "cation of the language does not necessarily imply that the user wants to see the results in the same language.",
        "For example, although the textual identification of the language for the query \"homo sapiens\" is Latin, a user entering this query from Spain, would most probably want to see Spanish web pages, rather than web pages in Latin.",
        "We address this issue by adding a non-linguistic feature to our system.",
        "We organize the rest of the paper as follows: First, we provide an overview of the previous research in this area.",
        "Second, we present our method to automatically generate a data set, and evaluate the effectiveness of this technique.",
        "As a result of this evaluation, we obtain a human-annotated data set which we use to evaluate the systems implemented in the following sections.",
        "In Section 4, we implement some of the existing models and compare their performance on our test set.",
        "We then use the results from these models to build a decision tree system.",
        "Next, we consider identifying the language intended by the user for the results of the query, and describe a system geared towards this task.",
        "Finally, we conclude our study and discuss the future directions for the problem."

        "Most of the work carried out to date on the written language identification problem consists of supervised approaches that are trained on a list of words or n-gram models for each reference language.",
        "The word based approaches use a list of short words, common words, or a complete vocabulary which are extracted from a corpus for each language.",
        "The short words approach uses a list of words with at most four or five characters; such as determiners, prepositions, and conjunctions, and is used in (Ingle, 1976; Grefenstette, 1995).",
        "The common words method is a generalization over the short words one which, in addition, includes other frequently occuring words without limiting them to a specific length, and is used in (Souter et al., 1994; Cowie et al., 1999).",
        "For classification, the word-based approaches sort the list of words in descending order of their frequency in the corpus from which they are extracted.",
        "Then the likelihood of each word in a given text can be calculated by using rank-order statistics or by transforming the frequencies into probabilities.",
        "The n-gram based approaches are based on the counts of character or byte n-grams, which are sequences of n characters or bytes, extracted from a corpus for each reference language.",
        "Different classification models that use the n-gram features have been proposed.",
        "(Cavnar and Trenkle, 1994) used an out-of-place rank order statistic to measure the distance of a given text to the n-gram profile of each language.",
        "(Dunning, 1994) proposed a system that uses Markov Chains of byte n-grams with Bayesian Decision Rules to minimize the probability error.",
        "(Grefenstette, 1995) simply used trigram counts that are transformed into probabilities, and found this superior to the short words technique.",
        "(Sibun and Reynar, 1996) used Relative Entropy by first generating n-gram probability distributions for both training and test data, and then measuring the distance between the two probability distributions by using the Kullback-Liebler Distance.",
        "(Poutsma, 2001) developed a system based on Monte Carlo Sampling.",
        "Linguini, a system proposed by (Prager, 1999), combines the word-based and n-gram models using a vector-space based model and examines the effectiveness of the combined model and the individual features on varying text size.",
        "Similarly, (Lena Grothe and Nrnberger, 2008) combines both models using the ad-hoc method of (Cavnar and Trenkle, 1994), and also presents a comparison study.",
        "The work most closely related to ours is presented very recently in (Hammarstrom, 2007), which proposes a model that uses a frequency dictionary together with affix information in order to identify the language of texts as short as one word.",
        "Other systems that use methods aside from the ones discussed above have also been proposed.",
        "(Takci and Sogukpinar, 2004) used letter frequency features in a centroid based classification model.",
        "(Kruengkrai et al., 2005) proposed a feature based on alignment of string kernels using suffix trees, and used it in two different classifiers.",
        "Finally, (Biemann and Teresniak, 2005) presented an unsupervised system that clusters the words based on sentence co-occurence.",
        "Recently, (Hughes et al., 2006) surveyed the previous work in this area and suggested that the problem of language identification for written resources, although well studied, has too many open challenges which requires a more systematic and collaborative study."

        "We start the construction of our data set by retrieving the queries, together with the clicked urls, from the Yahoo!",
        "Search Engine for a three months time period.",
        "For each language desired in our data set, we retrieve the queries from the corresponding",
        "Yahoo!",
        "web site in which the default language is the same as the one sought.",
        "Then we preprocess the queries by getting rid of the ones that have any numbers or special characters in them, removing extra spaces between query terms, and lowercasing all the letters of the queries.",
        "Next, we aggregate the queries that are exactly the same, by calculating the frequencies of the urls clicked for each query.",
        "As we pointed out in Section 1, and illustrated in Figure 1, the language identification methods give almost perfect accuracy when the text has 100 or more characters.",
        "Furthermore, it is suggested in (Levering and Cutler, 2006) that the average textual content in a web page is 474 words.",
        "Thus we assume that it is a fairly trivial task to identify the language for an average web page using one ofthe existing methods.",
        "In our case, this task gets already accomplished by the crawler for all the web pages crawled by the search engine.",
        "Thus we can summarize our information in two separate tables; T1 and T2.",
        "For Table T1, we have a set of queries Q, and each q e Q maps to a set of url-frequency pairs.",
        "Each mapping is of the form (q, u, fu), where u is a url clicked for q, and fu is the frequency of u.",
        "Table T2, on the other hand, contains the urls of all the web pages known to the search engine and has only two columns; (u, l), where u is a unique url, and l is the language identified for u.",
        "Since we do not consider multilingual web pages, every url in T2 is unique and has only one language associated with it.",
        "Next, we combine the tables T1 and T2 using an inner join operation on the url columns.",
        "After the join, we group the results by the language and query columns, during which we also count the number of distinct urls per query, and sum their frequencies.",
        "We illustrate this operation with a SQL query in Algorithm 1.",
        "As a result of these operations, we have, for each query q e Q, a set of triplets (l,fi, cU;l) where l is a language, fl is the count of clicks for l (which we obtained through the urls in language l), and cul is the count of unique urls in language l.",
        "The resulting table T3 associates queries with languages, but also contains a lot of noise.",
        "First,",
        "CREATE VIEW T3 AS SELECT",
        "Algorithm 1: Join Tables T1 and T2, group by query and language, aggregate distinct url and frequency counts.",
        "we have queries that map to more than one language, which suggests that the users clicked on the urls in different languages for the same query.",
        "To quantify the strength of each of these mappings, we calculate a weight wq>l for each mapping of a query q to a language l as:",
        "where Fq, the total frequency of a query q, is defined as:",
        "where Lq is the set of languages for which q has a mapping.",
        "Having computed a weight wq l for each mapping, we introduce our first threshold parameter, W. We eliminate all the queries in our data set, which have weights, wq>l, below the threshold",
        "W.",
        "Second, even though some of the queries map to only one language, this mapping cannot be trusted due to the high frequency of the queries together with too few distinct urls.",
        "This case suggests that the query is most likely navigational.",
        "The intent of navigational queries, such as \"ACL 2009\", is to find a particular web site.",
        "Therefore they usually consist of proper names, or acronyms that would not be of much use to our language identification problem.",
        "Hence we would like to get rid of the navigational queries in our data set by using some of the features proposed for the task of automatic taxonomy of search engine queries.",
        "For a more detailed discussion of this task, we refer the reader to (Broder, 2002; Rose and Levinson, 2004; Lee et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2006; Jansen et al., 2008).",
        "Two of the features used in (Liu et al., 2006) in identification of the navigational queries from click-through data, are the number of Clicks Satisfied (nCS) and number of Results Satisfied (nRS).",
        "In our problem, we substitute nCS with Fq, the total click frequency of the query q, and nRS with Uq, the number of distinct urls clicked for q.",
        "Thus we eliminate the queries that have a total click frequency above a given frequency threshold F, and, that have less than a given distinct number of urls, U.",
        "Thus, we have three parameters that help us in eliminating the noise from the inital data; W, F, and U.",
        "We show the usage of these parameters in SQL queries, in Algorithm 2.",
        "Parameters W, F, and U Output: Table D:[q, l] CREATE VIEW T4 AS INNER JOIN T2 ON T1.u = T2.u GROUP BY q; CREATE VIEW D AS",
        "Algorithm 2: Construction of the final data set D, by eliminating queries from T3 based on the parameters W, F, and U.",
        "The parameters F, U, and W are actually dependent on the size of the data set under consideration, and the study in (Silverstein et al., 1999) suggests that we can get enough click-through data for our analysis by retrieving a large sample of queries.",
        "Since we retrieve the queries that are submitted within a three months period, for each language, we have millions of unique queries in our data set.",
        "Investigating a held-out development set of queries retrieved from the United States web site (www.yahoo.com), we empirically decided the following values for the parameters, W = 1, F = 50, and U = 5.",
        "In other words, we only accepted the queries for which the contents of the urls agree on the same language, that are submitted less than 50 times, and at least have 5 unique urls clicked.",
        "The filtering process leaves us with 5-10% of the queries due to the conservative choice of the parameters.",
        "From the resulting set, we randomly picked 500 queries and asked a native speaker to annotate them.",
        "For each query, the annotator was to classify the query into one of three categories:",
        "• Category-1: If the query does not contain any foreign terms.",
        "• Category-2: If there exists some foreign terms but the query would still be expected to bring web pages in the same language.",
        "• Category-3: If the query belongs to other languages, or all the terms are foreign to the annotator.",
        "90.6% of the queries in our data set were annotated as Category-1, and 94.2% as Category-1 and Category-2 combined.",
        "Having successful results for the United States data set, we applied the same parameters to the data sets retrieved for other languages as well, and had the native speakers of each language annotate the queries in the same way.",
        "We list these results in Table 1.",
        "The results for English have the highest accuracy for Category-1, mostly due to the fact that we tuned our parameters using the United States data.",
        "The scores for German on the other hand, are the lowest.",
        "We attribute this fact to the highly multi-linguality of the Yahoo!",
        "Germany website, which receives a high number of non-German queries.",
        "In order to see how much of this multi-linguality our parameter selection successfully eliminate, we randomly picked 500 queries from the aggregated but unfiltered queries of the Yahoo!",
        "Germany website, and had them annotated as before.",
        "As suspected, the second annotation results showed that, only 47.6% of the queries were annotated as Category-1 and 60.2% are annotated as Category-1 and Category-2 combined.",
        "Our method was indeed successful and achieved 29.2% improvement over Category-1, and 27% improvement over Category-1 and Category-2 queries combined.",
        "Another interesting fact to note is the absolute differences between Category-1 and Category-1+2 scores.",
        "While this number is very low, 3.8%, for English, it is much higher for the other languages.",
        "Through an investigation of Category-2 non-English queries, we find out that this is mostly due to the usage of some common internet or computer terms such as \"download\", \"software\", \"flash player\", among other native language query terms.",

        "Finally, we extend this framework by adding a non-linguistic feature in order to identify the language intended by the search engine user.",

        "This is due to the characteristics of those languages, which allow the construction of composite words from multiple words, or have a richer morphology.",
        "Thus, the concepts can be expressed in less number of words or characters.",

        "The statistical approach is more robust to noise, such as misspellings, than the others, however it may fail to identify short queries or single words because of the lack of enough evidence, and it may confuse two languages that are very similar.",
        "In such cases, the knowledge-based model could be more useful, as it can find those query terms in the vocabulary.",
        "On the other hand, the knowledge-based model would have a sparse vocabulary for languages that can have heavily inflected words such as Turkish, and Finnish.",
        "In such cases, the morphological feature could provide a strong clue for identification from the affix information of the terms.",
        "Noting the fact that each model can complement the other(s) in certain cases, we combined them by using a decision tree (DT) classifier.",
        "We trained the classifier using the automatically annotated data set, which we created in Section 3.",

        "Table 4: Evaluation of the models built from the individual features, and the Rank-Order method on the test set.",
        "pruned the DT during the training phase to avoid overfitting.",
        "This way, we built a robust machine learning framework at a very low cost and without any human labour.",
        "As the features of our DT classifier, we use the results of the models that are implemented in Section 4.1, together with the confidence scores calculated for each instance.",
        "To calculate a confidence score for the models, we note that since each model makes its selection based on the language that gives the highest probability, a confidence score should indicate the relative highness of that probability compared to the probabilities of other languages.",
        "To calculate this relative highness, we use the Kurtosis measure, which indicates how peaked or flat the probabilities in a distribution are compared to a normal distribution.",
        "To calculate the Kurtosis value, , we use the equation below.",
        "where L is the set of languages, N is the number of languages in the set, pl is the probability for language l e L, and h and a are respectively the mean and the the standard deviation values of P = {pi|1 e L}.",
        "We calculate a measure for the result of each model, and then discretize it into one of three categories:",

        "The classifier that uses 10,000 instances gets outperformed by the statistical model (by 4.9%) only in the identification of English queries.",
        "In order to evaluate the significance of our improvement, we performed a paired t-test, with a null hypothesis and a = 0.01 on the outputs of the statistical model, and the DT classifier that uses 10,000 training instances.",

        "This is an expected result because of the high similarity between the two languages.",
        "As a final step in our study, we build another DT classifier by introducing a non-linguistic feature to our system, which is the language information of the country from which the user entered the query.",
        "Our intuition behind introducing this extra feature is to help the search engine in guessing the language in which the user wants to see the resulting web pages.",
        "Since the real purpose of a search engine is to bring the expected results to its users, we believe that a correct identification of the language that the user intended for the results when typing the query is an important first part of this process.",

        "In this paper, we considered the language identification problem for search engine queries.",
        "First, we presented a completely automated method to generate a reliable data set with language annotations that can be used to train a decision tree classifier.",
        "Second, we implemented three features used in the existing language identification methods, and compared their performance.",
        "Next, we built a decision tree classifier that improves the results on average by combining the outputs of the three models together with their confidence scores.",
        "Finally, we considered the practical application of this problem for search engines, and built a second classifier that takes into account the geographical information of the users.",
        "Human annotations on 5000 automatically annotated queries showed that our data generation method is highly accurate, achieving 84.3% accuracy on average for Category-1 queries, and 93.7% accuracy for Category-1 and Category-2 queries combined.",
        "Furthermore, the process is fast as we can get a data set of size approximately 50,000 queries in a few hours by using only 15 computers in a cluster.",
        "The decision tree classifier that we built for the textual language identification in Section 4.2 outperforms all three models that we implemented in Section 4.1, for all the languages except English, for which the statistical model is better by 4.9%, and Swedish, for which we get a tie.",
        "Introducing the geographical information feature to our decision tree framework boosts the accuracy greatly even in the case of a noisier test set.",
        "This suggests that the search engines can do a better job in presenting the results to their users by taking the non-linguistic features into account in identifying the intended language of the queries.",
        "In future, we would like to improve the accuracy of our data generation system by considering additional features proposed in the studies of automated query taxonomy, and doing a more careful examination in the assignment of the parameter values.",
        "We are also planning to extend the number of languages in our data set.",
        "Furthermore, we would like to improve the accuracy of Classifier-2 with additional non-linguistic features.",
        "Finally, we will consider other alternatives to the decision tree framework when combining the results of the models with their confidence scores."
