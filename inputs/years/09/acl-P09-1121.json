        "This variance in problem difficulty across languages is not unique to web search; it appears in a wide range of natural language processing problems.",
        "Much recent work on bilingual data has focused on exploiting these variations in difficulty to improve a variety of monolingual tasks, including parsing (Hwa et al., 2005; Smith and Smith, 2004; Burkett and Klein, 2008; Snyder and Barzi-lay, 2008), named entity recognition (Chang et al., 2009), and topic clustering (Wu and Oard, 2008).",
        "In this work, we exploit a similar intuition to improve monolingual web search.",

        "As we will see, machine translation can provide important predictive information in our setting, but we do not wish to display machine-translated output to the user.",

        "The thrust of our technique is using search ranking of one language and cross-lingual information to help ranking of another language.",
        "Our pairwise ranking scheme based on bilingual document pairs can easily integrate all kinds of similarities into the existing framework and significantly improves both English and Chinese ranking performance.",

        "Bold means a positive example for our hypothesis.",

        "Our model can be generally applied to other search ranking problems, such as ranking using monolingual similarities or ranking for cross-lingual/multilingual web search.",
        "Another interesting direction is to study the recovery of the optimal document ordering from pairwise ordering using well-founded formalism such as rank aggregation approaches (Dwork et a., 2001; Liu et al., 2007).",
        "Furthermore, we may involve more sophisticated monolingual features that do not transfer cross-lingually but are asymmetric for either side, such as clustering, document classification features built from domain taxonomies like DMOZ."
