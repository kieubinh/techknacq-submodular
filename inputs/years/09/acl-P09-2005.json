        "Usually, the response patterns from data-driven simulated user tend to be limited to the training data.",
        "Therefore, it is not easy to simulate unseen user intention patterns, which is quite important to evaluate or learn optimal dialog policies.",
        "Another problem is poor user type controllability in a data-driven method.",
        "Sometimes, developers need to switch testers between various type of users such as cooperative, uncooperative or novice user and so on to expose their dialog system to various users.",
        "For this, we introduce a novel data-driven user intention simulation method which is powered by human dialog knowledge in Markov logic formulation (Richardson and Domingos, 2006) to add diversity and controllability to data-driven intention simulation."
