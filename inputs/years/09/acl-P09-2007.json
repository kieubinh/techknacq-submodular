        "Two subjects, who are native speakers of Chinese and are graduate students in Computer Science, examined Elist and Jlist and categorized the causes of errors.",
        "They compared the incorrect characters with the correct characters to determine whether the errors were pronunciation-related or semantic-related.",
        "Referring to an error as being \"semantic-related\" is ambiguous.",
        "Two characters might not contain the same semantic part, but are still semantically related.",
        "In this study, we have not considered this factor.",
        "For this reason we refer to the errors that are related to the sharing of semantic parts in characters as composition-related.",
        "It is interesting to learn that native speakers had a high consensus about the causes for the observed errors, but they did not always agree.",
        "Hence, we studied the errors that the two subjects had agreed categorizations.",
        "Among the 1490 and 1718 words in Elist and Jlist, respectively, the two human subjects had consensus over causes of 1441 and 1583 errors.",
        "The statistics changed when we disregarded errors that involved characters not included in Clist.",
        "An error would be ignored if either the correct or the incorrect character did not belong to the Clist.",
        "It is possible for students to write such rarely used characters in an incorrect word just by coincidence.",
        "After ignoring the rare characters, there were 1333 and 1645 words in Elist and Jlist, respectively.",

        "There were, respectively, 505 composition-related and 1314 pronunciation-related errors in Jlist, so we see 30.70% (=505/1645) and 79.88% (=1314/1645) in the table.",
        "Notice that C&P represents the intersection of C and P, so we have to deduct C&P from the sum of C, P, NE, and D to find the total probability, namely 1.",
        "It is worthwhile to discuss the implication of the statistics in Table 1.",
        "For the Jlist, similarity between pronunciations accounted for nearly 80% of the errors, and the ratio for the errors that are related to compositions and pronunciations is 1:2.6.",
        "In contrast, for the Elist, the corresponding ratio is almost 1:1.",
        "The Jlist and Elist differed significantly in the ratios of the error types.",
        "It was assumed that the dominance of pronunciation-related errors in electronic documents was a result of the popularity of entering Chinese with pronunciation-based methods.",
        "The ratio for the Jlist challenges this popular belief, and indicates that even though the errors occurred during a writing process, rather than typing on computers, students still produced more pronunciation-related errors than composition-related errors.",
        "Distribution over error types is not as related to input method as one may have believed.",
        "Nevertheless, the observation might still be a result of students being so used to entering Chinese text with pronunciation-based method that the organization of their mental lexicons is also pronunciation related.",
        "The ratio for the Elist suggests that editors of the MOE book may have chosen the examples with a special viewpoint in their minds - balancing the errors due to pronunciation and composition."

        "The average of the eight numbers in the 'C' rows is only 71.54% and the best sample is 76.59%, suggesting that we did not find the correct words frequently.",
        "We would made incorrect judgments 24.75% of the time.",
        "The statistics also show that it is almost equally difficult to find correct words for errors that are composition and pronunciation related.",

        "There are simple test items for young children, and there are very challenging test items for the competitions among adults.",
        "Finding an attractive incorrect character to replace a correct character to form a test item is a key step in authoring test items.",
        "We have been trying to build a software environment for assisting the authoring of test items for incorrect character correction (Liu and Lin, 2008, Liu et al., 2009).",
        "It should be easy to find a lexicon that contains pronunciation information about Chinese characters.",
        "In contrast, it might not be easy to find visually similar Chinese characters with computational methods.",
        "We expanded the original Cangjie codes (OCC), and employed the expanded Cangjie codes (ECC) to find visually similar characters (Liu and Lin, 2008).",
        "With a lexicon, we can find characters that can be pronounced in a particular way.",
        "However, this is not enough for our goal.",
        "We observed that there were different symptoms when people used incorrect characters that are related to their pronunciations.",
        "They may use characters that could be pronounced exactly the same as the correct characters.",
        "They may also use characters that have the same pronunciation and different tones with the correct character.",
        "Although relatively infrequently, people may use characters whose pronunciations are similar to but different from the pronunciation of the correct character.",
        "As Liu and Lin (2008) reported, replacing OCC with ECC to find visually similar characters could increase the chances to find similar characters.",
        "Yet, it was not clear as to which components of a character should use ECC.",
        "We analyzed the OCCs for all the words in Clist to determine the list of basic components.",
        "We treated a Cangjie basic symbol as if it was a word, and computed the number of occurrences of n-grams based on the OCCs of the words in Clist.",
        "Since the OCC for a character contains at most five symbols, the longest n-grams are 5-grams.",
        "Because the reason to use ECC was to find common components in characters, we disregarded n-grams that repeated no more than three times.",
        "In addition, the n-grams that appeared more than three times might not represent an actual component in Chinese characters.",
        "Hence, we also removed such n-grams from the list of our basic components.",
        "This process naturally made our list include radicals that are used to categorize Chinese characters in typical printed dictionaries.",
        "The current list contains 794 components, and it is possible to revise the list of basic components in our work whenever necessary.",
        "After selecting the list of basic components with the above procedure, we encoded the words in Elist with our list of basic components.",
        "We adopted the 12 ways that Liu and Lin (2008) employed to decompose Chinese characters.",

        "With a dictionary that provides the pronunciation of Chinese characters and the improved ECC encodings for words in the Elist, we can create lists of candidate characters for replacing a specific correct character in a given word to create a test item for incorrect character correction.",
        "There are multiple strategies to create the candidate lists.",
        "We may propose the candidate characters because their pronunciations have the same sound and the same tone with those of the correct character (denoted SSST).",
        "Characters that have same sounds and different tones (SSDT), characters that have similar sounds and same tones (MSST), and characters that have similar sounds and different tones (MSDT) can be considered as candidates as well.",
        "It is easy to judge whether two Chinese characters have the same tone.",
        "In contrast, it is not trivial to define \"similar\" sound.",
        "We adopted the list of similar sounds that was provided by a psycholinguistic researcher (Dr. Chia-Ying Lee) at the Sinica Academia.",
        "In addition, we may propose characters that look similar to the correct character.",
        "Two characters may look similar for two reasons.",
        "They may contain the same components, or they contain the same radical and have the same total number of strokes (RS).",
        "When two characters contain the same component, the shared component might or might not locate at the same position within the bounding boxes of characters.",
        "In an authoring tool, we could recommend a limited number of candidate characters for replacing the correct character.",
        "We tried two strategies to compare and choose the visually similar characters.",
        "The first strategy (denoted SC7) gave a higher score to the shared component that located at the same location in the two characters being compared.",
        "The second stratTable 3.",
        "Incorrect characters were contained and ranked high in the recommended lists egy (SC2) gave the same score to any shared component even if the component did not reside at the same location in the characters.",
        "When there were more than 20 characters that receive nonzero scores, we chose to select at most 20 characters that had leading scores as the list of recommended characters.",
        "We examined the usefulness of these seven categories of candidates with errors in Elist and Jlist.",
        "The first set of evaluation (the inclusion tests) checked only whether the lists of recommended characters contained the incorrect character in our records.",
        "The second set of evaluation (the ranking tests) was designed for practical application in computer assisted item generation.",
        "Only for those words whose actual incorrect characters were included in the recommended list, we replaced the correct characters in the words with the candidate incorrect characters, submitted the incorrect words to Google, and ordered the candidate characters based on their NOPs.",
        "We then recorded the ranks of the incorrect characters among all recommended characters.",
        "Since the same character may appear simultaneously in SC1, SC2, and RS, we computed the union of these three sets, and checked whether the incorrect characters were in the union.",
        "The inclusion rate is listed under Comp.",
        "Similarly, we computed the union for SSST, SSDT, MSST, and MSDT, checked whether the incorrect characters were in the union, and recorded the inclusion rate under Pron.",

        "The data show the percentage of the incorrect characters being included in the lists that were recommended by the seven strategies.",
        "Notice that the percentages were calculated with different denominators.",
        "The number of composition-related errors was used for SC1, SC2, RS, and Comp (e.g. 505 that we mentioned in Section 3 for the Jlist); the number of pronunciation-related errors for SSST, SSDT, MSST, MSDT, and Pron (e.g., 1314 mentioned in Section 3 for the Jlist); the number of either of these two errors for Both (e.g., 1475 for Jlist).",
        "The results recorded in Table 3 show that we were able to find the incorrect character quite effectively, achieving better than 93% for both Elist and Jlist.",
        "The statistics also show that it is easier to find incorrect characters that were used for pronunciation-related problems.",
        "Most of the pronunciation-related problems were misuses of characters that had exactly the same pronunciations with the correct characters.",
        "Unexpected confusions, e.g., those related to pronunciations in Chinese dialects, were the main for the failure to capture the pronunciation-related errors.",
        "SSDT is a crucial complement to SSST.",
        "There is still room to improve our methods to find confusing characters based on their compositions.",
        "We inspected the list generated by SC1 and SC2, and found that, although SC2 outperformed SC1 on the inclusion rate, SC1 and SC2 actually generated complementary lists and should be used together.",
