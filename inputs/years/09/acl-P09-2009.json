        "A large percentage of words also show ambiguity regarding lexical category.",
        "The challenges of our work on POS tagging for Assamese, an Indo-European language, are compounded by the fact that very little prior computational linguistic exists for the language, though it is a national language of India and spoken by over 30 million people.",

        "Although POS tagged annotated corpus for some of the Indian languages such as Hindi, Bengali, and Telegu (SPSAL, 2007) have become available lately, a POS tagged corpus for Assamese was unavailable till we started creating one for the work presented in this paper.",
        "Another problem was that a clearly defined POS tagset for Assamese was unavailable to us.",
        "As a part of the work reported in this paper, we have developed a tagset consisting of 172 tags, using this tagset we have manually tagged a corpus of about ten thousand Assamese words.",

        "In Assamese, secondary forms of words are formed through three processes: affixation, derivation and compounding.",
        "Affixes play a very important role in word formation.",
        "Affixes are used in the formation of relational nouns and pronouns, and in the inflection of verbs with respect to number, person, tense, aspect and mood.",
        "For example, Table 1 shows how a relational noun ot5w {deutA: father) is inflected depending on number and person (Goswami, 2003).",

        "The following paragraphs describe just a few of the many characteristics of Assamese text that make the tagging task complex.",
        "• Depending on the context, even a common word may have different",
        "POS tags.",
        "For example: If ;fRtcf (kArane), TO (dare), Thin03 (nimitte), (hetu), etc., are placed after pronominal adjective, they are considered conjunction and if placed after noun or personal pronoun they are considered particle.",
        "For example,",

        "w^t (RAm), and hence kArne is considered",
        "particle.",

        "For example,",
        "Prtl t'lf%;f l TF: si he goisil.",
        "ET : Only he went.",
        "Actually (he : only) is a particle, but it is merged with the personal pronoun Pt (si).",
        "• An affix denoting number, gender or person, can be added to an adjective or other category word to create a noun word.",
        "For example,",
        "Is ^rrfw i TF : dhuniyAjoni hoi aAhisA.",
        "ET : You are looking beautiful.",
        "Here ^%tt (dhuniyA : beautiful) is an adjective, but after adding feminine suffix wft the whole constituent becomes a noun word.",

        "Also, often there are differences of opinion among linguists on the tags that may be associated with certain words in texts.",
        "We developed a tagset after in-depth consultation with linguists and manually tagged text segments of nearly 10,000 words according to their guidance.",
        "To make the tagging process easier we have subcategorised each category of noun and personal pronoun based on six case endings (viz, nominative, accussative, instumental, dative, genitive and locative) and two numbers.",

        "First, in the training phase, we have manually tagged the Tr part of the corpus using the tagset discussed above.",
        "Then, we build four database tables using probabilities extracted from the manually tagged corpus-word-probability table, previous-tag-probability table, starting-tag-probability table and affix-probability table.",
        "For testing, we consider three text segments, A, B and C, each of about 1000 words.",
