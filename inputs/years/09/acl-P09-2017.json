        "Multi-word expressions (MWEs) are sequences of words that tend to cooccur more frequently than chance and are either idiosyncratic or decomposable into multiple simple words (Baldwin, 2006).",
        "Deciding idiomaticity of MWEs is highly important for machine translation, information retrieval, question answering, lexical acquisition, parsing and language generation.",
        "Compositionality refers to the degree to which the meaning of a MWE can be predicted by combining the meanings of its components.",
        "Unlike syntactic compositionality (e.g. by and large), semantic compositionality is continuous (Baldwin, 2006).",
        "In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised approach that compares the major senses of a MWE and its semantic head using distributional similarity measures to test the compositionality of the MWE.",
        "These senses are induced by a graph based sense induction system, whose parameters are estimated in an unsupervised manner exploiting a number of graph connectivity measures (Korkontzelos et al., 2009).",
        "Our method partitions the context space and only uses the major senses, filtering out minor senses.",
        "In our approach the only language dependent components are a PoS tagger and a parser.",
        "There are several studies relevant to detecting compositionality of noun-noun MWEs (Baldwin et al., 2003) verb-particle constructions (Bannard et al., 2003; McCarthy et al., 2003) and verb-noun pairs (Katz and Giesbrecht, 2006).",
        "Datasets with human compositionality judgements are available for these MWE categories (Cook et al., 2008).",
        "Here, we focus on compound nominals, proper names and adjective-noun constructions.",
        "Our contributions are three-fold: firstly, we experimentally show that sense induction can assist in identifying compositional MWEs.",
        "Secondly, we show that unsupervised parameter tuning (Korkontzelos et al., 2009) results in accuracy that is comparable to the best manually selected combination of parameters.",
        "Thirdly, we propose a semi-supervised approach for extracting non-compositional MWEs from WordNet, to decrease annotation cost."
