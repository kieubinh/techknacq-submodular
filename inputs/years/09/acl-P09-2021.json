        "Second Language Acquisition (SLA) researchers have claimed that feedback provided during conversational interaction facilitates the acquisition process.",
        "Thus, interest in developing Dialog-Based Computer Assisted Language Learning (DB-CALL) systems is rapidly increasing.",
        "However, developing DB-CALL systems takes a long time and entails a high cost in collecting learners' data.",
        "Also, evaluating the systems is not a trivial task because it requires numerous language learners with a wide range of proficiency levels as subjects.",
        "While previous studies have considered user simulation in the development and evaluation of spoken dialog systems (Schatzmann et al., 2006), they have not yet simulated grammar errors because those systems were assumed to be used by native speakers, who normally produce few grammar errors in utterances.",
        "However, as telephone-based information access systems become more commonly available to the general public, the inability to deal with non-native speakers is becoming a serious limitation since, at least for some applications, (e.g. tourist information, legal/social advice) non-native speakers represent a significant portion of the everyday user population.",
        "Thus, (Raux and Eskenazi, 2004) conducted a study on adaptation of spoken dialog systems to non-native users.",
        "In particular, DB-CALL systems should obviously deal with grammar errors because language learners naturally commit numerous grammar errors.",
        "Thus grammar error simulation should be embedded in the user simulation for the development and evaluation of such systems.",
        "In Foster's (2007) pioneering work, she described a procedure which automatically introduces frequently occurring grammatical errors into sentences to make ungrammatical training data for a robust parser.",
        "However the algorithm cannot be directly applied to grammar error generation for language learner simulation for several reasons.",
        "First, it either introduces one error per sentence or none, regardless of how many words of the sentence are likely to generate errors.",
        "Second, it determines which type of error it will create only by relying on the relative frequencies of error types and their relevant parts of speech.",
        "This, however, can result in unrealistic errors.",
        "As exemplified in Table 1, when the algorithm tries to create an error by deleting a word, it would probably omit the word 'go' because verb is one of the most frequent parts of speech omitted resulting in an unrealistic error like the first simulated output.",
        "However, Korean/Japanese language learners of English tend to make subject-verb agreement errors, omission errors of the preposition of prepositional verbs, and omission errors of articles because their first language does not have similar grammar rules so that they may be slow on the uptake of such constructs.",
        "Thus, they often commit errors like the second simulated output.",
        "Input sentence He wants to go to a movie theater Unrealistic simulated output He wants to to a movie theater Realistic simulated output He want go to movie theater_",
        "This paper develops an approach to statistical grammar error simulation that can incorporate this type of knowledge about language learners' error characteristics and shows that it does indeed result in realistic grammar errors.",
        "The approach is based on Markov logic, a representation language that combines probabilistic graphical models and first-order logic (Richardson and Domingos, 2006).",
        "Markov logic enables concise specification of very complex models.",
        "Efficient open-source Markov logic learning and inference algorithms were used to implement our solution.",
        "We begin by describing the overall process of grammar error simulation and then briefly reviewing the necessary background in Markov logic.",
        "We then describe our Markov Logic Network (MLN) for grammar error simulation.",
        "Finally, we present our experiments and results."

        "The task of grammar error simulation is to generate an ill-formed sentence when given a well-formed input sentence.",
        "The generation procedure involves three steps: 1) Generating probability over error types for each word of the well-formed input sentence through MLN inference 2) Determining an error type by sampling the generated probability for each word 3) Creating an ill-formed output sentence by realizing the chosen error types (Figure 1)."

        "Markov logic makes it possible to compactly specify probability distributions over complex relational domains.",
        "We used the learning and inference algorithms provided in the open-source Alchemy package (Kok et al., 2006).",
