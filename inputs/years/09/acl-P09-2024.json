        "Question Answering systems have received a lot of interest from NLP researchers during the past years.",
        "But it is often the case that traditional QA systems cannot satisfy the information needs of the users as the question processing part may fail to properly classify the question or the information needed for extracting and generating the answer is either implicit or not present in the question.",
        "In such cases, interactive dialogue is needed to clarify the information needs and reformulate the question in a way that will help the system to find the correct answer.",
        "Due to the fact that casual users often ask questions with ambiguity and vagueness, and most of the questions have multiple answers, current QA systems return a list of answers for most questions.",
        "The answers for one question usually belong to different topics.",
        "In order to satisfy the information needs of the user, information-seeking dialogue should take advantage of the inherent grouping of the answers.",
        "Several methods have been investigated for generating topics for questions in information-seeking dialogue.",
        "Hori et al.",
        "(2003) proposed a method for generating the topics for disambiguation questions.",
        "The scores are computed purely based on the syntactic ambiguity present in the question.",

        "The topics for such clarification questions are based on manually constructed topic frames.",
        "Similarly in (Hickl et al., 2006), suggestions are made to users in the form of predictive question and answer pairs (known as QUABs) which are either generated automatically from the set of documents returned for a query (using techniques first described in (Harabagiu et al., 2005), or are selected from a large database of questions-answer pairs created offline (prior to a dialogue) by human annotators.",

        "None of the above methods consider the contexts of the list of answers in the documents returned by QA systems.",
        "The topic of a good information-seeking question should not only be relevant to the original question but also should be able to distinguish each answer from the others so that the new information can reduce the ambiguity and vagueness in the original question.",
