        "The problem of automatically summarizing text documents has received a lot of attention since the early work by Luhn (Luhn, 1958).",
        "Most of the current automatic summarization systems rely on a sentence extractive paradigm, where key sentences in the original text are selected to form the summary based on the clues (or heuristics), or learning based approaches.",
        "Common approaches for identifying key sentences include: training a binary classifier (Kupiec et al., 1995), training a Markov model or CRF (Conroy et al., 2004; Shen et al., 2007) or directly assigning weights to sentences based on a variety of features and heuristically determined feature weights (Toutanova et al., 2007).",
        "But, the question of which components and features of automatic summarizers contribute most to their performance has largely remained unanswered (Marcu and Gerber, 2001), until Nenkova et al.",
        "(Nenkova et al., 2006) explored the contribution of frequency based measures.",
        "In this paper, we examine the role a query plays in automated multi-document summarization of newswire.",
        "One of the issues studied since the inception of automatic summarization is that of human agreement: different people choose different content for their summaries (Rath et al., 1961; van Halteren and Teufel, 2003; Nenkova et al., 2007).",
        "Later, it was assumed (Dang, 2005) that having a question/query to provide focus would improve agreement between any two human-generated model summaries, as well as between a model summary and an automated summary.",
        "Starting in 2005 until 2007, a query-focused multi-document summarization task was conducted as part of the annual Document Understanding Conference.",
        "This task models a real-world complex question answering scenario, where systems need to synthesize from a set of 25 documents, a brief (250 words), well organized fluent answer to an information need.",
        "Query-focused summarization is a topic of ongoing importance within the summarization and question answering communities.",
        "Most of the work in this area has been conducted under the guise of \"query-focused multi-document summarization\", \"descriptive question answering\", or even \"complex question answering\".",
        "In this paper, based on structured empirical evaluations, we show that most of the systems participating in DUC's Query-Focused Multi-Document Summarization (QF-MDS) task have been query-biased in building extractive summaries.",
        "Throughout our discussion, the term 'query-bias', with respect to a sentence, is precisely defined to mean that the sentence has at least one query term within it.",
        "The term 'query-focus' is less precisely defined, but is related to the cognitive task of focusing a summary on the query, which we assume humans do naturally.",
        "In other words, the human generated model summaries are assumed to be query-focused.",
        "Here we first discuss query-biased content in Summary Content Units (SCUs) in Section 2 and then in Section 3 by building formal models on query-bias we discuss why/how automated systems are query-biased rather than being query-focused."

        "The third sentence in the example was picked by one summarizer, however, it did not contribute to any SCU.",

        "All the above numbers are based on the DUC 2007 dataset shown in boldface in Table 1 .",
        "There is one caveat: The annotated sentences come only from the summaries of systems that participated in the pyramid evaluations.",
        "Since only 13 among a total 32 participating systems were evaluated using pyramid evaluations, the dataset is limited.",
        "However, despite this small issue, it is very clear that at least those systems that participated in pyramid evaluations have been biased towards query-terms, or at least, they have been better at correctly identifying important sentences from the query-biased sentences than from query-unbiased sentences.",

        "The distributions estimated were then used to obtain the likelihood of a query-biased sentence being emitted into a summary by each system.",
        "For the DUC 2007 data, there were 45 summaries for each of the 32 systems (labeled 1-32) among which 2 were baselines (labeled 1 and 2), and 18 summaries from each of 10 human summarizers (labeled A-J).",
        "We computed the log-likelihood, log(L[summary;p(d)]), of all human and machine summaries from DUC 07 query focused multi-document summarization task, based on both distributions described below (see Sections 3.1, 3.2).",

        "On average each topic has 549 sentences, among which 196 contain a query term; which means only 35.6% sentences in the input were query-biased.",

        "Our results underscore the differences between human and machine generated summaries.",
        "Based on Summary Content Unit (SCU) level analysis of query-bias we argue that most systems are better at finding important sentences only from query-biased sentences.",
        "More importantly, we show that on an average, 76.67% of the sentences picked by any automated summarizer are query-biased.",
        "When asked to produce query-focused summaries, humans do not rely to the same extent on the repetition of query terms.",
        "We further confirm based on the likelihood of emitting non query-biased sentence, that there is a strong (negative) correlation among systems' likelihood score and ROUGE score, which suggests that systems are trying to improve performance based on ROUGE metrics by being biased towards the query terms.",
        "On the other hand, humans do not rely on query-bias, though we do not have statistically significant evidence to suggest it.",
        "We have also speculated that the multinomial model helps in better capturing the variance across the systems since it distinguishes among query-biased sentences by quantifying the amount of query-bias.",
        "From our point of view, most of the extractive summarization algorithms are formalized based on a bag-of-words query model.",
        "The innovation with individual approaches has been in formulating the actual algorithm on top of the query model.",
        "We speculate that the real difference in human summarizers and automated summarizers could be in the way a query (or relevance) is represented.",
        "Traditional query models from IR literature have been used in summarization research thus far, and though some previous work (Amini and Usunier, 2007) tries to address this issue using contextual query expansion, new models to represent the query is perhaps one way to induce topic-focus on the summary.",
        "IR-like query models, which are designed to handle 'short keyword queries', are perhaps not capable of handling 'an elaborate query' in case of summarization.",
        "Since the notion of query-focus is apparently missing in any or all of the algorithms, the future summarization algorithms must try to incorporate this while designing new algorithms."
