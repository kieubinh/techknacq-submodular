      "text": [
        "The use of various synchronous grammar based formalisms has been a trend for statistical machine translation (SMT) (Wu, 1997; Eisner, 2003; Galley et al., 2006; Chiang, 2007; Zhang et al., 2008).",
        "The grammar formalism determines the intrinsic capacities and computational efficiency of the SMT systems.",
        "To evaluate the capacity of a grammar formalism, two factors, i.e. generative power and expressive power are usually considered (Su and Chang, 1990).",
        "The generative power refers to the ability to generate the strings of the language, and the expressive power to the ability to describe the same language with fewer or no extra ambiguities.",
        "For the current synchronous grammars based SMT, to some extent, the generalization ability of the grammar rules (the usability of the rules for the new sentences) can be considered as a kind of the generative power of the grammar and the disam- biguition ability to the rule candidates can be considered as an embodiment of expressive power.",
        "However, the generalization ability and the dis-ambiguition ability often contradict each other in practice such that various grammar formalisms in SMT are actually different trade-off between them.",
        "For instance, in our investigations for SMT (Section 3.1), the Formally SCFG based hierarchical phrase-based model (hereinafter FSCFG) (Chiang, 2007) has a better generalization capability than a Linguistically motivated STSSG based model (hereinafter LSTSSG) (Zhang et al., 2008), with 5% rules of the former matched by NIST05 test set while only 3.5% rules of the latter matched by the same test set.",
        "However, from expressiveness point of view, the former usually results in more ambiguities than the latter.",
        "To combine the strengths of different synchronous grammars, this paper proposes a statistical machine translation model based on a synthetic synchronous grammar (SSG) which syncretizes FSCFG and LSTSSG.",
        "Moreover, it is noteworthy that, from the combination point of view, our proposed scheme can be considered as a novel system combination method which goes beyond the existing post-decoding style combination of A-best hypotheses from different systems.",
        "2 The Translation Model Based on the Synthetic Synchronous Grammar",
        "Formally, the proposed Synthetic Synchronous Grammar (SSG) is a tuple where £s(£t) is the alphabet set of source (target) terminals, namely the vocabulary; As(At) is the alphabet set of source (target) non-terminals, such as the POS tags and the syntax labels; A represents the special nonterminal label in FSCFG; and P is the grammar rule set which is the core part of a grammar.",
        "Every rule r in P is as:",
        "where a e [{A}, Ns, £s]+ is a sequence of one or more source words in £s and nonterminals symbols in [{A},A,];7 e [{A},At,£t]+ is a sequence of one or more target words in £t and nonterminals symbols in [{A}, At]; At is a many-to-many corresponding set which includes the alignments between the terminal leaf nodes from source and target side, and Ant is a one-to-one corresponding set which includes the synchronizing relations between the non-terminal leaf nodes from source and target side; to contains feature values associated with each rule.",
        "Through this formalization, we can see that FSCFG rules and LSTSSG rules are both included.",
        "However, we should point out that the rules with mixture of X non-terminals and syntactic non-terminals are not included in our current implementation despite that they are legal under the proposed formalism.",
        "The rule extraction in current implementation can be considered as a combination of the ones in (Chiang, 2007) and (Zhang et al., 2008).",
        "Given the sentence pair in Figure 1, some SSG rules can be extracted as illustrated in Figure 2.",
        "The translation in our SSG-based translation model can be treated as a SSG derivation.",
        "A derivation consists of a sequence of grammar rule applications.",
        "To model the derivations as a latent variable, we define the conditional probability distribution over the target translation e and the cor-",
        "Input: A source parse tree T(/1J) Output: A target translation e for u := 0 to J – 1 do if Ajvt of r is empty then",
        "I Add r into H[v, v + u]; end else",
        "Substitute the non-terminal leaf node pair (Wsrc, Ntgt) with the hypotheses in the hypotheses stack corresponding with Nsrc's span iteratively.",
        "Output the 1-best hypothesis in H[l, J] as the final translation.",
        "where is a feature function ,Afc is the corresponding feature weight and is a normalization factor for each derivation of f. The main challenge of SSG-based model is how to distinguish and weight the different kinds of derivations .",
        "For a simple illustration, using the rules listed in Figure 2, three derivations can be produced for the sentence pair in Figure 1 by the proposed model:",
        "All of them are SSG derivations while d\\ is also a FSCFG derivation, c?2 is also a LSTSSG derivation.",
        "Ideally, the model is supposed to be able to weight them differently and to prefer the better derivation, which deserves intensive study.",
        "Some sophisticated features can be designed for this issue.",
        "For example, some features related with structure richness and grammar consistency of a derivation should be designed to distinguish the derivations involved various heterogeneous rule applications.",
        "For the page limit and the fair comparison, we only adopt the conventional features as in (Zhang et al., 2008) in our current implementation.",
        "!This relates with reviewers' questions: \"can a rule expecting an NN accept an X?\"",
        "and \"... the interaction between the two typed of rules In our study in progress, we would design some features to distinguish the derivation steps which fulfill the expectation or not, to measure how much heterogeneous rules are applied in a derivation and so on.",
        "Figure 2: Some synthetic synchronous grammar rules can be extracted from the sentence pair in Figure 1.",
        "R1-R3 are bilingual phrase rules, R4-R5 are FSCFG rules and Re-Rs are LSTSSG rules.",
        "For efficiency, our model approximately search for the single 'best' derivation using beam search as",
        "The major challenge for such a SSG-based decoder is how to apply the heterogeneous rules in a derivation.",
        "For example, (Chiang, 2007) adopts a CKY style span-based decoding while (Liu et al., 2006) applies a linguistically syntax node based bottom-up decoding, which are difficult to integrate.",
        "Fortunately, our current SSG syncretizes FSCFG and LSTSSG.",
        "And the conventional de-codings of both FSCFG and LSTSSG are span-based expansion.",
        "Thus, it would be a natural way for our SSG-based decoder to conduct a span-based beam search.",
        "The search procedure is given by the pseudocode in Figure 3.",
        "A hypotheses stack H[i,j] (similar to the \"chart cell\" in CKY parsing) is arranged for each span [i, j] for storing the translation hypotheses.",
        "The hypotheses stacks are ordered such that every span is translated after its possible antecedents: smaller spans before larger spans.",
        "For translating each span the decoder traverses each usable rule r = (a,^, Ant, At,lv).",
        "If there is no nonterminal leaf node in r, the target side 7 will be added into H[i, j] as the candidate hypothesis.",
        "Otherwise, the nonterminal leaf nodes in r should be substituted iteratively by the corresponding hypotheses until all nonterminal leaf nodes are processed.",
        "The key feature of our decoder is that the derivations are based on synthetic grammar, so that one derivation may consist of applications of heterogeneous rules (Please seeds in Section 2.2 as a simple demonstration)."

        "The NIST MT2005 test set is used as the test set.",

        "For significant test, we used Zhang's implementation (Zhang et al., 2004)(confidence level of 95%).",

        "Table 1 summarizes the statistics of the rules for different models in three phases: after extraction (Extracted), after scoring(Scored), and after filtering (Filtered) (filtered by NIST05 test set just, similar to the filtering step in phrase-based SMT system).",
        "In Extracted phase, FSCFG has obvious more rules than LSTSSG.",
        "However, in Scored phase, this situation reverses.",
        "Interestingly, the situation reverses again in Filtered phase.",
        "The reasons for these phenomenons are that FSCFG abstract rules involves high-degree generalization.",
        "Each FSCFG abstract rule averagely have several duplicates in the extracted rule set.",
        "Then, the duplicates will be discarded during scoring.",
        "However, due to the high-degree generalization , the FSCFG abstract rules are more likely to be matched by the test sentences.",
