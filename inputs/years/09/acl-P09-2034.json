        "Assuming that the MT system to be evaluated can deal with both directions of a language pair, in this research we suggest to conduct automatic MT evaluation by determining the orthographic similarity between a back-translation and the original source text.",

        "The manual evaluation of the results of machine translation systems requires considerable time and effort.",
        "For this reason fast and inexpensive automatic methods were developed.",
        "They are based on the comparison of a machine translation with a reference translation produced by humans.",
        "The comparison is done by determining the number of matching word sequences between both translations.",
        "It could be shown that such methods, of which BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) is the most common, can deliver evaluation results that show a high agreement with human judgments (Papineni et al., 2002; Coughlin, 2003; Koehn & Monz, 2006).",
        "Disadvantages of BLEU and related methods are that a human reference translation is required, and that the results are reliable only at corpus level, i.e. when computed over many sentence pairs (see e.g. Callison-Burch et al., 2006).",
        "However, at the sentence level, due to data sparseness the results tend to be unsatisfactory (Agarwal & Lavie, 2008; Callison-Burch et al., 2008).",
        "Papineni et al.",
        "(2002) describe this as follows:",
        "\"BLEU's strength is that it correlates highly with human judgments by averaging out individual sentence judgment errors over a test corpus rather than attempting to divine the exact human judgment for every sentence: quantity leads to quality.\"",
        "Although in many scenarios the above mentioned drawbacks may not be a major problem, it is nevertheless desirable to overcome them.",
        "This is what we attempt in this paper by introducing the back-translation score.",
        "It is based on the assumption that the MT system considered can translate a language pair in both directions, which is usually the case.",
        "Evaluating the quality of a machine translation now involves translating it back to the source language.",
        "The score is then computed by comparing the back-translation to the original source text.",
        "Although for this comparison BLEU could be used, our experiments show that a modified version which we call OrthoBLEU is better suited for this purpose as it can deal with compounds and inflexional variants in a more appropriate way.",
        "Its operation is based on finding matches of character-rather than word-sequences.",
        "It resembles algorithms used in translation memory search for locating orthographically similar sentences.",
        "The results that we obtain in this work refute to some extend the common belief that backtranslation (sometimes also called round-trip translation) is not a suitable means for MT evaluation (Somers, 2005; Koehn, 2005).",
        "This belief seems to be largely based on the obvious observation that the back-translation score is highest for a trivial translation system that does nothing and simply leaves all source words in place.",
        "On the other hand, according to Somers (2005) \"until now no one as far as we know has published results demonstrating this\" (i.e. that back-translation is not useful for MT evaluation).",
        "We would like to add that so far the inappropriateness of back-translation has only been shown by comparisons with other automatic metrics (Somers 2005; Koehn, 2005), which are also",

        "Somers (2005) therefore states: \"To be really sure of our results, we should like to replicate the experiments evaluating the translations using a more old-fashioned method involving human ratings of intelligibility.\"",
        "That is, apparently nobody has ever seriously compared back-translation scores to human judgments, so the belief about their inutility seems not sufficiently backed by facts.",

        "On the other hand, serious scientific publications (Somers, 2005; Koehn, 2005) come to the conclusion that back-translation is completely unsuitable for MT evaluation.",
