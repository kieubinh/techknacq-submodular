        "However, when we translate long sentences, we argue that two major issues will be raised.",
        "On one hand, parsing accuracy will be lower as the length of sentence grows.",
        "It will inevitably hurt the translation quality (Quirk and the other hand, decoding on long sentences will be time consuming, especially for forest approaches.",
        "So splitting long sentences into subsentences becomes a natural way in MT literature.",
        "A simple way is to split long sentences by punctuations.",
        "However, without concerning about the original whole tree structures, this approach will result in ill-formed sub-trees which don't respect to original structures.",
        "In this paper, we present a new approach, which pays more attention to parse trees on the long sentences.",
        "We firstly parse the long sentences into trees, and then divide them accordingly into sub-sentences, which will be translated independently (Section 3).",
        "Finally, we combine sub translations into a full translation (Section 4).",

        "Long sentences could be very complicated in grammar and sentence structure, thereby creating an obstacle for translation.",

        "To divide sentences by punctuation is one of the most commonly used methods.",
        "However, simply applying this method might damage the accuracy of parsing.",
        "As a result, the strategy we proposed is to operate division while concerning the structure of parse tree.",
        "As sentence division should not influence the accuracy of parsing, we have to be very cautious about sentences whose division might decrease the accuracy of parsing.",
        "Figure 2(a) shows an example of the parse tree of an undividable sentence.",
        "As can be seen in Figure 2, when we divide the sentence by comma, it would break the structure of \"VP\" sub-tree and result in a ill-formed sub-tree \"VP\" (right sub-tree), which don't have a subject and don't respect to original tree structures.",
        "Consequently, the key issue of sentence division is finding the sentences that can be divided without loosing parsing accuracy.",

        "However, this does not prove to be a problem, as we process each comma independently.",
        "In other words, we only split the dividable part of this kind of sentences, leaving the non-dividable part unchanged.",
        "To find the sentences that can be divided, we present a new method and provide its pseudo code.",
        "Firstly, we divide a sentence by its commas.",
        "For each word in the sub-sentence on the left side of a comma, we compute its lowest common ancestor (LCA) with the comma.",
        "And we process the words in the sub-sentence on the right side of the comma in the same way.",
        "Finally, we check if all the LCA we have computed are comma's parent node.",
        "If all the LCA are the comma's parent node, the sub-sentences are independent.",
