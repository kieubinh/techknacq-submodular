        "Comparing one entity with other entities is one of the most convincing ways of evaluation (Jin-dal and Liu, 2006).",
        "A comparative sentence formulates an ordering relation between two entities and that relation is very useful for many application areas.",
        "One key area is for the customers.",
        "For example, a customer can make a decision on his/her final choice about a digital camera after reading other customers' product reviews, e.g., \"Digital Camera X is much cheaper than Y though it functions as good as Y!\"",
        "Another one is for manufacturers.",
        "All the manufacturers have an interest in the articles saying how their products are compared with competitors' ones.",
        "Comparative sentences often contain some comparative keywords.",
        "A sentence may express some comparison if it contains any comparative",
        "l ee ([gat]: same)'.",
        "But many sentences also express comparison without those keywords.",
        "Similarly, although some sentences contain some keywords, they cannot be comparative sentences.",
        "By these reasons, extracting comparative sentences is not a simple or easy problem.",
        "It needs more complicated and challenging processes than only searching out some keywords for extracting comparative sentences.",
        "Jindal and Liu (2006) previously studied to identify English comparative sentences.",
        "But the mechanism of Korean as an agglutinative language and that of English as an inflecting language have seriously different aspects.",
        "One of the greatest differences related to our work is that there are Part-of-Speech (POS) Tags for comparative and superlative in Englishl, whereas, unfortunately, the POS tagger of Korean does not provide any comparative and superlative tags because the analysis of Korean comparative is much more difficult than that of English.",
        "The major challenge of our work is therefore to identify comparative sentences without comparative and superlative POS Tags.",
        "We first survey previous studies about the Korean comparative syntax and collect the corpus of Korean comparative sentences from the Web.",
        "As we refer to previous studies and investigate real comparative sentences form the collected corpus, we can construct the set of comparative keywords and extract comparative-sentence candidates; the sentences which contain one or more element of the keyword set are called comparative-sentence candidates.",
        "Then we use some machine learning techniques to eliminate non-comparative sentences from those candidates.",
        "The final experimental results in 5-fold cross validation show the overall precision of 88.68% and the overall recall of 88.40%.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes the related work.",
        "In section 3, we explain comparative keywords and comparative-sentence candidates.",
        "In section 4, we describe how to eliminate non-comparative sentences from the candidates extracted in preceding section.",
        "Section 5 presents the experimental results.",
        "Finally, we discuss conclusions and future work in section 6"

        "In order to capture S2, we added long-distance-words sequences to the set of single-keywords.",

        "It means that the sentence is formed as < S V but S V> in English (S: subject phrase, V: verb phrase).",

        "4 Eliminating Non-comparative Sentences from the Candidates",
        "To effectively eliminate non-comparative sentences from comparative sentence candidates with a CKL2 keyword, we employ machine learning techniques (MEM and Naïve Bayes).",
        "For feature extraction from each comparative-sentence candidate, we use continuous words sequence within the radius of 3 (the window size of 7) of each keyword in the sentence; we experimented with radius options of 2, 3, and 4 and we achieved the best performance in the radius of 3.",
        "After determining the radius, we replace each word with its POS tag; in order to reflect various expressions of each sentence, POS tags are more proper than lexical information of actual words.",
        "However, since CKs play the most important role to discriminate comparative sentences, they are represented as a combination of their actual keyword and POS tag.",
        "Thus our feature is formed as \"X -> y\".",
