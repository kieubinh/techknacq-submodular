        "The answer can be explicitly stated in one of the blog sentences, or a system might have to infer them from assumptions made by the bloggers and their comments.",
        "Moreover, most of the opinion questions have longer answers, not just a phrase snippet, but up to 2 or 3 sentences.",
        "As we can observe in Table 2, the questions for which the TQA system performed better were the pure factual ones (1, 3, 4, 8, 10 and 14), although in some cases (question number 14) the OQA system retrieved more correct answers.",
        "At the same time, opinion queries, although revolving around NEs, were not answered by the traditional QA system, but were satisfactorily answered by the opinion QA system (2, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12).",
        "Questions 18 and 20 were not correctly answered by any of the two systems.",
        "We believe the reason is that question 18 was ambiguous as far as polarity of the opinions expressed in the answer snippets (\"improvement\" does not translate to either \"positive\" or \"negative\") and question 20 referred to the title of a project proposal that was not annotated by any of the tools used.",
        "Thus, as part of the future work in our OQA system, we must add a component for the identification of quotes and titles, as well as explore a wider range of polarity/opinion scales.",
        "Furthermore, questions 15, 16, 18, 19 and 20 contain both factual as well as opinion aspects and the OQA system performed better than the TQA, although in some cases, answers were lost due to the artificial boosting of the queries containing NEs of the EAT (Expected Answer Type).",
        "Therefore, it is obvious that an extra method for answer ranking should be used, as Answer Validation techniques using Textual Entailment.",

        "In this article, we created a collection of both factual and opinion queries in Spanish and English.",

        "Our main objective was to compare the performances of these two systems and analyze their errors, proposing solutions to creating an effective QA system for both factoid an opinionated queries.",
        "We saw that, even using specialized resources, the task of QA is still challenging.",
        "Opinion QA can benefit from a snippet retrieval at a paragraph level, since in many cases the answers were not simple parts of sentences, but consisted in two or more consecutive sentences.",
        "On the other hand, we have seen cases in which each of three different consecutive sentences was a separate answer to a question.",
        "Our future work contemplates the study of the impact anaphora resolution and temporality on opinion QA, as well as the possibility to use Answer Validation techniques for answer re-ranking."
