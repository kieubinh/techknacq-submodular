        "Sentiment analysis have been widely conducted in several domains such as movie reviews, product reviews, news and blog reviews (Pang et al., 2002; Turney, 2002).",
        "The unit of the sentiment varies from a document level to a sentence level to a phrase-level, where a more fine-grained approach has been receiving more attention for its accuracy.",
        "Sentiment analysis on product reviews identifies or summarizes sentiment from reviews by extracting relevant opinions about certain attributes of products such as their parts, or properties (Hu and Liu, 2004; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005).",
        "Aspect-based sentiment analysis summarizes sentiments with diverse attributes, so that customers may have to look more closely into analyzed sentiments (Titov and McDonald, 2008).",
        "However, there are additional problems.",
        "First, it is rather hard to choose the right level of detail.",
        "If concepts corresponding to attributes are too general, the level of detail may not be so much finer than the ones on a document level.",
        "On the other hand, if concepts are too specific, there may be some attributes that are hardly mentioned in the reviews, resulting in the data sparseness problem.",
        "Second, there are cases when some crucial information is lost.",
        "For example, suppose that two product attributes are mentioned in a sentence with a coordinated or subordinated structure.",
        "In this case, the information about their relation may not be shown in the summary if they are classified into different upper-level attributes.",
        "Consider (1).",

        "'It's a bit thinner than I thought, but it is good enough for layering.'",
        "(thickness: negative but acceptable, overall: positive)",
        "Example (1) shows sample customer reviews about clothes, each first in Korean, followed by a Yale Romanized form, and an English translation.",
        "Note that the weight of the polarity in the sentiment about size e.g. in (1a) is overcome by the one about color.",
        "However, if the overall sentiment is computed by considering only the number of semantically identical phrases in the reviews, it misses the big picture.",
        "In particular, when opinions regarding attributes are described with respect to expressions whose polarities are dependent on the specific contexts such as the weather or user preference, an overestimated or underestimated weight of the sentiment for each attribute may be assigned.",
        "In our example, ^^/yalpta/'thin' has an ambiguous polarity, i.e., either positive or negative, whose real value depends on the expected utility of the clothes.",
        "In this case, the negative polarity is the intended one, as shown in (1b).",
        "In order to reflect this possibility, we need to adjust the weight of each polarity accordingly.",
        "In this paper, we propose to look into the kind of linguistic and ontological clues that may influence the use of polarities, or the relevance for 'satisfaction of purchase' inspired by Kano's theory of quality element classification (Huisko-nen and Pirttila, 1998), the conceptual granularities, and such syntactic and lexical clues as conjunction items and adverbs.",
        "They may play significant roles in putting together the identified polarity information, so as to assess correctly what the customers consider most important.",
        "We conducted several one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tests to identify the effects of each clue on deriving categories of polarity and quantification method 2 to see whether these clues can distinguish fine-grained polarities correctly.",
        "Section 2 introduces categories of polarity.",
        "Section 3 analyzes ontological and linguistic clues for identifying the proper category.",

        "If we go down another level, Product is divided into Quality and Comfortableness.",

        "Quality elements classified by Kano as shown in Table 1 can be base indicators of relevant attributes for satisfaction in real review text.",
        "For example, while completeness of the product may become crucial if the product has a defect, it is usually not the case that it would contribute much to the overall satisfaction of the customer.",
        "Conceptual Granularity: The concepts corresponding to attributes have a different level of detail.",
        "If the customer wants to comment on some attributes in detail, she could use a finegrained concept (e.g., the width of the thigh part of the pants) rather than a coarse-grained one (e.g., just the size of the pants).",
        "To deal properly with the changing granularity of such concepts, we constructed a domain specific semi-hierarchical network for clothes of the Clothing-Type structure, in addition to the Review structure, by utilizing hierarchical category information in online shopping malls.",
        "Figure 2 shows an example for \"pants\".",
        "Syntactic and Lexical Clues: Descriptions of each attribute in the reviews are often expressed in a phrase or clause, so that conjunctions, or endings of a word with a conjunctive marker in Korean, play a significant role in connecting one attribute to another.",
        "They also convey a subtle meaning of the sentiment about relations between two or more connected attributes.",
        "We classified such syntactic clues into 4 groups of likeness (L), contrary (C), cause-effect (CE), and contrary with contrastive markers (CC).",

        "Wilson and colleagues (2006) selected some syntactic clues as features for intensity classification.",
        "The selected features are shown to improve the accuracy, but the set of clues may vary to the nature of the given corpus, so that some otherwise useful clues that reflect a particular focused structure may not be selected.",
        "We argue that some syntactic clues such as the use of certain conjunctions can be identified manually to make up for the limitation of feature selection.",
        "Adverbs modifying adjectives or verbs such as too, and very also strengthen the polarity of a given sentiment, so such clues work to differentiate normal positive or negative from 'barely positive' and 'acceptably negative'.",
        "Table 2 summarizes linguistic clues in the present analysis.",
        "All these three types of clue that appear in the review text may interact with one another.",
        "For example, attributes with 'barely positive' tend to be described with a concept on a coarse level, and may belong to Must-be Quality (e,g., size in (1a)).",
        "However, if such attributes are negative, customers may explain them with a very finegrained concept (e.g., the width of thigh is okay, but the calf part is too wide; interaction between relevance for satisfaction and conceptual granularity).",
        "They may also use adverbs such as 'too' to emphasize such unexpected polarity information.",
        "For emphasis, a contrastive structure can be used to indicate which attribute has a more weight (e.g., 'A but B'; interaction between syntactic clues and relevance for satisfaction).",
        "In addition, an unfocused attribute A may be the attribute with 'acceptably negative' if the polarity of the attribute B is positive.",
        "We believe that the interaction between lexical and syntactic clues and relevance for satisfaction are the most important and that this correlation information may be utilized with such fine-grained polarity as 'barely positive' or 'acceptably negative'."
