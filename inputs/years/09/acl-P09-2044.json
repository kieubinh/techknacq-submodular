        "While most research in natural language processing is dealing with identifying, extracting and classifying facts, recent years have seen a surge in research on sentiment and subjectivity (see Pang & Lee (2008) for an overview).",
        "However, even opinions have to be backed up by facts to be effective as arguments.",
        "Distinguishing facts from fiction requires to detect subtle variations in the use of linguistic devices such as linguistic hedges which indicate that speakers do not back up their opinions with facts (Lakoff, 1973; Hyland, 1998).",
        "Many NLP applications could benefit from identifying linguistic hedges, e.g. question answering systems (Riloff et al., 2003), information extraction from biomedical documents (Medlock & Briscoe, 2007; Szarvas, 2008), and deception detection (Bachenko et al., 2008).",
        "While NLP research on classifying linguistic hedges has been restricted to analysing biomedical documents, the above (incomplete) list of applications suggests that domain-and language-independent approaches for hedge detection need to be developed.",
        "We investigate Wikipedia as a source of training data for hedge classification.",
        "We adopt Wikipedia's notion of weasel words which we argue to be closely related to hedges and private states.",
        "Many Wikipedia articles contain a specific weasel tag, so that Wikipedia can be viewed as a readily annotated corpus.",
        "Based on this data, we have built a system to detect sentences that contain linguistic hedges.",
        "We compare a baseline relying on word frequency measures with one combining word frequency with shallow linguistic features."

        "The basic idea of the RelF score is to give those words a high score, which occur frequently in the context of a weasel tag.",
        "However, due to the sparseness of tagged instances, words that occur with a very high frequency in the corpus automatically receive a lower score than low-frequent words.",
        "We use the logarithmic function to diminish this effect.",
        "In equation 3, for each weasel context j, dist(w, weaseltagj ) denotes the distance of word w to the weasel tag in j.",

        "= 0.69/rec.",
        "= 0.68) for asp (Table 2 shows results at a few fixed thresholds allowing for a better comparison).",
        "This indicates that the syntactic patterns do not contribute to the regeneration of weasel tags.",
        "Word frequency and distance to the weasel tag are sufficient.",
        "The decreasing precision of both approaches when trained on more tagged sentences (i.e., computed with a higher threshold) might be caused by the great number of unannotated weasel words.",
        "Indeed, an investigation of the sentences scored with the added syntactic patterns showed that many high-ranked sentences were weasels which had not been tagged.",
        "A disadvantage of the weasel tag is its short life span.",
        "The weasel tag marks a phrase that needs to be edited, thus, once a weasel word has been detected and tagged, it is likely to get removed soon.",
        "The number of tagged sentences is much smaller than the actual number of weasel words.",
        "This leads to a great number of false positives.",
        "Table 2: F-scores at different thresholds (bold at the precision/recall break-even-points determined on the development data)",
        "The difference between wpw and asp becomes more distinct when the manually annotated data form the test set.",
        "Here asp outperforms wpw by a large margin, though this is also due to the fact that wpw performs rather poorly, asp reaches an F-score of 0.69 (prec.",
        "= 0.61/rec.",
        "= 0.78), while wpw reaches only an F-Score of 0.59 (prec.",
        "= 0.42/ rec.",
        "= 1).",
        "This suggests that the added syntactic patterns indeed manage to detect weasels that have not yet been tagged.",
        "When humans annotate the data they not only take specific words into account but the whole sentence, and this is why the syntactic patterns achieve better results when tested on those data.",
        "The word frequency measure derived from the weasel tags is not sufficient to cover this more intelligible notion of hedging.",
        "If one is to be restricted to words, it would be better to fall back to the weakly supervised approaches by Medlock 6 Briscoe (2007) and Szarvas (2008).",
        "These approaches could go beyond the original annotation and learn further hedging indicators.",
