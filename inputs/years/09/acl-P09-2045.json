      "text": [
        "To generate an accurate review summary for a specific product, product features must be identified accurately.",
        "Since product features are often domain-dependent, it is desirable that the features extraction system is as flexible as possible.",
        "Our approach are unsupervised and relies only on product specifications.",
        "Product specifications can usually be fetched from web sites like Amazon automatically.",
        "Those materials have several characteristics that are very helpful to review mining:",
        "1.",
        "Nicely structured, provide a natural conceptual view of products;",
        "2.",
        "Include only relevant information of the product and contain few noise words;",
        "3.",
        "Except for the product feature itself, usually also provide a unit to measure this feature.",
        "A typical mobile phone specification is partially given below:",
        "• Physical features",
        "- Form: Mono block with full keyboard• Display and 3D",
        "The architecture of our approach, is depicted in Figure 1.",
        "We first retrieve multiple specifications from various sources like websites, user manuals etc.",
        "Then we run clustering algorithms on the specifications and generate a specification tree.",
        "And then we use this specification tree to extract features from product reviews.",
        "Finally the extracted features are presented in a tree form.",
        "- Size: small -- Thickness: thin price: low",
        "Usually, each product specification describes a particular product model.",
        "Some features are present in every product specification.",
        "But there are cases that some features are not available in all specifications.",
        "For instance, \"WiFi\" features are only available in a few mobile phones specifications.",
        "Also, different specifications might express the same features with different words or terms.",
        "So it is necessary to combine multiple specifications to include all possible features.",
        "Clustering algorithm can be used to combine specifications.",
        "We propose an approach that takes following inherent information of specifications into account:",
        "• Hierarchy structure: Positions of features in hierarchy reflect relationships between features.",
        "For example, \"length\", \"width\" feature are often placed under \"size\" feature.",
        "• Unit of measurement: Similar features are usually measured in similar units.",
        "Though different specification might refer the same feature with different terms, the units of measurement used to describe those terms are usually the same.",
        "For example, \"dimension\" and \"size\" are different terms, but they share the same unit \"mm\" or \"inch\".",
        "Naturally, a product can be viewed as a tree of features.",
        "The root is the product itself.",
        "Each node in the tree represents a feature in the product.",
        "A complex feature might be conceptually split into several simple features.",
        "In this case, the complex feature is represented as a parent and the simple features are represented as its children.",
        "To construct such a product feature tree, we adopt the following algorithm:",
        "• Parse specifications: We first build a dictionary for common units of measurement.",
        "Then for every specification, we use regular expression and unit dictionary to parse it to a tree of (feature, unit) pairs.",
        "• Cluster specification trees: Given multiple specification trees, we cluster them into a single tree.",
        "Similarities between features are a combination of their lexical similarity, unit similarity and positions in hierarchy:",
        "The parameter a is set to 0.7 empirically.",
        "If Sim(fl, /2) is larger than 5, we merge features fl and /2 together.",
        "After clustering, we can get a specification tree resembles the one in subsection 2.1.",
        "However, this specification tree contains much more features than any single specification.",
        "Features described in reviews can be classified into two categories: explicit features and implicit features (Hu and Liu, 2004a).",
        "In the following sections, we describe methods to extract features in Chinese product reviews.",
        "However, these methods are designed to be flexible so that they can be easily adapted to other languages.",
        "We generate bi-grams in character level for every feature in the specification tree, and then match them to every sentence in the reviews.",
        "There might be cases that some bi-grams would overlap or concatenated.",
        "In these cases, we join those bi-grams together to form a longer expression.",
        "Some features are not mentioned directly but can be inferred from the text.",
        "Qi Suet al.",
        "(2008) investigates the problem of extracting those kinds of features.",
        "There approach utilizes the association between features and opinion words to find implicit features when opinion words are present in the text.",
        "Our methods consider another kind of association: the association between features and units of measurement.",
        "For example, in the sentence \"A mobile phone with 8 mega-pixel, not very common in the market.\"",
        "feature name is absent in the sentence, but the unit of measurement \"mega pixel\" indicates that this sentence is describing the feature \"camera resolution\".",
        "We use regular expression and dictionary of unit to extract those features.",
        "There are many ways to provide a summary.",
        "Hu and Liu (2004b) count the number of positive and negative review items towards individual feature and present these statistics to users.",
        "G. Carenini et al.",
        "(2006b) and M. Gamon et al.",
        "(2005) both adopt a tree map visualization to display features and sentiments associated with features.",
        "We adopt a relatively simple method to generate a summary.",
        "We do not predict the polarities of the user's overall attitudes towards product features.",
        "Predicting polarities might entail the construction of a sentiment dictionary, which is domain dependent.",
        "Also, we believe that text descriptions of features are more helpful to users.",
        "For example, for feature \"size\", descriptions like \"small\" and \"thin\" are more readable than \"positive\".",
        "Usually, the words used to describe a product feature are short.",
        "For each product feature, we report several most frequently occurring uni-grams and bi-grams as the summary of this feature.",
        "In Figure 2, we present a snippet of a sample summary output.",
        "• mobile phone: not bad, expensive o appearance: cool",
        "■ color: white",
        "■ size: small, thin",
        "o camera functionality: so-so, acceptable o entertainment functionality:■ picture quality: good",
        "■ picture resolution: not high",
        "powerful■ game: fun, simple",
        "In this paper, we mainly focus on Chinese product reviews.",
        "The experimental data are retrieved from ZOL websites (www.",
        "zol.",
        "com.",
        "cn).",
        "We collected user reviews on 2 mobile phones, 1 digital camera and 2 notebook computers.",
        "To evaluate performance of our algorithm on real-world data, we do not perform noise word filtering on these data.",
        "Then we have a human tagger to tag features in the user reviews.",
        "Both explicit features and implicit features are tagged.",
        "The specifications for all 3 kinds of products are retrieved from ZOL, PConline and IT168 websites.",
        "We run the clustering algorithm on the specifications and generate a specification tree for each kind of product.",
        "Table 1 shows that our clustering method is effective in collecting product features.",
        "The number of features increases rapidly with the number of specifications input into clustering algorithm.",
        "When we use 10 specifications as input, the clustering methods can collect several hundred features.",
        "Then we run our algorithm on the data and evaluate the precision and recall.",
        "We also run the algorithms described in Hu and Liu (2004a) on the same data as the baseline.",
        "From Table 2, we can see the precision of baseline system is much lower than its recall.",
        "Examining the features extracted by baseline system, we find that many mistakenly recognized features are high-frequency words.",

        "Those words include \"user\", \"review\" and \"comment\" etc.",
        "In contrast, our approach recognizes features by matching bi-grams to the specification tree.",
        "Because those high-frequency words usually are not present in specifications.",
        "They are ignored by our approach.",
        "Thus from Table 2, we can conclude that our approach could achieve a relatively high precision while keep a high recall.",
        "After the summary is given, for each word in summary, we ask one person to decide whether this word correctly describe the feature.",
        "Table 3 gives the summary precision for each product model.",
        "In general, on-line reviews have several characteristics in common.",
        "The sentences are usually short.",
        "Also, words describing features usually co-occur with features in the same sentence.",
