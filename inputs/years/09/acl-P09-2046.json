        "Key phrases E E",
        "The input of preprocessing is user's queries and the output is a list of words and their POS labels.",
        "Because of the effectiveness and convenience associated with integrating two stages of word segmentation and POS tagging, we proposed two modules for the preprocessing stage.",
        "The purposes of two modules are as follows: • Word Segmentation: The main function of this segmentation module is to identify and separate the tokens present in the text in such a way that every individual word, as well as every punctuation mark, will be a different token.",
        "The segmentation module considers words, numbers with decimals or dates in numerical format in order not to separate the dot, the comma or the slash (respectively) from the preceding and/or following elements.",
        "• POS tagging: The output of the segmentation module is taken as input by the POS tagging module.",
        "Almost any kind of POS tagging could be applied.",
        "In our system, we have proposed a hybrid model for the problem of Vietnamese POS Tagging (Chau and Tuoi, 2006).",
        "This model combines a rule-based method and a statistical learning method.",

        "The input of the candidate phrase identification is a list of words and their POS labels, and the output is a list of words and their chunking labels.",
        "The idea underlying this method (Chau and Tuoi, 2007) for the Vietnamese key phrase extraction is based on a number of grammatical constructions in Vietnamese.",
        "The method consists of pattern-action rules executed by the finite-state transduction mechanism.",
        "It recognizes entities such as noun phrases.",
        "In order to accomplish the noun phrases recognition, we have developed over 434 patterns of noun phrase groups that cover proper noun constructs.",
        "In this section, we focus on the description of a methodology for key phrase extraction.",
        "This method combines a pattern-based method and a statistical learning method.",
        "Both methods will complement each other to increase the expected performance of the model.",
        "In particular, the method has the following steps:",
        "• Step 1: We propose a method that exploits specific characteristics of Vietnamese (Chau and Tuoi, 2007).",
        "At the heart of this method is the idea of building a Vietnamese words set that reflects semantic relationships among objects.",
        "For example, consider the sentence that follows:",
        "\"Mdy tinh nay co dung luong RAM l&n nhat la bao nhieu ?\"",
        "that means \"What is the largest RAM capacity for this computer?\"",
        "In this sentence, we have two objects \"Mdy tinh\"(this computer) and \"RAM\" in real world.",
        "Respectively, two noun phrases are \"Mdy tinh\"(this computer) and \"dung luong RAM l&n nhdt\" (the largest RAM capacity).",
        "We consider the meanings of words per the above example; we will recognize \"co\", a meaning word in our meaning word set, which reflects a possessive relationship between \"Mdy tinh\" and \"dung luong RAM l&n nhat\".",
        "This has identified \"dung luong RAM l&n nhat\" representing the meaning of the sentence.",
        "This meaning word-based approach provides a set of semantic relationships (meaning words) between phrases to support key phrase extraction, which does not require building a hierarchy or semantic network of objects in the Vietnamese language.",
        "• Step 2: In case the sentence has no meaning word among phrases, the key phrase extracting process is based on the ViO ontology via concept matching.",
        "In particular, this step has the following phases:",
        "1. every candidate phrase in the sentence is matched to an entry in the VicDic dictionary especially when new phrases are not a concern or do not exist in the dictionary.",
        "Because a partial matching dilemma usually exists, we apply several strategies to improve the matching process, including maximum matching, minimum-matching, forward-matching, backward-matching and bidirectional matching.",
        "2. if the matching process is successful, then we retrieve categories for the entries respectively via the category system in the ViO ontology; if the candidate phrase has the most specific category, then the phrase is the key phrase of the sentence indicated in Step 3.",
        "3. if the matching process is not successful, then we find a semantic similarity concept in the ViO ontology as Step 4.",
        "After that, the key phrase extracting process will go to phase 2.",
        "• Step 3: The idea of the most specific category identification process based on the ViO ontology is shown as pseudo-code, such as",
