        "With the increased incidence of depressive disorders, many psychiatric websites have developed community-based services such as message boards, web forums and blogs for public access.",
        "Through these services, individuals can describe their stressful or negative life events such as death of a family member, argument with a spouse and loss of a job, along with depressive symptoms, such as depressive mood, suicidal tendencies and anxiety.",
        "Such psychiatric texts (e.g., forum posts) contain large amounts of natural language expressions related to negative life events, making them useful resources for building more effective psychiatric services.",
        "For instance, a psychiatric retrieval service can retrieve relevant forum or blog posts according to the negative life events experienced by users so that they can be aware that they are not alone because many people have suffered from the same or similar problems.",
        "The users can then create a community discussion to share their experiences with each other.",
        "Additionally, a dialog system can generate supportive responses like \"Don't worry\", \"That's really sad\" and \"Cheer up\" if it can understand the negative life events embedded in the example sentences shown in Table 1.",
        "Therefore, this study proposes a framework for negative life event classification.",
        "We formulate this problem as a sentence classification task; that is, classify sentences according to the type of negative life events within them.",
        "The class labels used herein are presented in Table 1, which are derived from Brostedt and Pedersen (2003).",
        "Traditional approaches to sentence classification (Khoo et al., 2006; Naughton et al., 2008) or text categorization (Sebastiani 2002) usually adopt bag-of-words as baseline features to train classifiers.",
        "Since the bag-of-words approach treats each word independently without considering the relationships of words in sentences, some researchers have investigated the use of n-grams to capture sequential relations between words to boost classification performance (Chitturi and Hansen, 2008; Li and Zong, 2008).",
        "The use of n-grams is effective in capturing local dependencies of words, but tends to suffer from data sparseness problem in capturing long-distance dependencies since higher-order n-grams require large training data to obtain reliable estimation.",
        "For our task, the expressions of negative life events can be characterized by association language patterns, i.e., meaningful combinations of words, such as <worry, children, health>, <break up, boyfriend>, <argue, friend>, <loss, job>, and",
        "Label Description Example Sentence <school, teacher, blame> in the example sentences in Table 1.",
        "Such language patterns are not necessarily composed of continuous words.",
        "Instead, they are usually composed of the words with long-distance dependencies, which cannot be easily captured by n-grams.",
        "Therefore, the aim of this study is two-fold: (1) to automatically discover association language patterns from the sentences annotated with negative life events; and (2) to classify sentences with negative life events using the discovered patterns.",
        "To discover association language patterns, we incorporate the measure mutual information (MI) into a data mining algorithm, called association pattern mining, to incrementally derive frequently co-occurred words in sentences (Section 2).",
        "The discovered patterns are then combined with single words as features to train classifiers for negative life event classification (Section 3).",
        "Experimental results are presented in Section 4.",
        "Conclusions are finally drawn in Section 5."

        "The problem of language pattern acquisition can be converted into the problem of association pattern mining, where each sales transaction in a database can be considered as a sentence in the corpora, and each item in a transaction denotes a word in a sentence.",
        "An association language pattern is defined herein as a combination of multiple associated words, denoted by < w1,...,wk > .",
        "Thus, the task of association pattern mining is to mine the language patterns of frequently associated words from the training sentences.",
        "For this purpose, we adopt the Apriori algorithm (Agrawal and Srikant, 1994) and modified it slightly to fit our application.",
        "Its basic concept is to identify frequent word sets recursively, and then generate association language patterns from the frequent word sets.",
        "For simplicity, only the combinations of nouns and verbs are considered, and the length is restricted to at most 4 words, i.e., 2-word, 3-word and 4-word combinations.",

        "First, the support of each word, i.e., word frequency, in the training corpus is counted.",

        "To calculate Lk , the following two-step process is performed iteratively until no more frequent k-word sets are found.",
        "• Join step: A set of candidate k-word sets, denoted as Ck, is first generated by merging frequent word sets of Lk-1, in which only the word sets whose first (k-2) words are identical can be merged.",
        "• Prune step: The support of each candidate word set in Ck is then counted to determine which candidate word sets are frequent.",
        "Finally, the candidate word sets with a support count greater than or equal to the minimum support are considered to form Lk .",

        "where P( w1,...wk ) denotes the probability of the k words co-occurring in a sentence in the training set, and P( wi ) denotes the probability of a single word occurring in the training set.",
        "Accordingly, each frequent word set in Lk is assigned a mutual information score.",
        "In order to generate a set of association language patterns, all frequent word sets are sorted in the descending order of the mutual information scores.",
