        "Therefore, we identified travel blogs in a blog database, and extracted travel information from them.",
        "Travel information in travel blogs is also useful for recommending information that is matched to the each traveler.",
        "Recently, several methods that identify bloggers' attributes such as residential area (Yasuda et al., 2006), gender, and age (Ikeda et al., 2008, Schler et al., 2006), have been proposed.",
        "By combining this research with travel information extracted from travel blogs, it is possible to recommend a local product that is popular among females, for example, or a travel spot, where young people often visit.",

        "The task of compiling travel information is divided into two steps: (1) identification of travel blogs and (2) extraction of travel information from them.",
        "We explain these steps in Sections 3.1 and 3.2.",
        "Blog entries that contain cue phrases, such as 'travel', 'sightseeing', or 'tour', have a high degree of probability of being travel blogs.",
        "However, not every travel blog contains such cue phrases.",
        "For example, if a blogger writes his/her journey to Norway in multiple blog entries, it might state We traveled to Norway' in the first entry, while only writing 'We ate wild sheep!'",
        "in the second entry.",
        "In this case, because the second entry does not contain any expressions related to travel, it is difficult to identify that the second entry is a travel blog.",
        "Therefore, we focus not only on each entry but also on its surrounding entries for the identification of travel blogs.",
        "We formulated the identification of travel blogs as a sequence-labeling problem, and solved it using machine learning.",
        "For the machine learning method, we examined the Conditional Random Fields (CRF) method, whose empirical success has been reported recently in the field of natural language processing.",
        "The CRF-based method identifies the class of each entry.",
        "Features and tags are given in the CRF method as follows: (1) the k tags occur before a target entry, (2) k features occur before a target entry, and (3) k features follow a target entry (see Figure 1).",
        "We used the value of k=4, which was determined in a pilot study.",
        "Here, we used the following features for machine learning: whether an entry contains each 416 cue phrase, such as 'ifftfx (travel)', 'y T – (tour)', and ' ft} IS (departure)', and the number of location names in each entry.",
