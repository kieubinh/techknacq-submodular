        "A collection of high quality data is resource-demanding regardless of the area of research and type of the data.",
        "This fact has encouraged a formulation of an alternative way of data collection, \"Games With a Purpose\" methodology (GWAP), (van Ahn and Dabbish, 2008).",
        "The GWAP methodology exploits the capacity of Internet users who like to play on-line games.",
        "The online games are being designed to generate data for applications that either have not been implemented yet, or have already been implemented with a performance lower than human.",
        "Moreover, the players work simply by playing the game - the data are generated as a by-product of the game.",
        "If the game is enjoyable, it brings human resources and saves financial resources.",
        "The game popularity brings more game sessions and thus more annotated data.",
        "The GWAP methodology was formulated in parallel with design and implementation of the on-line games with images (van Ahn and Dabbish, 2004) and subsequently with tunes (Law et al., 2007), in which the players try to agree on a caption of the image/tune.",
        "Lhe popularity of the games is enormous so the authors have succeeded in the basic requirement that the annotation is generated in a substantial amount.",
        "Lhen the Onto games appeared (Siorpaes and Hepp,",
        "'www.gwap.org",
        "2008), bringing a new type of input data to GWAP, namely video and text.",
        "Lhe situation with text seems to be slightly different.",
        "One has to read a text in order to identify its topics, which takes more time than observing images, and the longer text, the worse.",
        "Since the game must be of a dynamic character, it is unimaginable that the players will spend minutes reading an input text.",
        "Lherefore, the text must be opened to the players 'part' by 'part'.",
        "So far, besides the Onto games, two more games with texts have been designed: What did Shannon say?, the goal of which is to help the speech recognizer with difficult-to-recognize words, and Phrase Detectives (Kruschwitz, Chamberlain, Poesio, 2009), the goal of which is to identify relationships between words and phrases in a text.",
        "Motivated by the GWAP portal, the LGame portal has been established.",
        "Seven key properties that any game on the LGame portal will satisfy were formulated - see Lable 1.",
        "Lhe LGame portal has been opened with the Shannon game, a game of intentionally hidden words in the sentence, where players guess them, and the Place the Space game, a game of word segmentation.",
        "Within a systematic framework established at the LGame portal, the games PlayCoref, PlayNE, PlayDoc devoted to the linguistic phenomena dealing with the contents of documents, namely coreference, named-entitites, and document labels, respectively, are being designed in parallel but implemented subsequently since the GWAPs are open-ended stories the success of which is hard to estimate in advance.",
        "Lhese games are designed for Czech and English by default.",
        "However, the game rules are language independent.",
        "1.",
        "During the game, the data are collected for the natural language processing tasks that computers cannot solve at all or not well enough.",
        "2.",

        "7.",
        "The game offers several levels of difficulty (to fit a vast range of players).",
        "We have decided to implement the PlayCoref first.",
        "Coreference crosses the sentence boundaries and playing coreference offers a great opportunity to test players' willingness to read a text part by part, e.g. sentence by sentence.",

        "Motivation The PDT 2.0 coreference annotation (including the annotation scheme design, training of the annotators, technical and linguistic support, and annotation corrections) spanned the period from summer 2002 till autumn 2004.",
        "Each of two annotators annotated one half out of 3,165 documents.",
        "We are aware that coreferential pairs marked in the PlayCoref sessions may differ from the PDT 2.0 coreference annotation.",
        "However, the following estimates reinforce our motivation to use the GWAP technology on texts: assuming that (1) the PlayCoref is designed as a two-player game, (2) at least one document is being present in each session, (3) the session lasts up to 5 minutes and (4) the players play half an hour a day, then at least 6 documents will be processed a day by two players.",
        "This means that 3,165 documents will be annotated by two players in 528 days, by eight players in 132 days, by 32 players in 33 days etc., and by 128 players in 9 days.",
        "Strategy The game is designed for two players.",
        "The game starts with several first sentences of the document displayed in the players' sentence window.",
        "According to the restrictions put on the members of the coreferential pairs, parts of the text are unlocked while the other parts are locked.",
        "Only unlocked parts of the text are allowed to become a member of the coreferential pair.",
        "In our case, only nouns and selected pronouns are unlocked.In Table 2, we provide a list of the locked pronoun's sub-part-of-speech classes (as designed in the Czech positional tag system).",
        "Pronouns of the other sub-part-of-speech classes are unlocked.",
        "The selection of the locked pronoun's sub-part-of-speech classes is based on the fact that some types of pronouns usually corefer with parts of the text larger than one word.",
        "This type of coreference cannot be annotated without a linguistic knowledge and without training.",
        "Therefore it must be omitted for the purposes of the PlayCoref game.",
        "The players mark coreferential pairs between the unlocked words in the text (no phrases are allowed).",
        "They mark the coreferential pairs as undirected links.",
        "After the session, the coreference",
        "Table 2: List of the pronoun's sub-part-of-speech classes in the Czech positional tag system locked for the PlayCoref.",
        "chains are automatically reconstructed from the coreferential pairs marked.",
        "During the session, the number of words the opponent has linked into the coreferential pairs is displayed to the player.",
        "The number of sentences with at least one coreferential pair marked by the opponent is displayed to the player as well.",
        "Revealing more information about the opponent's actions would affect the independency of the players' decisions.",
        "If the player finishes pairing all the related words in a visible part of the document (visible to him), he asks for the next sentence of the document.",
        "It appears at the bottom of his sentence window.",
        "The player can remove pairs created before at any time and can make new pairs in the sentences read so far.",
        "The session goes on this way until the end of the session time.",
        "Instructions for the Players Instructions for the players must be as comprehensible and concise as possible.",
        "To mark a coreferential pair, no linguistic knowledge is required.",
        "It is all about the text comprehension ability.",
        "Input Texts In the first stage of the project, documents from PDT 2.0 and MUC-6 will be used in the sessions, so that the quality of the game data can be evaluated against the manual coreference annotation.",
        "Since the PDT 2.0 coreference annotation operates on the tectogrammatical layer and PlayCoref on the surface layer, the coreferential pairs of the t-layer must be projected to the surface first.",
        "The basic steps of the projection are depicted in Figure 1.",
        "Going from the t-layer, some of the coreferential pairs get lost because their members do not have their counterparts on surface.",
        "From the remaining coreferential pairs, those between nouns and unlocked pronouns are selected.",
        "In the final game documents, the difference between the grammatical, textual and extended textual coreference is omitted, because the players will not be asked to distinguish them.",
        "Table 3 shows the number of coreferential pairs in various stages of the projection.",
        "Figure 1: Projection of the PDT coreference annotation to the surface layer.",
        "The first step depicts the annotation of the extended textual coreference.",
        "Pairs that have no surface counterparts are marked DEEP, pairs with surface counterparts are marked SURF.",
        "Pairs suitable for the game are marked unlocked.",
        "Data from the coreference task on the sixth Message Understanding Conference can be used in a much more straightforward way.",
        "Coreference is annotated on the surface and no projection is needed.",
        "The links with noun phrases are disregarded.",
        "Table 3: Number of coreferential pairs (in thousands) in various stages of projection.",
        "Counts in the second, third and fourth columns are extrapolated on the basis of data annotated so far, which is about 200 thousand word tokens in 12 thousand sentences (out of 833 thousand tokens in 49 thousand sentences in PDT 2.0).",
        "Type of the coreferential pairs, either grammatical or textual one, is not distinguished.",
        "Scoring The players get points for their coreferential pairs according to the equation ptSA = w\\*ICA(A, acr)+W2*ICA(A, B) where A and B are the players, acr is an automatic coreference resolution procedure, weights 0 < W\\,W2 < 1, w\\,W2 G R are set empirically, and ICA stands for the inter-coder agreement that we can simultaneously express either by the F-measure or Krippen-",
