        "Treebanks are collections of manually-annotated syntactic analyses of sentences.",
        "They are primarily intended for building models for statistical parsing; however, they are often enriched for general natural language processing purposes.",
        "For Arabic, two important treebanking efforts exist: the Penn Arabic Treebank (PATB) (Maamouri et al., 2004) and the Prague Arabic Dependency Treebank (PADT) (Smrz and Hajic, 2006).",
        "In addition to syntactic annotations, both resources are annotated with rich morphological and semantic information such as full part-of-speech (POS) tags, lemmas, semantic roles, and diacritizations.",
        "This allows these treebanks to be used for training a variety of applications other than parsing, such as tokenization, diacritization, POS tagging, morphological disambiguation, base phrase chunking, and semantic role labeling.",
        "In this paper, we describe a new Arabic treebanking effort: the Columbia Arabic Treebank (CATiB).",
        "CATiB is motivated by the following three observations.",
        "First, as far as parsing Arabic research, much of the non-syntactic rich annotations are not used.",
        "For example, PATB has over 400 tags, but they are typically reduced to around 36 tags in training and testing parsers (Kulick et",
        "^his work was supported by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Contract No.",
        "HR0011-08-C-0110.",
        "al., 2006).",
        "The reduction addresses the fact that sub-tags indicating case and other similar features are essentially determined syntactically and are hard to automatically tag accurately.",
        "Second, under time restrictions, the creation of a treebank faces a tradeoff between linguistic richness and treebank size.",
        "The richer the annotations, the slower the annotation process, the smaller the resulting treebank.",
        "Obviously, bigger treebanks are desirable for building better parsers.",
        "Third, both PATB and PADT use complex syntactic representations that come from modern linguistic traditions that differ from Arabic's long history of syntactic studies.",
        "The use of these representations puts higher requirements on the kind of annotators to hire and the length of their initial training.",
        "CATiB contrasts with PATB and PADT in putting an emphasis on annotation speed for the specific task of parser training.",
        "Two basic ideas inspire the CATiB approach.",
        "First, CATiB avoids annotation of redundant linguistic information or information not targeted in current parsing research.",
        "For example, nominal case markers in Arabic have been shown to be automatically determinable from syntax and word morphology and needn't be manually annotated (Habash et al., 2007a).",
        "Also, phrasal co-indexation, empty pronouns, and full lemma disambiguation are not currently used in parsing research so we do not include them in CATiB.",
        "Second, CATiB uses a simple intuitive dependency representation and terminology inspired by Arabic's long tradition of syntactic studies.",
        "For example, CATiB relation labels include tamyiz (specification) and idafa (possessive construction) in addition to universal predicate-argument structure labels such as subject, object and modifier.",
        "These representation choices make it easier to train annotators without being restricted to hire people who have degrees in linguistics.",
        "This paper briefly describes CATiB's representation and annotation procedure, and reports on produced data, achieved inter-annotator agreement and annotation speeds."

        "CATiB uses the same basic tokenization scheme used by PATB and PADT.",
        "However, the CATiB POS tag set is much smaller than the PATB's.",
        "Whereas PATB uses over 400 tags specifying every aspect of Arabic word morphology such as definiteness, gender, number, person, mood, voice and case, CATiB uses 6 POS tags: NOM (non-proper nominals including nouns, pronouns, adjectives and adverbs), PROP (proper nouns), VRB (active-voice verbs), VRB-PASS (passive-voice verbs), PRT (particles such as prepositions or conjunctions) and PNX (punctuation).",
        "CATiB's dependency links are labeled with one of eight relation labels: SB J (subject of verb or topic of simple nominal sentence), OBJ (object of verb, preposition, or deverbal noun), TPC (topic in complex nominal sentences containing an explicit pronominal referent), PRD (predicate marking the complement of the extended cop-ular constructions for kAn l^lyilj jlTand An l^lyilj jl), IDF (relation between the possessor [dependent] to the possessed [head] in the idafa/possesive nominal construction), TMZ (relation of the specifier [dependent] to the specified [head] in the tamyiz/specification nominal constructions), MOD (general modifier of verbs or nouns), and – (marking flatness inside constructions such as first-last proper name sequences).",
        "This relation label set is much smaller than the twenty or so dashtags used in PATB to mark syntactic and semantic functions.",
        "No empty categories and no phrase co-indexation are made explicit.",
        "No semantic relations (such as time and place) are annotated.",

        "Although CATiB is independent of previous annotation projects, it builds on existing resources and lessons learned.",

        "We also use the TrEd annotation interface developed in coordination with the PADT.",

        "Annotators are hired on a part-time basis and are not required to be on-site.",
        "The annotation files are exchanged electronically.",
        "This arrangement allows more annotators to participate, and reduces logistical problems.",
        "However, having no full-time annotators limits the overall weekly annotation rate.",
        "Annotator training took about two months (150 hrs/annotator on average).",
        "This training time is much shorter than the PATB's six-month training period.",
        "Below, we describe our pipeline in some detail including the different resources we use.",
        "Data Preparation The data to annotate is split into batches of 3-5 documents each, with each document containing around 15-20 sentences (400-600 tokens).",
        "Each annotator works on one batch at a time.",
        "This procedure and the size of the batches was determined to be optimal for both the software and the annotators' productivity.",
