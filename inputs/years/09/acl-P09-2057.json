        "We select source-target sentence pairs (S,T) based on a ME classifier (Munteanu and Marcu, 2005).",
        "Because the set of target sentences T considered can be huge, previous work (Fung and Cheung, 2004; Resnik and Smith, 2003; Snover et al., 2008; Munteanu and Marcu, 2005) preselects target sentences T at the document level .",
        "We have reimplemented a particular filtering scheme based on BM25 (Quirk et al., 2007; Utiyama and Isahara, 2003; Robertson et al., 1995).",
        "In this paper, we demonstrate a different strategy .",
        "We compute the ME score incrementally at the word level and apply a beam-search algorithm to a large number of sentences.",
        "We abandon target sentences early on during classification if they fall outside the beam.",
        "For comparison purposes, we run our novel extraction algorithm with and without the document-level pre-filtering step.",
        "The results in Section 4 show that the number of extracted sentence pairs is more than doubled which also leads to an increase in BLEU by about 1 % on the Spanish-English data.",
        "The classification probability is defined as follows:",
        "where S = s{ is a source sentence of length J and T = t[ is a target sentence of length I. c £ {0,1} is a binary variable .",
        "p(c\\S, T) e [0,1] is a probability where a value p(c = 1\\S, T) close to 1.0 indicates that S and T are translations of each other.",
        "id £ 1\" is a weight vector obtained during training, /(c, S, T) is a feature vector where the features are co-indexed with respect to the alignment variable c. Finally, Z(S,T) is an appropriately chosen normalization constant.",
        "Section 2 summarizes the use of the binary classifier.",
        "Section 3 presents the beam-search algorithm.",
        "In Section 4, we show experimental results.",

        "1 is based on several real-valued feature functions fi .",
        "Their computation is based on the so-called IBM Model-1 (Brown et al., 1993).",
        "The Model-1 is trained on some parallel data available for a language pair, i.e. the data used to train the baseline systems in Section 4. p(s\\T) is the Model-1 probability assigned to a source word s given the target sentence T , p(t\\S) is defined accordingly.",
        "p(s\\t) and p(t\\s) are word translation probabilities obtained by two parallel Model-1 training steps on the same data, but swapping the role of source and target language.",
        "To compute these values efficiently, the implementation techniques in (Tillmann and Xu, 2009) are used.",
        "Coverage and fertility features are defined based on the Model-1 Viterbi alignment: a source word s is said to be covered if there is a target word t G T such that its probability is above a threshold e: p(s\\t) > e .",
        "We define the fertility of a source word s as the number of target words t G T for which p(s\\t) > e. Target word coverage and fertility are defined accordingly.",
        "A large number of 'uncovered' source and target positions as well as a large number of high fertility words indicate non-parallelism.",
        "We use the following N = 7 features: 1,2) lexical Model-1 weight-ing: J2s ~log{ p{s\\T) ) and £t -log{ p(t\\S) ), 3,4) number of uncovered source and target positions, 5,6) sum of source and target fertilities, 7) number of covered source and target positions .",
        "These features are defined in a way that they can be computed incrementally at the word level.",
        "Some thresholding is applied, e.g. a sequence of uncovered positions has to be at least 3 positions long to generate a non-zero feature value .",
        "In the feature vector f(c,S,T), each feature fa occurs potentially twice, once for each class c G {0,1}.",
        "For the feature vector /(c = 1, S, T), all the feature values corresponding to class c = 0 are set to 0, and vice versa.",
        "This particular way of defining the feature vector is needed for the search in Section 3: the contribution of the 'negative' features for c = 0 is only computed when Eq.",
        "1 is evaluated for the highest scoring final hypothesis in the beam.",
        "To train the classifier, we have manually annotated a collection of 524 sentence pairs .",

        "The Tight-weight' features defined in Section 2 are such that the matching score can be computed incrementally while processing the source and target sentence positions in some order.",

        "[ m , j = 1 , Uj = 0 , Ui = 0 ; 0 ] .",
        "During the left-to-right search , state transitions of the following type occur:",

        "Here, f(l,j,i) is a partial feature vector computed for all the additional source and target positions processed in the last extension step.",
        "The number of uncovered source and target positions u' is updated as well.",
        "The beam-search algorithm is carried out until all source positions j have been processed.",
        "We extract the highest scoring partial hypothesis from the final stack j = J .",
        "For that hypothesis, we compute a global feature vector f(l,S, T) by adding all the local f(l,j, i)'s component-wise.",
        "The 'negative' feature vector f{0,S,T) is computed from f{l,S,T) by copying its feature values.",
        "We then use Eq.",
        "1 to compute the probability p(l\\S, T) and apply a threshold of 6 = 0.75 to extract parallel sentence pairs.",
        "We have adjusted beam-search pruning techniques taken from regular SMT decoding (Tillmann et al., 1997; Koehn, 2004) to reduce the number of hypotheses after each extension step.",
        "Currently, only histogram pruning is employed to reduce the number of hypotheses in each stack.",
        "The resulting beam-search algorithm is similar to a monotone decoder for SMT: rather then incrementally generating a target translation, the decoder is used to select entire target sentences out of a predefined list.",
        "That way, our beam search algorithm is similar to algorithms in large-scale speech recognition (Ney, 1984; Vintsyuk, 1971), where an acoustic signal is matched to a preassigned list of words in the recognizer vocabulary."
