        "Word alignment is the process of identifying word-to-word links between parallel sentences.",
        "It is a fundamental and often a necessary step before linguistic knowledge acquisitions, such as training a phrase translation table in phrasal machine translation (MT) system (Koehn et al., 2003), or extracting hierarchial phrase rules or synchronized grammars in syntax-based translation framework.",
        "Most word alignment models distinguish translation direction in deriving word alignment matrix.",
        "Given a parallel sentence, word alignments in two directions are established first, and then they are combined as knowledge source for phrase training or rule extraction.",
        "This process is also called symmetrization.",
        "It is a common practice in most state of the art MT systems.",
        "Widely used alignment models, such as IBM Model serial (Brown et al., 1993) and HMM , all assume one-to-many alignments.",
        "Since many-to-many links are commonly observed in natural language, symmetrization is able to make up for this modeling limitation.",
        "On the other hand, combining two directional alignments practically can lead to improved performance.",
        "Symmetrization can also be realized during alignment model training (Liang et al., 2006; Zens et al., 2004).",
        "Given two sets of word alignments trained in two translation directions, two extreme combination are intersection and union.",
        "While intersection achieves high precision with low recall, union is the opposite.",
        "A right balance of these two extreme cases would offer a good coverage with reasonable accuracy.",
        "So starting from intersection, gradually adding elements in the union by heuristics is typically used.",
        "Koehn et al.",
        "(2003) grow the set of word links by appending neighboring points, while Och and Hey (2003) try to avoid both horizontal and vertical neighbors.",
        "These heuristic-based combination methods are not driven explicitly by the intended application of the resulting output.",
        "Ayan (2005) exploits many advanced machine learning techniques for general word alignment combination problem.",
        "However, human annotation is required for supervised training in those techniques.",
        "We propose a new combination method.",
        "Like heuristics, we aim to find a balance between intersection and union.",
        "But unlike heuristics, combination is carried out as an optimization process driven by an effectiveness function.",
        "We evaluate the impact of each alignment pair w.r.t.",
        "the target application, say phrase table training, and gradually add or remove the word link that currently can maximize the predicted benefit measured by the effectiveness function.",
        "More specifically, we consider the goal of word alignment combination is for phrase table training, and we directly motivate word alignment combination as a process of maximizing the number of phrase translations that can be extracted within a sentence pair."

        "Given a parallel sentence (e = e{,f = f(), a word link is represented by a pair of indices (i, j), which means that Foreign word fj is aligned with English word e^.",
        "The direction of word alignments is ignored.",
        "Since the goal of word alignment combination is for phrase table training, we first formally define a phrase translation.",
        "Provided with a set of static word alignments A, a phrase pair (eii' fjl) *s considered translation of each other if and only if there exists at least one word link between them and no cross phrase boundary links exist in A, i.e., for all (i, j) e A,i e 12} iff j € [ji, J2] • Notice that by this definition, it does not matter whether boundary words of the phrase pairs should be aligned or not.",
        "Let PPn(A) denote the set of phrase pairs that can be extracted with A where up to n boundary words are allowed to be not-aligned, i.e., aligned to empty word NULL.",
        "As can be imagined, increasing n would improve recall of phrase table but likely to hurt precision.",
        "For word alignment combination, we focus on the set with high accuracy where n = 0.",
        "Let Ai, A2 denote two sets of word alignments to be combined for the given sentence pair.",
        "For instance, Ai could be word alignments from English to foreign while A2 the other direction.",
        "On different setup, Ai could be Model-4 alignments, while A2 is from HMM.",

        "Its initial value is the difference between union and intersection.",
        "We assume that there is an effectiveness function g(-) which quantitatively measures the 'goodness' of a alignment set for the intended application.",
        "A higher number indicates a better alignment set.",
        "We use the function g to drive the process.",
        "Each time, we identify the best word link in the candidate set that can maximize the function g and append it to the current set A.",
        "This process is repeated until the candidate set is empty or adding any link in the set would lead to degradation.",
        "Finally (line 15 to 21), we pickup word links in the candidate set to align those uncovered words.",
        "This is applied to maximize coverage, which is similar as the 'final' in (Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "Again, we use the function g(-) to rank the word links in Ac and sequentially append them to A depending on current word coverage.",
        "The algorithm clearly is a greedy search procedure that maximizes the function g. Since we plan to take the combined word alignments for phrase translation training, a natural choice for",
        "g is the number of phrase pairs that can be extracted with the given alignment set.",
        "We choose g(A) = |PPo(A)|, where we only count phrase pairs that all boundary words are aligned.",
        "The reason of putting a tight constraint is to maintain phrase table accuracy while improving the coverage.",
        "By keeping track of the span of currently aligned words, we can have efficient implementation of the function g.",

        "4: while Ac / 0 do 6: if cur Max > total then 17: if ej is not aligned or /- is not aligned then",
        "Alternatively, the optimization can go in opposite direction.",
        "We start with the union A = Au, and gradually remove the worse word link = argmax(ij:?-)eAc g(A – that could maximize the effectiveness function.",
        "Similarly, this shrinking process is repeated until either candidate set is empty or removing any link in the candidate set would reduce the value of function g.",
        "Other choice of 'goodness' function g is possible.",
        "For instance, one could consider syntactic constraints, or weight phrase pairs differently according to their global co-occurrence.",
        "The basic idea is to implement the combination as an iterative customized optimization process that is driven by the application."

        "The task is to translate spoken Farsi into English.",
        "We decode reference transcription so recognition is not an issue.",
        "The training data was provided by the DARPA TransTac program.",
        "It consists of around 11 OK sentence pairs with 850K English words in the military force protection domain.",
        "We train IBM Model-4 using GIZA++ toolkit (Och and Ney, 2003) in two translation directions and perform different word alignment combination.",
        "The resulting alignment set is used to train a phrase translation table, where Farsi phrases are limited to up to 6 words.",
        "The quality of resulting phrase translation table is measured by translation results.",
        "Our decoder is a phrase-based multi-stack implementation of the log-linear model similar to Pharaoh (Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "Like other log-linear model based decoders, active features in our translation engine include translation models in two directions, lexicon weights in two directions, language model, lexi-calized reordering models, sentence length penalty and other heuristics.",
        "These feature weights are tuned on the dev set to achieve optimal translation performance evaluated by automatic metric.",
        "The language model is a statistical 4-gram model estimated with Modified Kneser-Ney smoothing (Chen and Goodman, 1996) using only English sentences in the parallel training data.",
        "We first study the impact of different word alignment combination methods on phrase translation table, and compare our approaches to heuristic based methods.",
        "The same English to Farsi and Farsi to English Model-4 word alignments are used, but we try different combination methods and analysis the final alignment set and the resulting phase translation table.",
        "Table 1 presents some statistics.",
        "Each row corresponds to a particular combination.",
        "The first two are intersection (I) and union (U).",
        "The next two methods are heuristic (H) in (Och and Ney, 2003) and grow-diagonal (GD) proposed in (Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "Our proposed methods are presented in the following two rows: one is optimization as an expanding process (OE), the other is optimization as an shrinking process (OS).",
        "In the last four rows, we add 'final' operation (line 15 to 21 in Algorithm 1).",
        "For each method, we calculate the output alignment set size as a percentage of the union (the 2nd column) and resulting phrase table (PPn( A)) size (in thousand) with different constrain on the maximum number of unaligned boundary words n = 0,1,2 (the next 3 columns).",
        "As we can see, the intersection has less than half of all word links in the pool.",
        "This implies the underlying word alignment quality leaves much room for improvements, mainly due to data sparseness.",
        "Not surprisingly, when relaxing unaligned boundary word number from 0 to 2, the phrase table size increases more than 7 times.",
        "This is the result of very low recall of word alignments, consequently the estimated phrase table PP2(A) has very low accuracy.",
        "Union suffers from the opposite problem: many incorrect word links prevent good phrase pairs from being extracted.",
        "The two heuristic methods and our proposed optimization approaches achieve somewhat a balance between I and U.",
        "By comparing size of PPo(A) (3rd column), optimization methods are able to identify much more phrase pairs with similar size of alignment set.",
        "This confirms that the new method is indeed moving to the desired direction of extracting as many accurate (all boundary words should be aligned) phrase pairs as possible.",
        "We still notice that ratio of |PP2(A)| and |PPo(A)| (the last column) is high.",
