        "A paraphrase generation system is a program which, given a source sentence, produces a different sentence with almost the same meaning.",
        "Paraphrase generation is useful in applications to choose between different forms to keep the most appropriate one.",
        "For instance, automatic summary can be seen as a particular paraphrasing task (Barzilay and Lee, 2003) with the aim of selecting the shortest paraphrase.",
        "Paraphrases can also be used to improve natural language processing (nlp) systems.",
        "(Callison-Burch et al., 2006) improved machine translations by augmenting the coverage of patterns that can be translated.",
        "Similarly, (Sekine, 2005) improved information retrieval based on pattern recognition by introducing paraphrase generation.",
        "In order to produce paraphrases, a promising approach is to see the paraphrase generation problem as a translation problem, where the target language is the same as the source language (Quirk et al., 2004; Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005).",
        "A problem that has drawn less attention is the generation step which corresponds to the decoding step in smt.",
        "Most paraphrase generation tools use some standard smt decoding algorithms (Quirk et al., 2004) or some off-the-shelf decoding tools like moses (Koehn et al., 2007).",
        "The goal of a decoder is to find the best path in the lattice produced from a paraphrase table.",
        "This is basically achieved by using dynamic programming and especially the Viterbi algorithm associated with beam searching.",
        "However decoding algorithms were designed for translation, not for paraphrase generation.",
        "Although left-to-right decoding is justified for translation, it may not be necessary for paraphrase generation.",
        "A paraphrase generation tool usually starts with a sentence which may be very similar to some potential solution.",
        "In other words, there is no need to \"translate\" all of the sentences.",
        "Moreover, decoding may not be suitable for non-contiguous transformation rules.",
        "In addition, dynamic programming imposes an incremental scoring function to evaluate the quality of each hypothesis.",
        "For instance, it cannot capture some scattered syntactical dependencies.",
        "Improving on this major issue is a key point to improve paraphrase generation systems.",
        "This paper first presents an alternative to decoding that is based on transformation rule application in section 2.",
        "In section 3 we propose a paraphrase generation method for this paradigm based on an algorithm used in two-player games.",
        "Section 4 briefly explain experimental context and its associated protocol for evaluation of the proposed system.",
        "We compare the proposed algorithm with a baseline system in section 5.",
        "Finally, in section 6, we point to future research tracks to improve paraphrase generation tools.",
        "2 Statistical paraphrase generation using transformation rules",
        "The paraphrase generation problem can be seen as an exploration problem.",
        "We seek the best paraphrase according to a scoring function in a space to search by applying successive transformations.",
        "This space is composed of states connected by actions.",
        "An action is a transformation rule with a place where it applies in the sentence.",
        "States are a sentence with a set of possible actions.",
        "Applying an action in a given state consists in transforming the sentence of the state and removing all rules that are no more applicable.",
        "In our framework, each state, except the root, can be a final state.",
        "This is modelised by adding a stop rule as a particular action.",
        "We impose the constraint that any transformed part of the source sentence cannot be transformed anymore.",
        "This paradigm is more approriate for paraphrase generation than the standard smt approach in respect to several points: there is no need for left-to-right decoding because a transformation can be applied anywhere without order; there is no need to transform the whole of a sentence because each state is a final state; there is no need to keep the identity transformation for each phrase in the paraphrase table; the only domain knowledge needed is a generative model and a scoring function for final states; it is possible to mix different generative models because a statistical paraphrase table, an analogical solver and a paraphrase memory for instance; there is no constraint on the scoring function because it only scores final states.",
        "Note that the branching factor with a paraphrase table can be around thousand actions per states which makes the generation problem a difficult computational problem.",
        "Hence we need an efficient generation algorithm."

        "uct (Kocsis and Szepesvari, 2006) {Upper Confidence bound applied to Tree) is a Monte-Carlo planning algorithm that have some interesting properties: it grows the search tree non-uniformly and favours the most promising sequences, without pruning branch; it can deal with high branching factor; it is an any-time algorithm and returns best solution found so far when interrupted; it does not require expert domain knowledge to evaluate states.",
        "These properties make it ideally suited for games with high branching factor and for which there is no strong evaluation function.",
        "For the same reasons, this algorithm sounds interesting for paraphrase generation.",
        "In particular, it does not put constraint on the scoring function.",
        "We propose a variation of the uct algorithm for paraphrase generation named mcpg for Monte-Carlo based Paraphrase Generation.",
        "The main part of the algorithm is the sampling step.",
        "An episode of this step is a sequence of states and actions, s\\, a\\, s2, ci2, ■ ■ ■, st, from the root state to a final state.",
        "During an episode construction, there are two ways to select the action a» to perfom from a state s».",
        "If the current state was already explored in a previous episode, the action is selected according to a compromise between exploration and exploitation.",
        "This compromise is computed using the ucb-Tunned formula (Auer et al., 2001) associated with the rave heuristic (Gelly and Silver, 2007).",
        "If the current state is explored for the first time, its score is estimated using Monte-Carlo sampling.",
        "In other word, to complete the episode, the actions e^, aj+i,..., ax-i, &t are selected randomly until a stop rule is drawn.",
        "At the end of each episode, a reward is computed for the final state St using a scoring function and the value of each (state, action) pair of the episode is updated.",
        "Then, the algorithm computes an other episode with the new values.",
        "Periodically, the sampling step is stopped and the best action at the root state is selected.",
        "This action is then definitely applied and a sampling is restarted from the new root state.",
        "The action sequence is built incrementally and selected after being enough sampled.",
        "For our experiments, we have chosen to stop sampling regularly after a fixed amount rj of episodes.",
        "Our main adaptation of the original algorithm is in the (state, action) value updating procedure.",
        "Since the goal of the algorithm is to maximise a scoring function, we use the maximum reachable score from a state as value instead of the score expectation.",
        "This algorithm suits the paradigm proposed for paraphrase generation."

        "It consists of European parliament debates.",

        "Note that the sentences in this corpus are long, with an average length of 30 words per French sentence and 27.1 for English.",
        "We randomly extracted 100 French sentences as a test corpus.",
        "Paraphrase generation tools based on smt methods need a language model and a paraphrase table.",
        "Both are computed on a training corpus.",
        "The language models we use are n-gram language models with back-off.",
        "We use srilm (Stol-cke, 2002) with its default parameters for this purpose.",
        "The length of the n-grams is five.",
        "To build a paraphrase table, we use the construction method via a pivot language proposed in (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005).",
        "Three heuristics are used to prune the paraphrase table.",
        "The first heuristic prunes any entry in the paraphrase table composed of tokens with a probability lower than a threshold e. The second, called pruning pivot heuristic, consists in deleting all pivot clusters larger than a threshold r. The last heuristic keeps only the n most probable paraphrases for each source phrase in the final paraphrase table.",
        "For this study, we empirically fix e = 10\", r = 200 and k = 10.",
        "We developed a dedicated website to allow the human judges with some flexibility in workplaces and evaluation periods.",
