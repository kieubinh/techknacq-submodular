        "Automatic story segmentation is an important precursor in processing audio or video streams in large information repositories.",
        "Very often, these continuous streams of data do not come with boundaries that segment them into semantically coherent units, or stories.",
        "The story unit is needed for a wide range of spoken language information retrieval tasks, such as topic tracking, clustering, indexing and retrieval.",
        "To perform automatic story segmentation, there are three categories of cues available: lexical cues from transcriptions, prosodic cues from the audio stream and video cues such as anchor face and color histograms.",
        "Among the three types of cues, lexical cues are the most generic since they can work on text and multimedia sources.",
        "Previous approaches include TextTiling (Hearst 1997) that monitors changes in sentence similarity, use of cue phrases (Reynar 1999) and Hidden Markov Models (Yamron 1998).",
        "In addition, the approach based on lexical chaining captures the content coherence by linking coherent lexical items (Morris and Hirst 1991, Hirst and St-Onge 1998).",
        "Stokes (2004) discovers boundaries by chaining up terms and locating instances of time where the count of chain starts and ends (boundary strength) achieves local maxima.",
        "Chan et al.",
        "(2007) enhanced this approach through statistical modeling of lexical chain starts and ends.",
        "We further extend this approach in two aspects: 1) a Bayesian decision framework is used; 2) chain continuations straddling across boundaries are taken into consideration and statistically modeled."

        "We form lexical chains from the TDT-2 ASR outputs by linking repeated words.",
        "Since words may also repeat across different stories, we limit the maximum distance between consecutive words within the lexical chain.",
        "This limit is optimized according to the approach in (Chan et al.",
        "2007) based on the training data.",
        "The optimal value is found to be 130.9sec for long programs.",
        "We make use of three lexical chain features: chain starts, continuations and ends.",
        "At the beginning of a story, new words are introduced more frequently and hence we observe many lexical chain starts.",
        "There is also tendency of many lexical chains ending before a story ends.",
        "As a result, there is a higher density of chain starts and ends in the proximity of a story boundary.",
        "Furthermore, there tends to be fewer chains straddling across a story boundary.",
        "Based on these characteristics of lexical chains, we devise a statistical framework for story segmentation by modeling the distribution of these lexical chain features near the story boundaries.",
        "Given an utterance boundary with the lexical chain feature, X, we compare the conditional probabilities of observing a boundary, B, or non-boundary, B, as",
        "P(B | X)> P(B | X).",
        "(1) where X is a single chain feature, which may be the chain start (S), chain continuation (C), or chain end (E).",
