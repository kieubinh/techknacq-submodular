        "One can use a stochastic morphological parser to do spelling checking and correction, and present spelling suggestions ranked with the parser output probabilities.",
        "We assume that a word is misspelled if the parser fails to return an analysis of the word.",

        "These characters may not be supported in some keyboards and message transfer protocols; thus people frequently use their nearest ASCII equivalents (c, g, i, o, s, u, respectively) instead of the correct forms, e.g., spelling nasilsin as nasilsin.",
        "Therefore, in addition to enumerating words in one edit distance, we also enumerate all the words from which the misspelled word can be obtained by replacing these special Turkish characters with their ASCII counterparts.",
        "For instance, for the word nasilsin, the alternative spellings nasilsin, nasilsin, and nasilsin will also be generated.",
        "Note that although the context is important for spelling correction, we use only unigrams.",
        "One can build a morpheme based language model to incorporate the context information.",
        "We also limited the edit distance to 1, but it is straightforward to allow longer edit distances.",
        "We can build a finite-state transducer to enumerate and represent efficiently all the valid and invalid word forms that can be obtained by these edit operations on a word.",

        "One of the reasons is that the transducer for the morphological parser is ambiguous and cannot be optimized for recognition in contrast to the word models.",
