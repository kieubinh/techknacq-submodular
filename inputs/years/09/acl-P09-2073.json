        "Recently, there is a growing interest in working with tree-structured data in different applications and domains such as computational biology and natural language processing.",
        "Moreover, many applications in computational linguistics require the computation of similarities over pair of syntactic or semantic trees.",
        "In this context, Tree Edit Distance (TED) has been widely used for many years.",
        "However, one of the main constraints of this method is to tune the cost of edit operations, which makes it difficult or sometimes very challenging in dealing with complex problems.",
        "In this paper, we propose an original method to estimate and optimize the operation costs in TED, applying the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm.",

        "Among many tree-based algorithms, Tree Edit Distance (TED) has offered many solutions for various NLP applications such as information retrieval, information extraction, similarity estimation and textual entailment.",
        "Tree edit distance is defined as the minimum costly set of basic operations transforming one tree to another.",
        "In common, TED approaches use an initial fixed cost for each operation.",
        "Generally, the initial assigned cost to each edit operation depends on the nature of nodes, applications and dataset.",
        "For example the probability of deleting a function word from a string is not the same as deleting a symbol in RNA structure.",
        "According to this fact, tree comparison may be affected by application and dataset.",
        "A solution to this problem is assigning the cost to each edit operation empirically or based on the expert knowledge and recommendation.",
        "These methods emerge a critical problem when the domain, field or application is new and the level of expertise and empirical knowledge is very limited.",
        "Other approaches towards this problem tried to learn a generative or discriminative probabilistic model (Bernard et al., 2008) from the data.",
        "One of the drawbacks of those approaches is that the cost values of edit operations are hidden behind the probabilistic model.",
        "Additionally, the cost can not be weighted or varied according to the tree context and node location.",
        "In order to overcome these drawbacks, we are proposing a stochastic method based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to estimate the cost of each edit operation based on the user defined application and dataset.",
        "A further advantage of the method, besides automatic learning of the operation costs, is to investigate the cost values in order to better understand how TED approaches the application and data in different domains.",
        "As for the experiments, we learn a model for recognizing textual entailment, based on TED, where the input is a pair of strings represented as syntactic dependency trees.",
        "Our results illustrate that optimizing the cost of each operation can dramatically affect the accuracy and achieve a better model for recognizing textual entailment."

        "Tree edit distance measure is a similarity metric for rooted ordered trees.",
        "Assuming that we have two rooted and ordered trees, it means that one node in each tree is assigned as a root and the children of each node are ordered.",
        "The edit operations on the nodes a and b between trees are defined as: Insertion (A – > a), Deletion (a – > A) and Substitution (a – > b).",
        "Each edit operation has an associated cost (denoted as 7(0, – > &)).",
        "An edit script on two trees is a sequence of edit operations changing a tree to another.",
        "Consequently, the cost of an edit script is the sum of the costs of its edit operations.",
        "Based on the main definition of this approach, TED is the cost of minimum cost edit script between two trees (Zhang and Shasha, 1989).",
        "In the classic TED, a cost value is assigned to each operation initially, and the distance is computed based on the initial cost values.",
        "Considering that the distance can vary in different domains and datasets, converging to an optimal set of values for operations is almost empirically impossible.",
        "In the following sections, we propose a method for estimating the optimum set of values for operation costs in TED algorithm.",
        "Our method is built on adapting the PSO optimization approach as a search process to automate the procedure of cost estimation."

        "In this algorithm each particle can learn from the experience of other particles in the same population (called swarm).",
        "In other words, each particle in the iterative search process would adjust its flying velocity as well as position not only based on its own acquaintance but also other particles' flying experience in the swarm.",
        "This algorithm has found efficient in solving a number of engineering problems.",
        "PSO is mainly built on the following equations.",
        "To be concise, for each particle at each iteration, the position Xi (Equation 1) and velocity Vi (Equation 2) is updated.",
        "Xu is the best position of the particle during its past routes and Xgi is the best global position over all routes travelled by the particles of the swarm, n and r2 are random variables drawn from a uniform distribution in the range [0,1], while c\\ and c2 are two acceleration constants regulating the relative velocities with respect to the best local and global positions.",

        "In order to obtain this, the system is developed using an optimization framework based on PSO.",
        "One of the most important steps in applying PSO is to define a fitness function, which could lead the swarm to the optimized particles based on the application and data.",
        "The choice of this function is very crucial since, based on this, PSO evaluates the quality of each candidate particle for driving the solution space to optimization.",
        "Moreover, this function should be, possibly, application and data independent, as well as flexible enough to be adapted to the TED based problems.",

        "Put it differently, maximizing the Bhattacharyya distance would increase the separability of two classes.",

        "The entailment function for the pair TH returns the true value when the meaning of H can be inferred from the meaning of T and false otherwise.",
        "In another word, Textual Entailment can be defined as human reading comprehension task.",
        "One of the approaches to textual entailment problem is based on the distance between T and H.",
        "In this approach, the entailment score for a pair is calculated on the minimal set of edit operations that transform T into H. An entailment relation is assigned to a TH pair in the case that overall cost of the transformations is below a certain threshold.",
        "The threshold, which corresponds to tree edit distace, is empirically estimated over the dataset.",
        "This method was implemented by (Kouylekov and Magnini, 2005), based on TED algorithm (Zhang and Shasha, 1989).",
        "Each RTE dataset includes its own development and test set, however, RTE-4 was released only as a test set and the data from RTE-1 to RTE-3 were exploited as development set for evaluating RTE-4 data.",
        "In order to deal with TED approach to textual entailment, we used EDITS package (Edit Distance Textual Entailment Suite) (Magnini et al., 2009).",
        "In addition, We partially exploit ISwarm-PSO package with some adaptations as an implementation of PSO algorithm.",
        "Each pair in the datasets converted to two syntactic dependency trees using Stanford statistical parser, developed in the Stanford university NLP group by (Klein and Manning, 2003).",
        "We conducted six different experiments in two sets on each RTE dataset.",
        "The costs were estimated on the training set, then we evaluate the estimated costs on the test set.",
        "In the first set of experiments, we set a simple cost scheme based on three operations.",
        "Implementing this cost scheme, we expect to optimize the cost of each edit operation without considering that the operation costs may vary based on different characteristics of a node, such as size, location or content.",
        "The results were obtained using: 1) The random cost assignment, 2) Assigning the cost based on the expertise knowledge and intuition (So called Intuitive), and 3) Automatic estimated and optimized cost for each operation.",
        "In the second case, we applied the same cost values which was used in EDITS by its developers (Magnini et al., 2009).",
        "In the second set of experiments, we tried to take advantage of an advanced cost scheme with more fine-grained operations to assign a weight to the edit operations based on the characteristics of the nodes (Magnini et al., 2009).",
        "For example if a node is in the list of stop-words, the deletion cost should be different from the cost of deleting a content word.",
