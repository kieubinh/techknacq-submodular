        "A fundamental problem that microplanners and surface realizers face in natural language generation is how to restrict the search space of possible solutions.",
        "A traditional solution to this computational complexity problem is to divide the generation process into tractable sub-problems, each represented as a module in a pipeline, where every decision made by a module restricts the number of options available to others further down the line.",
        "Though such pipeline architectures are computationally efficient, they severely restrict the flexibility of the system and the quality of the generated output.",
        "Most systems with pipeline architectures generate relatively simple, domain-specific output.",
        "Systems that produce more complex linguistic constructions typically achieve this by adding more modules to the pipeline (e.g. a revision module (Robin, 1994) or aggregation (Shaw, 2002)).",
        "Since complex linguistic constructions often require interaction between modules, adding them to the repertoire of pipelined NLG systems becomes an engineering and programming task.",
        "Integrated NLG systems have a simpler architecture because they do not need to model interactions between modules.",
        "However, they still face the problem of computational complexity that was originally solved by the pipeline model.",
        "Strategies that have been introduced to reduce the search space in integrated systems include greedy/incremental search algorithms (Stone et al., 2003), constructing a dependency graph for a flat semantic input and converting it into a derivation tree (Koller and Striegnitz, 2002), using planning algorithms (Appelt, 1985; Koller and Stone, 2007), polarity filtering (Kow, 2007) and using underspecified g-derivation trees (G-TAG, Danlos (2000)).",
        "Despite all these efforts, most systems still don't attempt to go above the sentence level or generate very complex sentences.",
        "In this paper we present a new technique for designing an integrated grammar for natural language generation.",
        "Using this technique it is possible to use linguistic constraints on referential coherence to automatically reduce the search space – which in turn makes it possible to generate longer and more coherent texts.",
        "First we extend the grammar of a surface realizer to produce complex, multi-sentential output.",
        "Then we add a representation for discourse referents to the grammar, inspired by Centering Theory's notion of a backward looking center and preferred center.",
        "Having done this, we show that by integrating discourse-level representations into a syntactic grammar we can extend an optimization technique – polarity filtering (Kow, 2007; Gar-dent and Kow, 2006) – from syntactic realization to the discourse level."

        "Centering Theory (Grosz et al., 1995) is a frequently used framework for modeling referential coherence in discourse.",
        "It is based on the notion that for each utterance in a discourse there is a set of entities which are the centers of attention and which serve to link that utterance to other utterances in the same discourse segment.",
        "Entities mentioned by an utterance (the set of forward looking centers) form a partially ordered list called the Cf list where roughly, subjects are ranked highest, followed by objects, indirect objects and other arguments or adjuncts.",
        "The backward looking center of Un is said to be the most highly ranked element on the Cf list of Un-1 mentioned in the previous utterance.",
        "Centering Theory has been adapted to NLG by Kibble (1999; 2001), and implemented in Kibble and Power (2004).",
        "Rather than using the notion of centering transitions as defined by Grosz et al.",
        "(1995), in these papers centering theory is redefined as constraints on salience and cohesion.",
        "These constraints state that there is a preference for consecutive utterances to keep the same center and that there is a preference for the center of Unto be realized as the highest ranked entity on the Cf list of Un.",
        "Kibble and Power (2004) show how these constraints can be used to drive text planning, sentence planning and pronominalization in an integrated fashion.",
        "Our approach is similar to Kibble and Power (2004) in that we don't use the concept of centering transitions.",
        "However, our method is more efficient in that Kibble and Power (2004) use centering transitions to rank the set of generated solutions (some of which are incoherent), whereas we encode centering constraints in elementary trees to reduce the search space of possible solutions before we start computing them."

        "The basic idea of polarity filtering is to associate elementary trees with a set of polarities.",
        "When these polarities don't 'cancel each other out', it means that it is not possible to combine the set of trees selected for a given input.",
        "This is a quick way to check whether the number of argument slots is the same as the number of potential arguments.",
        "For example, if the lexical selection consists of two trees for a given input, one of which provides an NP (-NP) and one of which expects two NPs (-2NP) then the sum of polarities will be NP and therefore the generator will not attempt to combine the trees.",
        "Values for polarities are defined as follows: every initial tree is assigned a cat polarity for each substitution node of category cat and a +cat polarity if its root node is of category cat.",
        "Auxiliary trees are assigned a - cat polarity for each substitution node only.",
