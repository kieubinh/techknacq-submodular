        "We introduce three data sets of true and lying texts collected for this purpose, and we show that automatic classification is a viable technique to distinguish between truth and falsehood as expressed in language.",
        "We also introduce a method for class-based feature analysis, which sheds some light on the features that are characteristic for deceptive text.",

      "text": [
        "The discrimination between truth and falsehood has received significant attention from fields as diverse as philosophy, psychology and sociology.",
        "Recent advances in computational linguistics motivate us to approach the recognition of deceptive language from a data-driven perspective, and attempt to identify the salient features of lying texts using natural language processing techniques.",
        "In this paper, we explore the applicability of computational approaches to the recognition of deceptive language.",
        "In particular, we investigate whether automatic classification techniques represent a viable approach to distinguish between truth and lies as expressed in written text.",
        "Although acoustic and other non-linguistic features were also found to be useful for this task (Hirschberg et al., 2005), we deliberately focus on written language, since it represents the type of data most frequently encountered on the Web (e.g., chats, forums) or in other collections of documents.",
        "Specifically, we try to answer the following two questions.",
        "First, are truthful and lying texts separable, and does this property hold for different datasets?",
        "To answer this question, we use three different data sets that we construct for this purpose - consisting of true and false short statements on three different topics - and attempt to automatically separate them using standard natural language processing techniques.",
        "Second, if truth and lies are separable, what are the distinctive features of deceptive texts?",
        "In answer to this second question, we attempt to identify some of the most salient features of lying texts, and analyse their occurrence in the three data sets.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "We first briefly review the related work, followed by a description of the three data sets that we constructed.",
        "Next, we present our experiments and results using automatic classification, and introduce a method for the analysis of salient features in deceptive texts.",
        "Lastly, we conclude with a discussion and directions for future work."

        "Very little work, if any, has been carried out on the automatic detection of deceptive language in written text.",
        "Most of the previous work has focused on the psychological or social aspects oflying, and there are only a few previous studies that have considered the linguistic aspects of falsehood.",
        "In psychology, it is worthwhile mentioning the study reported in (DePaulo et al., 2003), where more than 100 cues to deception are mentioned.",
        "However, only a few of them are linguistic in nature, as e.g., word and phrase repetitions, while most of the cues involve speaker's behavior, including facial expressions, eye shifts, etc.",
        "(Newman et al., 2003) also report on a psycholinguistic study, where they conduct a qualitative analysis of true and false stories by using word counting tools.",
        "Computational work includes the study of (Zhou et al., 2004), which studied linguistic cues for deception detection in the context oftext-based asynchronous computer mediated communication, and (Hirschberg et al., 2005) who focused on deception in speech using primarily acoustic and prosodic features.",

        "We focused on three different topics: opinions on abortion, opinions on death penalty, and feelings about the best friend.",
        "For each of these three topics an annotation task was defined using the Amazon Mechanical Turk service.",
        "For the first two topics (abortion and death penalty), we provided instructions that asked the contributors to imagine they were taking part in a debate, and had 10-15 minutes available to express their opinion about the topic.",

        "Next, they were asked to prepare a second brief speech expressing the opposite of their opinion, thus lying about their true beliefs about the topic.",
        "In both cases, the guidelines asked for at least 4-5 sentences and as many details as possible.",
        "For the third topic (best friend), the contributors were first asked to think about their best friend and describe the reasons for their friendship (including facts and anecdotes considered relevant for their relationship).",
        "Thus, in this case, they were asked to tell the truth about how they felt about their best friend.",

        "With two exceptions - two entries where the true and false statements were identical, which were removed from the data - all the other entries were found to be of good quality, and closely following our instructions."

        "No feature selection was performed, and stopwords were not removed.",
        "Table 2 shows the tenfold cross-validation results using the two classifiers.",

        "The results are shown in Table 3.",
        "Although below the in-topic performance, the average accuracy is still significantly higher than the 50% baseline, indicating that the learning process relies on clues specific to truth/deception, and it is not bound to a particular topic."

      "text": [
        "In order to gain a better understanding of the characteristics of deceptive text, we devised a method to calculate a score associated with a given class of words, as a measure of saliency for the given word class inside the collection of deceptive (or truthful) texts.",
        "Given a class of words C = [Wi,W2, â– â– -,WN }, we define the class coverage in the deceptive corpus D as the percentage of words from D belonging to the class C:",
        "CoverageD (C ) where FrequencyD(Wi) represents the total number of occurrences of word Wi inside the corpus D, and SizeD represents the total size (in words) ofthe corpus D.",

        "Frequency t (Wi)",
        "doverageT(C) = WiECSiZeT-",

        "DominanceD (C ) Coverage^, (C ) CoverageT(C)",
        "A dominance score close to 1 indicates a similar distribution of the words in the class C in both the deceptive and the truthful corpus.",
        "Instead, a score significantly higher than 1 indicates a class that is dominant in the deceptive corpus, and thus likely to be a characteristic of the texts in this corpus.",
        "Finally, a score significantly lower than 1 indicates a class that is dominant in the truthful corpus, and unlikely to appear in the deceptive corpus.",
        "We use the classes of words as defined in the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), which was developed as a resource for psycholinguistic analysis (Pennebaker and Francis, 1999).",
        "The 2001 version of LIWC includes about 2,200 words and word stems grouped into about 70 broad categories relevant to psychological processes (e.g., emotion, cognition).",
        "The LIWC lexicon has been validated by showing significant correlation between human ratings ofa large number of written texts and the rating obtained through LIWC-based analyses of the same texts.",
        "All the word classes from LIWC are ranked according to the dominance score calculated with formula 1, using a mix of all three data sets to create the D and T corpora.",
        "Those classes that have a high score are the classes that are dominant in deceptive text.",
        "The classes that have a small score are the classes that are dominant in truthful text and lack from deceptive text.",
        "Table 4 shows the top ranked classes along with their dominance score and a few sample words that belong to the given class and also appeared in the deceptive (truthful) texts.",
        "Interestingly, in both truthful and deceptive language, three of the top five dominant classes are related to humans.",
        "In deceptive texts however, the human-related word classes (you, other, huMANS) represent detachment from the self, as if trying not to have the own self involved in the lies.",
        "Instead, the classes of words that are closely connected to the self (I, friends, self) are lacking from deceptive text, being dominant instead in truthful statements, where the speaker is comfortable with identifying herself with the statements she makes.",

        "Instead, belief-oriented vocabulary (insight), such as believe, feel, think, is more frequently encountered in truthful statements, where the presence of the real truth does not require truth-related words for emphasis."
