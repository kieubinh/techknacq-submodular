        "When humans are employed in the process, producing such a large labeled corpora becomes time consuming and expensive.",
        "There comes the necessity of using automatic methods to align sentences with the intention to build extracts from abstracts.",

        "We feed these 5 types of labeled data into the learners of each of the supervised approaches: SVM, CRF, HMM, and MaxEnt.",
        "Then we extensively investigate the performance of the classifiers to label unseen sentences (from 25 topics of DUC-2007 data set) as summary or non-summary sentence.",

        "Using ROUGE Similarity Measures ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is an automatic tool to determine the quality of a summary using a collection of measures ROUGE-N (N=l,2,3,4), ROUGE-L, ROUGE-W and ROUGES which count the number of overlapping units such as n-gram, word-sequences, and word-pairs between the extract and the abstract summaries (Lin, 2004).",
        "We assume each individual document sentence as the extract summary and calculate its ROUGE similarity scores with the corresponding abstract summaries.",
        "Thus an average ROUGE score is assigned to each sentence in the document.",
        "We choose the top N sentences based on ROUGE scores to have the label +1 (summary sentences) and the rest to have the label – 1 (non-summary sentences).",
        "Basic Element (BE) Overlap Measure We extract BEs, the \"head-modifier-relation\" triples for the sentences in the document collection using BE package 1.0 distributed by ISI .",
        "The ranked list of BEs sorted according to their Likelihood Ratio (LR) scores contains important BEs at the top which may or may not be relevant to the abstract summary sentences.",
        "We filter those BEs by checking possible matches with an abstract sentence word or a related word.",
        "For each abstract sentence, we assign a score to every document sentence as the sum of its filtered BE scores divided by the number of BEs in the sentence.",
        "Thus, every abstract sentence contributes to the BE score of each document sentence and we select the top N sentences based on average BE scores to have the label +1 and the rest to have the label – 1.",
        "Syntactic Similarity Measure In order to calculate the syntactic similarity between the abstract sentence and the document sentence, we first parse the corresponding sentences into syntactic trees using Charniak parser (Charniak, 1999) and then we calculate the similarity between the two trees using the tree kernel (Collins and Duffy, 2001).",
        "We convert each parenthesis representation generated by Charniak parser to its corresponding tree and give the trees as input to the tree kernel functions for measuring the syntactic similarity.",
        "The tree kernel of two syntactic trees T\\ and T2 is actually the inner product of the two m-dimensional vectors, v{T\\) and f (T2):",
        "The TK (tree kernel) function gives the similarity score between the abstract sentence and the document sentence based on the syntactic structure.",
        "Each abstract sentence contributes a score to the document sentences and the top N sentences are selected to be annotated as +1 and the rest as – 1 based on the average of similarity scores.",
        "Semantic Similarity Measure Shallow semantic representations, bearing a more compact information, can prevent the sparseness of deep structural approaches and the weakness of BOW models (Moschitti et al., 2007).",
        "To experiment with semantic structures, we parse the corresponding sentences semantically using a Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) system like ASSERT.",
        "ASSERT is an automatic statistical semantic role tagger, that can annotate naturally occuring text with semantic arguments.",
        "We represent the annotated sentences using tree structures called semantic trees (ST).",
        "Thus, by calculating the similarity between STs, each document sentence gets a semantic similarity score corresponding to each abstract sentence and then the top N sentences are selected to be labeled as +1 and the rest as – 1 on the basis of average similarity scores.",
        "Extended String Subsequence Kernel (ESSK)",
        "Formally, ESSK is defined as follows (Hirao et al., 2004): d",
        "K (t-u) = l valSti^u^ ifm = l",
        "Here, K'm(ti,Uj) is defined below, ti and v,j are the nodes of T and U, respectively.",
        "Each node includes a word and its disambiguated sense.",
        "The function val(t, u) returns the number of attributes common to the given nodes t and u.",
        "Here A is the decay parameter for the number of skipped words.",
        "We choose A = 0.5 for this research.",

        "simessk(T, U) = Kessk(T, U) y/Ketak(T,T)Keaak(U,U)",

        "For HMM systems, we use Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) based method to rank the sentences (Carbonell et al., 1997).",

        "ESSK works as the best for HMM and Sem labeling performs the worst for all ROUGE scores.",
        "Synt and BE labeled HMMs perform almost similar whereas ROUGE labeled system is pretty close to that of ESSK.",
