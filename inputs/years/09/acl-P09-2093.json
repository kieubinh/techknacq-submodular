        "Event time argument detection is important to many NLP applications such as textual inference (Baral et al., 2005), multi-document text summarization (e.g. Barzilay e al., 2002), temporal event linking (e.g. Bethard et al., 2007; Chambers et al., 2007; Ji and Chen, 2009) and template based question answering (Ahn et al., 2006).",
        "It's a challenging task in particular because about half of the event instances don't include explicit time arguments.",
        "Various methods have been exploited to identify or infer the implicit time arguments (e.g. Filatova and Hovy, 2001; Mani et al., 2003; Lapata and Lascarides, 2006; Eidelman, 2008).",
        "Most of the prior work focused on the sentence level by clustering sentences into topics and ordering sentences on a time line.",
        "However, many sentences in news articles include multiple events with different time arguments.",
        "And it was not clear how the errors of topic clustering techniques affected the inference scheme.",
        "Therefore it will be valuable to design inference methods for more fine-grained events.",
        "In addition, in the previous approaches the linguistic evidences such as verb tense were mainly applied for inferring the exact dates of implicit time expressions.",
        "In this paper we are interested in those more challenging cases in which an event mention and all of its coreferential event mentions do not include any explicit or implicit time expressions; and therefore its time argument can only be predicted based on other related events even if they have different event types."

        "event: a specific occurrence involving participants.",
        "The 2005 ACE evaluation had 8 types of events, with 33 subtypes; for the purpose of this paper, we will treat these simply as 33 distinct event types.",

      "text": [
        "The events in a news document may contain a temporal or locative dimension, typical about an unfolding situation.",
        "Various situations are evolving, updated, repeated and corrected in different event mentions.",
        "Here later information may override earlier more tentative or incomplete events.",
        "As a result, different events with particular types tend to occur together frequently, for example, the chains of \"Conflict-^Life-Die/Life-Injure\" and \"Justice-Convict Justice-Charge-Indict/Justice-Trial-Hearing\" often appear within one document.",
        "To avoid redundancy, the news writers rarely provide time arguments for all of these events.",
        "Therefore, it's possible to recover the time argument of an event by gleaning knowledge from its related events, especially if they are involved in a pre-cursor/consequence or causal relation.",
        "We present two examples as follows.",
        "For example, we can propagate the time \"Sunday (normalized into \"2003-04-06\")\" from a \"Conflict-Attack\" EMi to a \"Life-Die\" EMj because",
        "they both involve \"Kurdish/Kurds\": [Sentence including EM]",
        "Injured Russian diplomats and a convoy of America's Kurdish comrades in arms were among unintended victims caught in crossfire and friendly fire Sunday.",
        "[Sentence including EMj] Kurds said 18 of their own died in the mistaken U.S. air strike.",
        "This kind of propagation can also be applied between two events with similar event types.",
        "For example, in the following we can propagate \"Saturday\" from a \"Justice-Convict\" event to a \"Justice-Sentence\" event because they both involve arguments \"A state security court/state\" and \"newspaper/Monitor\": [Sentence including EM] A state security court suspended a newspaper critical of the government Saturday after convicting it of publishing religiously inflammatory material.",
        "[Sentence including EMj]",
        "The sentence was the latest in a series of state actions against the Monitor, the only English language daily in Sudan and a leading critic of conditions in the south of the country, where a civil war has been waged for 20 years."

        "For example, in a \"Conflict-Attack\" event, \"Attacker\" and \"Target\" are more important than \"Person\" to indicate the event time.",
