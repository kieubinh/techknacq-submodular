        "The metonymic adage in (1) is a classical example.",
        "Here the pen stands for the press and the sword for military power.",
        "In the following example Bach is used to refer to the composer's music and in (3) the glass stands for its content, i.e. the actual drink (beverage).",
        "The sentences (4) and (5) represent a variation of this phenomenon called logical metonymy.",
        "Here both the book and three martinis have even-tive interpretations, i.e. the noun phrases stand for the events of reading the book and drinking three martinis respectively.",
        "Such behaviour is triggered by the type requirements the verb (or the preposition) places onto its argument.",
        "This is known in linguistics as a phenomenon of type coercion.",
        "Many existing approaches to logical metonymy explain systematic syntactic ambiguity of metonymic verbs (such as enjoy) or prepositions (such as after) by means of type coercion (Pustejovsky, 1991; Pustejovsky, 1995; Briscoe et al., 1990; Verspoor, 1997; Godard and Jayez, 1993).",
        "Logical metonymy occurs in natural language texts relatively frequently.",
        "Therefore, its automatic interpretation would significantly facilitate the task of many NLP applications that require semantic processing (e.g., machine translation, information extraction, question answering and many others).",

        "Given a verb-object métonymie phrase, such as read Shakespeare, they searched for entities the object could stand for, such as plays of Shakespeare.",
        "They considered all the nouns co-occurring with the object noun and the Japanese equivalent of the preposition of.",
        "Utiyama and his colleagues tested their approach on 75 métonymie phrases taken from the literature and reported a precision of 70.6%, whereby an interpretation was considered correct if it made sense in some imaginary context.",
        "Lapata and Lascarides (2003) extend Utiyama's approach to interpretation of logical metonymies containing aspectual verbs (e.g. begin the book) and polysemous adjectives (e.g. good meal vs. good cook).",
        "Their method generates a list of interpretations with their likelihood derived from a corpus.",
        "Lapata and Lascarides define an interpretation of logical metonymy as a verb string, which is ambiguous with respect to word sense.",
        "Some of these strings indeed correspond to paraphrases that a human would give for the métonymie phrase.",
        "But they are not meaningful as such for automatic processing, since their senses still need to be disambiguated in order to obtain the actual meaning.",
        "For example, compare the grab sense of take vs. its film sense for the métonymie phrase finish video.",
        "It is obvious that only the latter sense is a correct interpretation.",
        "We extend the experiment of Lapata and Lascarides by disambiguating the interpretations with respect to WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) synsets (for verb-object métonymie phrases).",
        "We propose a novel ranking scheme for the synsets using a non-disambiguated corpus, address the issue of sense frequency distribution and utilize information from WordNet glosses to refine the ranking.",
        "We conduct and experiment to show that our representation of a métonymie interpretation as a synset is intuitive to human subjects.",
        "In the discussion section we provide an overview of the constraints on logical metonymy pointed out in linguistics literature, as well as proposing some additional constraints (e.g. on the type of the métonymie verb, on the type of the reconstructed event, etc.)"

        "Some of the accounts along with our own analysis are presented below.",
        "The interpretation of logical metonymy is often explained by the lexical defaults associated with the noun complement in the métonymie phrase.",
        "Pustejovsky (1991) models these lexical defaults in the form of the qualia structure of the noun.",
        "The qualia structure of a noun specifies the following aspects of its meaning:",
        "and Lascarides.",
        "Their model does not take into account raising syntactic frame and as such its interpretation of raising métonymie phrases will be based on the wrong kind of corpus evidence.",
        "Our expectation, however, is that control verbs tend to form logical metonymies more frequently.",
        "By analyzing the lists of control and raising verbs compiled by Boguraev and Briscoe (1987) we found evidence supporting this claim.",
        "Only 20% of raising verbs can form métonymie constructions (e.g. expect, allow, command, request, require etc.",
        "), while others can not (e.g. appear, seem, consider etc.).",
        "Due to both this and the fact that we build on the approach of Lapata and Lascarides (2003), we gave preference to control verbs to develop and test our system.",
        "• Activity vs. result.",
        "Some métonymie verbs require the reconstructed event to be an activity (e.g. begin writing the book), while others require a result (e.g. attempt to reach the peak).",
        "This distinction potentially allows to rule out some incorrect interpretations, e.g. a resultative find for enjoy book, as enjoy requires an event of the type activity.",
        "Automating this would be an interesting route for extension of our experiment.",
        "• Telic vs. agentive vs. other events.",
        "Another interesting observation we made captures the constraints that the métonymie verb imposes on the reconstructed event in terms of its function.",
        "While some métonymie verbs require rather telic events (e.g., enjoy, want, try), others have strong preference for agentive (e.g., start).",
        "However, for some categories of verbs it is hard to define a particular type of the event they require (e.g., attempt the peak should be interpreted as attempt to reach the peak, which is neither telic nor agentive)."

        "We presented a system producing disambiguated interpretations of logical metonymy with respect to word sense.",
        "Such representation is novel and it is intuitive to humans, as demonstrated by the human experiment.",
        "We also proposed a novel scheme for estimating the likelihood of a WordNet synset as a unit from a non-disambiguated corpus.",
        "The obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to deriving metonymic interpretations.",
        "Along with this we provided criteria for discriminating between different metonymic verbs with respect to their effect on the interpretation of logical metonymy.",
        "Our empirical analysis has shown that control verbs tend to form logical metonymy more frequently than raising verbs, as well as that the former comply with the model of Lapata and Lascarides (2003), whereas the latter form logical metonymies based on a different syntactic frame.",
        "Incorporating such linguistic knowledge into the model would be an interesting extension of this experiment.",
        "One of the motivations of the proposed sense-based representation is the fact that the interpretations of metonymic phrases tend to form coherent semantic classes (Pustejovsky, 1991; Puste-jovsky, 1995; Godard and Jayez, 1993).",
        "The automatic discovery of such classes would require word sense disambiguation as an initial step.",
        "This is due to the fact that it is verb senses that form the classes rather than verb strings.",
        "Comparing the interpretations obtained for the phrase finish video, one can clearly distinguish between the meaning pertaining to the creation of the video, e.g., film, shoot, take, and those denoting using the video, e.g., watch, view, see.",
        "Discovering such classes using the existing verb clustering techniques is our next experiment.",
        "Using sense-based interpretations of logical metonymy as opposed to ambiguous verbs could benefit other NLP applications that rely on disambiguated text (e.g. for the tasks of information retrieval (Voorhees, 1998) and question answering (Paşca and Harabagiu, 2001))."
