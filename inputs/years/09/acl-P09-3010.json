        "One of the main open issues is the annotation of the so-called \"blended\" emotions and their recognition.",
        "Usually, there is a low agreement among raters in annotating emotions and, surprisingly, emotion recognition is higher in a condition of modality deprivation (i. e. only acoustic or only visual modality vs. bimodal display of emotion).",

        "From the output values of these indexes a general recognition of each emotion arousal is allowed.",
        "After this selection we will annotate emotive interactions with our multimodal annotation scheme, performing a kappa statistic on annotation results to validate our coding scheme.",

        "In the last years many multimodal corpora have been collected.",
        "These corpora have been recorded in several languages and have being elicited with different methodologies: acted (such as for emotion corpora, see for example Goeleven, 2008), task oriented corpora, multiparty dialogs, corpora elicited with scripts or storytelling and ecological corpora.",
        "Among the goals of collection and analysis of corpora there is shading light on crucial aspects of speech production.",
        "Some of the main research questions are how language and gesture correlate with each other (Kipp et al., 2006) and how emotion expression modifies speech (Magno",
        "Caldognetto et al., 2004) and gesture (Poggi, 2007).",
        "Moreover, great efforts have been done to analyze multimodal aspects of irony, persuasion or motivation.",
        "Multimodal coding schemes are mainly focused on dialogue acts, topic segmentation and the so called \"emotional area\".",
        "The collection of multimodal data has raised the question of coding scheme reliability.",
        "The aim of testing coding scheme reliability is to assess whether a scheme is able to capture observable reality and allows some generalizations.",
        "From mid Nineties, the kappa statistic has begun to be applied to validate coding scheme reliability.",
        "Basically, the kappa statistic is a statistical method to assess agreement among a group of observers.",
        "Kappa has been used to validate some multimodal coding schemes too.",
        "However, up to now many multimodal coding schemes have a very low kappa score (Carletta, 2007, Douglas-Cowie et al., 2005; Pianesi et al., 2005, Reidsma et al., 2008).",
        "This could be due to the nature of multimodal data.",
        "In fact, annotation of mental and emotional states of mind is a very demanding task.",
        "The low annotation agreement which affects multimodal corpora validation could also be due to the nature of the kappa statistics.",
        "In fact, the assumption underlining the use of kappa as reliability measure is that coding scheme categories are mutually exclusive and equally distinct one another.",
        "This is clearly difficult to be obtained in multimodal corpora annotation, as communication channels (i.e. voice, face movements, gestures and posture) are deeply interconnected one another.",
        "To overcome these limits we are collecting a new corpus, Rovereto Emotive Corpus (REC), a task oriented corpus with psychophysiological data registered and aligned with audiovisual data.",
        "In our opinion this corpus will allow to clearly identify emotions and, as a result, having a clearer idea of facial expression of emotions in dialogue.",
        "In fact, REC is created to shade light on the relationship between cooperation and emotions in dialogues.",
        "This resource is the first up to now with audiovisual and psychophysio-logical data recorded together."

        "REC (Rovereto Emotive Corpus) is an audiovisual and psychophysiological corpus of dialogues elicited with a modified Map Task.",
        "The Map Task is a cooperative task involving two participants.",
        "It was used for the first time by the HCRC group at Edinburg University (Anderson et al., 1991).",
        "In this task two speakers sit opposite one another and each of them has a map.",
        "They cannot see each other's map because the they are separated by a short barrier.",
        "One speaker, designated the Instruction Giver, has a route marked on her map; the other speaker, the Instruction Follower, has no route.",
        "The speakers are told that their goal is to reproduce the Instruction Giver's route on the Instruction Follower's map.",
        "To the speakers are told explicitly that the maps are not identical at the beginning of the dialogue session.",
        "However, it is up to them to discover how the two maps differ.",
        "Our map task is modified with respect to the original one.",
        "In our Map Task the two participants are sitting one in front of the other and are separated by a short barrier or a full screen.",
        "They both have a map with some objects.",
        "Some of them are in the same position and with the same name, but most of them are in different positions or have names that sound similar to each other (e. g. Maso Michelini vs. Maso Nichelini, see Fig. 1).",
        "One participant (the giver) must drive the other participant (the follower) from a starting point (the bus station) to the finish (the Castle).",
        "Figure 1 : Maps used in the recording of REC corpus",
        "Giver and follower are both native Italian speakers.",
        "In the instructions it was told them that they will have no more than 20 minutes to accomplish the task.",
        "The interaction has two conditions: screen and no screen.",
        "In screen condition a barrier was present between the two speakers.",
        "In no screen condition a short barrier, as in the original map task, was placed allowing giver and follower to see each other's face.",
        "With these two conditions we want to test whether seeing the speakers face during interactions influences facial emotion display and cooperation (see Kendon, 1967; Ar-gyle and Cook 1976; for the relationship between gaze/no gaze and facial displays; for the influence of gaze on cooperation and coordination see Brennan et al., 2008).",
        "A further condition, emotion elicitation, was added.",
        "In \"emotion\" condition the follower or the giver can alternatively be a confederate, with the aim of getting the other participant angry.",
        "In this condition the psycho-physiological state of the confederate is not recorded.",
        "In fact, as it is an acted behavior, it is not interesting for research purpose.",
        "All the participants had given informed consent and the experimental protocol has been approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of Trento University.",
        "REC is by now made up of 17 dyadic interactions, 9 with confederate, for a total of 204 minutes of audiovisual and psychophysiological recordings (electrocardiogram and derived heart rate value, and skin conductance).",
        "Our goal is reaching 12 recordings in the confederate condition.",
        "During each dialogue, the psychophysiologi-cal state of non-confederate giver or follower is recorded and synchronized with video and audio recordings.",
        "So far, REC corpus is the only multimodal corpus which has psychophysiological data to assess emotive states.",
        "The psychophysiological state of each participant has been recorded with a BIOPAC MP150 system.",
        "In particular, Electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded by Ag AgC1 surface electrodes fixed on participant's wrists, low pass filter 100 Hz, at a 200 samples/second rate.",
        "Heart Rate (HR) has been automatic calculated as number of heart beats per minute.",
        "Galvanic Skin Conductance (SK) was recorded with Ag AgC1 electrodes attached to the palmar surface of the second and third fingers of the non dominant hand, and recorded at a rate of 200samples/second.",
        "Artefacts due to hand movements have been removed with proper algorithms.",
        "Audiovisual interactions are recorded with 2 Canon Digital Cameras and 2 free field Sennheiser half-cardioid microphones with permanently polarized condenser, placed in front of each speaker",
        "The recording procedure of REC is the following.",
        "Before starting the task, we record baseline condition that is to say we record participants' psychophysiological outputs for 5 minutes without challenging them.",
        "Then the task started and we recorded the psychophysiological outputs during the interaction which we called task condition.",
        "Then the confederate started challenging the speaker with the aim of getting him/her angry.",
        "To do so, the confederate at minutes 4, 9 and 13 of the interaction plays a script (negative emotion elicitation in giver; Anderson et al., 2005):",
        "•You driving me in the wrong direction, try to be more accurate!",
        "\";",
        "• \"It's still wrong, this can't be your best, try harder!",
        "So, again, from where you stop \";",
        "• \"You're obviously not good enough in giving instruction\".",
        "In Fig. 2 we show the results of a 1x5 ANOVA executed in confederate condition.",
        "Heart rate (HR) is confronted over the five times of interest (baseline, task, after 4 minutes, after 9 minutes, after 13 minutes).",
        "The times of interest are baseline, task, and after 4, 9 and 13 minutes, that is to say just after emotion elicitation with the script.",
        "We find that HR is significantly different in the five conditions, which means that the procedure to elicit emotions is incremental and allows recognition of different psychophysiological states, which in turns are linked to emotive states.",
        "Mean HR values are in line with the ones showed by Anderson et al.",
        "(2005).",
        "Moreover, from the inspection of skin conductance values (Fig.",
        "3) there is a linear increase of the number of peaks of conductance over time.",
        "This can be due to two factors: emotion elicitation but also an increasing of task difficulty leading to higher stress and therefore to an increasing number of skin conductance peaks.",
        "As Cacioppo et al.",
        "(2000) pointed out, it is not possible to assess the emotion typology from psychophysiological data alone.",
        "In fact, HR and skin conductance are signals of arousal which in turns can be due both to high arousal emotions such as happiness or anger.",
        "Therefore, we asked participants after the conclusion of the task to report on a 8 points rank scale the valence of the emotions felt towards the interlocutor during the task (from extremely positive to extremely negative).",
        "On 10 participants, 50% of them rated the experience as quite negative, 30% rated the experience as almost negative, 10% of participants rated it as negative and 10% as neutral.",

      "heading": "3. Annotation Method and Coding Scheme",
      "text": [
        "The emotion annotation coding scheme used to analyze our map task is quite far from the emotion annotation schemes proposed in Computational Linguistic literature.",
        "Craggs and Woods (2005) proposed to annotate emotions with a scheme where emotions are expressed at different blending levels (i. e. blending of different emotion and emotive levels).",
        "In Craggs and Woods opinions' annotators must label the given emotion with a main emotive term (e. g. anger, sadness, joy etc.)",
        "correcting the emotional state with a score ranging from 1 (low) to 5 (very high).",
        "Martin et al.",
        "(2006) used a three steps rank scale of emotion valence (positive, neutral and negative) to annotate their corpus recorded from TV interviews.",
        "But both these methods had quite poor results in terms of annotation agreement among coders.",
        "Several studies on emotions have shown how emotional words and their connected concepts influence emotion judgments and their labeling (for a review, see Feldman Barrett et al., 2007).",
        "Thus, labeling an emotive display (e. g. a voice or a face) with a single emotive term could be not the best solution to recognize an emotion.",
        "Moreover researchers on emotion recognition from face displays find that some emotions as anger or fear are discriminated only by mouth or eyes configurations.",
        "Face seems to be evolved to transmit orthogonal signals, with a lower correlation each other.",
        "Then, these signals are deconstructed by the \"human filtering functions\", i. e. the brain, as optimized inputs (Smith et al., 2005).",
        "The Facial Action Units (FACS, Ekman and Friesen, 1978) is a good scheme to annotate face expressions starting from movement of muscular units, called action units.",
        "Even if accurate, it is a little problematic to annotate facial expression, especially the mouth ones, when the subject to be annotated is speaking, as the muscular movements for speech production overlaps with the emotional configuration.",
        "On the basis of such findings, an ongoing debate is whether the perception of a face and, specifically, of a face displaying emotions, is based on holistic perception or perception of parts.",
        "Although many efforts are ongoing in neuroscience to determine the basis of emotion perception and decoding, little is still known on how brains and computer might learn part of an object such as a face.",
        "Most of the research in this field is based on PCA-alike algorithms which learn holistic representations.",
        "On the contrary other methods such as non Negative Matrix Factorization are based on only positive constrains leading to part based additive representations.",
        "Keeping this in mind, we decide not to label emotions directly but to attribute valence and activation to nonverbal signals, \"deconstructing\" them in simpler elements.",
        "These elements have implicit emotive dimensions, as for example mouth shape.",
        "Thus, in our coding scheme a smile would be annotate as \")\" and a large smile as \"+)\".",
        "The latter means a higher valence and arousal than the previous signal, as when the speaker is laughing.",
        "In the following, we describe the modalities and the annotation features of our multimodal annotation scheme.",
        "As an example, the analysis of emotive labial movements implemented in our annotation scheme is based on a little amount of signs similar to emoticons.",
        "We sign two levels of activation using the plus and minus signs.",
        "So, annotation values for mouth shape are:",
        "•o open lips when the mouth is open; •- closed lips when the mouth is closed; • ) corners up e.g. when smiling; +) open smile;",
        "•( corners down; +( corners very down",
        "•lcornerup for asymmetric smile;",
        "•O protruded, when the lips are rounded.",
        "Similar signals are used to annotate eyebrows shape.",
        "The approach we have used to analyze cooperation in dialogue task is mainly based on Bethan Davies model (Bethan Davies, 2006).",
        "The basic coded unit is the \"move\", which means individual linguistic choices to successfully fulfill Map Task.",
        "The idea of evaluating utterance choices in relation to task success can be traced back to Anderson and Boyle (1994) who linked utterance choices to the accuracy of the route performed on the map.",
        "Bethan Davies extended the meaning of \"move\" to the goal evaluation, from a narrow set of indicators to a sort of data-driven set.",
        "In particular, Bethan Davies stressed some useful points for the computation of collaboration between two communicative partners:",
        "•social needs of dialogue: there is a minimum \"effort\" needed to keep the conversation going.",
        "It includes minimal answers like \"yes\" or \"no\" and feedbacks.",
        "These brief utterances are classified by Bethan Davies (following Traum, 1994) as low effort, as they do not require much planning to the overall dialogue and to the joint task; •responsibility of supplying the needs of the communication partner: to keep an utterance going, one of the speakers can provide follow-ups which take more consideration of the partner's intentions and goals in the task performance.",
        "This involves longer utterances, and of course a larger effort; •responsibility of maintaining a known track of communication or starting a new one: there is an effort in considering the actions of a speaker within the context of a particular goal: that is, they mainly deal with situations where a speaker is reacting to the instruction or question offered by the other participant, rather than moving the discourse on another goal.",
        "In fact the latter",
        "is perceived as a great effort as it involves reasoning about the task as a whole, beside planning and producing a particular utterance.",
        "Following Traum (1994), speakers tend to engage in lower effort behaviors than higher ones.",
        "Thus, if you do not answer to a question, the conversation will end, but you can choose whether or not to query an instruction or offer a suggestion about what to do next.",
        "This is reflected in a weighting system where behaviors account for the effort invested and provides a basis for the empirical testing of dialogue principles.",
        "The use of this system provides a positive and negative score for each dialogue move.",
        "We slightly simplified the Bethan Davies' weighting system and propose a system giving positive and negative weights in an ordinal scale from +2 to -2.",
        "We also attribute a weight of 0 for actions which are in the area of \"minimum social needs\" of dialogue.",
        "In Table 1 we report some of the dialogue moves, called cooperation type, and the corresponding cooperation weighting level.",
        "There is also a description of different type of moves in terms of Grice's conversational rules breaking or following.",
        "Due to the nature of the map task, where giver and a follower have different dialogue roles, we have two slightly different versions of the cooperation annotation scheme.",
        "For example \"giving instruction\" is present only when annotating the giver cooperation.",
        "On the other hand \"feedback\" is present in both annotation schemes.",
        "Other communicative collaboration indexes we codify in our coding scheme are the presence or absence of eye contact through gaze direction (to the interlocutor, to the map, unfocused), even in full screen condition, where the two speakers can't see each other.",
        "Dialogue turns management (turn giving, turn offering, turn taking, turn yielding, turn concluding, and feedback) has been annotated as well.",
        "Video clips have been orthographically transcribed.",
        "To do so, we adopted a subset of the conventions applied to the transcription of the speech corpus of the LUNA project corpus annotation (see Rodriguez et al., 2007).",
        "Up to now we have annotated 9 emotive tokens of an average length of 100 seconds each.",
        "They have been annotated with the coding scheme previously described by 6 annotators.",
        "Our coding scheme has been implemented into ANVIL software (Kipp, 2001).",
        "A Fleiss' kappa statistic (Fleiss, 1971) has been performed on the annotations.",
        "We choose Fleiss' kappa as it is the suitable statistics when chance agreement is calculated on more than two coders.",
        "In this case the agreement is expected on the basis of a single distribution reflecting the combined judgments of all coders.",
        "Thus, expected agreement is measured as the overall proportion of items assigned to a category k by all coders n.",
        "Cooperation annotation for giver has a Fleiss' kappa score of 0.835 (p<0.001), while for follower cooperation annotation is 0.829 (p<0.001).",
        "Turn management has a Fleiss kappa score of 0.784 (p<0.001).",
        "As regard gaze, Fleiss kappa score is 0.788 (p<0.001).",
        "Mouth shape annotation has a Fleiss kappa score of 0.816 (p<0.001) and eyebrows shape annotation has a Fleiss kappa of 0.855 (p<0.001).",
        "In the last years a large debate on the interpretation of kappa scores has widespread.",
        "There is a general lack of consensus on how to interpret those values.",
        "Some authors (All-wood et al., 2006) consider as reliable for multimodal annotation kappa values between 0.67 and 0.8.",
        "Other authors accept as reliable only scoring rates over 0.8 (Krippendorff, 2004) to allow some generalizations.",
        "What is clear is that it seems inappropriate to propose a general cut off point, especially for multimodal annotation where very little literature on kappa agreement has been reported.",
