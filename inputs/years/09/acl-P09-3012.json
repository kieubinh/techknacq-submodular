        "In contrast to single document summarization information overlap is one of the biggest challenges to MDS systems.",
        "While repeated information is a good evidence of importance, this information should be included in a summary only once in order to avoid a repetitive summary.",

        "In sentence clustering semantically similar sentences are grouped together.",
        "Sentences within a cluster overlap in information, but they do not have to be identical in meaning.",
        "In contrast to paraphrases sentences in a cluster do not have to cover the same amount of information.",
        "One sentence represents one cluster in the summary.",
        "Either a sentences from the cluster is selected (Aliguliyev, 2006) or a new sentence is regenerated from all/some sentences in a cluster (Barzilay and McKeown, 2005).",
        "Usually the quality of the sentence clusters are only evaluated indirectly by judging the quality of the generated summary.",
        "There is still no standard evaluation method for summarization and no consensus in the summarization community how to evaluate a summary.",
        "The methods at hand are either superficial or time and resource consuming and not easily repeatable.",
        "Another argument against indirect evaluation of clustering is that troubleshooting becomes more difficult.",
        "If a poor summary was created it is not clear which component e.g. information extraction through clustering or summary generation (using for example language regeneration) is responsible for the lack of quality.",
        "However there is no gold standard for sentence clustering available to which the output of a clustering systems can be compared.",
        "Another challenge is the evaluation of sentence clusters.",
