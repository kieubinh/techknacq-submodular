        "The purpose of route directions is to inform a person, who is typically not familiar with his current environment, of how to get to a designated goal.",
        "Generating such directions poses difficulties on various conceptual levels such as the planning of the route, the selection of landmarks along the way (i.e. easily recognizable buildings or structures) and generating the actual instructions of how to navigate along the route using the selected landmarks as reference points.",
        "As pointed out by Tom & Denis (2003), the use of landmarks in route directions allows for more effective way-finding than directions relying solely on street names and distance measures.",
        "An experiment performed in Tom & Denis' work also showed that people tend to use landmarks rather than street names when producing route directions themselves.",
        "The application presented here is an early research prototype that takes a data-driven generation approach, making use of annotated corpora collected in a way-finding study.",
        "In contrast to previously developed NLG systems in this area (e.g. Dale et.",
        "al, 2002), one of our key features is the integration of a number of online resources to compute routes and to find salient landmarks.",
        "The information acquired from these resources can then be used to generate natural directions that are both easier to memorise and easier to follow than directions given by a classic route planner or navigation system.",
        "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: In Section 2 we introduce our system and describe the resources and their integration in the architecture.",
        "Section 3 describes our corpus-based generation approach, with Section 4 outlining our integration of text generation and visualisation.",
        "Finally, Section 5 gives a short conclusion and discusses future work."

        "The route planner used in our system is provided by the Google Maps API.",
        "Given a route computed in Google Maps, our system queries a number of online resources to determine landmarks that are adjacent to this route.",
        "At the time of writing, these resources are: OpenStreetMapsfor public transportation, the Wikipedia WikiPro-ject Geographical coordinates for salient buildings, statues and other objects, Google AJAX Search API for \"yellow pages landmarks\" such as hotels and restaurants, and Wikimapia for squares and other prominent places.",
        "All of the above mentioned resources can be queried for landmarks either by a single GPS coordinate (using the LocalSearch method in Google AJAX Search and web tools in Wikipe-dia) or an area of GPS coordinates (using URL based queries in Wikimapia and OpenStreet-Maps).",
        "The following list describes the data formats returned by the respective services and how they were integrated:",
        "• Wikimapia and OpenStreetMaps - Both resources return landmarks in the queried area as an XML file that specifies GPS coordinates and additional information.",
        "The XML files are parsed using a JavaScript implementation of a SAX parser.",
        "The coordinates and names of landmarks are then used to add objects within the Google Maps API.",
        "• Wikipedia - In order to integrate landmarks from Wikipedia, we make use of a community created tool called search-a-place , which returns landmarks from Wikipedia in a given radius of a GPS coordinate.",
        "The results are returned in an HTML table that is converted to an XML file similar to the output of Wikimapia.",

        "A data-driven generation approach achieves a number of advantages over traditional approaches for our scenario.",
        "First of all, corpus data can be used to learn directly how certain events are typically expressed in natural language, thus avoiding the need of manually specifying linguistic realisations.",
        "Secondly, variations of discourse structures found in naturally given directions can be learned and reproduced to avoid monotonous descriptions in the generation part.",
        "Last but not least, a corpus with good coverage can help us determine the correct selection restrictions on verbs and nouns occurring in directions.",
        "The price to pay for these advantages is the cost of annotation; however we believe that this is a reasonable trade-off, in view of the fact that a small annotated corpus and reasonable generalizations in data modelling will likely yield enough information for the intended navigation applications.",
        "We currently use the data set from (Marciniak & Strube, 2005) to learn linguistic expressions for our generation approach.",
        "The data is annotated on the following levels:",
        "• Token and POS level",
        "• Grammatical level (including annotations of main verbs, arguments and connectives)",
        "• Frame-semantics level (including semantic roles and frame annotations in the sense of (Fillmore, 1977))",
        "• Temporal level (including temporal relations between discourse units)",
        "At the time of writing, our system only makes use of the first three annotation levels.",
        "The lexical selection is inspired by the work of Ratna-parkhi (2000) with the overall process designed as follows: given a certain situation on a route, our generation component receives the respective frame name and a list of semantic role filling landmarks as input (cf.",
        "Section 4).",
        "The generation component then determines a list of potential lexical items to express this frame using the relative frequencies of verbs annotated as evoking the particular frame with the respective set of semantic roles (examples in Table 1).",

        "We further intend to replace the current hard-coded set of mapping rules with an automatically induced mapping that aligns physical routes and landmarks with the semantic representations.",
        "The application is planned to be used in web experiments to acquire further data for alignment and to study specific effects in the generation of walking instructions in a multimodal setting.",
