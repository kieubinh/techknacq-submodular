        "The grammar introduced is a descriptive grammar of general-purpose, present-day standard Mandarin Chinese, which is fast becoming an internationally spoken language.",
        "Real examples of actual language use will be illustrated based on a data driven and corpus based approach so that its links to computational linguistic approaches for computer processing are naturally bridged in.",
        "A number of important Chinese NLP resources are also presented.",
        "On the technology side, the tutorial mainly covers Chinese word segmentation and Part-of-Speech tagging.",
        "Word segmentation problem has to deal with some Chinese language unique problems such as unknown word detection and named entity recognition which are the emphasis of this tutorial."
