        "Language independence is commonly presented as one of the advantages of modern, machine-learning approaches to NLP.",
        "Once an algorithm is developed, the argument goes, it can trivially be extended to another language; \"all\" that is needed is a suitably large amount of training data for the new language.",
        "This is indeed a virtue.",
        "However, the typical approach to developing language-independent systems is to eschew using any linguistic knowledge in their production.",
        "In this position paper, I argue that, on the contrary, the production of language-independent NLP technology requires linguistic knowledge, and that the relevant kind of linguistic knowledge is in fact relatively inexpensive.",
        "The rest of this paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, I discuss how linguistically naive systems can end up tuned to the languages they were originally developed for.",
        "In Section 3, I survey the long papers from ACL2008:HLT to give a snapshot of how linguistic diversity is currently handled in our field.",
        "In Section 4, I give a brief overview of Linguistic Typology, and suggest how knowledge derived from this field can be profitably incorporated into language-independent NLP systems."

      "text": [
        "A simple example of subtle language dependence is the way in which n-gram models work better for languages that share important typological properties with English.",
        "On the face of it, n-gram models code in no linguistic knowledge.",
        "They treat natural language text as simple sequences of symbols and automatically reflect the \"hidden\" structure through the way it affects the distributions of words in various (flat, unstructured) contexts.",
        "However, the effectiveness of n-gram models in English (and similar languages) is partially predicated on two properties of those languages: relatively low levels of inflectional morphology, and relatively fixed word order.",
        "As is well-known by now, languages with more elaborate morphology (more morphemes per word, more distinctions within the same number of morphological slots, and/or fewer uninflected words) present greater data sparsity problems for language models.",
        "This data sparsity limits the ability of n-gram models to capture the dependencies between open-class morphemes, but also closed class morphemes.",
        "The information expressed by short function words in English is typically expressed by the inflectional morphology in languages with more elaborate morphological systems.",
        "Word-based n-gram models have no way of representing the function morphemes in such a language.",
        "In addition, for n-gram models to capture inter-word dependencies, both words have to appear in the n-gram window.",
        "This will happen more consistently in languages with relatively fixed word order, as compared to languages with relatively free word order.",
        "Thus even though n-grams models can be built without any hand-coding of linguistic knowledge, they are not truly language independent.",
        "Rather, their success depends on typological properties of the languages they were first developed for.",
        "A more linguistically-informed (and thus more language independent) approach to n-gram models is the factored language model approach of Bilmes and Kirchhoff (2003).",
        "Factored language models address the problems of data-sparsity in morphologically complex languages by representing words as bundles of features, thus capturing dependencies between subword parts of adjacent words.",
        "A second example of subtle language dependence comes from Dasgupta and Ng (2007), who present an unsupervised morphological segmentation algorithm meant to be language-independent.",
        "Indeed, this work goes much further towards language independence than is the norm (see Section 3).",
        "It is tested against data from English, Bengali, Finnish and Turkish, a particularly good selection of languages in that it includes diversity along a key dimension (degree of morphological complexity), as well as representatives of three language families (Indo-European, Uralic, and Altaic).",
        "Furthermore, the algorithm is designed to detect more than one prefix or suffix per word, which is important for analyzing morphologically complex languages.",
        "However, it seems unrealistic to expect a one-size-fits-all approach to be achieve uniformly high performance across varied languages, and, in fact, it doesn't.",
        "Though the system presented in (Dasgupta and Ng, 2007) outperforms the best systems in the 2006 PASCAL challenge for Turkish and Finnish, it still does significantly worse on these languages than English (F-scores of 66.2 and 66.5, compared to 79.4).",
        "This seems to be due to an interesting interaction of at least two properties of the languages in question.",
        "First, the initial algorithm for discovering candidate roots and affixes relies on the presence of bare, uninflected roots in the training vocabulary, extracting a string as a candidate affix (or sequence of affixes) when it appears at the end (or beginning) of another string that also appears independently.",
        "In Turkish and Finnish, verbs appear as bare roots in many fewer contexts than in English.",
        "This is also true in Bengali, and the authors note that their technique for detecting allomorphs is critical to finding \"out-of-vocabulary\" roots (those unattested as standalone words) in that language.",
        "However, the technique for finding allomorphs assumes that \"roots exhibit the character changes during attachment, not suffixes\" (p.160), and this is where another property of Finnish and Turkish becomes relevant: Both of these languages exhibit vowel harmony, where the vowels in many suffixes vary depending on the vowels of the root, even if consonants intervene.",
        "Thus I speculate that at least some of the reduced performance in Turkish and Finnish is due to the system not being able to recognize variants of the same suffixes as the same, and, in addition, not being able to isolate all of the roots.",
        "Of course, in some cases, one language may represent, in some objective sense, a harder problem than another.",
        "A clear example of this is English letter-to-phoneme conversion, which, as a result of the lack of transparency in English orthography, is a harder problem that letter-to-phoneme conversion in other languages.",
        "Not surprisingly, the letter-to-phoneme systems described in e.g. (Jiampojamarn et al., 2008) and (Bartlett et al., 2008) do worse on the English test data than they do on German, Dutch, or French.",
        "On the other hand, just because one language may present a harder problem than the other doesn't mean that system developers can assume that any performance differences can be explained in such a way.",
        "If one aims to create a language-independent system, then one must explore the possibility that the system includes assumptions about linguistic structure which do not hold up across all languages.",
        "The conclusions I would like to draw from these examples are as follows: A truly language-independent system works equally well across languages.",
        "When a system that is meant to be language independent does not in fact work equally well across languages, it is likely because something about the system design is making implicit assumptions about language structure.",
        "These assumptions are typically the result of \"overfitting\" to the original development language(s).",
        "In Sec-",
        "1999).",
        "In Turkish, the bare root can function as a familiar imperative, but other forms are inflected (Lewis, 1967; Un-derhill, 1976).",
        "tion 4, I will argue that the best way to achieve language independence is by including, rather than eschewing, linguistic knowledge."

        "In addition, some languages are classified as using a negative word that may be a verb or may be a particle, as having variation between negative affixes and negative words, and as having double (or two-part) negation, where each negative clause requires two markers, one before the verb, and one after it.",
        "These examples illustrate several useful aspects of the knowledge systematized by linguistic typology: First, languages show variation beyond that which one might imagine looking only at a few familiar (and possibly closely related) languages.",
        "Second, however, that variation is still bounded: Though typologists are always interested in finding new categories that stretch the current classification, for the purposes of computational linguistics, we can get very far by assuming the known types exhaust the possibilities.",
        "Finally, because of the work done by field linguists and typologists, this knowledge is available as high-level generalizations about languages, of the sort that can inform the design of linguistically-sophisticated, language-independent NLP systems."

        "This paper has briefly argued that the best way to create language-independent systems is to include linguistic knowledge, specifically knowledge about the ways in which languages vary in their structure.",
        "Only by doing so can we ensure that our systems are not overfitted to the development languages.",
        "Furthermore, this knowledge is relatively inexpensive to incorporate, as it does not require building or maintaining intricate rule systems.",
        "Finally, if the field as a whole values language independence as a property of NLP systems, then we should ensure that the languages we select to use in evaluations are representative of both the language types and language families we are interested in."
