        "Once upon a time, knowledge-based parsers were slow, inaccurate and fragile.",
        "This is no longer true.",
        "In the last decade, enormous improvements have been achieved in this area.",
        "Parsers based on constraint-based formalisms such as HPSG, LFG, and CCG are now fast enough for many applications; they are robust; and they perform much more accurately than previously by incorporating, typically, a statistical disambiguation component.",
        "As a consequence, such parsers now obtain competitive, if not superior, performance.",
        "Zae-nen (2004), for instance, points out that the (LFG-based) XLE parser is fast, has a statistical disambiguation component, and is robust, and thus allows full parsing to be incorporated in many applications.",
        "Clark and Curran (2007) show that both accurate and highly efficient parsing is possible using a CCG.",
        "As a consequence of this development, massive amounts of parsed sentences now become available.",
        "Such large collections of syntactically annotated but not manually verified syntactic analyses are a very useful resource for many purposes.",
        "In this position paper we focus on one purpose: linguistic analysis.",
        "Our claim is, that very large parsed corpora are an important resource for linguists.",
        "Such very large parsed corpora can be used to search systematically for specific infrequent syntactic configurations of interest, and also to obtain quantitative data about specific syntactic configurations.",
        "Although parsed corpora obviously contain a certain amount of noise, for many applications the abundant size of these corpora compensates for this.",
        "In this paper, we illustrate our position by a nu-mer of recent linguistic studies in which very large corpora of Dutch have been employed, which were syntactically annotated by the freely available Alpino parser (Bouma et al., 2001; van Noord, 2006).",
        "The Alpino system incorporates a linguistically motivated, wide-coverage grammar for Dutch in the tradition of HPSG.",
        "It consists of over 800 grammar rules and a large lexicon of over 300,000 lexemes (including very many person names, geographical names, and organization names) and various rules to recognize special constructs such as named entities, temporal expressions, etc.",
        "Since we use Alpino to parse large amounts of data, it is crucial that the parser is capable to treat sentences with unknown words.",
        "A large set of heuristics have been implemented carefully to deal with unknown words and word sequences.",
        "Based on the categories assigned to words, and the set of grammar rules compiled from the HPSG grammar, a left-corner parser finds the set of all parses, and stores this set compactly in a packed parse forest.",
        "All parses are rooted by an instance of the top category, which is a category that generalizes over all maximal projections (S, NP, VP, ADVP, AP, PP and some others).",
        "If there is no parse covering the complete input, the parser finds all parses for each substring.",
        "In such cases, the robustness component will then select the best sequence of non-overlapping parses (i.e., maximal projections) from this set.",
        "In order to select the best parse from the parse forest, a best-first search algorithm is applied.",
        "The algorithm consults a Maximum Entropy disambiguation model to judge the quality of (partial) parses.",
        "The disambiguation model is trained on the manually verified Alpino treebank (about 7100 sentences from newspaper texts).",
        "Although Alpino is not a dependency grammar in the traditional sense, dependency structures are generated by the lexicon and grammar rules as the value of a dedicated feature.",
        "The dependency structures are based on CGN (Corpus Gesproken Nederlands, Corpus of Spoken Dutch) (Hoekstra et al., 2003), D-Coi and LASSY (van Noord et al., 2006).",
        "Dependency structures are stored in XML.",
        "Advantages of the use of XML include the availability of general purpose search and visualization software.",
        "For instance, we exploit XPATH (standard XML query language) to search in large sets of dependency structures, and Xquery to extract information from such large sets of dependency structures (Bouma and Kloosterman, 2002; Bouma and Kloosterman, 2007)."

        "The first illustration of our thesis that parsed corpora provide an interesting new resource for linguists, constitutes more of an anecdote than a systematic study.",
        "We include the example, presented earlier in van Noord (2009), because it is fairly easy to explain, and because it was how we became aware ourselves of the potential of parsed corpora for the purpose of linguistics.",
        "In van der Beek et al.",
        "(2002), the grammar underlying the Alpino parser is presented in some detail.",
        "As an example of how the various specific rules of the grammar interact with the more general principles, the analysis of comparatives and the interaction with generic principles for (right-ward) extraposition is illustrated.",
        "In short, comparatives such as comparative adjectives and the adverb anders as in the following example (1) license corresponding comparative phrases (such as phrases headed by dan (than)) by means of a feature which percolates according to the extraposition principle.",

        "As can be observed in the dependency graph, the left-right order of nodes does not represent the left-right ordering in the sentence.",

        "The daughter node should begin at the same position as the root sentence.",
        "Finally, the end position of the obcomp node must be larger than the end position of the head of the root sentence (i.e. the finite verb).",
        "In addition to many mis-parsed sentences, we found quite a few genuine cases.",

        "Not only do we find such examples, but informants agree that nothing is wrong with such cases.",
        "Some examples are listed in figure 3.",
        "It is striking that many examples involve the comparative adjectives liever and eerder.",
        "Also, the list involves examples where adverbials such as zo, zozeer, zoveel are related with an extraposed subordinate sentence headed by dat which according to the annotation guidelines are also treated as comparative complements.",
        "The examples show that at least in some cases, the possibility of extraposition of comparative complements out of topic must be allowed; we hypothesize that the acceptability of such cases is not a binary decision, but rather a preference which depends on the choice of comparative on the one hand, and the heaviness of the comparative complement on the other hand.",
        "For the purpose of this paper, we hope to have illustrated how parsed corpora can be helpful to find new empirical evidence for fairly complicated and suble linguistic issues.",
        "Note that for a construction of this type, manually verified treebanks are much too small.",
        "We estimated that it takes about 5 million words to find a single, good, example.",

        "For the third experiment (unaccusative versus transitive usage of verbs), an additional layer of manual verification was used, and furthermore, as the sub-categorization frequencies of individual verbs are estimated, the full TwNC was searched in order to obtain reasonably reliable estimates.",
