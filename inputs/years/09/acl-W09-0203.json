        "Word space models have become a mainstay in the automatic acquisition of lexical semantic knowledge.",
        "The computation of semantic relatedness of two words in such models is based on their distributional similarity.",
        "The most crucial way in which such models differ is the definition of distributional similarity: In a regular word space model the observed distribution concerns the immediate neighbours of a word within a predefined window to the left and right (Schütze, 1992; Sahlgren, 2006).",
        "Early on in the development as an alternative models were proposed that relied on the similarity of the distribution of syntactic relations (Hindle, 1990; Padö and Lapata, 2007).",
        "More recently the distribution of the occurrence within simple patterns defined in the form of regular expressions that are supposed to capture explicit semantic relations was explored as the basis ofdistri-butional similarity (Almuhareb and Poesio, 2004).",
        "Whereas dependency based semantic spaces have been shown to surpass other word space models for a number of problems (Padö and Lapata, 2007; Lin, 1998), for the task of categorisation simple pattern based spaces have been shown to perform equally good if not better (Poesio and Almuhareb, 2005b; Almuhareb and Poesio, 2005b).",
        "We want to show that dependency based spaces also fare better in these tasks if the dependency relations used are selected reasonably.",
        "At the same time we want to show that such a system can be built with freely available components and without the need to rely on the index of a proprietary search engine vendor.",
        "We propose to use the web acquired data of the ukWaC (Ferraresi et al., 2008), which is huge but still manageable and comes in a pre-cleaned version with HTML markup removed.",
        "It can easily be fed into a parser like MiniPar which allows for the subsequent extraction of dependency relations of different types and complexity.",
        "In particular we work with dependency paths that can reach beyond direct dependencies as opposed to Lin (1998) but in the line of Padó and Lapata (2007).",
        "In contrast to the latter, however, different paths that end in the same word are not generally mapped to the same dimension in our model.",
        "A path in a dependency graph can pass through several nodes and encompass different relations.",
        "We experimented with two sets of nouns previously used in the literature for word clustering.",
        "The nouns in both sets are taken from a number of different WordNet categories.",
        "Hence, the task consists in clustering together the words from the same category.",
        "By keeping the clustering algorithm constant, differences in performance can be attributed to the differences of the word representations.",
        "The next section provides a formal description of our word space model.",
        "Section 3 reports on our clustering experiments with two sets of concepts used previously to evaluate the categorisation abilities of word spaces.",
        "Section 4 discusses these re sults and draws some conclusions."

        "We follow the formalisation and terminology developed in Padó and Lapata (2007) according to which a dependency based space is determined by the sets of its basis elements B and targets T that form a matrix M = B x T, a similarity function S that assigns a real-valued similarity measure to pairs of elements from T, the association measure A that captures the strength of the relation between a target and a basis element, the context selection function cont, the basis mapping function m and the path value function v. Our set of targets is always a subset of the lemmas output by MiniPar.",
        "The remaining elements are defined in this section.",
        "We use p to denote a path in a dependency graph which is conceived of as an undirected graph for this purpose.",
        "So, in general a dependency path has an upward and downward part where one can have length zero.",
        "All the paths used to define the contexts for target words are anchored there, i.e. they start from the target.",
        "In choosing the context definitions that determine what dependency paths are used in the construction of the word vectors, we oriented ourselves at the sets proposed in Padó and Laptheir best results with it we started from their medium sized set of context definitions, from which we extracted the appropriate ones for our experiments and added some that seemed to make sense for our purposes: As our evaluation sets consist entirely of nouns, we used only context definitions that start at a noun.",
        "Thereby we can ensure that only nominal uses are recorded in a word vector if a target word can have different parts of speech.",
        "The complete set of dependency relations our context selection function cont comprises is given in Figure 1 along with an example for each.",
        "We only chose paths that end in an open word class assuming that they are more informative about the meaning of a target word.",
        "Paths ending in a preposition for instance, as used by Padó and Lapata (2007), were not considered.",
        "For the same reason we implemented a simple stop word filter that discards paths ending in a pronoun, which are assigned the tag N by MiniPar just like any other noun.",
        "On the other hand we added the relation between a prepositional complement and the noun it modifies (appearing as relation IX in Figure 1) as a close approximation of the pattern used by (Al-muhareb and Poesio, 2004) to identify attributes of a concept as detailed in the next section.",
        "Path specifications X and XI are also additions we made that are thought to gather additional attribute values to the ones already covered by III.",
        "As a basis mapping function m we used a generalisation of the one used by Grefenstette (1994) and Lin (1998).",
        "They map a dependency between two words to a pair consisting of the relation label l and the end word of the dependency end(p).",
        "As we use paths that span more than a single relation, this approach is not directly applicable to our setup.",
        "Instead we use a mapping function that maps a path to the sequence ofedge labels through which it passes combined with the end word:",
        "where l(•) is a labelling function that returns the sequence of edge labels for a given path.",
        "With this basis mapping function the nodes or words respectively through which a path passes are all neglected except for the node where the path ends.",
        "So, for the noun human the sequence human and mouse genome as well as the sequence human and chimpanzee genome increase the count for the same basis element :N:conj:N:*:N:nn:N:genome.",
        "Here we use a path notation of the general form:",
        "where POS is a part of speech, rel a relation and word a node label, i.e. a lemma, all as produced by MiniPar.",
        "The length of a path is determined by n and the asterisk (* ) indicates that a node label is ignored by the basis mapping function.",
        "As an alternative we experimented with a lexical basis mapping function that maps a path to its end word:",
        "This reduces the number of dimensions considerably and yields semantic spaces that are similar to window based word spaces.",
        "As this mapping function consistently delivered worse results, we dropped it from our evaluation.",

        "This method is obviously too liberal, though, if compared to the dependency spaces.",
        "In general we were able to show that semantic spaces are obviously able to capture categorical knowledge about concepts best when they are built from a syntactically annotated source.",
        "This is true even if the context specification used is not the most parsimonious.",
        "The problem of determining the right set of contexts is therefore rather an optimisation issue than a question of using dependency based spaces or not.",
        "It is a considerable one, though, as computations are much cheaper with vectors of reduced dimensionality, of course.",
        "For the categorisation task the inclusion ofmore complex relations reaching over several dependencies does not seem to be helpful considering they can all be dropped without a decrease in performance.",
        "As Padó and Lapata (2007) reached better results in their experiments with a broader set of context specifications we conclude that the selection of the kinds of context to include when constructing a word space depends largely on the task at hand."
