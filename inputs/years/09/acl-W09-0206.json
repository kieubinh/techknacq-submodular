        "The path to new content-rich competencies is paved by the acquisition of new and the reorganisation of already known concepts.",
        "Learners willing to take this journey, however, are imposed with the problem of positioning themselves to that point in a learning network of content, where they leave their known trails and step into the unknown - and to receive guidance in subsequent further conceptual development.",
        "More precisely, positioning requires to map characteristics from a learner's individual epistemic history (including both achievements and shortcomings) to the characteristics of the available learning materials and to recommend remedial action on how to achieve selected conceptual development goals (Van Bruggen et al., 2006).",
        "The conceptual starting points of learners necessary to guide the positioning process is reflected in the texts they are writing.",
        "Through structure and word choice, most notably the application of professional language, arrangement and meaning of these texts give cues about the level of competency development.",
        "As learning activities increasingly leave digital traces as evidence for prior learning, positioning support systems can be built that reduce this problem to developing efficient and effective matchmaking procedures.",
        "Latent semantic analysis (LSA) (Deerwester et al., 1990) as one technology in the family of geometry-based natural language models could in principle provide a technological basis for the positioning aims outlined above.",
        "The assumption underlying this is that the similarity to and of learning materials can be used as a proxy for similarity in learning outcomes, i.e. the developmental change in conceptual coverage and organisation caused by learning.",
        "In particular, LSA utilises threshold values for the involved semantic similarity judgements.",
        "Traditionally the threshold is obtained by calculating the average similarity between texts that correspond to the same category.",
        "This procedure can be inaccurate if a representative set of documents for each category is not available.",
        "Furthermore, similarity values tend to decrease with increasing corpora and vocabulary sizes.",
        "Also, the role of distractors in this context, i.e. negative evidence as reference material to sharpen classification for positioning, is largely unknown.",
        "With the following experiment, we intend to",
        "!See (Smith, 1996) for a clarification of the difference of competence and competency",
        "validate that geometrical models (particularly latent semantic analysis) can produce near human results regarding their propositions on how to account written learner evidence for prior learning and positioning these learners to where the best-suiting starting points are.",
        "We will show that latent semantic analysis works for positioning and that it can provide effective positioning.",
        "The main focus of this contribution is to investigate whether machine learning proves useful for the positioning classifiers, whether distractors improve results, and what the role of thresholds for the classifiers is.",
        "The rest of this paper is structured as follows.",
        "At first, positioning with LSA and related work are explained.",
        "This is followed by an outline of our own approach to positioning.",

      "text": [
        "According to (Kalz et al., 2007), positioning \"is a process that assists learners in finding a starting point and an efficient route through the [learning] network that will foster competence building\".",
        "Often, the framework within which this competence development takes places is a formal curriculum offered by an educational provider.",
        "Not only when considering a lifelong learner, for whom the borders between formal and informal learning are absolutely permeable, recognition of prior learning turns out to be crucial for positioning: each individual background differs and prior learning needs to be respected or even accredited before taking up new learning activities especially before enrolling in a curriculum.",
        "Typically, the necessary evidence of prior learning (i.e., traces of activities and their outcomes) are gathered in a learner's portfolio.",
        "This portfolio is then analysed to identify both starting points and a first navigation path by mapping evidence onto the development plans available within the learning network.",
        "The educational background represented in the portfolio can be of formal nature (e.g. certified exams) in which case standard admission and exemption procedures may apply.",
        "In other cases such standard procedures are not available, therefore assessors need to intellectually evaluate learner knowledge on specific topics.",
        "In procedures for accreditation of prior learning (APL), assessors decide whether evidence brought forward may lead to exemptions from one or more courses.",
        "For supporting the positioning process (as e.g. needed for APL) with technology, three different computational classes of approaches can be distinguished: mapping procedures based on the analysis of informal descriptions with textmining technologies, meta-data based positioning, and positioning based on ontology mappings (Kalz et al., 2007).",
        "Latent semantic analysis is one of many possible techniques that can be facilitated to support or even partially automate the analysis of informal portfolios.",
        "LSA is an algorithm applied to approximate the meaning of texts, thereby exposing semantic structure to computation.",
        "LSA combines the classical vector-space model with a singular value decomposition (SVD), a two-mode factor analysis.",
        "Thus, bag-of-words representations of texts can be mapped into a modified vector space that is assumed to reflect semantic structure.",
        "The basic idea behind LSA is that the collocation of terms of a given document-term-space reflects a higher-order - latent semantic - structure, which is obscured by word usage (e.g. by synonyms or ambiguities).",
        "By using conceptual indices that are derived statistically via a truncated SVD, this variability problem is believed to be overcome.",
        "In a typical LSA process, first a document-term matrix is constructed from a given text base of n documents containing m terms.",
        "This matrix M of the size m x n is then resolved by the SVD into the term vector matrix T (constituting the left singular vectors), the document vector matrix D (constituting the right singular vectors) being both orthonormal and the diagonal matrix S.",
        "Multiplying the truncated matrices Tk, Sk and Dk results in a new matrix Mk (see Figure 1) which is the least-squares best fit approximation of M with k singular values (Berry et al., 1994).",
        "LSA has been widely used in learning applications such as automatic assessment of essays, provision of feedback, and selection of suitable materials according to the learner's degree of expertise in specific domains.",
        "The Intelligent Essay Assessor (IEA) is an example of the first type of applications where the semantic space is build from materials on the topic to be evaluated.",
        "In (Foltz et al., 1999) the finding is reported that the IEA rating performance is close to the one of human raters.",
        "In (van Bruggen et al., 2004) authors report that LSA-based positioning requires creating a latent-semantic space from text documents that model learners' and public knowledge on a specific subject.",
        "Those texts include written material of learners' own production, materials that the learner has studied and learned in the past, and descriptions of learning activities that the learner has completed in the past.",
        "Public knowledge on the specific subject includes educational materials of all kind (e.g. textbooks or articles).",
        "In this case the description of the activity needs to be rich in the sense of terminology related to the domain of application.",
        "LSA relies on the use of rich terminology to characterize the meaning.",
        "Following the traditional LSA procedure, the similarity (e.g. cosine) between LSA vector models of the private and public knowledge is then calculated to obtain the learner position with respect to the public knowledge."

        "In the following, we design an experiment, conduct it, and evaluate the results to shed new light on the use of LSA for positioning.",

        "The assessment is in all cases done by comparing a set of learning materials (model solutions plus previously accepted/rejected reference material) to the documents from learners' portfolios using cosines as a proxy for their semantic similarity.",
        "In this comparison, thresholds for the cosine measure's values have to be defined above which two documents are considered to be similar.",
        "Depending on how exactly the model solutions and additional reference material are utilised, different assessment algorithms can be developed.",
        "To validate the proposed positioning services elaborated below, we compare the automatic recommendations for each text presented as evidence with expert recommendations over the same text (external validation).",

        "The assumption behind this is that with more positive examples to evaluate an investigated essay against, the precision of the evaluation should rise.",
        "The threshold is the average of the positive evidence essays among each other.",
        "Average to Good > Average among Good: Tests if the similarity to the 'good' examples is higher than the average similarity of the humanly judged good ones.",
        "Assumption is that the good evidence gathered circumscribes that area in the latent semantic space which is representative of the abstract model solution and that any new essay should be within the boundaries characterised by this positive evidence thus having a higher correlation to the positive examples then they have among each other.",
        "Best ofGood > Best ofBad: Tests whether the maximum similarity to the good essays is higher than the maximum similarity to bad essays.",
        "If a tested essay correlates higher to the best of the good than to the best of the bad, then it is classified as accepted.",

        "Figure 4 shows that recall and precision stay stable as there are no changes to the reference material taken into account: all essays are evaluated using three fixed 'gold standard' texts.",
        "This rule serves as a baseline benchmark for the other results.",
        "Figure 5 depicts a falling recall when having less positively judged essays in the training sample.",
        "In most cases, the recall is visibly higher than in the first rule, 'Best of Gold', especially when given enough good examples to learn from.",
        "Precision is rather stable.",
        "We interpret that the falling recall can be led back to the problem of too few examples that are then not able to model the target area of the latent semantic space.",
        "and slightly higher than in the previous rule, especially with rising numbers of positive examples.",
        "It seems that the recall is very dependant on the positive examples whether they are able to characterise representative boundaries: seeing recall change with varying amounts of positive examples, this indicates that the boundaries are not very well chosen.",
        "We assume that this is related to containing 'just pass' essays that were scored with 2.0 or 2.5 points and distort the boundaries of the target area in the latent semantic concept space.",
        "Figure 7 exhibits a quickly falling recall, though starting on a very high level, whereas precision is relatively stable.",
        "Having more negative evidence clearly seems to be counter productive and it seems more important to have positive examples to learn from.",
        "We have two explanations for this: First, bad examples scatter across the space and it is likely for a good essay to correlate higher with a bad one when there is only a low number of positive examples.",
        "Second, bad essays might contain very few words and thus expose correlation artefacts that would in principle be easy to detect, but not with LSA.",
        "Figure 8 depicts a recall that is generically higher than in the 'Best of Gold' case, while precision is in the same area.",
        "Recall seems not to be so stable but does not drop with more bad samples (and less good ones) to learn from such as in the 'Best of Good' case.",
        "We interpret that noise can be added to increase recall while still only a low number of positive examples is available to improve it.",
        "whole experiment; whereas the other rules showed the same results, the recall of this rule was unstable over the test runs, but in tendency lower than in the other rules.",
        "To gain further insight about the location of the 94 essays and three gold standards in the higher order latent-semantic space, a simple cluster analysis of their vectors was applied.",
        "Therefore, all document-to-document cosine similarities were calculated, filtered by a threshold of .65 to capture only strong associations, and, subsequently, a network plot of this resulting graph was visualised.",
        "As can be seen in the two charts, the humanly positively judged evidence seems to cluster quite well in the latent-semantic space when visualised as a network plot.",
        "Through filtering the document vectors by the vocabulary used only in the accepted, rejected, or both classes, an even clearer picture could be generated, shown in Figure 10.",
        "Both figures clearly depict a big connected component consisting mainly out of accepted essays, whereas the rejected essays mainly spread in the unconnected surrounding.",
        "The rejected essays are in general not similar to each other, whereas the accepted samples are.",

        "An explanation for this can be found therein that there are always a lot more heterogeneous ways to make an error.",
        "Homogeneity can only be assumed for the positive evidence, not for negative evidence.",
        "Noise seems to be useful for the calculation of thresholds.",
        "Though it will need further investigation whether our new hypothesis works that bad samples can be virtually anything (that is not good).",
        "Learning helps.",
        "The recall was shown to improve in various cases, while precision stayed at the more or less same level as the simple baseline rule.",
        "Though the threshold calculation using the difference to good and bad examples seemed to bear the potential of increasing precision.",
        "Thresholds and ways how to calculate them are evidently important.",
        "We proposed several well working ways on how to construct thresholds from evidence that extend the state of the art.",
        "Thresholds usually vary with changing corpus sizes and the measures proposed can adopt to that.",
        "We plan to investigate the use of support vector machines in the latent semantic space in order to gain more flexible means of characterising the boundaries of the target area representing a concept.",
        "It should be mentioned that this experiment demonstrates that conceptual development can be measured and texts and their similarity can serve as a proxy for that.",
        "Of course the experiment we have conducted bears the danger to bring results that are only stable within the topical area chosen.",
        "We were able to demonstrate that textual representations work on a granularity level of around 23 words, i.e. with the typical length of a free text question in an exams.",
        "While additionally using three model solutions or at least two positive samples, we were able to show that using a textbook split into paragraph-sized textual units combined with generic background material, valid classifiers can be built with relative ease.",
        "Furthermore, reference material to score against can be collected along the way.",
        "The most prominent open problem is to try and completely get rid of model solutions as reference material and to assess the lower level concepts (terms and term aggregates) directly to further reduce corpus construction and reference material collection.",
        "Using clustering techniques, this will mean to identify useful ways for efficient visualisation and analysis."
