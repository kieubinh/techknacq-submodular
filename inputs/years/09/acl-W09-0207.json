        "One of the interesting research questions which emerged during the above research was how better quality distractors could automatically be chosen.",
        "In fact user evaluation showed that from the three main tasks performed in the generation of multiple-choice tests (term identification, sentence transformation and distractor selection), it was distractor selection which needed further improvement with a view to putting it in practical use.",
        "Distractors play a vital role for the process of multiple-choice testing in that good quality distractors ensure that the outcome of the tests provides more credible and objective picture of the knowledge of the testees involved.",
        "On the other hand, poor distractors would not contribute much to the accuracy of the assessment as obvious or too easy distractors will pose no challenge to the students and as a result, will not be able to distinguish high performing from low performing learners.",
        "The principle according to which the distractors were chosen, was semantic semantically closer were the distractors to the correct answer, the most 'plausible' they were deemed to be.",
        "The rationale behind this consists in the fact that distractors semantically distant from the correct answer could make guessing a 'straightforward task'.",
        "By way an example, if processing the sentence 'Syntax is the branch of linguistics which studies the way words are put together into sentences', the multiple-choice generation system would identify syntax as an important term, would transform the sentence into the question 'Which branch of linguistics studies the way words are put together into sentences?'",
        "and would choose 'Pragmatics', 'Morphology' and 'Semantics' as distractors to the correct answer 'Syntax', being closer to it than 'Chemistry', 'Football' or 'Beer' for instance (which if offered as distractors, would be easily dismissed by people who do not have even any knowledge of linguistics).",
        "While the semantic similarity premise appears as a logical way forward to automatically select distractors, there are different methods or measures which compute semantic similarity.",
        "Each of these methods could be evaluated individually but here we evaluate their suitability for the task of selection of distractors in multiple-choice tests.",
        "This type of evaluation could be regarded as extrinsic evaluation of each of the methods, where the benchmark for their performance would not be an annotated corpus or human judgement on accuracy, but to what extent a specific NLP application can benefit from employing a method.",
        "Another premise that this study seeks to verify is whether orthographically close distractors, in addition to being semantically related, could yield even better results."

        "On the other hand usefulness is a completely independent measure as it looks at distractors only and not only the combination of stems and distractors.",
        "In order to conduct this type of analysis, we used a simplified procedure, described in (Gronlund, 1982).",

        "On the other hand, distractors are termed not useful if they are not selected by any students at all.",
        "The evaluation showed (see Table 2) that there were 24 (30%) distractors deemed not useful from the collocation distractors.",
        "The figures for not useful distractors for those selected by way of WordNet similarity were as follows: 17 (21%) for extended gloss overlap distractors, 20 (25%) for the Leacock and Chodorow distractors, 19 (24%) for the Jiang and Conrath distractors and 16 (20%) for the Lin ones.",

        "Summarising the results of the item analysis, it is clear that there is not a method that outperforms the rest in terms of producing best quality items or distractors.",

        "In this study we conducted extrinsic evaluation of several similarity methods (collocation patterns; four different methods of WordNet-based semantic similarity: extended gloss overlap measure, Leacock and Chodorow's, Jiang and Conrath's as well as Lin's measures; distributional similarity; phonetic similarity; mixed strategy) by seeking to establish which one would be most suitable for the task of selection of distractors in multiple-choice tests.",
        "The evaluation results based on item analysis suggests that whereas there is not a method that clearly outperforms in terms of delivering better quality distractors, mixed strategy and Lin's measure consistently perform better than the rest of methods/measures.",
        "However, these two methods do not offer any statistically significant improvement over their closest competitors."
