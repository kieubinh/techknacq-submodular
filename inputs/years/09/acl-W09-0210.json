        "Bayesian non-parametric models have received a lot of attention in the machine learning community.",
        "These models have the attractive property that the number of components used to model the data is not fixed in advance but is actually determined by the model and the data.",
        "This property is particularly interesting for NLP where many tasks are aimed at discovering novel, previously unknown information in corpora.",
        "Recent work has applied Bayesian non-parametric models to anaphora resolution (Haghighi and Klein, 2007), lexical acquisition (Goldwater, 2007) and language modeling (Teh, 2006) with good results.",
        "Recently, Vlachos et al.",
        "(2008) applied the basic models of this class, Dirichlet Process Mixture Models (DPMMs) (Neal, 2000), to a typical learning task in NLP: lexical-semantic verb clustering.",
        "The task involves discovering classes of verbs similar in terms of their syntactic-semantic properties (e.g. MOTION class for travel, walk, run, etc.).",
        "Such classes can provide important support for other NLP tasks, such as word sense disambiguation, parsing and semantic role labeling (Dang, 2004; Swier and Stevenson, 2004).",
        "Although some fixed classifications are available (e.g. VerbNet (Kipper-Schuler, 2005)) these are not comprehensive and are inadequate for specific domains (Korhonen et al., 2006b).",
        "Unlike the clustering algorithms applied to this task before, DPMMs do not require the number of clusters as input.",
        "This is important because even if the number of classes in a particular task was known (e.g. in the context of a carefully controlled experiment), a particular dataset may not contain instances for all the classes.",
        "Moreover, each class is not necessarily contained in one cluster exclusively, since the target classes are defined manually without taking into account the feature representation used.",
        "The fact that DPMMs do not require the number of target clusters in advance, renders them promising for the many NLP tasks where clustering is used for learning purposes.",
        "While the results of Vlachos et al.",
        "(2008) are promising, the use of a clustering approach which discovers the number of clusters in data presents a new challenge to existing evaluation measures.",
        "In this work, we investigate optimal evaluation for such approaches, using the dataset and the basic method of Vlachos et al.",
        "as a starting point.",
        "We review the applicability of existing evaluation measures and propose a modified version of the newly introduced V-measure (Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2007).",
        "We complement the quantitative evaluation with thorough qualitative assessment, for which we introduce a method to summarize samples obtained from a clustering algorithm.",
        "In preliminary work by Vlachos et al.",
        "(2008), a constrained version of DPMMs which takes advantage of must-link and cannot-link pairwise constraints was introduced.",
        "It was demonstrated how such constraines can guide the clustering solution towards some prior intuition or considerations relevant to the specific NLP application in mind.",
        "We explain the inference algorithm for the constrained DPMM in greater detail and evaluate quantitatively the contribution of each constraint type of independently, complementing it with qualitative analysis.",
        "The latter demonstrates how the pairwise constraints added affects instances beyond those involved directly.",
        "Finally, we discuss how the unsupervised and the constrained version ofDPMMs can be used in a real-world setup.",
        "The results from our comprehensive evaluation show that both versions of DPMMs are capable of learning novel information not in the gold standard, and that the constrained version is more accurate than a previous verb clustering approach which requires setting the number of clusters in advance and is therefore less realistic."

        "Given this, the goal is to find a partitioning of the instances K that is as close as possible to the gold standard C.",
        "Most work on verb clustering has used the F-measure or the Rand Index (RI) (Rand, 1971) for evaluation, which rely on counting pairwise links between instances.",
        "However, Rosenberg and Hirschberg (2007) pointed out that F-measure assumes (the missing) mapping between q and kj.",
        "In practice, RI values concentrate in a small interval near 100% (Meila, 2007).",
        "Rosenberg & Hirschberg (2007) proposed an information-theoretic metric: V-measure.",
        "V-measure is the harmonic mean of homogeneity and completeness which evaluate the quality ofthe clustering in a complementary way.",
        "Homogeneity assesses the degree to which each cluster contains instances from a single class of C. This is computed as the conditional entropy of the class distribution of the gold standard given the clustering discovered by the algorithm, H(C\\K), normalized by the entropy of the class distribution in the gold standard, H(C).",
        "Completeness assesses the degree to which each class is contained in a single cluster.",
        "This is computed as the conditional entropy of the cluster distribution discovered by the algorithm given the class, H(K\\C), normalized by the entropy of the cluster distribution, H(K).",
        "In both cases, we subtract the resulting ratios from 1 to associate higher scores with better solutions:",
        "The parameter / in Eq.",
        "3 regulates the balance between homogeneity and completeness.",
        "Rosenberg & Hirschberg set it to 1 in order to obtain the harmonic mean of these qualities.",
        "They also note that V-measure favors clustering solutions with a large numberofclusters (large \\ K\\ ), since suchsolutions can achieve very high homogeneity while maintaining reasonable completeness.",
        "This effect is more prominent when a dataset includes a small numberofinstaces forgold standard classes.",
        "While increasing \\ K\\ does not guarantee an increase in V-measure (splitting homogeneous clusters would reduce completeness without improving homogeneity), it is easier to achieve higher scores when more clusters are produced.",
        "Another relevant measure is the Variation of Information (VI) (Meila, 2007).",
        "Like V-measure, it assesses homogeneity and completeness using the quantities H(C\\ K) and H(K\\ C) respectively, however it simply adds them up to obtain a final result (higher scores are worse).",
        "It is also a metric, i.e. VI scores can be added, subtracted, etc, since the quantities involved are measured in bits.",
        "However, it can be observed that if \\ C \\ and \\ K \\ are very different then the terms H(C K) and H(K C) will not necessarily be in the same range.",
        "In particular, if \\K\\ < \\C\\ then H(K\\C) (and V/) will be low.",
        "In addition, VI scores are not normalized and therefore their interpretation is difficult.",
        "Both V-measure and VI have important advantages over RI and F-measure: they do not assume a mapping between classes and clusters and their scores depend only on the relative sizes of the clusters.",
        "However, V-measure and VI can be misleading if the number of clusters found ( K ) is substantially different than the number of gold standard classes ( C ).",
        "In order to ameliorate this, we suggest to take advantage of the / parameter in Eq.",
        "3 in order to balance homogeneity and completeness.",
        "More specifically, setting // = \\K\\/\\C\\ assigns more weight to completeness than to homogeneity in case K > C since the former is harder to achieve and the latter is easier when the clustering solution has more clusters than the gold standard has classes.",
        "The opposite occurs when \\K\\ < \\C\\.",
        "In case \\K\\ = \\C\\ the score is the same as the original V-measure.",
        "Achieving 100% score according to any of these measures requires correct prediction of the number of clusters.",
        "In this work, we evaluate our results using the three measures described above (V-measure, VI, V-beta).",

        "Adding randomly selected pairwise links is beneficial.",
        "In particular, must-links improve the clustering rapidly.",
        "Incorporating 50 must-links improves the performance by 7-8% according to the evaluation measures.",
        "In addition, it reduces the average number of clusters by approximately 4.",
        "The cannot-links are rather ineffective, which is expected as the clustering discovered by the unsupervised DPMM is more fine-grained than the gold standard.",
        "For the same reason, it is more likely that the randomly selected cannot-links are already discovered by the DPMM and are thus redundant.",
        "Wagstaff & Cardie also noted that the impact of the two types of links tends to vary across data sets.",
        "Nevertheless, a minor improvement is observed in terms of homogeneity.",
        "The balanced mix improves the performance, but less rapidly than the must-links.",
        "In order to assess how the links added help the DPMM learn other links we use the Constrained Rand Index (CRI), which is a modification of the Rand Index that takes into account only the pairwise decisions that are not dictated by the constraints added (Wagstaff and Cardie, 2000; Klein et al., 2002).",
        "We evaluate the constrained DPMM with CRI (Table 3, bottom right graph) and our results show that the improvements obtained using pairwise constraints are due to learning links beyond the ones enforced.",
        "In a real-world setting, obtaining the mixed set of links is equivalent to asking a human expert to give examples of verbs that should be clustered together or not.",
        "Such information could be extracted from a lexical resource (e.g. ontology).",
        "Alternatively, the DPMM could be run without any constraints first and if a human expert judges the clustering too coarse (or fine) then cannot-links (or must-links) could help, since they can adapt the clustering rapidly.",
        "When 20 randomly selected must-links are integrated, the DPMM reaches or exceeds the performance of PC used by Sun et al.",
        "(2008) according to all the evaluation measures.",
        "We also argue that it is more realistic to guide the clustering algorithm using pairwise constraints than by defining the number of clusters in advance.",
        "Instead of using pairwise constraints to affect the clustering solution, one could alter the parameters for the Dirichlet prior Go (Eq.",
        "1) or experiment with varying concentration parameter values.",
        "However, it is difficult to predict in advance the exact effect such changes would have in the solution discovered.",
        "Finally, we conducted qualitative analysis ofthe samples obtained constraining the DPMM with 10 randomly selected must-links.",
        "We first prepared the data according to the method described in Section 5, using probJink and prob_single thresholds of 99% and 1% respectively.",
        "This resulted in 26 clusters and one singleton for 79 verbs.",
        "Recall that without constraining the DPMM these thresholds produced 20 clusters and 5 singletons for 70 verbs.",
        "49 verbs are shared in both outputs, while the average cluster size is similar.",
        "The resulting clusters are highly accurate.",
        "As many as 16 (i.e. 62%) of them represent a single gold standard class, 7 of which contain (only) the pairs of must-linked verbs.",
        "Interestingly, only 11 out of 17 gold standard classes are exemplified among the 16 clusters, with 5 classes subdivided into finer-grained classes.",
        "Each of these subdivisions seems semantically fully motivated (e.g. 30.3 peer verbs were subdivided so that peep and peek were assigned to a different cluster than the semantically different gaze, glance and stare) and 4 of them can be directly attributed to the use of must-links.",
        "From the 6 clusters that contained members from two different gold standard classes, the majority (5) make sense as well.",
        "3 of these contain members of must-link pairs together with verbs from semantically related classes (e.g. 37.7 say and 40.2 nonverbal expression classes).",
        "3 of the clusters that contain members of several gold standard classes include must-link pairs as well.",
        "In two cases must-links have helped to bring together verbs which belong to the same class (e.g. the members of the must-link pair broaden-freeze which represent 45.4 change of state class appear now in the same cluster with other class members dampen, soften and sharpen).",
        "Thus, DP-MMs prove useful in learning novel information taking into account pairwise constraints.",
        "only 4 (i.e. 15%) of the clusters in the output examined are not meaningful (mostly due to the mismatch between the syntax and semantics of verbs)."

        "The latter also studied how the added links affect instances not directly involved in them.",
        "It can be argued that one could use clustering algorithms that require the number of clusters to be known in advance to discover interesting subclasses such as those discovered by the DPMMs.",
        "However, this would normally require multiple runs and manual inspection of the results, while",
        "DPMMs discover them automatically.",
        "Apart from the fact that fixing the number of clusters in advance restricts the discovery of novel information in the data, such algorithms cannot take full advantage of the pairwise constraints, since the latter are likely to change the number of clusters."
