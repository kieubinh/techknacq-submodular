        "Over the last decades, annotated corpora and computational lexicons have gained an increasing role among language resources in computational linguistics: on the one hand, they are used to train Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools such as parsers and PoS taggers; on the other hand, they are developed through automatic procedures of linguistic annotation and lexical acquisition.",
        "The relation between annotated corpora and computational lexicons is circular: as a matter of fact, if linguistic annotation of textual data is supported and improved by the use of lexicons, these latter can be induced from annotated data in a corpus-based fashion.",
        "In the field of cultural heritage and in particular that of classical languages studies, much effort has been devoted throughout the years to the digitization of texts, but only recently have some projects begun to annotate them above the morphological level.",
        "Concerning lexicology and lexicography of classical languages, a long tradition has produced and established many dictionaries, thesauri and lexicons, providing examples from real texts.",
        "Nevertheless, nowadays it is possible and indeed necessary to match lexicons with data from (annotated) corpora, and viceversa.",
        "This requires the scholars to exploit the vast amount of textual data from classical languages already available in digital format, and particularly those annotated at the highest levels.",
        "The evidence provided by the texts themselves can be fully represented in lexicons induced from these data.",
        "Subsequently, these lexicons can be used to support the textual annotation itself in a virtuous circle.",
        "This paper reports on the creation of a valency lexicon induced from the Index Thomisticus Treebank, a syntactically annotated corpus of Medieval Latin texts by Thomas Aquinas.",
        "The paper is organised as follows: section 2 describes the available Latin treebanks, their annotation guidelines and gives some specific information on the Index Thomisticus treebank; section 3 deals with the notion of valency, while section 4 describes the state of the art on valency lexicons; section 5 illustrates the procedures of acquisition and representation of our valency lexicon; finally, section 6 draws some conclusions and describes future work."

        "Latin is a richly inflected language, showing:",
        "- discontinuous constituents ('non-projectivity'): this means that phrasal constituents may not be continuous, but broken up by words of other constituents.",
        "An example is the following sentence by Ovid (Metamorphoses, I.1-2): \"In nova fert animus mutatas dicere formas corpora\" (\"My mind leads me to tell of forms changed into new bodies\").",
        "In this sentence, both the nominal phrases \"nova corpora\" and \"muta-tas formas\" are discontinuous;",
        "- moderately free word-order: for instance, the order of the words in a sentence like \"audaces fortuna iuvat\" (\"fortune favours the bold\") could be changed into \"fortuna audaces iuvat\", or \"fortuna iuvat audaces\", without affecting the meaning of the sentence.",
        "These features of Latin influenced the choice of Dependency Grammars (DG) as the most suitable grammar framework for building Latin annotated corpora like treebanks.",
        "While since the 1970s the first treebanks were annotated via Phrase Structure Grammar (PSG)-based schemata (as in IBM, Lancaster and, later on, Penn treebanks), in the past decade many projects of dependency treebanks development have started, such as the ALPINO treebank for",
        "University Treebank for Italian (Lesmo et al., 2002), or the Danish Dependency Treebank (Kromann, 2003).",
        "On the one hand, this is due to the fact that the first treebanks were mainly English language corpora.",
        "PSG were a suitable framework for a poorly inflected language like English, showing a fixed word-order and few discontinuous constituents.",
        "Later on, the syntactic annotation of moderately free word-order languages required the adoption of the DG framework, which is more appropriate than PSG for such a task.",
        "On the other hand, Carroll et al.",
        "(1998) showed that inter-annotator agreement was significantly better for dependency treebanks, indicating that phrase structure annotation was requiring too many irrelevant decisions (see also Lin, 1995).",
        "Although much Latin data is nowadays available in digital format, the first two projects for the development of Latin treebanks have only recently started: namely the Latin Dependency Treebank (LDT) at the Tufts University in Boston (within the Perseus Digital Library) based on texts of the Classical era (Bamman, 2006), and the Index Thomisticus Treebank (IT-TB) at the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Milan, based on the Opera omnia of Thomas Aquinas (Passarotti, 2007).",
        "Taking into account the above mentioned features of Latin, both the treebanks independently chose the DG framework as the most suitable one for data annotation.",
        "The same approach was later on followed by a third Latin treebank now available, which is ongoing at the University of Oslo in the context of the PROIEL project (Pragmatic Resources in Old Indo-European Languages): the aim of PROIEL is the syntactic annotation of the oldest extant versions of the New Testament in Indo-European languages, including Greek, Latin, Gothic, Armenian and Church Slavonic (Haug and J0hndal, 2008).",
        "Since LDT and IT-TB were the first projects of their kind for Latin, no prior established guidelines were available to rely on for syntactic annotation.",
        "Therefore, the so-called 'analytical layer' of annotation of the Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT) for Czech (Hajic et al., 1999) was chosen and adapted to specific or idiosyncratic constructions of Latin.",
        "These constructions (such as the ablative absolute or the passive periphrastic) could be syntactically annotated in several different ways and are common to Latin of all eras.",
        "Rather than have each treebank project decide upon and record each decision for annotating them, LDT and IT-TB decided to pool their resources and create a single annotation manual that would govern both treebanks (Bamman et al., 2007a; Bamman et al., 2007b; Bamman et al., 2008).",
        "As we are dealing with Latin dialects separated by 13 centuries, sharing a single annotation manual is very useful for comparison purposes, such as checking annotation consistency or dia-chronically studying specific syntactic constructions.",
        "In addition, the task of data annotation through these common guidelines allows annotators to base their decisions on a variety of examples from a wider range of texts and combine the two datasets in order to train probabilistic dependency parsers.",
        "Although the PROIEL annotation guidelines are grounded on the same grammar framework as the LDT and IT-TB, they differ in a number of details, some of which are described in Passarotti (forthcoming).",
        "The Index Thomisticus (IT) by Roberto Busa SJ (1974-1980) was begun in 1949 and is considered a groundbreaking project in computational linguistics.",
        "It is a database containing the Opera omnia of Thomas Aquinas (118 texts) as well as 61 texts by other authors related to Thomas, for a total of around 11 million tokens.",
        "The corpus is morphologically tagged and lemmatised.",
        "Early in the 1970's Busa started to plan a project aimed at both the morphosyntactic disambiguation of the IT lemmatisation and the syntactic annotation of its sentences.",
        "Today, these tasks are performed by the IT-TB project, which is part of the wider 'Lessico Tomistico Bicul-turale', a project whose target is the development of a lexicon from the IT texts.",
        "Presently, the size of the IT-TB is 46,456 tokens, for a total of 2,103 parsed sentences excerpted from the Scriptum super Sententiis Mag-istri Petri Lombardi."

      "text": [
        "As outlined above, the notion of valency is generally defined as the number of complements required by a word: these obligatory complements are usually named 'arguments', while the non-obligatory ones are referred to as 'adjuncts'.",
        "Although valency can refer to different parts of speech (usually verbs, nouns and adjectives), scholars have mainly focused their attention on verbs, so that the notion of valency often coincides with verbal valency.",
        "Valency is widely used in DG formalisms, but it also figures in PSG-based formalisms like HPSG and LFG.",
        "While Karl Buhler can be considered as the pioneer of the modern theory of valency, Lucien Tesnière is widely recognised as its real founder.",
        "Tesnière views valency as a quantitative quality of verbs, since only verbs constrain both the quantity and the quality (i.e. nouns and adverbs) of their obligatory arguments; through a metaphor borrowed from drama, Tesnière classifies dependents into actants (arguments) and circon-stants (adjuncts): \"Le noeud verbal [...] exprime tout un petit drame.",
        "Comme un drame en effet, il comporte obligatoirement un procès, et le plus souvent des acteurs et des circonstances.",
        "Transposés du plan de la réalité dramatique sur celui de la syntaxe structurale, le procès, les acteurs et les circonstances deviennent respectivement le verbe, les actants et les circonstants\" (Tesnière, 1959: 102).",
        "Arguments can be either obligatory or optional, depending on which sense of the verb is involved.",
        "For example, the seem sense of the verb appear requires two obligatory arguments in active clauses, as in the following sentence: \"That lawyer appears to love his work\".",
        "Here the second argument (\"to love his work\") cannot be left out without changing the meaning of the verb.",
        "On the other hand, optional arguments are recorded into the verbal argument structure itself, althought they may not appear at the clausal level.",
        "For instance, in the following sentence the object required by the verb eat is missing, but the sentence is still acceptable: \"He eats (something)\".",
        "Optionality can also act at the communicative level as well as at the structural one.",
        "For instance, adjuncts can be necessary for communicative intelligibility in particular contexts, as in the following sentence: \"I met James at the Marquee club\", where the locative adverbial (\"at the Marquee club\") is required to answer a question like \"Where did you meet James?\".",
        "On the other hand, structural optionality depends on the features of the language and applies at the clausal level.",
        "For instance, as a poorly inflected language, English requires the subject of a predicate to be expressed in declarative and interrogative main clauses, so that a sentence like the following is ungrammatical if the subject is missing: \"[I] slept all morning\".",
        "Given the so-called \"syntax-semantics interface\" (Levin, 1993), arguments are generally associated with a predicate sense rather than a predicate form, and are structured in sequences called 'subcategorization frames' (SCFs) or 'complementation patterns'.",
        "For example, there is a semantic difference between the bill sense and the attack sense of the verb charge in English, as in the following sentences:",
        "- (a) \"The hotel charges 80 euros for a night\".",
        "- (b) \"The army charged the enemy\".",
        "In these sentences, the two predicate senses show two different SCFs:",
        "Arguments are also selected by verbs according to lexical-semantic properties, called 'selec-tional preferences' (SPs) or 'selectional restrictions'.",
        "For example, a sentence like \"*The train flew to Rome\" is ungrammatical, since it violates",
        "and circumstances.",
        "Transposed from the dramatic reality to structural syntax, the process, the actors and the circumstances respectively become the verb, the actants and the circumstants\" (our translation).",

        "The corpus-based approach we followed induces verbal arguments directly from annotated data, where the arguments may be present or not, depending on the features of the texts.",

        "On the other hand, moving from parser performance to lexicon development, the lexicon can be induced from automatically parsed texts when an accurate parsing system is available.",
        "The syntactic and lexical data recorded in the lexicon are also important in further semantic NLP applications, such as word sense disambiguation, anaphora and ellipsis resolution, and selectional preference acquisition.",
        "Following a widespread approach in valency lexicons, a close connection between valency frames and word senses will be followed in the description of lexicon entries: this means that each headword entry of our lexicon will consist of one or more SCFs and SCCs, one for each sense of the word.",
        "We plan to make the lexicon available online through a graphical interface usable also during the annotation procedures, as has been already done for the PDT via the tree editor TrEd.",
        "In this way, the consistency of the annotation process can be tested and enforced thanks to the information stored in the lexicon.",
        "In order to test the accuracy of our system, it will be also necessary to evaluate the quality of our valency lexicon against the Perseus \"dynamic lexicon\", Happ's list and other existing resources for Latin, such as traditional dictionaries and thesauri.",
