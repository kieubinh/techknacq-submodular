        "An evaluation made in August 2008 in a recent Communication of the EC states that \"The absence of clear and comprehensive policies in many Member States was identified in the Recommendation as a threat to the survival of digitised and born-digital material...\" It also provides a good practice example from the UK, the Digital Preservation Coalition.",
        "Although this British experience is given as an example of a successful approach, the implementation of preservation in the current digital repositories in the UK is far from being satisfactory.",
        "The recent final report of the DRAI project (see Daisy Abbott 2008) on UK-based digital repositories identified that \"Of the 3,707collections aggregated, only 737 (20%) had evidence of a preservation policy, and of these the vast majority were from within the Arts and Humanities Data Service (AHDS) Collections Repository which, since March 2008, is no longer funded, leaving only 6% of resources with ongoing policies for long term preservation.\"",
        "Why the digital preservation which is recognised to be of high importance, is still not implemented widely?",
        "The Blue Ribbon Task Force Report (2008) summarized five major obstacles in building sustainable digital preservation programs: inadequacy of funding models to address long-term access and preservation needs; confusion and/or lack of alignment between stakeholders, roles, and responsibilities with respect to digital access and preservation; inadequate institutional, enterprise, and/or community incentives to support the collaboration needed to reinforce sustainable economic models; complacency that current practices are good enough; and fear that digital access and preservation is too big to take on.",
        "While these address mostly stakeholder-related issues, a recent report (DPE: 2007) reviewed the progress of digital preservation research world-wide.",
        "It concludes that \"The analysis of the last 16 years of effort in the area of digital preservation.",
        "support our claim that while much work has been done on the periphery, the central problems of digital preservation have yet to be resolved.\"",
        "Automation in digital preservation is one of the ten areas named by this study as being in a need of accelerated research.",
        "These two reports identify two key areas which need attention: the organisational aspects and the research.",
        "Any institution which currently faces the preservation challenge has to make a difficult choice under the circumstances of the rapidly changing technological environment and the lack of a generally recommended and effective solution.",
        "However, the deeper reason why after two decades of efforts digital preservation still has not reached maturity, is the lack of consistent theoretical foundation.",
        "In 2001, James Cheney et al.",
        "articulated the need to develop a mathematical theory for the area of information preservation.",
        "Having such a theory should help to understand better the object models and the basic transformations which need to be supported in a preservation system; it will also be of great benefit to automation because it would be much more clear what processes can be automated.",
        "In addition, a coherent theory would help to identify any gaps in procedures or data flows and thus would contribute to the implementation of systems which behaviour could be consistently traced.",
        "However, since this first suggestion that a theory of preservation is needed, there has not been much progress in developing one.",
        "Even the identification of the basic elements of a theory of preservation is not a trivial task.",
        "In addition to this methodological difficulty, the variety of domains where digital preservation is to be applied brings even more difficulties.",
        "It is still not clear whether a universal 'one-size-fits-all' solution could be used in all different domains.",
        "For example, in the cultural heritage domain which is considered in this paper there are various curatorial situations with regard to digital objects.",
        "Resources prepared by small projects are in more danger with regard to their longevity compared to resources of large institutions if we consider that they are created but the life-cycle for digital objects curation is not applied in full.",
        "In this paper it is not our aim to investigate what is the level of awareness and readiness of the whole range of cultural heritage institutions but we try to highlight what is the current state in the digital preservation field and what issues need to be addressed by projects in the cultural heritage domain.",
        "In 2002, the reference model for an open archival information system (OAIS) was published and one year later adopted in the international standard ISO 14721:2003, see (OAIS: 2003).",
        "It provides a functional approach which is helpful to understand and describe the processes in a preservation system.",
        "However, the specification of the minimum information which should accompany a digital object in order to guarantee its accessibility, interpretability and usability in the future, is not addressed in OAIS.",
        "There are different ongoing attempts to build a theory of preservation.",
        "Giorgos Flouris and Carlo Meghini in 2007 again suggested basing such a theory on firm mathematical foundations and such an effort will be made within the CASPARproject.",
        "Paul Watry in 2007 presented the directions of future research of the SHAMAN project which aims to study the context which guarantees that the essential properties of digital objects such as authenticity and integrity will be maintained over time.",
        "Reagan Moore and MacKenzie Smith suggested in 2007 a practical approach, which demonstrates how various requirements of the preservation systems can be implemented as sets of rules.",
        "Attempts to find an approach to building a coherent theory of preservation should also reflect the specific features of various subject domains.",
        "In Section 2 of this paper, we introduce the basic concepts of the ISO standard in the digital preservation domain OAIS.",

      "text": [
        "In response to the increased need for the introduction of common practices in assuring long term digital preservation (DP) of digital objects, the International Standards Organisation (ISO) in the last decade developed a number of conceptual DP standards and also some technical guidelines.",
        "The most popular standard in the area is ISO 14721:2003 (Space data and information transfer systems - Open archival information system - Reference model), widely known as OAIS.",
        "It is a conceptual framework which presents the main functional components and identifies the basic data flows within a digital preservation system.",
        "The development of OAIS arose from the need for a model which would specify the basic components of a system for long-term preservation of digital objects and their relationships with the 'external world'.",
        "In Fig. 1, an OAIS is represented as a box which is connected to other entities from the environment.",
        "These are Producers, Consumers, and Management (OAIS is not suggesting what roles could be defined within the archive).",
        "A special class of Consumers is the Designated Community.",
        "The Designated Community is the set of Consumers who should be able to understand the preserved information.\"",
        "Within the cultural heritage domain, a special attention also should be paid to the concept of designated community which is essential for the understanding of resources in the future.",
        "Understanding the actual needs and the level of background knowledge of the designated community is not trivial in this domain, especially in the cases of creating scholarly resources.",
        "This in fact opens a new essential issue related to the dynamics of resources: while the resources created by memory institutions such as libraries, archives and museums are 'static' because they represent the resources of the institutions, the resources created by projects tend to be dynamic, because they could be enriched and extended.",
        "These resources usually do not cover a fixed set of holdings but are oriented towards a specific theme and after a core set of resources is available, more materials could be added at later stages.",
        "Being familiar with the model will help cultural heritage professionals to organize better the digital objects' lifecycle and take informed decisions on the preservation aspects of their resources.",
        "In addition to the definition of these functional entities, an OAIS information model explains the data flows between the environment and the archive, and also within the functional components of the archive.",
        "Every act of submission of information to an OAIS by a Producer, as well as the dissemination of information to a Consumer, occurs either as a single discrete transmission, or as a series of transmissions.",
        "To describe the exchange of data, OAIS defines the concept of an Information Package as a \"container\" of two types of information: Content Information (CI) and Preservation Description Information (PDI).",
        "The Content Information and PDI are viewed as being encapsulated and identifiable by the Packaging Information (PI).",
        "OAIS defines three specialised types of information packages (IP), namely:",
        "â€¢ Archival Information Package (AIP): An Information Package, consisting of the Content Information and the associated PDI, which is preserved within an OAIS.",
        "â€¢ Dissemination Information Package (DIP): The Information Package, derived from one or more AIPs, received by the Consumer in response to a request to the",
        "OAIS.",
        "â€¢ Submission Information Package (SIP): An Information Package that is delivered by the Producer to the OAIS for use in the construction of one or more AIPs.",
        "PDI is divided into four types of preservation information called Provenance, Context, Refer ence, and Fixity.",
        "Provenance describes the source of the Content Information; Context describes how the CI relates to other information outside the Information Package.",
        "Reference provides identifiers, by which the CI may be uniquely identified.",
        "Fixity provides a wrapper, which protects the CI from undocumented alteration.",
        "A key point to note is that OAIS does not suggest any specific metadata as instantiations of PDI; so that there is no guidance on what constitutes a minimum technical requirement in respect of representing and encoding PDI information within corresponding PDI data bitstreams.",
        "The definition of a minimum required set of data should be based on a study of what is required to assure a reliable, consistent, and measurable specification and implementation of a preservation system.",
        "The consequences for the cultural heritage domain is that currently there is no single and uniformly accepted set of elements which guarantee the longevity of resources; but every single institution and project should consider how to structure the different types of archival packages if it establishes and digital archive and also decide what metadata need to be stored for preservation purposes.",
        "In OAIS the closest analogue to the high-level notion of metadata can be found in the idea of representation information while on the implementation level PDI provides the closest notion to a particular instantiation of a set of metadata elements.",
        "Having a reference framework for long-term digital preservation systems had an essential impact on the development of a common professional understanding and vocabulary.",
        "It has had a significant impact on the subsequent development of standards and as a guide to the setting up of preservation systems.",
        "Yet, the complexity of the area allows for multiple interpretations of how the framework should be implemented in real life applications.",
        "This arguably gives rise to a need to develop implementation guidelines and also to adjust any practical solution to policy frameworks."

        "In the area of preservation metadata, the basic concern, as stated by Brian Lavoie and Richard Gartner, still seems to be the development of preservation elements' schemes (2005).",
        "However, presentation and interoperability issues are not the only concern: preservation metadata, as all other types of metadata are affected by the metadata bottleneck, a metaphor which indicates that the human efforts needed to create metadata can not cope with the pace of creation of new digital resources.",

        "The final product of TEXT will be a set of web resources but their inclusion into repository is still under question; if this happens additional effort will be needed to define SIPs and to transform currently available XML files into SIPs.",
