        "Automatic metrics to assess the quality of machine translations have been a major enabler in improving the performance of MT systems, leading to many varied approaches to develop such metrics.",
        "Initially, most metrics judged the quality of MT hypotheses by token sequence match (cf. BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), NIST (Dod-dington, 2002).",
        "These measures rate systems hypotheses by measuring the overlap in surface word sequences shared between hypothesis and reference translation.",
        "With improvements in the state-of-the-art in machine translation, the effectiveness of purely surface-oriented measures has been questioned (see e.g., Callison-Burch et al.",
        "(2006)).",
        "In response, metrics have been proposed that attempt to integrate more linguistic information into the matching process to distinguish linguistically licensed from unwanted variation (Gimenez and Marquez, 2008).",
        "However, there is little agreement on what types of knowledge are helpful: Some suggestions concentrate on lexical information, e.g., by the integration of word similarity information as in Meteor (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005) or MaxSim (Chan and Ng, 2008).",
        "Other proposals use structural information such as dependency edges (Owczarzak et al., 2007).",
        "In this paper, we investigate an MT evaluation metric that is inspired by the similarity between this task and the textual entailment task (Dagan et al., 2005), which",

        "Textual entailment (TE) was introduced by Dagan et al.",
        "(2005) as a concept that corresponds more closely to \"common sense\" reasoning than classical, categorical entailment.",
        "Textual entailment is defined as a relation between two natural language sentences (a premise P and a hypothesis H) that holds if a human reading P would infer that H is most likely true.",
        "Information about the presence or absence of entailment between two sentences has been found to be beneficial for a range of NLP tasks such as Word Sense Disambiguation or Question Answering (Dagan et al., 2006; Harabagiu and Hickl, 2006).",
        "Our intuition is that this idea can also be fruitful in MT Evaluation, as illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "Very good MT output should entail the reference translation.",
        "In contrast, missing hypothesis material breaks forward entailment; additional material breaks backward entailment; and for bad translations, entailment fails in both directions.",
        "Work on the recognition of textual entailment (RTE) has consistently found that the integration of more syntactic and semantic knowledge can yield gains over surface-based methods, provided that the linguistic analysis was sufficiently robust.",
        "Thus, for RTE, \"deep\" matching outperforms surface matching.",
        "The reason is that linguistic representation makes it considerably easier to distinguish admissible variation (i.e., paraphrase) from true, meaning-changing divergence.",
        "Admissible variation may be lexical (synonymy), structural (word and phrase placement), or both (diathesis alternations).",
        "The working hypothesis of this paper is that the benefits of deeper analysis carry over to MT evaluation.",
        "More specifically, we test whether the features that allow good performance on the RTE task can also predict human judgments for MT output.",
        "Analogously to RTE, these features should help us to differentiate meaning preserving translation variants from bad translations.",
        "Nevertheless, there are also substantial differences between TE and MT evaluation.",
        "Crucially, TE assumes the premise and hypothesis to be well-formed sentences, which is not true in MT evaluation.",
        "Thus, a possible criticism to the use of TE methods is that the features could become unreliable for ill-formed MT output.",
        "However, there is a second difference between the tasks that works to our advantage.",
        "Due to its strict compositional nature, TE requires an accurate semantic analysis of all sentence parts, since, for example, one misanalysed negation or counterfactual embedding can invert the entailment status (MacCartney and Manning, 2008).",
        "In contrast, human MT judgments behave more additively: failure of a translation with respect to a single semantic dimension (e.g., polarity or tense) degrades its quality, but usually not crucially so.",
        "We therefore expect that even noisy entailment features can be predictive in MT evaluation.",
        "Regression-based prediction.",
        "Experiences from the annotation of MT quality judgments show that human raters have difficulty in consistently assigning absolute scores to MT system output, due to the number of ways in which MT output can deviate.",
        "Thus, the human annotation for the WMT 2008 dataset was collected in the form of binary pairwise preferences that are considerably easier to make (Callison-Burch et al., 2008).",
        "This section presents two models for the prediction of pairwise preferences.",
        "The first model (Abs) is a regularized linear regression model over entailment-motivated features (see below) that predicts an absolute score for each reference-hypothesis pair.",
        "Pairwise preferences are created simply by comparing the absolute predicted scores.",
        "This model is more general, since it can also be used where absolute score predictions are desirable; furthermore, the model is efficient with a runtime linear in the number of systems and corpus size.",
        "On the downside, this model is not optimized for the prediction of pairwise judgments.",
        "The second model we consider is a regularized logistic regression model (Pair) that is directly optimized to predict a weighted binary preference for each hypothesis pair.",
        "This model is less efficient since its runtime is",
        "Semantic relatedness (7) Compatibility of locations",
        "Semantic Relations (4) Structural Match (5) entities (4)",
        "quadratic in the number of systems.",
        "On the other hand, it can be trained on more reliable pairwise preference judgments.",
        "In a second step, we combine the individual decisions to compute the highest-likelihood total ordering of hypotheses.",
        "The construction of an optimal ordering from weighted pairwise preferences is an NP-hard problem (via reduction of CYCLIC-ORDERING; Barzilay and Elhadad, 2002), but a greedy search yields a close approximation (Cohen et al., 1999).",
        "Both models can be used to predict system-level scores from sentence-level scores.",
        "Again, we have two method for doing this.",
        "The basic method (Basic) predicts the quality of each system directly as the percentage of sentences for which its output was rated best among all systems.",
        "However, we noticed that the manual rankings for the WMT 2007 dataset show a tie for best system for almost 30% of sentences.",
        "Basic is systematically unable to account for these ties.",
        "We therefore implemented a \"tie-aware\" prediction method (WithTies) that uses the same sentence-level output as Basic, but computes system-level quality differently, as the percentage of sentences where the system's hypothesis was scored better or at most e worse than the best system, for some global \"tie interval\" e.",
        "Features.",
        "We use the Stanford RTE system (MacCart-ney et al., 2006) to generate a set of entailment features (Rte) for each pair of MT hypothesis and reference translation.",
        "Features are generated in both directions to avoid biases towards short or long translations.",
        "The Stanford RTE system uses a three-stage architecture.",
        "it (a) constructs a robust, dependency-based linguistic analysis of the two sentences; (b) identifies the best alignment between the two dependency graphs given similarity scores from a range of lexical resources, using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling strategy; and (c) computes roughly 75 features over the aligned pair of dependency graphs.",
        "The different feature groups are shown in Table 1.",
        "A small number features are real-valued, measuring different quality aspects of the alignment.",
        "The other features are binary, indicating matches and mismatches of different types (e.g., alignment between predicates embedded under compatible or incompatible modals, respectively).",
        "To judge to what extent the entailment-based model delivers improvements that cannot be obtained with established methods, we also experiment with a feature set formed from a set of established MT evaluation metrics (TradMt).",
        "We combine different parametrization of (smoothed) BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), NIST (Dod-dington, 2002), and TER (Snover et al., 2006), to give a total of roughly 100 features.",
        "Finally, we consider a combination of both feature sets (Comb)."

        "All models are evaluated on WMT 2008 to compare against the published results.",
        "Finally, we need to set the tie interval e. Since we did not want to optimize e, we simply assumed that the percentage of ties observed on WMT 2007 generalizes to test sets such as the 2008 dataset.",
        "We set e so that there are ties for first place on 30% of the sentences, with good practical success (see below).",

        "The first results column (Cons) shows consistency, i.e., accuracy in predicting human pairwise preference judgments.",
        "Note that the performance of a random baseline is not at 50%, but substantially lower.",
        "This is due to (a) the presence of contradictions and ties in the human judgments, which cannot be predicted; and (b) WMT's requirement to compute a total ordering of all translations for a given sentence (rather than independent binary judgments), which introduces transitivity constraints.",
        "See Callison-Burch et al.",
        "(2008) for details.",
        "Among our models, Pair shows a somewhat better consistency than Abs, as can be expected from a model directly optimized on pairwise judgments.",
        "Across feature sets, COMB works best with a consistency of 0.53, competitive with published",
        "WMT 2008 results.",
        "The two final columns (Basic and WithTies) show Spearman's p for the correlation between human judgments and the two types of system-level predictions.",
        "For Basic system-level predictions, we find that Pair performs considerably worse than Abs, by a margin of up to p = 0.1.",
        "Recall that the system-level analysis considers only the top-ranked hypotheses; apparently, a model optimized on pairwise judgments has a harder time choosing the best among the top-ranked hypotheses.",
        "This interpretation is supported by the large benefit that Pair derives from explicit tie modeling.",
        "Abs gains as well, although not as much, so that the correlation of the tie-aware predictions is similar for Abs and Pair.",
        "Comparing different feature sets, Basic show a similar pattern to the consistency figures.",
        "There is no clear winner between Rte and TradMt.",

        "We found small but consistent differences between the models: Rte performs about 1.5 percent better on the top hypotheses than on the bottom translations.",
        "We found the inverse effect for the TradMt model, which performs 2 points worse on the top hypotheses than on the bottom hypotheses.",
        "Revisiting our initial concern that the entailment features are too noisy for very bad translations, this finding indicates some ungrammaticality-induced degradation for the entailment features, but not much.",
        "Conversely, these numbers also provide support for our initial hypothesis that surface-based features are good at detecting very deviant translations, but can have trouble dealing with legitimate linguistic variation.",
