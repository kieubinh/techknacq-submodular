        "For the combination of machine translation systems there have been two main approaches described in recent publications.",
        "One uses confusion network decoding to combine translation systems as described in (Rosti et al., 2008) and (Karakos et al., 2008).",
        "The other approach selects whole hypotheses from a combined n-best list (Hildebrand and Vogel, 2008).",
        "Our setup follows the approach described in (Hildebrand and Vogel, 2008).",
        "We combine the output from the available translation systems into one joint n-best list, then calculate a set of features consistently for all hypotheses.",
        "We use MER training on a development set to determine feature weights and re-rank the joint n-best list."

      "heading": "2. Features",
      "text": [
        "For our entries to the WMT'09 we used the following feature groups:",
        "• Language model score",
        "• Word lexicon scores",
        "• Sentence length features",
        "• Rank feature",
        "• Normalized n-gram agreement",
        "The details on language model and word lexicon scores can be found in (Hildebrand and Vogel, 2008).",
        "We use two sentence length features, which are the ratio of the hypothesis length to the length of the source sentence and the difference between the hypothesis length and the average length of the hypotheses in the n-best list for the respective source sentence.",
        "We also use the rank of the hypothesis in the original system's n-best list as a feature.",
        "The participants of the WMT'09 shared translation task provided output from their translation systems in various sizes.",
        "Most submission were lst-best translation only, some submitted 10-best up to 300-best lists.",
        "In preliminary experiments we saw that adding a high scoring lst-best translation to a joint n-best list composed of several larger n-best lists does not yield the desired improvement.",
        "This might be due to the fact, that hypotheses within an n-best list originating from one single system (sub-list) tend to be much more similar to each other than to hypotheses from another system.",
        "This leads to hypotheses from larger sub-lists scoring higher in the n-best list based features, e.g. because they collect more n-gram matches within their sub-list, which \"supports\" them the more the larger it is.",
        "Previous experiments on Chinese-English showed, that the two feature groups with the highest impact on the combination result are the language model and the n-best list based n-gram agreement.",
        "Therefore we decided to focus on the n-best list n-gram agreement for exploring sub-list size normalization to adapt to the data situation with various n-best list sizes.",
        "The n-gram agreement score of each n-gram in the target sentence is the relative frequency of target sentences in the n-best list for one source sentence that contain the n-gram e, independent of the position of the n-gram in the sentence.",
        "This feature represents the percentage of the translation hypotheses, which contain the respective n-gram.",
        "If a hypothesis contains an n-gram more than once, it is only counted once, hence the maximum for the agreement score a(e) is 1.0 (100%).",
        "The agreement score a(e) for each n-gram e is:",
        "where C is the count of the hypotheses containing the n-gram and L is the size of the n-best list for this source sentence.",
        "To compensate for the various n-best list sizes provided to us we modified the n-best list n-gram agreement by normalizing the count of hypotheses that contain the n-gram by the size of the sub-list it came from.",
        "It can be viewed as either collecting fractional counts for each n-gram match, or as calculating the n-gram agreement percentage for each sub-list and then interpolating them.",
        "The normalized n-gram agreement score anorm(e) for each n-gram e is:",
        "anorm(e) – p ^ ^ l .",
        "where P is the number of systems, Cj is the count of the hypotheses containing the n-gram e in the sublist pj and Lj is the size of the sublist pj.",
        "For the extreme case of a sub-list size of one the fact of finding an n-gram in that hypothesis or not has a rather strong impact on the normalized agreement score.",
        "Therefore we introduce a smoothing factor A in a way that it has an increasing influence the smaller the sub-list is:",
        "asmooth(e)",
        "Lj - Cj ALj Lj",
        "where P is the number of systems, Cj is the count of the hypotheses containing the n-gram in the sublist pj and Lj is the size of the sublist pj.",
        "We used an initial value of A – 0.1 for our experiments.",
        "In all three cases the score for the whole hypothesis is the sum over the word scores normalized by the sentence length.",
        "We use n-gram lengths n – 1..6 as six separate features."
