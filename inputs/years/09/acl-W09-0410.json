        "Phrases are defined as non-empty contiguous sequences of words.",
        "The phrase translation probabilities are estimated using relative frequencies.",
        "In order to obtain a more symmetric model, the phrase-based model is used in both directions.",
        "The hierarchical phrase-based approach can be considered as an extension of the standard phrase-based model.",
        "In this model we allow the phrases to have \"gaps\", i.e. we allow non-contiguous parts of the source sentence to be translated into possibly non-contiguous parts of the target sentence.",
        "The model can be formalized as a synchronous context-free grammar (Chiang, 2007).",
        "The model also included some additional heuristics which have shown to be helpful for improving translation quality, as proposed in (Vilar et al., 2008).",
        "The first step in the hierarchical phrase extraction is the same as for the phrased-based model.",
        "Having a set of initial phrases, we search for phrases which contain other smaller sub-phrases and produce a new phrase with gaps.",
        "In our system, we restricted the number of non-terminals for each hierarchical phrase to a maximum of two, which were also not allowed to be adjacent.",
        "The scores of the phrases are again computed as relative frequencies.",
        "For both translation models, phrase-based and hierarchical, additional common models were used: word-based lexicon model, phrase penalty, word penalty and target language model.",

        "The smoothing technique we apply was the modified Kneser-Ney discounting with interpolation.",

        "Adjectives in Spanish and French, as in most Romanic languages, are usually placed after the corresponding noun, whereas for English it is the other way round.",
        "Therefore, for these language pairs local reorderings of nouns and adjective groups in the source language were applied.",
        "The following sequences of words are considered to be an adjective group: a single adjective, two or more consecutive adjectives, a sequence of adjectives and coordinate conjunctions, as well as an adjective along with its corresponding adverb.",
        "If the source language is Spanish or French, each noun is moved behind the corresponding adjective group.",
        "If the source language is English, each adjective group is moved behind the corresponding noun.",
        "Long range reorderings were applied on the verb groups for the German-English language pair.",
        "Verbs in the German language can often be placed at the end of a clause.",
        "This is mostly the case with infinitives and past participles, but there are many cases when other verb forms also occur at the clause end.",
        "For the translation from German into English, following verb types were moved towards the beginning of a clause: infinitives, infini-tives+zu, finite verbs, past participles and negative particles.",
        "For the translation from English to German, infinitives and past participles were moved to the end of a clause, where punctuation marks, subordinate conjunctions and finite verbs are considered as the beginning of the next clause.",
        "For the translation from German into English, German compounds were split using the frequencybased method described in (Koehn and Knight, 2003).",
        "For the other translation direction, the English text was first translated into the modified German language with split compounds.",
        "The generated output was then postprocessed, i.e. the components were merged using the method described in (Popovic et al., 2006): a list of compounds and a list of components are extracted from the original German training corpus.",

        "For system combination we used the approach described in (Matusov et al., 2006).",
        "The method is based on the generation of a consensus translation out of the output of different translation systems.",
        "The core of the method consists in building a confusion network for each sentence by aligning and combining the (single-best) translation hypothesis from one MT system with the translations produced by the other MT systems (and the other translations from the same system, if n-best lists are used in combination).",
        "For each sentence, each MT system is selected once as \"primary\" system, and the other hypotheses are aligned to this hypothesis.",
        "The resulting confusion networks are combined into a signle word graph, which is then weighted with system-specific factors, similar to the approach of (Rosti et al., 2007), and a trigram LM trained on the MT hypotheses.",
        "The translation with the best total score within this word graph is selected as consensus translation.",
