        "Modern Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems are typically trained on sentence-aligned parallel texts (bi-texts) from a particular domain.",
        "When tested on text from that domain, they demonstrate state-of-the art performance, but on out-of-domain test data the results can deteriorate significantly.",
        "For example, on the WMT06 Shared Translation Task, the scores for French-to-English translation dropped from about 30 to about 20 Bleu points for nearly all systems when tested on News Commentary instead of the Europarl text, which was used for training (Koehn and Monz, 2006).",
        "Subsequently, in 2007 and 2008, the WMT Shared Translation Task organizers provided a limited amount of bilingual News Commentary training data (1-1.3M words) in addition to the large amount of Europarl data (30-32M words), and set up separate evaluations on News Commentary and on Europarl data, thus inviting interest in domain adaptation experiments for the News domain (Callison-Burch et al., 2007; Callison-Burch et al., 2008).",
        "This year, the evaluation is on News Commentary only, which makes domain adaptation the central focus of the Shared Translation Task.",

        "We further used two language models (in-domain and out-of-domain), cognates, improved tokenization, and additional smart recasing as a post-processing step."

        "Below we describe separately the standard and the nonstandard settings of our system.",
        "In our baseline experiments, we used the following general setup: First, we tokenized the parallel bi-text, converted it to lowercase, and filtered out the overly-long training sentences, which complicate word alignments (we tried maximum length limits of 40 and 100).",
        "We then built separate English-to-Spanish and Spanish-to-English directed word alignments using IBM model 4 (Brown et al., 1993), combined them using the in-tersect+grow heuristic (Och and Ney, 2003), and extracted phrase-level translation pairs of maximum length 7 using the alignment template approach (Och and Ney, 2004).",
        "We thus obtained a phrase table where each phrase translation pair is associated with the following five standard parameters: forward and reverse phrase translation probabilities, forward and reverse lexical translation probabilities, and phrase penalty.",
        "We then trained a log-linear model using the standard feature functions: language model probability, word penalty, distortion costs (we tried distance based and lexicalized reordering models), and the parameters from the phrase table.",
        "We set all feature weights by optimizing Bleu (Pap-ineni et al., 2002) directly using minimum error rate training (MERT) (Och, 2003) on the tuning part of the development set (dev-test2009a).",
        "We used these weights in a beam search decoder (Koehn et al., 2007) to translate the test sentences (the English part of dev-test2009b, tokenized and lowercased).",
        "We then recased the output using a monotone model that translates from lowercase to uppercase Spanish, we post-cased it using a simple heuristic, de-tokenized the result, and compared it to the gold standard (the Spanish part of dev-test2009b)using Bleu andNIST.",
        "The nonstandard features of our system can be summarized as follows:",
        "Two Language Models.",
        "Following Nakov and Hearst (2007), we used two language models (LM) - an in-domain one (trained on a concatenation of the provided monolingual Spanish News Commentary data and the Spanish side of the training News Commentary bi-text) and an out-of-domain one (trained on the provided monolingual Spanish Europarl data).",
        "For both LMs, we used 5-gram models with Kneser-Ney smoothing.",
        "Merging Two Phrase Tables.",
        "Following Nakov (2008), we trained and merged two phrase-based SMT systems: a small in-domain one using the News Commentary bi-text, and a large out-ofdomain one using the Europarl bi-text.",
        "As a result, we obtained two phrase tables, Tnews and Teuro, and two lexicalized reordering models, Rnews and Reuro.",
        "We merged the phrase table as follows.",
        "First, we kept all phrase pairs from Tnews.",
        "Then we added those phrase pairs from Teuro which were not present in Tnews.",
        "For each phrase pair added, we retained its associated features: forward and reverse phrase translation probabilities, forward and reverse lexical translation probabilities, and phrase penalty.",
        "We further added two new features, Fnews and Feuro, which show the source of each phrase.",
        "Their values are 1 and 0.5 when the phrase was extracted from the News Commentary bi-text, 0.5 and 1 when it was extracted from the Europarl bi-text, and 1 and 1 when it was extracted from both.",
        "As a result, we ended up with seven parameters for each entry in the merged phrase table.",
        "Merging Two Lexicalized Reordering Tables.",
        "When building the two phrase tables, we also built two lexicalized reordering tables (Koehn et al., 2005) for them, Rnews and Reuro, which we merged as follows: We first kept all phrases from Rnews, then we added those from Reuro which were not present in Rnews.",
        "This resulting lexical-ized reordering table was used together with the above-described merged phrase table.",
        "Cognates.",
        "Previous research has shown that using cognates can yield better word alignments (Al-Onaizan et al., 1999; Kondrak et al., 2003), which in turn often means higher-quality phrase pairs and better SMT systems.",
        "Linguists define cognates as words derived from a common root (Bickford and Tuggy, 2002).",
        "Following previous researchers in computational linguistics (Bergsma and Kon-drak, 2007; Mann and Yarowsky, 2001; Melamed, 1999), however, we adopted a simplified definition which ignores origin, defining cognates as words in different languages that are mutual translations and have a similar orthography.",
        "We extracted and used such potential cognates in order to bias the training of the IBM word alignment models.",
        "Following Melamed (1995), we measured the orthographic similarity using longest common subsequence ratio (lcsr), which is defined as follows:",
        "where lcs(si,s2) is the longest common subsequence of s\\ and s2, and |s| is the length of s.",
        "Following Nakov et al.",
        "(2007), we combined the LCSR similarity measure with competitive linking (Melamed, 2000) in order to extract potential cognates from the training bi-text.",
        "Competitive linking assumes that, given a source English sentence and its Spanish translation, a source word is either translated with a single target word or is not translated at all.",
        "Given an English-Spanish sentence pair, we calculated lcsr for all cross-lingual word pairs (excluding stopwords and words of length 3 or less), which induced a fully-connected weighted bipartite graph.",
        "Then, we performed a greedy approximation to the maximum weighted bipartite matching in that graph (competitive linking) as follows: First, we aligned the most similar pair of unaligned words and we discarded these words from further consideration.",
        "Then, we aligned the next most similar pair of unaligned words, and so forth.",
        "The process was repeated until there were no words left or the maximal word pair similarity fell below a pre-specified threshold 9 (0 < 9 < 1), which typically left some words unaligned.",
        "As a result we ended up with a list C of potential cognate pairs.",
        "Following (Al-Onaizan et al., 1999; Kondrak et al., 2003; Nakov et al., 2007) we filtered out the duplicates in C, and we added the remaining cognate pairs as additional \"sentence\" pairs to the bi-text in order to bias the subsequent training of the IBM word alignment models.",
        "Improved (De-)tokenization.",
        "The default to-kenizer does not split on hyphenated compound words like nation-building, well-rehearsed, self-assured, Arab-Israeli, domestically-oriented, etc.",
        "While linguistically correct, this can be problematic for machine translation since it can cause data sparsity issues.",
        "For example, the system might know how to translate into Spanish both well and rehearsed, but not well-rehearsed, and thus at translation time it would be forced to handle it as an unknown word, i.e., copy it to the output untranslated.",
        "A similar problem is related to double dashes, as illustrated by the following training sentence: \"So the question now is what can China do to freeze – and, if possible, to reverse – North Korea 's nuclear program. \"",
        "We changed the tokenizer so that it splits on '-' and we altered the de-tokenizer accordingly.",
        "Improved Recaser.",
        "The default recaser suggested by the WMT09 organizers was based on a monotone translation model.",
        "We trained such a recaser on the Spanish side of the News Commen- tary bi-text that translates from lowercase to uppercase Spanish.",
        "While being good overall, it had a problem with unknown words, leaving them in lowercase.",
        "In a News Commentary text, however, most unknown words are named entities - persons, organization, locations - which are spelled with a capitalized initial in Spanish.",
        "Therefore, we used an additional recasing script, which runs over the output of the default recaser and sets the casing of the unknown words to the original casing they had in the English input.",
        "It also makes sure all sentences start with a capitalized initial.",
        "Rule-based Post-editing.",
        "We did a quick study of the system errors on the development set, and we designed some heuristic post-editing rules, e■g■, insert ^/j at the sentence beginning;",
        "• duplicate punctuation: we remove duplicate sentence end markers, quotes, commas, parentheses, etc."

        "In the following discussion, we will discuss the Bleu results under condition (3).",

        "The News Commentary baseline system uses sentences of length up to 40 tokens from the News Commentary bi-text, the default tokenizer and de-tokenizer, a distance-based reordering model, and a trigram language model trained on the Spanish side of the bi-text.",

        "System 6 adds a second 5-gram LM trained on the monolingual Europarl data, gaining 0.2%.",
        "System 7 augments the training bi-text with cognate pairs, gaining another 0.57%.",
        "System 8 is the same as System 6, except that it is trained on the out-of-domain Europarl bitext instead of the in-domain News Commentary bi-text.",
        "Surprisingly, this turns out to work better than the in-domain System 6 by 1.14% of Bleu.",
        "This is a quite surprising result since in both WMT07 and WMT08, for which comparable kinds and size of training data was provided, training on the out-of-domain Europarl was always worse than training on the in-domain News Commentary.",
        "We are not sure why it is different this year, but it could be due to the way the dev-train and dev-test was created for the 2009 data by extracting alternating sentences from the original development set.",
        "System 9 augments the Europarl bi-text with cognate pairs, gaining another 0.21%.",
        "System 10 merges the phrase tables of systems 7 and 9, and is otherwise the same as them.",
        "This adds another 0.27%.",
        "Our official submission to WMT09 is the post-edited System 10, retuned on the full development set: dev-test2009a + dev-test2009b (in order to produce more stable results with MERT)."

        "Still, the lowercased Bleu of 24.40% suggests that there may be a lot of room for further improvement in recasing - we are still about 2% below it.",
