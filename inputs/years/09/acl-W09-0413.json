        "The core of our system is the STTK decoder (Vogel, 2003), a phrase-based SMT decoder with a local reordering window of 2 words.",
        "The decoder generates a translation for the input text or word lattice by searching translation model and language model for the hypothesis that maximizes phrase translation probabilities and target language probabilities.",
        "The translation model, i.e. the SMT phrase table is created during the training phase by a modified version of the Moses Toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007) applying GIZA++ for word alignment.",
        "Language models are built using the SRILM Toolkit.",
        "The POS-tags for the reordering models were generated with the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994) for all languages.",
        "We submitted translations for the English-German, German-English, English-French and French-English tasks.",
        "All systems were trained on the Europarl and News Commentary corpora using the Moses Toolkit and apply 4-gram language models created from the respective monolingual News corpora.",
        "All feature weights are automatically determined and optimized with respect to BLEU via MERT (Venugopal et al., 2005).",

      "heading": "3. Word Reordering Model",
      "text": [
        "One part of our system that differs from the baseline system is the reordering model.",
        "To account for the different word orders in the languages, we used the POS-based reordering model presented in Rottmann and Vogel (2007).",
        "This model learns rules from a parallel text to reorder the source side.",
        "The aim is to generate a reordered source side that can be translated in a more monotone way.",
        "In this framework, first, reordering rules are extracted from an aligned parallel corpus and POS information is added to the source side.",
        "These rules are of the form VVIMP VMFIN PPER – PPER VMFIN VVIMP and describe how the source side has to be reordered to match the target side.",
        "Then the rules are scored according to their relative frequencies.",
        "In a preprocessing step to the actual decoding different reorderings of the source sentences are encoded in a word lattice.",
        "Therefore, for all reordering rules that can be applied to a sentence the resulting reorderings are added to the lattice if the score is better than a given threshold.",
        "The decoding is then performed on the resulting word lattice.",
        "This approach does model the reordering well if only short-range reorderings occur.",
        "But especially when translating from and to German, there are also long-range reorderings that require the verb to be shifted nearly across the whole sentence.",
        "During this shift of the verb, the rest of the sentence remains mainly unchanged.",
        "It does not matter which words are in between, since they are moved as a whole.",
        "Furthermore, rules including an explicit sequence of POS-tags spanning the whole sentence would be too specific.",
        "A lot more rules would be needed to cover long-range reorderings with each rule being applicable only very sparsely.",
        "Therefore, we model long-range reordering by generalizing over the unaffected sequences and introduce rules with gaps.",
        "(For more details see Niehues and Kolss (2009)).",
        "These are learned in a way similar to the other type of reordering rules described above, but contain a gap representing one or several arbitrary words.",
        "It is, for example, possible to have the following rule VAFIN * VVPP – VAFIN VVPP *, which puts both parts of the German verb next to each other."

      "heading": "4. Translation Model",

        "The translation models of all systems we submitted differ in some parts from the baseline system.",
        "The main changes done will be described in this section.",
        "The baseline method for creating the word alignment is to create the GIZA++ alignments in both directions and then to combine both alignments using a heuristic, e.g. grow-diag-final-and heuristic, as provided by the Moses Toolkit.",
        "In some of the submitted systems we used a discriminative word alignment model (DWA) to generate the alignments as described in Niehues and Vogel (2008) instead.",
        "This model is trained on a small amount of hand-aligned data and uses the lexical probability as well as the fertilities generated by the GIZA++ Toolkit and POS information.",
        "We used all local features, the GIZA and indicator fertility features as well as first order features for 6 directions.",
        "The model was trained in three steps, first using the maximum likelihood optimization and afterwards it was optimized towards the alignment error rate.",
        "For more details see Niehues and",
        "Vogel (2008).",
        "The relative frequencies of the phrase pairs are a very important feature of the translation model, but they often overestimate rare phrase pairs.",
        "Therefore, the raw relative frequency estimates found in the phrase translation tables are smoothed by applying modified Kneser-Ney discounting as described in Foster et al.",
        "(2006).",
        "For the test sentences the POS-based reordering allows us to change the word order in the source sentence, so that the sentence can be translated more easily.",
        "But this approach does not reorder the training sentences.",
        "This may cause problems for phrase extraction, especially for long-range re-orderings.",
        "For example, if the English verb is aligned to both parts of the German verb, this phrase can not be extracted, since it is not continuous on the German side.",
        "In the case of German as source language, the phrase could be extracted if we also reorder the training corpus.",
        "Therefore, we build lattices that encode the different reorderings for every training sentence.",
        "Then we can not only extract phrase pairs from the monotone source path, but also from the reordered paths.",
        "So it would be possible to extract the example mentioned before, if both parts of the verb were put together by a reordering rule.",
        "To limit the number of extracted phrase pairs, we extract a source phrase only once per sentence even if it may be found on different paths.",
        "Furthermore, we do not use the weights in the lattice.",
        "If we use the same rules as for the test sets, the lattice would be so big that the number of extracted phrase pairs would be still too high.",
        "As mentioned before, the word reordering is mainly a problem at the phrase extraction stage if one word is aligned to two words which are far away from each other in the sentence.",
        "Therefore, the short-range reordering rules do not help much in this case.",
        "So, only the long-range reordering rules were used to generate the lattice for the training corpus.",
        "This already leads to an increase of the number of source phrases in the filtered phrase table from 724K to 971K.",
        "The number of phrase pairs grows from 5.1M to 6.7M.",
        "For most of the different tasks there was a huge amount of parallel out-of-domain training data available, but only a much smaller amount of indomain training data.",
        "Therefore, we tried to adapt our system to the in-domain data.",
        "We want to make use of the big out-of-domain data, but do not want to lose the information encoded in the indomain data.",
        "To achieve this, we built an additional phrase table trained only on the in-domain data.",
        "Since the word alignment does not depend heavily on the domain we used the same word alignment.",
        "Then we combined both phrase tables in the following way.",
        "A phrase pair with features 6 from the first phrase table is added to the combined one with features < 6,1 >, where 1 is a vector of ones with length equal to the number of features in the other phrase table.",
        "The phrase pairs of the other phrase table were added with the features < 1, 6 >."

        "The system translating from English to German was trained on the data described in Section 2.1.",
        "The first system already uses the POS-based reordering model for short-range reorderings.",
        "The results of the different systems are shown in Table 1.",
        "We could improve the translation quality on the test set by using the smoothed relative frequencies in the phrase table as described before and by adapting the phrase table.",
        "Then we used the discriminative word alignment to generate a new word alignment.",
        "For the training of the model we used 500 hand-aligned sentences from the Eu-roparl corpus.",
        "By training a translation model based on this word alignment we could improve the translation quality further.",
        "At last we added the model for long-range reorderings, which performs best on the test set.",
        "The improvement achieved by smoothing is significant at a level of 5%, the remaining changes are not significant on their own.",
        "In all language pairs, the problem occurs that some features do not lead to an improvement on the development set, but on the test set.",
        "One reason for this may be that the development set is quite small.",
        "The German-English system was trained on the same data as the English-German except that we perform compound splitting as an additional preprocessing step.",
        "The compound splitting was done with the frequency-based method described in Koehn et al.",
        "(2003).",
        "For this language direction, the initial system already uses phrase table smoothing, adaptation and discriminative word alignment, in addition to the techniques of the English-German baseline system.",
        "The results are shown in Table 2.",
        "For this language pair, we could improve the translation quality, first, by adding the long-range reordering model.",
        "Further improvements could be achieved by using lattice phrase extraction as described before.",
        "For creating the English-French translations, first, the baseline system as described in Section 2 was used.",
        "This baseline was then augmented with phrase table smoothing, short-range word reordering and phrase table adaptation as described above.",
        "In addition, the adapted phrase table was (BLEU Score) postprocessed such that phrase table entries include the same amount of punctuation marks, especially quotation marks, in both source and target phrase.",
        "In contrast to the English^German language pairs, the word reordering required in English^French translations are restricted to rather local word shifts which can be covered by the short-range reordering feature.",
        "Applying additional long-range reordering is scarcely expected to yield further improvements for these language pairs and was not applied specifically in this task.",
