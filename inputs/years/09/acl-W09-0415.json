        "The goal of the MulTra project is to develop a grammar-based translation model capable of handling not just a couple of languages, but potentially a large number of languages.",
        "This is not an original goal, but as 50 years of work and investment have shown, the task is by no means an easy one, and although SMT has shown fast and impressive results towards it (e.g. EuroMatrix), we believe that a (principled) grammar-based approach is worth developing, taking advantage of the remarkable similarities displayed by languages at an abstract level of representation.",
        "In the first phase of this project (2007-2009), our work has focused on French, English, German, Italian and Spanish, with preliminary steps towards Greek, Romanian, Russian and Japanese.",
        "To evaluate the quality of the (still under development) system, we decided to join the WMT09 translation evaluation with prototypes for the following language pairs: English to French, French to English and German to English.",
        "In this short paper, we will first give a rough description of the MulTra system architecture and then turn to the difficult issue of the bilingual dictionaries.",
        "The MulTra project relies to a large extent on abstract linguistics, inspired from recent work in generative grammar (Chomsky, 1995, Culicover & Jackendoff, 2005, Bresnan, 2001).",
        "The grammar formalism developed for this project is both rich enough to express the structural diversity ofall the languages taken into account, and abstract enough to capture the generalizations hidden behind obvious surface diversity.",
        "At the software level, an object-oriented design has been used, similar in many ways to the one adopted for the multilingual parser (cf. Wehrli, 2007).",
        "The rapid growth of the number of transfer modules has often been viewed as a major flaw of the transfer model when applied to multilingual translation (cf. Arnold, 2000, Kay, 1997).",
        "This argument, which relies on the fact that the number of transfer modules and of the corresponding bilingual dictionaries increases as a quadratic function of the number of languages, is considerably weakened if one can show that transfer modules can be made relatively simple and light (cf. section 2), compared to the analysis and generation modules (whose numbers are a linear function of the number of languages).",
        "Likewise, section 3 will show how one can drastically reduce the amount ofwork by deriving bilingual dictionaries by transitivity."

        "To a large extent, this system can be viewed as an extension of the Multilingual Fips parsing project.",
        "For one thing, the availability of the \"deep linguistic\" Fips parser for the targeted languages is a crucial element for the MulTra project; second, the MulTra software design matches the one developed for the multilingual parser.",
        "In both cases, the goal is to set up a generic system which can be redefined (through type extension and method redefinition) to suit the specific needs of, respectively, a particular language or a particular language pair.",
        "The translation algorithm follows the traditional pattern of a transfer system.",
        "First the input sentence is parsed by the Fips parser, producing an information-rich phrase-structure representation with associated predicate-argument representations.",
        "The parser also identifies multiword expressions such as idioms and collocations - crucial elements for a translation system (cf. Seretan & Wehrli, 2006).",
        "The transfer module maps the source-language abstract representation into the target-language representation.",
        "Given the abstract nature of this level of representation, the mapping operation is relatively simple and can be sketched as follows: recursively traverse the source-language phrase structure in the order: head, right subconstituents, left sub-constituents.",
        "Lexical transfer (the mapping of a source-language lexical item with an equivalent target-language item) occurs at the head-transfer level (provided the head is not empty) and yields a target-language equivalent term often, but by no means always, of the same category.",
        "Following the projection principle used in the Fips parser, the target-language structure is projected on the basis of the lexical item which is its head.",
        "In other words, we assume that the lexical head determines a syntactic projection (or meta-projection).",
        "Projections (ie.",
        "constituents) which have been analyzed as arguments of a predicate undergo a slightly different transfer process, since their precise target-language properties may be in part determined by the subcategorization features of the target-language predicate.",
        "To take a simple example, the direct object of the French verb regarder in (1a) will be transferred into English as a prepositional phrase headed by the preposition at, as illustrated in (2a).",
        "This information comes from the lexical database.",
        "More specifically, the French-English bilingual lexicon specifies a correspondence between the French lexeme [ regarder NP 1 and the English lexeme [ look [ at NP ] ].",
        "For both sentences, we also illustrate the syntactic structures as built, respectively, by the parser for the source sentence and by the translator for the target sentence.",
        "(1)a. Paul a regarde la voiture.",
        "TP TIP vP TIP TNP",
        "(2)a. Paul looked at the car.",
        "Given the general model as sketched above, the addition of a language to the system requires (i) a parser and (ii) a generator.",
        "Then for each language pair for which that language is concerned, the system needs (iii) a (potentially empty) language-pair specific transfer module, and (iv) a bilingual lexical database.",
        "The first three components are described below, while the fourth will be the topic of section 3.",
        "Parser The Fips multilingual parser is assumed.",
        "Adding a new language requires the following tasks: (i) grammar description in the Fips formalism, (ii) redefinition of the language-specific parsing methods to suit particular properties ofthe language, and (iii) creation of an appropriate lexical database for the language.",
        "Generator Target-language generation is done in a largely generic fashion (as described above with the transfer and projection mechanisms).",
        "What remains specific in the generation phase is the selection of the proper morphological form of a lexical item.",
        "Language-pair-specific transfer Transfer from language A to language B requires no language-pair specification if the language structures of A and B are isomorphic.",
        "Simplifying a little bit, this happens among closely related languages, such as Spanish and Italian for instance.",
        "For languages which are typologically different, the transfer module must indicate how the precise mapping is to be done.",
        "Consider, for instance, word-order differences such as adjectives which are prenominal in English and postnominal in French - a red car vs. une voiture rouge.",
        "The specific English-French transfer module specifies that French adjectives, which do not bear the [+prenominal] lexical feature, correspond to right subconstituents (vs. left subconstituents) of the head noun.",
        "Other cases are more complicated, such as the V2 phenomenon in German, pronominal cliticization in Romance languages, or even the use of the do auxiliary in English interrogative or negative sentences.",
        "Such cases are handled by means of specific procedures, which are in some ways reminiscent of transformation rules of the standard theory of generative grammar, ie.",
        "rules that can insert, move or even delete phrase-structure constituents (cf. Akmajian & Heny, 1975).",
        "So far, the languages taken into account in the MulTra project are those for which the Fips parser has been well developed, that is English, French, German, Italian and Spanish.",
        "Of the 20 potential language pairs five are currently operational (English-French, French-English, German-French, German-English, Italian-French), while 6 other pairs are at various stages of development."

        "The lexical database is composed for each language of (i) a lexicon of words, containing all the inflected forms of the words of the language, (ii) a lexicon of lexemes, containing the syntactic/semantic information of the words (corresponding roughly to the entries of a classical dictionary) and (iii) a lexicon of collocations (in fact multi-word expressions including collocations and idioms).",
        "We call the lexemes and the collocations the lexical items of a language.",

        "In addition to these links, the table contains transfer information such as translation context (eg.",
        "sport, finance, law, etc.",

        "Of course the opposite translation direction must be considered independently.",
