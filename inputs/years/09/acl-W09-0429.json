        "In this section, we describe recent improvements to the Moses decoder for the WMT 2009 shared task.",
        "We implemented in Moses a more efficient beam search, following suggestions by Moore and Quirk (2007).",
        "In short, the guiding principle of this work is not to build a hypothesis and not to compute its language model scores, if it is likely to be too bad anyway.",
        "Before a hypothesis is generated, the following checks are employed:",
        "1. the minimum allowed score for a hypothesis is the worst score on the stack (if full) or the threshold for the stack (if higher or stack not full) plus an early discarding threshold cushion",
        "2. if (a) new hypothesis future score, (b) the current hypothesis actual score, and (c) the future cost of the translation option are worse than the allowed score, do not generate the hypothesis",
        "3. if adding all real costs except for the language model costs (i.e., reordering costs) makes the score worse than the allowed score, do not generate the hypothesis.",
        "4. complete generation of the hypothesis and add it to the stack",
        "Note that check 1 and 2 mostly consists of adding and comparing already computed values.",
        "In our implementation, step 3 implies the somewhat costly construction of the hypothesis data structure, while step 4 performs the expensive language model calculation.",
        "Without these optimizations, the decoder spends about 60-70% of the search time computing language model scores.",
        "With these optimization, the vast majority of potential hypotheses are not built.",
        "See Figure 1 for the time/search-accuracy tradeoffs using this early discarding strategy.",
        "Given a stack size, we can vary the threshold cushion mentioned in step 1 above.",
        "A tighter threshold (the factor 1.0 implies no cushion at all), results in speedier but worse search.",
        "Note, however, that the degradation in quality for a given time point is less severe than the alternative – reducing the stack size (and also tightening the beam threshold, not shown in the figure).",
        "To mention just two data points in the German-English setting: Stack size of 500 and early discarding threshold of 1.0 results in faster search (150ms/word) and better quality (73.5% search accuracy) than the default search setting of a stack size 200 and no early discarding (252ms/word for 62.5% seach accuracy).",
        "Accuracy is measured against the best translations found under any setting.",
        "Note that this early discarding is related to ideas behind cube pruning (Huang and Chiang, 2007), which generates the top n most promising hypotheses, but in our method the decision not to generate hypotheses is guided by the quality ofhy-potheses on the result stack.",
        "Commonly in statistical machine translation, punctuation tokens are treated just like words.",
        "For tokens such as commas, many possible translations are collected and they may be translated into any of these choices or reordered if the language model sees gains.",

        "Walls form hard reordering constraints, over which words may not be reordered (limited to zones, if defined within them).",
        "the most frequent tokens in a corpus and not very consistently translated across languages, it has a very noisy translation table, often with 10,000s if not 100,000s of translations.",
        "Punctuation has a meaningful role in structuring a sentence, and we see some gains exploiting this in the systems we built last year.",
        "By disallowing reordering over commas and sentence-ending punctuation, we avoid mixing words from different clauses, and typically see gains of 0.10.2 BLEU.",
        "But also other punctuation tokens imply reordering constraints.",
        "Parentheses, brackets, and quotation marks typically define units that should be translated as blocks, meaning that words should not be moved in or out of sequences in quotes and alike.",
        "To handle such reordering constraints, we introduced a framework that uses what we call zones and walls.",
        "A zone is a sequence of words that should be translated as block.",
        "This does not mean that the sequence cannot be reordered as a whole, but that once we start to translate words in a zone, we have to finish all its words before moving outside again.",
        "To put it another way: words may not reordered into or out of zones.",
        "A wall is a hard reordering constraint that requires that all words preceeding it have to be translated before words after may be translated.",
        "If we specify walls within zones, then we consider them local walls where the before-mentioned constraint only applies within the zone.",
