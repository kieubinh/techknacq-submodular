        "Our best result is the phrase-pivot system which scores higher than direct translation by 1.1 BLEU points.",

        "In this section we discuss different linguistic phenomena in which Arabic, English and Chinese are divergent.",
        "We consider orthography, morphology and syntax.",
        "We also present a new metric for quantifying linguistic differences.",
        "Arabic is written from right-to-left using an alphabet of 36 letters and eight optional diacritical marks.",
        "Arabic is written in a cursive mostly word-internal connected form, but words are separated by white spaces.",
        "The absence of Arabic diacritics adds a lot of ambiguity.",
        "Chinese uses a complex orthography that includes around 10,000 characters in common use.",
        "Characters convey semantic rather than phonological information.",
        "Chinese is written from left-to-right or top-down.",
        "Chinese words can be made out of one, two or more characters.",
        "However, words are written without separating spaces.",
        "Word segmentation is a major challenge for processing Chinese (Wu, 1998).",
        "English uses the Roman alphabet and its words are written with separating white spaces.",
        "English orthography is much closer to Arabic than it is to Chinese.",
        "Arabic is a morphologically rich language with a large set of morphological features such person, number, gender, voice, aspect, mood, case, and state.",
        "Arabic features are realized using both concatenative (affixes and stems) and templatic (root and patterns) morphology with a variety of morphological, phonological and orthographic adjustments.",
        "In addition, Arabic has a set of very common clitics that are written attached to the word, e.g., the conjunction +j w+ 'and', the preposition +m b+ 'with/in', the definite article +J Al+ 'the' and a range of pronominal clitics that can attach to nouns (as possessives) or verbs and prepositions (as objects).",
        "In stark contrast to Arabic, Chinese is an isolating language with no morphology to talk of.",
        "However, what Chinese lacks in morphology it replaces with a complex system of nominal quantifiers and verbal aspects.",
        "For example, in Figure 1 (at the end of this paper), Chinese marks the definiteness and humanness of the word ^^fe Xue Sheng 'student' using the two characters Zhe Wei 'this person', while the indefiniteness and book-ness of the word ^ Shu 'book' are indicated through the characters â€“ ^ Yi Ben 'one book-type'.",
        "English has a simple limited morphology primarily indicating number and tense.",
        "English stands in the middle between Arabic and Chinese in terms of morphological complexity.",
        "Arabic is morpho-syntactically complex with many differences from Chinese and English.",
        "We describe here three prominent syntactic issues in which Arabic, Chinese and English vary widely: subject-verb order, verbprepositional phrase order and nominal modification.",
        "First, Arabic verb subjects may be: (a.)",
        "pro-dropped (verb conjugated), (b.)",
        "pre-verbal, or (c.) post-verbal.",
        "The morphology of the Arabic verb varies in the three cases.",
        "By contrast English and Chinese are both generally subject-verb languages.",
        "When translating from Arabic, the challenge is to determine whether there is an explicit subject and, if there is, whether it is pre-or post-verbal.",
        "Since Arabic objects also follow the verb, a sequence of Verb NounPhrase may be a verb subject or a pro-drop-verb object.",
        "In the example in Figure 1, the subject (student) appears after the sentence initial verb in Arabic, but at the beginning of the sentence in Chinese and English.",
        "Secondly, as for the word order of prepositional phrases (PP), Arabic and English are similar in that PPs generally appear at the end of the sentence (after all the verbal arguments) and to a lesser extent at its beginning.",
        "In Chinese, however, some PPs (in particular locatives and temporals) must appear between subject and verb.",
        "Other PPs may appear at end of sentence.",
        "In the example in Figure 1, the location of the reading, 'in the classroom' appears at the end of the Arabic and English sentences; however, it is between subject and verb in Chinese.",
        "Finally, we distinguish three types of nominal modification: adjectival (as in 'red book'), possessive (as in 'John's book') and relative (as in 'the book [which John gave me').",
        "All of these modification types are handled in a similar manner in Chinese: using the particle Eft) De to connect modifier with modified.",
        "Modifiers always precede the modified.",
        "For example, in Figure 1, 'a book about China' appears as",
        "Eft)^ Guan Yu Zhong Guo De Shu 'about China De book'.",
        "Similarly, 'the student's book' would be translated as ^tfe Eft ^ Xue Sheng De Shu 'student DE book'.",
        "Like Chinese, English adjectival modifiers precede what they modify.",
        "However, relative modifiers follow.",
        "Possessive modifiers in English can appear before or after: 'the student's book' or 'the book of the student'.",
        "Unlike English and Chinese, Arabic adjectival modifiers typically follow their nouns (with a small exception of some superlative adjectives).",
        "However, similar to English but not Chinese, Arabic relative modifiers",
        "follow what they modify.",
        "As for possessive modifiers, Arabic has a special construction called Idafa, in which modifiers immediately follow what they modify without connecting particles.",
        "For example, 'the student's book' can only be translated in Arabic as sAyi ktAb AlTAlb 'book the-student'.",
        "These different phenomena are summarized in Table 1.",
        "It is interesting to point out that English phenomena are a middle ground for Arabic and Chinese: in some cases English is closer to Arabic and in others to Chinese.",
        "The previous section described specific types of linguistic phenomena without distinguishing them in terms of frequency or effect distance.",
        "For example, Arabic nominals (nouns, adjectives and adverbs) are seven times as frequent as verbs; and nominal modification phenomena are more likely local than long distance compared to verb-subject order.",
        "A proper quantification of these different phenomena requires trilingual parallel treebanks, which are not available.",
        "As such, we propose a simple metric to quantify linguistic differences by measuring the translation complexity of different language pairs.",

        "We are aware of two potentially biased aspects of our experimental setting.",
        "First, the Arabic and Chinese portions of our data collection, the UN corpus, are known to be generated from English originals.",
        "And secondly, the preprocessing techniques we used on Arabic and Chinese were developed for translation from these languages into English.",
        "These two aspects make English potentially more central to our experiments than if the data collection and preprocessing were done on Arabic and Chinese independent of English.",
        "Of course, it must be noted that the data bias is not unique to our work but rather a challenge for any bilingual corpus, in which translation is done from one language to another.",
        "Additionally, we can argue that the English bias in data and preprocessing does not only affect the Arabic-English and English-Chinese pipelines, but it also makes the Arabic and Chinese data potentially closer.",
        "Finally, given the expense involved in creating direct Arabic-Chinese parallel text and given the large amounts of Arabic-English and English-Chinese data, we think our results (with English bias) are still valid and interesting.",

        "We believe that this is a result of English being a sort of middle ground between Arabic and Chinese in terms of different linguistic features (in particular word order).",
        "Our best result is the phrase-pivot system which scores higher than direct translation by 1.1 BLEU points.",
        "An error analysis of our system shows that we successfully handle many complex Arabic-Chinese syntactic variations although there is a large space for improvement still.",
        "In the future, we plan on exploring tighter coupling of Arabic and Chinese through comparing different methods of preprocessing Arabic for Arabic-Chinese MT, in a similar manner to Sadat and Habash (2006).",
        "We also plan to study how well these results carry on to different corpora (bilingual Arabic-English and English-Chinese) as opposed to the trilingual corpus used in this paper.",
