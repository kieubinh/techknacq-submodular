        "Also, fixing erroneous words, generating complex morphology, and re-ranking translation results in post-processing phases may utilize syntactic information of both source and target languages.",
        "A syntax-based SMT system encodes the syntactic information in its translation model of the decoding step.",
        "A number of researchers have proposed syntactic reordering as a preprocessing step (Xia and McCord, 2004; Collins et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2007).",
        "In these syntactic reordering approaches, source sentences are first parsed and a series of reordering rules are applied to the parsed trees to reorder the source sentences into target languagelike word orders.",
        "Such an approach is an effective method for a phrase-based SMT system that employs a relatively simple distortion model in the decoding phase.",
        "This paper concentrates upon reordering source sentences in the preprocessing step of a Chinese-to-Korean phrase-based SMT system using syntactic information.",
        "Chinese-to-Korean SMT has more difficulties than the language pairs studied in previous research (French-English, German-English, and Chinese-English).",
        "From the viewpoint of language typology, these language pairs are all SVO languages and they have relatively simpler morphological inflections.",
        "On the other hand, Korean is an SOV and agglutinative language with relatively free word order and with complex and rich inflections.",
        "For the Chinese-to-Korean SMT, these systematic differences of the two languages make the generation of Korean verbal phrases very difficult.",
        "Firstly, the difference in the verb position of the two languages may not be reflected in the simple distortion model of a phrase-based SMT system.",
        "Secondly, Morphology generation of",
        "Korean verbs is difficult because of its complexity and the translation direction from a low-inflection language to a high-inflection language.",
        "In the following sections, we describe the characteristics of Korean verbal phrases and their corresponding Chinese verbal phrases, and present a set of handwritten syntactic reordering rules including Chinese verb phrases (VPs), preposition phrases (PPs), and modality-bearing words.",
        "In the latter sections, we empirically verify that our reordering rules effectively reposition source words to target language-like order and improve the translation results.",

        "Each eojeol in Korean consists of one or more base forms (stem morphemes or content morphemes) and their inflections (function morphemes).",
        "Inflections usually include postpositions and verb endings (verb affixes) of verbs and adjectives.",
        "These base forms and inflections are grammatical units in Korean, and they are defined as morphemes.",
        "As for the translation unit, eojeol cause data sparseness problems hence we consider a morpheme as a translation unit for Korean.",
        "As briefly mentioned in the previous section, Chinese and Korean belong to different wordorder typologies.",
        "The difference of verb position causes the difficulty in generating correct Korean verbal phrases.",
        "Also, the complexity of verb affixes in Korean verbs is problematic in SMT systems targeting Korean, especially if the source language is isolated.",
        "In the Dong-A newspaper corpus on which we carry out our experiments in Section 4, Korean function morphemes occupy 41.3% of all Korean morphemes.",
        "Verb endings consist of 40.3% of all Korean function words, and the average number of function morphemes inflected by a verb or an adjective is 1.94 while that of other content morphemes is only 0.7.",
        "These statistics indicate that the morphological form of Korean verbal phrases (Korean verbs) are significantly complex.",
        "A verbal phrase in Korean consists of a series of verb affixes along with a verb stem.",
        "A verb stem cannot be used by itself but should take at least one affix to form a verbal complex.",
        "Verb affixes in Korean are ordered in a relative sequence within a verbal complex (Lee, 1991) and express different modality information: tense, aspect, mood, negation, and voice (Figure 1).",
