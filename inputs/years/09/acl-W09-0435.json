        "Statistical machine translation (SMT) is currently the most promising approach to machine translation of large vocabulary tasks.",
        "The approach was first presented by Brown et al.",
        "(1993) and has since been used in many translation systems (Wang and Waibel, 1998), (Och and Ney, 2000), (Yamada and Knight, 2000), (Vogel et al., 2003).",
        "State-of-the-art SMT systems often use translation models based on phrases to describe translation correspondences and word reordering between two languages.",
        "The reordering of words is one of the main difficulties in machine translation.",
        "Phrase-based translation models by themselves have only limited capability to model different word orders in the source and target language, by capturing local reorderings within phrase pairs.",
        "In addition, the decoder can reorder phrases, subject to constraints such as confining reorderings to a relatively small window.",
        "In combination with a distance-based distortion model, some short-range reorderings can be handled.",
        "But for many language pairs this is not sufficient, and several authors have proposed additional reordering models as described in Section 2.",
        "In this work we present a new method that explicitly handles longrange word reorderings by applying discontinuous, POS-based reordering rules.",
        "The paper is structured as follows: In the next section we present related work that was carried out in this area.",
        "Afterwards, we describe the problem of long-range reordering.",
        "In Section 4 the existing framework for reordering will be introduced.",
        "Section 5 describes the extraction of rules modeling long-range reorderings, and in the following section the integration into the framework will be explained.",
        "Finally, the model will be evaluated in Section 7, and a conclusion is given in Section 8."

        "In recent years several approaches using reordering rules on the source side have been applied successfully in different systems.",
        "These rules can be used in rescoring as in Chen et al.",
        "(2006) or can be used in a preprocessing step.",
        "The aim of this step is to monotonize the source and target sentence.",
        "In Collins et al.",
        "(2005) and Popovic and Ney (2006) handmade rules were used to reorder the source side depending on information from a syntax tree or based on POS information.",
        "These rules had to be created manually, but only a few rules were needed and they were able to model long-range reorderings.",
        "Consequently, for every language pair these rules have to be created anew.",
        "In contrast, other authors propose data-driven methods.",
        "In Costa-jussa and Fonollosa (2006) the source sentence is first translated into an auxiliary sentence, whose word order is similar to the one of the target sentences.",
        "Thereby statistical word classes were used.",
        "Rottmann and Vogel (2008) used rules to reorder the source side and store different possible reorderings in a word lattice.",
        "They use POS tags and in the latter two cases also chunk tags to generalize the rules.",
        "The different reorderings are assigned weights depending on their relative frequencies (Rottmann and Vogel, 2007) or depending on a source side language model (Zhang et al., 2007).",
        "In the presented work we will use discontinuous rules in addition to the rules used in Rottmann and Vogel (2007).",

        "The two examples show that in order to be able to handle the reorderings between German and English, the model has to allow some words to be shifted across the whole sentence.",
        "If this is not handled correctly, phrase-based systems sometimes generate translations that omit words, as will be shown in Section 7.",

        "Then we decide during decoding which type of rules to use.",

        "Since this is done in a different way than for the continuous one, we will first describe it in detail.",
        "Like the continuous rules, the discontinuous ones are extracted from a word aligned corpus, whose source side is annotated with POS tags.",
        "Then the source side is scanned for reorderings.",
        "This is done by comparing the alignment points di and di+i of two consecutive words.",
        "We found a reordering if the target words aligned to fi and fi+iare in a different order than the source words.",
        "In our case the target word eai+1 has to precede the target word eai.",
        "More formally said, we check the following condition:",

        "There, for example, a reordering can be found at the position of the word \"Kenntnis\".",
        "Since we only check the links of consecutive words, we may miss some reorderings where there is an unaligned word between the words with a crossing link.",
        "However, in this case it is not clear where to place the unaligned word, so we do not extract rules from such a reordering.",
        "So now we have found a reordering and also the border between the left and right part of the reordering.",
        "To be able to extract a rule for this reordering we need to find the beginning of the left and the end of the right part.",
        "This is done by searching for the last word before and the first word after the reordering.",
        "In the given example, the left part is \"ihre Bereitschaft zur Kenntnis\" and the right part would be \"genommen\".",
        "As shown in the figure, the words of the first part have to be aligned to target words that follow the target word aligned to the first word of the right part.",
        "Otherwise, they would not be part of the reordering.",

        "To be able to write the rules in a easier way let fj' be the first word following fj that is aligned and fki the last word before fk .",
        "After extracting the reordering rule, we need to replace some parts of the rule by a placeholder to obtain more general rules.",
        "As described before, it is not directly clear which part of the rule should be replaced and therefore, we extract four different types of rules.",
        "In the reordering, there is always a left part, in our example ihre Bereitschaft zur Kenntnis, and a right part (genommen).",
        "So we can either replace the left or the right part of the reordering by a placeholder.",
        "One could argue that always the longer sequence should be replaced, since that is more intuitive, but to lose no information we just extract both types of rules.",
        "Later we will see that depending on the language pair, one or the other type will generalize better.",
        "In the evaluation part the different types will be referred to as Left and Right rules.",
        "Furthermore, not the whole part has to be replaced.",
        "It can be argued that the first or last word of the part is important to characterize the reordering and should therefore not be replaced.",
        "For each of the types described before, we extract two different subtypes of rules, which leads altogether to four different types of rules.",
        "Let us first have a look at the types where we replace the left part.",
        "If we replace the whole part, in the example we would get the following rule: * VVPP – VVPP *.",
        "This would lead to problems during rule application.",
        "Since the rule begins with a placeholder, it is not clear where the matching should start.",
        "Therefore, we also include the last word before the reordering into the rule and can now extract the following rule from the sentence: VAFIN * VVPP – VAFIN VVPP *.",
        "In general, we extract the following rule to which we will refer as Left All:",
        "As mentioned in the beginning, we extracted a second subtype of rule.",
        "This time, the first word of the left part is not replaced.",
        "The reason can be seen by looking at the reordered sequence.",
        "There, the second part of the reordering is moved between the last word before the reordering (fj) and the first word of the first part (fj+i).",
        "In our example this results in the following rule: VAFIN PPOSAT * VVPP – VAFIN VVPP PPOSAT * and in general, we extract the rule (Left Part):",
        "If we replace the right part by a star, we similarly get the following rule (Right All): PPOSAT NNAPPARTNN * – * PPOSAT NN APPART NN.",
        "The other rule (Right Part) can not be extracted from this example, since the right part has length one.",
        "But in general we get the two rules:",
        "Here we already see that the rules where the first part is replaced result in typical reordering between the German and English language.",

        "These restrictions limit the number of reorder-ings that have to be tested during decoding.",

        "Thus it is hard to understand the meaning of the sentence.",
        "In the other two examples the verb of the subordinate clause has to be moved from the last position in the German sentence to the second position in the English one.",
        "This is again only possible using the long-range reordering rules.",
        "Furthermore, if these rules are not used, it is possible that the verb will be not translated at all as in the last example.",
        "We also performed similar experiments on the German-French task.",
        "Since the type of reordering needed for this language pair is similar to the one used in the German-English task, we used also the Left rules in the long-range reorderings.",
        "As it can be seen in Table 5, the long-range reordering rules could also help to improve the translation performance for this language pair.",
        "The improvement on the EPPS task is significant at a level of 5%.",
        "In a last group of experiments we applied the same approach also to the English-German translation task.",
        "In this case the verb has to be moved to the right, so that we used the Right rules for the long-range reorderings.",
        "Looking at the rule usage of the different type of rules, the picture was quite promising.",
        "This time the Right rules could be applied more often and the Left ones only a few times.",
        "But if we look at the results as shown in Table 6, the long-range reorderings do not improve the performance.",
        "We will investigate the reasons for this in future work.",

        "We have presented a new method to model longrange reorderings in statistical machine translation.",
        "This method extends a framework based on extracting POS-based reordering rules from an aligned parallel corpus by adding discontinuous reordering rules.",
        "Allowing rules with gaps captures very long-range reorderings while avoiding the data sparseness problem of very long continuous reordering rules.",
        "The extracted rules are used to generate a word lattice with different possible reorderings of the source sentence in a preprocessing step prior to decoding.",
        "Placing various restrictions on the application of the rules keeps the lattice small enough for efficient decoding.",
        "Compared to a baseline system that only uses continuous reordering rules, applying additional discontinuous rules improved the translation performance on a German-English translation task significantly by up to 0.8 BLEU points.",
        "In contrast to approaches like Collins et al.",
        "(2005) and Popovic and Ney (2006), the rules are created in a data-driven way and not manually.",
        "It was therefore easily possible to transfer this approach to the German-French translation task, and we showed that we could improve the translation quality for this language pair as well.",
        "Furthermore, this approach needs only the POS information and no syntax tree.",
        "Thus, if we use the approximation for the tags as described before, the approach could also easily be integrated into a real-time translation system.",
        "An unsolved problem is still why this approach does not improve the results ofthe English-German translation task.",
        "An explanation might be that here the reordering problem is even more difficult, since the German word order is very free."
