        "The performance of a translation system depends on the complex interaction of several different components.",
        "Since metrics assess only output, they fail to inform us about the consequences of these interactions, and thus provide no insight into the errors made by a system, or into the design tradeoffs of competing systems.",
        "In this work, we show that it is possible to obtain such insights by analyzing translation system components in isolation.",
        "We focus on model search spaces (§2), posing a very simple question: Given a model and a sentence pair, does the search space contain the sentence pair?",
        "Applying this method to the analysis and comparison of French-English translation using both phrase-based and hierarchical phrase-based systems yields surprising results, which we analyze quantitatively and qualitatively.",

        "We find that low weight phrase translations typically discarded by heuristic pruning nearly triples the number of reference sentences that can be exactly reconstructed by either model (§3).",
        "• Second, we find that the high-probability regions in the search spaces of phrase-based and hierarchical systems are nearly identical (§4).",
        "This means that reported differences between the models are due to their rankings of competing hypotheses, rather than structural differences of the derivations they produce."

        "For this particular subset the capability of the hierarchical system to capture long-distance reorderings did not make the difference, but rather the ability to drop words within a translation rule.",
        "The phrase-based system cannot learn many rules which omit the translation of words because we disallowed unaligned words at phrase edges.",
        "The hierarchical system has the same restriction, but the constraint does not prohibit rules which have unaligned words within the rule.",
        "This allows the hierarchical system to learn rules such as the one presented above.",
        "The phrase-based system can learn similar knowledge, although less general, if it is allowed to have unaligned words at the phrase edges.",
        "In fact, without this constraint 13 out of the 20 analysed rules can be generated by the phrase-based system.",
        "Figure 5 shows a seemingly simple hierarchical translation which fails to be constructed by the phrase-based system: The second rule application involves both the reordering of the translation of postaux and the omittance of a translation for concurrence.",
        "This translation could be easily captured by a phrase-pair, however, it requires that the training data contains exactly such an example which was not the case.",
        "The closest rule the phrase-based rulestore contains is des services postaux / postal services which fails since it does not cover all of the input.",
        "This is an example for when the generalisation of the hierarchical model is superior to the phrase-based approach.",
        "5.5.3 Qualitative Analysis of Unreachable Phrase-based Translations",
        "The size of the set of unreachable phrase-based translations is only 0.6% or 12 sentences.",
        "This means that almost all of the 1-best outputs of the phrase-based translations can be reached by the hierarchical system.",
        "Similarly to above, we analysed which words of the input as well as which words of the phrase-based translation can be covered by the available hierarchical translation rules.",
        "We found that all of the translations were not generable because of the second structural difference we identified in §4.",
        "The hierarchical rule-set did not contain a rule with the necessary lexical evidence to perform the same reordering as the phrase-based model.",
        "Figure 6 shows a phrase-based translation which could not be reached by the hierarchical system because a rule of the form X – electoralesX<^/Xjjjelectoral would be required to move the translation of electorales (electoral) just before the translation of reunions (meetings).",
        "Inspection of the hierarchical ruleset reveals that such a rule is not available and so the translation cannot be generated.",
        "The small size of the set of unreachable phrase-based translations shows that the lexically informed reordering mechanism of the hierarchical model is not a large obstacle in generating most of the phrase-based outputs.",
        "In summary, each system can reproduce nearly all of the highest-scoring outputs of the other system.",
        "This shows that the 1-best regions of both systems are nearly identical despite the differences discussed in §4.",
        "This means that differences in observed system performance are probably attributable to the degree of model error and search error in each system."

        "Sparse distributions are common in natural language processing, and machine translation is no exception.",
        "We showed that utilizing more of the entire distribution can dramatically improve the coverage of translation models, and possibly their accuracy.",
        "Accounting for sparsity explicitly has achieved significant improvements in other areas such as in part of speech tagging (Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007).",
        "Considering the entire tail is challenging, since the search space grows exponentially with the number of translation options.",
        "A first step might be to use features that facilitate more variety in the top 20 translation options.",
        "A more elaborate aim is to look into alternatives to maximum likelihood hood estimation such as in Blunsom and Osborne (2008).",
        "Additionally, our expressiveness analysis shows clearly that the 1-best region of hierarchical and phrase-based models is nearly identical.",
        "Discounting cases in which systems handle unaligned words differently, we observe an overlap of between 96% and 99% across three language pairs.",
        "This implies that the main difference between the models is in their parameterization, rather than in the structural differences in the types of translations they can produce.",
        "Our results also suggest that the search spaces of both models are highly overlapping: The results for the 1-best region allow the conjecture that also other parts of the search space are behaving similarly since it appears rather unlikely that spaces are nearly disjoint with only the 1-best region being nearly identical.",
        "In future work we aim to use n-best lists or lattices to more precisely measure search space overlap.",
