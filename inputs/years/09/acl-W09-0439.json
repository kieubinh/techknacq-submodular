        "The most commonly used method for training feature weights in statistical machine translation (SMT) systems is Och's minimum error rate training (MERT) procedure.",
        "A well-known problem with Och's procedure is that it tends to be sensitive to small changes in the system, particularly when the number of features is large.",
        "In this paper, we quantify the stability of Och's procedure by supplying different random seeds to a core component of the procedure (Powell's algorithm).",

        "Most recent approaches in SMT, eg (Koehn et al., 2003; Chiang, 2005), use a log-linear model to combine probabilistic features.",
        "Minimum Error-Rate Training (MERT) aims to find the set of loglinear weights that yields the best translation performance on a development corpus according to some metric such as BLEU.",
        "This is an essential step in SMT training that can significantly improve performance on a test corpus compared to setting weights by hand.",
        "MERT is a difficult problem, however, because calculating BLEU as a function of log-linear weights requires decoding, which is an expensive operation.",
        "Moreover, because this function is not differentiable, efficient gradient-based optimization algorithms cannot be used.",
        "Och's procedure is the most widely-used version of MERT for SMT (Och, 2003).",
        "To reduce computational cost, it relies on the key technique of optimizing weights over n-best lists of translation hypotheses rather than over all possible hypotheses.",
        "This allows the most probable hypothesis under a given set of weights – and the corresponding BLEU score – to be found by enumerating n-best entries rather than decoding.",
        "Some variant on Powell's algorithm (Press et al., 2002) is typically used to maximize BLEU in this setting.",
        "The n-best lists are constructed by alternating decoding and BLEU maximization operations: decoding adds new hypotheses to the current lists, then BLEU is maximized over the lists to find new best weights for the subsequent decoding step, etc.",
        "This process continues until no new hypotheses are found.",
        "Och's procedure works well in practice, usually converging after 10-20 calls to the decoder, far fewer than would be required to maximize BLEU directly with a general-purpose optimization algorithm.",
        "However, it tends to be sensitive to small changes in the system, particularly for large feature sets.",
        "This is a well-known problem with Och's procedure (Och et al., 2004).",
        "It makes it difficult to assess the contribution of features, because the measured gain in performance due to a new feature can depend heavily on the setting of some apparently unrelated parameter such as the size of n-best list used.",
        "Features with the potential for statistically significant gains may be rejected because Och's procedure failed to find good weights for them.",
        "In this paper we attempt to quantify the stability of Och's procedure under different conditions by measuring the variation in test-set scores across different random seeds used with Powell's algorithm.",
        "We show that there is extensive variation for large feature sets, and that it is due to two main factors: the occasional failure of Och's procedure to find a good maximum on the development set, and the failure of some maxima to generalize to the test set.",
        "We analyze the causes ofeachofthese problems, and propose solutions for improving the stability of the overall procedure."

        "One possible approach to estimating log-linear weights on features is to dispense with the n-best lists employed by Och's procedure and, instead, to optimize weights by directly accessing the decoder.",
        "The disadvantage of this approach is that far more iterations of decoding of the full development set are required.",
        "In (Zens and Ney, 2004) the downhill simplex method is used to estimate the weights; around 200 iterations are required for convergence to occur.",
        "However, each iteration is unusually fast, because only monotone decoding is permitted (i.e., the order of phrases in the target language mirrors that in the source language).",
        "Similarly, Cettolo and Federico (2004) apply the simplex method to optimize weights directly using the decoder.",
        "In their experiments on NIST 2003 Chinese-English data, they found about 100 iterations of decoding were required.",
        "Although they obtained consistent and stable performance gains for MT, these were inferior to the gains yielded by Och's procedure in (Och, 2003).",
        "Taking Och's MERT procedure as a baseline, (Zens et al., 2007) experiment with different training criteria for SMT and obtain the best results for a criterion they call \"expected BLEU score\".",
        "Moore and Quirk (2008) share the goal underlying our own research: improving, rather than replacing, Och's MERT procedure.",
        "They focus on the step in the procedure where the set of feature weights optimizing BLEU (or some other MT metric) for an n-best list is estimated.",
        "Typically, several different starting points are tried for this set of weights; often, one of the starting points is the best set of weights found for the previous set of n-best hypotheses.",
        "The other starting points are often chosen randomly.",
        "In this paper, Moore and Quirk look at the best way of generating the random starting points; they find that starting points generated by a random walk from previous maxima are superior to those generated from a uniform distribution.",
        "The criterion used throughout the paper to judge the performance of MERT is the BLEU score on the development test set (rather than, for instance, the variance of that score, or the BLEU score on held-out test data).",
        "Another contribution of the paper is ingenious methods for pruning the set of n-best hypotheses at each iteration.",
        "Cer et al. (2008) also aim at improving Och's MERT.",
        "They focus on the search for the best set of weights for an n-best list that follows choice of a starting point.",
        "They propose a modified version of Powell's in which \"diagonal\" directions are chosen at random.",
        "They also modify the objective function used by Powell's to reflect the width of the optima found.",
        "They are able to show that their modified version of MERT outperforms both a version using Powell's, and a more heuristic search algorithm devised by Philipp Koehn that they call Koehn Coordinate Descent, as measured on the development set and two test data sets.",
        "(Duh and Kirchhoff, 2008) ingeniously uses MERT as a weak learner in a boosting algorithm that is applied to the n-best reranking task, with good results (a gain of about 0.8 BLEU on the test set).",
        "Recently, some interesting work has been done on what might be considered a generalization of Och's procedure (Macherey et al., 2008).",
        "In this generalization, candidate hypotheses in each iteration of the procedure are represented as lattices, rather than as n-best lists.",
        "This makes it possible for a far greater proportion of the search space to be represented: a graph density of 40 arcs per phrase was used, which corresponds to an n-best size of more than two octillion (2 * 10) entries.",
        "Experimental results for three NIST 2008 tasks were very encouraging: though BLEU scores for the lattice variant of Och's procedure did not typically exceed those for the n-best variant on development data, on test data the lattice variant outperformed the n-best approach by between 0.6 and 2.5 BLEU points.",
        "The convergence behaviour of the lattice variant was also much smoother than that of the n-best variant.",
        "It would be interesting to apply some of the insights of the current paper to the lattice variant of Och's procedure."

        "Och's procedure works as follows.",
        "First the decoder is run using an initial set of weights to generate n best translations (usually around 100) for each source sentence.",
        "These are added to existing n-best lists (initially empty).",
        "Next, Powell's algorithm is used to find the weights that maximize BLEU score when used to choose the best hypotheses from the n-best lists.",
        "These weights are plugged back into the decoder, and the process repeats, nominally until the n-best lists stop growing, but often in practice until some criterion of convergence such as minimum weight change is attained.",
        "The weights that give the best BLEU score when used with the decoder are output.",
        "The point of this procedure is to bypass direct search for the weights that result in maximum BLEU score, which would involve decoding using many different sets of weights in order to find which ones gave the best translations.",
        "Och's procedure typically runs the decoder only 10-20 times, which is probably at least one order ofmag-nitude fewer than a direct approach.",
        "The main trick is to build up n-best lists that are representative of the search space, in the sense that a given set of weights will give approximately the same BLEU score when used to choose the best hypotheses from the n-best lists as it would when decoding.",
        "By iterating, the algorithm avoids weights that give good scores on the n-best lists but bad ones with the decoder, since the bad hypotheses that are scored highly by such weights will get added to the n-best lists, thereby preventing the choice of these weights in future iterations.",
        "Unfortunately, there is no corresponding guarantee that weights which give good scores with the decoder but bad ones on the nbest lists will get chosen.",
        "Finding the set of weights that maximizes BLEU score over n-best lists is a relatively easy problem because candidate weight sets can be evaluated in time proportional to n (simply calculate the score of each hypothesis according to the current weight set, then measure BLEU on the highest scoring hypothesis for each source sentence).",
        "Powell's algorithm basically loops over each feature in turn, setting its weight to an optimum value before moving on.",
        "Och's linemax algorithm is used to perform this optimization efficiently and exactly.",
        "However this does not guarantee that Powell's algorithm will find a global maximum, and so Powell's is typically run with many different randomly-chosen initial weights in order to try to find a good maximum."

        "In essence, this uses the average BLEU score from the points close to a given maximum as a surrogate for the BLEU at the maximum, in order to penalize maxima that are \"narrow\" and therefore more likely to be spurious.",
        "While Cer et al. use this technique while maximizing along a single dimension within Powell's algorithm, we apply it over all dimensions with the vectors output from Powell's.",
        "Each individual weight is perturbed according to a normal distribution (with variance 1e-03), then the resulting vector is used to calculate BLEU over the n-best lists.",
        "The average score over 10 such perturbed vectors is used to calculate rbleu in the weight-selection method from the previous section.",
        "The results from regularized weight selection are compared to standard weight selection and to the baseline MERT algorithm in table 5.",
        "Regularization appears to have very little effect on the weight selection approach.",
        "This does not necessarily contradict the results of Cer et al., since it is applied in a very different setting.",
        "The standard weight selection technique (in combination with the reseeding and history accumulation strategies) gives a systematic improvement in average test-set BLEU score over the baseline, although it does not substantially reduce variance.",

        "In this paper, we have investigated the stability of Och's MERT algorithm using different random seeds within Powell's algorithm to simulate the effect of small changes to a system.",
        "We found that test-set BLEU scores can vary by 1 percent or more across 10 runs of Och's algorithm with different random seeds.",
        "Using a bootstrap analysis, we demonstrate that an effective, though expensive, way to stabilize MERT would be to run it many times (at least 7), then choose the weights that give best results on a held-out corpus.",
        "We propose less expensive simple strategies for avoiding local maxima that systematically improve testset BLEU scores averaged over 10 MERT runs, as well as reducing their variance in some cases.",
        "An attempt to improve on these strategies by regularizing BLEU was not effective.",
        "In future work, we plan to integrate improved variants on Powell's algorithm, which are orthogonal to the investigations reported here."
