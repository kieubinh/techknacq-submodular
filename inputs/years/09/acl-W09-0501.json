        "The occurrence of an ECF at that marked place, that is, at the punchline of the telling, is associated with issues of affiliation and stance since it is placed exactly before the recipient's slot upon story completion, which is a regular place for the occurrence of evaluation (Schegloff, 1984)."

        "This article reports some of the findings of a study of extreme case formulations (ECFs) (Edwards, 2000; Pomerantz, 1986) in spontaneous conversations exclusively conducted in Cypriot Greek.",
        "In a seminal article, Pomerantz (1986) drew attention to the conversational uses of extreme case formulations (ECFs).",
        "Edwards (2000: 3478) explains that ECFs are \"descriptions or assessments that deploy extreme expressions such as every, all, none, best, least, as good as it gets, always, perfectly, brand new, and absolutely\".",
        "Pomerantz (1986: 219-220) summarizes the three main uses of ECFs, mainly used in complaints, in the following way:",
        "(1) to assert the strongest case in anticipation of non-sympathetic hearings, (2) to propose the cause of a phenomenon,",
        "(3) to speak for the rightness (wrongness) of a practice.",
        "Pomerantz's (1986) three uses of ECFs are basically oppositional and argumentative, occurring in environments where descriptions and assessments are being strengthened or resisted.",
        "As Edwards (2000) showed this applies to his counselling data (1995) too, where wife and husband produce and defend opposed versions of facts.",
        "In this data a lot of ECFs follow the same sequential pattern of \"ECF-challenge-softener\".",
        "Although Pomerantz (1986) did not pursue post-ECF talk, she noted the challenge after an ECF.",
        "However, as Edwards notes (2000: 360), ECFs can also occur in affiliative sequences as \"upgrades and displays of affiliation being done, of agreement being full and so on\" as in Pomerantz's (1984) demonstration of how upgraded \"second assessments\" display agreement.",
        "ECFs make excellent upgrades (id.).",
        "Added to this role, ECFs might be treated by participants as \"indexing the speaker's stance or attitude\", what Edwards calls \"investments\" (op.cit.: 363-4).",
        "As Edwards explains (id.) denying or insisting on something in an extreme way can highlight the action of denying or insisting, as a kind of stance or attitude (cf. Edwards & Potter, 1992; Potter 1996).",
        "Finally, Edwards (2000: 365) draws attention to the \"nonliteral or metaphoric uses of ECFs\" used in actions of exaggerating, teasing, ironizing, emphasizing, joking etc."

      "text": [
        "The study of ECFs investigated in this work is based on recordings of informal, spontaneous, face-to-face conversations among close friends or relatives.",
        "These are exclusively conducted in Cypriot Greek.",
        "The conversations transcribed for the present study are part of a collection of recordings that took place between December 1998 and April 2003.",
        "They comprise transcriptions of 35 hours of tape-recorded natural interactions produced by young native Cypriot Greek speakers during a variety of gatherings or occasions, e.g. dinner, gathering for coffee in friends' houses etc.",
        "The extracts included in this article comprise transcriptions of approximately 3 hour.",
        "The recordings consist of same sex conversations among women.",
        "The method that is adopted in the analysis of the data is Conversation Analysis (CA), which has its origins in the pioneering work in the sixties by the sociologist Harvey Sacks (1992a, 1992b).",
        "First and foremost, conversation analysis has focused its analytical attention on \"recorded, naturally occurring talk-in-interaction\" (Hutchby and Wooffitt, 1998: 14).",
        "These recordings of actual speech are transcribed using a system which is intended to capture in detail the characteristics \"of the sequencing of turns, including gaps, pauses and overlaps; and the element of speech delivery such as audible breath and laughter, stress, enunciation, intonation and pitch\" (Hutchby and Drew, 1995:",
        "182).",
        "The transcription symbols used in this study are based on the transcription conventions developed by Jefferson for the analysis of conversational turns in English conversation (see Sacks, Schegloff and Jefferson, 1974) and are adopted in the form presented by Ochs, Schegloff and Thompson (1996) and Clift (1999).",
        "The relevant transcription symbols for this study are cited in appendix I.",
        "The phonetic inventory used for reading transcription is based on the International Phonetic Association [IPA] which is adjusted to the Greek language by Nespor (1999) and on the phonetic inventory of Cypriot Greek presented and described by Newton (1972)."

      "text": [
        "My data of spontaneous Cypriot-Greek conversations confirms Edwards's (2000) and Pomerantz's claim (1986) of the use of ECFs in making complaints.",
        "In particular, this study reports a pattern of the sequential and interactional position of ECFs found in the reporting of \"opposition-type stories\" (Schegloff, 1984) and in complaining about a non-present party's misbehaviour.",
        "In the conversations examined here, complaining is expressed with the narration of two-party opposition-type stories in which the teller is one of the two parties involved.",
        "In particular, opposition-type stories are reported using the BCBC format, B being the teller and C his/her opponent.",
        "Thus, that BCBC format tracks not only the alternation of the turns but also the alternation of positions.",
        "This formula turns out to have C's position be the one occupying the last turn (Schegloff, 1984).",
        "By \"reproducing the \"original\" utterance or utterances, speakers can provide access to the interaction being discussed, enabling the recipient to assess it for himself.",
        "Supplying this kind of evidence is important when.....a complaint is made about someone based on what they said\" (Holt, 1996: 229).",
        "It seems that the basic feature attributed to opposition type stories is that they are more than any other form of storytelling \"recipient designed\" (Sacks, 1971: 453).",
        "If this is so, it means that tellers design the storytelling with an orientation to the specific recipients in order to elicit their affiliative siding.",
        "In the fragments under study where the teller is one of the opposing parties, it is obviously important for the teller to transmit to her recipients the correctness or appropriateness of her position and the incorrectness or inappropriateness of her opponent's position.",
        "In these extracts the teller invests special effort in constructing the contrast between herself and her opponent in two interrelated ways.",
        "Therefore, this is accomplished by narrating an opposition-type story based on the conversation she had with the opponent and by reporting the activities of the opponent parties which proposes the significance of the upcoming reported speech.",
        "Each story culminates in a report of the other's speech.",
        "The motivation for the reporting of speech and activities is grounded in considerations of affiliation and stance.",
        "Actually in the conversations examined in this paper the oppositional story has its punchline in the reporting of an ECF attributed to the third non-present party.",
        "One thing the recipient can do is to side with one or the other, that is, teller/protagonist or his/her opponent.",
        "Usually recipients side with tellers because this is how tellers choose their story recipients (Schegloff, 1984).",
        "In the cases here the reported ECF is responded to with a challenge taking the form of rhetorical question, extreme case formulation, idiomatic expression or ironic evaluation.",
        "Stories involve extended single turns at talk (Sacks, 1968: 18).",
        "The storytelling sequence is composed \"of three serially ordered and adjacently placed types of sequences\": \"the preface, the telling, and the response sequences\" (Sacks, 1974: My main interest is in the punchline and the recipient's slot upon story completion.",
        "Due to the limit of space, I present only two representative examples of the use ECF in the punchline of opposition-type stories as shown in the extract 1 and 2 that follow.",
        "(D = Dorina; T = Themis; M = Maria; C = Christiana; L = Litsa; N = Nitsa.",
        "All of the women participating in the conversation except",
        "Dorina are teachers working in the same school.",
        "Dorina is a psychologist qualified by the Ministry of Education to visit some specific primary schools and check the welfare of children.",
        "Now she is narrating the story of a child in one of the schools she visited.)"
