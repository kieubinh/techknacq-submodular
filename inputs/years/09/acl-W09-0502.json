        "This paper focuses on the segmentation ofrequests in spoken language from a semantic-pragmatic perspective.",
        "Taxonomies exist for specific types of requests, and general dialogue-acts taxonomies like DAMSL cover various types of utterances 'influencing the addressee's future action' (Core and Allen, 1997; Stolcke et al., 2000).",
        "The aim is not to replace them – the former are finer-grained than what is proposed here, and the latter have the advantage of treating requests in a framework which includes other types of dialogue acts.",
        "The purpose of this paper is rather to contribute to a middle-ground, with distinctions general enough to encompass all types of action requests (assuming that a common process of 'requesting' underlies them), yet detailed and structured enough to account for the construction of their meaning.",
        "The goal is therefore not to provide a taxonomy identifying speech or dialogue acts in 'shallow' discourse structure (Jurafsky et al., 1997), but a structured explanatory taxonomy of requesting means.",
        "The scope is 'requests for action' taken in a broad sense, as exemplified by (1-3).",
        "(1) Err / hmm / you know / it would probably be easiest if I just squeezed back there and poked around myself / would that be alright with you?",

        "(2) Mister Masry?",
        "// [-Yeah //] I was wondering can you tell me who I talk to / about maybe getting an advance on my paycheck // Just / for the weekend //",
        "'Request' is understood broadly to include the whole spectrum of invitations, entreaties, commands, etc.",
        "'Action' is understood broadly in the sense that the scope includes requests for clarification (e.g. 'Who said it?",
        "'); for attention, as 'Now you listen' in (3) or 'Mr Masry?'",
        "in (2); for confirmation, as 'You got that?'",
        "in (3); and of course what corresponds to a narrow understanding of the expression 'action requests', namely requests for actions not concerned with dialogue management, as the request to allow the speaker of (1) into the file room of the county water board, the request to direct the speaker of (2) to the right person, or the request not to follow the speaker of (3).",
        "The scope excludes 'true' questions (unmarked information requests in which no significant attempt to further influence the addressee is traced).",
        "The main question of this paper is: What definition of a 'request' should we work with, if we are to describe the outer boundaries and the inner complexity of requests in a way that enables mod-elization and quantification of request strategies?",

        "One aspect of language interactions which tends to be oversimplified is the relationship between a 'request' and its instantiation.",
        "True, with 'indirect requests', traditional pragmatics cast light on the gap between the 'illocutionary act' of requesting and the 'locutionary act' (or the 'literal' elements) used to express it.",
        "To bridge this gap, it focused on the contextual felicity-conditions of utterances, or on the conversational implicatures, the maxims, the inference rules or the cognitive faculties that enable us to construe their meaning (Austin, 1962; Searle, 1969; Searle, 1979; Grice, 1975; Perrault and Allen, 1980; Lenci, 1994, etc.",
        "); but all too often, the very examples given as a starting point to such analyses are far too simple, as the signifier of the request is almost invariably composed of one isolated, syntactically pure segment.",
        "Pragmatic analyses of this kind encourage an idealized vision of language interactions, in which a request (and more generally a speech act) coincides perfectly with one stand-alone, clear-cut and atemporal piece of language.",
        "More recent 'cue-based' (Jurafsky and Martin, 2000) probabilistic approaches, on the other hand, give an increasingly accurate surface description of empirical dialogues as successions of normalized 'moves' or 'dialogue acts' (Carletta et al., 1997; Stolcke et al., 2000); but the normalization of sequences as distinct 'utterances' also encourages an atomistic, 'one segment, one act' vision.Yet, as far as semantic-pragmatic representation is concerned, it is artificial and problematic to imagine that a request corresponds to a 'block' of signifier (§2.1) and to a 'block' of meaning (§2.2).",
        "Spoken corpora show that requests are rarely composed of one clause or one simple clause-complex (though dialogue management requests might tend to correspond to monosegmental clauses or fragments).",
        "The majority of requests take the form of several increments of various syntactic, semantic and pragmatic types, often with repetitions of increments, interruptions from the co-interactants (and from the speakers themselves), embedded phases of negotiation, etc.",
        "The safest way to approach the problem is therefore to consider that a priori every request instantiation is likely to have a discontinuous signifier and extensible boundaries.",
        "Requesting: a real-time process",
        "Even assigning the beginning and the end of a 'request' in a linear transcription can prove difficult, as shown by some seemingly simple, supposedly straightforward 'imperative' requests:",
        "The police officer who utters (4) points successively at two different locations in a tunnel in which he is walking with his staff.",
        "It is therefore not a problem to say that the two clauses in this sequence correspond to two different requests.",
        "When some time later the police officer corners a fugitive and shouts (5), this 'bijective' analysis does not hold anymore: the officer does not want two separate actions of 'putting the gun down'.",
        "To consider the segment 'Put that gun down' as 'a request' would force us to consider the second segment, as well as 'now', as so many 'requests', since each of the three segments, in the situation, is pronounced in order to trigger an action.",
        "It is preferable to say that the three increments instantiate one same request.",
        "The reason is, that all throughout the speech sequence, the police officer has one result in mind only, and the fulfillment of his request at any moment of the sequence would in fact render the subsequent increments useless and even incoherent (which is not the case in (4)).The situation of a 'surjective' relationship between the speech increments and the acts they perform occurs in cases like (5) because the instantiation of action-requests rarely fits the ideal scenario according to which one 'block' stimulus triggers one clear reaction (or not), as summarized in the left part of Figure 1.",
        "Spoken language being a real-time process, interactants habitually take into consideration the current state of the world, checking whether their expectations have been met (and probably in a scalar not a polar way), and deciding whether more stimulation (seen as process) is necessary.",
        "In other words, the perlocutionary (the set of effects of the utterance) may influence the locutionary in return, as long as the world differs from what the speakers would like it to be; and as long as the speakers do not recognize the product of their intention in the world, they have to choose between several options: repeat, rephrase, modify the extent of, or abandon their requests.",
        "To account for this, one must consider request-instantiation not as an end-product but as a process, not as 'act' but as action in progress.",
        "This is summarized in the right part of Figure 1.",
        "locutionary event(s) \"time of / perlocutionary reference\"",
        "Both ways: Interpretations, decisions, adjustments",
        "The speech/act fracture",
        "The problem of the instantiation of requests reaches in fact deeper than the 'mere' real-time calculation of an intention/effects (and /cost) ratio on the part of the speaker.",
        "Speech being linear, any request that uses spoken language for its instantiation will extend over a certain span.",
        "Often, the length of that span is primarily accounted for by the internal complexity of the request instantiation, even before it becomes relevant to assess the perlocutionary.",
        "That a radical fracture must be acknowledged between the speech elements used and the act performed is exemplified by (6), uttered in an emergency ward by a chief-doctor who is examining a patient, to a fellow doctor who is taking care of another patient a few meters away.",
        "It is tempting to analyze (6) as a request preceded by a specification of its target and followed by an explanation of its motive.",
        "The problem with this 'narrow' analysis is that it forces major descriptive changes when possible variants are taken into consideration, such as (6') and (6\") (assuming that, in the situation, they could have produced the same effect).",
        "It seems indeed difficult to describe the increment 'I need you' as a 'request' in (6') but as a mere explanation, 'banalized' by the presence of the imperative increment, in (6); and it seems equally difficult to hold that the vocative increment 'Al' falls within the scope of the request in (6'') but outside of it in (6).",
        "The 'narrow' analysis presented above results from a vision of request instantiations in EITHER/OR terms within a limited range of clear-cut strategies (sometimes reduced to clause-types).",
        "However, the comparison of common requests such as (6) with their possible variants shows that the very idea of pinpointing one increment (usually a sentence) as the support of the request is taken at fault – so much so that the distinction between 'direct' and 'indirect' speech acts falls.",
        "Imperative clauses may retain a specificity compared with other segments (see further on), but the facts remain that (a) countless requests are instantiated by several increments, (b) a great number of these increments might suffice to instantiate the corresponding request alone, (c) none of these increments can claim to be ' the segment of speech that performs the act', and therefore (d) all of the increments, far from excluding one another from the request instantiation, contribute to it.",
        "From this perspective, the semantic-pragmatic segmentation of requests in spoken language consists in, first, identifying the increments involved in 'carrying out' the request and, second, determining the contribution of each increment to the whole.",
        "It seems doubtful, however, that the meaning of a request should be the simple, compositional addition of the meanings of its increments.",
        "One reason is that the increments of a request are often semantically and pragmatically heterogeneous (the three increments in (6) are by no means equatable), and their modes of contribution are therefore several.",
        "If heterogeneity is not a problem for the interactants, it is probably because they rely on a broader and more flexible vision of a request's meaning than is often acknowledged.",
        "Why do speakers formulate requests?",
        "In most cases, the goal is not to actually witness an action.",
        "The speaker of (4) is not interested in 'seeing' his staff set up spotlights because he said so, nor is the speaker of (6) interested in 'seeing' 'Al' come over to her (if it were the case, motive increments such as 'I need you' would be incoherent, except maybe as ploys).",
        "The officer wants the tunnel to be lit, and the doctor wants immediate help from a colleague nearby.",
        "Each of these requests is therefore meant to bring about a specific situation.",
        "To be sure, the ultimate object of most requests is a desired state of the world – not an action; and the possible actions of the co-interactant(s) often have value not of themselves but primarily as a step towards the advent of that state.",
        "A useful way to represent the speaker's mental context preceding a request instantiation is therefore to distinguish several 'worlds' roughly seen as static – the current world and the possible worlds (including the target world but also undesired worlds, maybe others still) – separated by a dynamic 'transition situation' which includes the possible actions of the co-interactants and the possibility for the speaker to stimulate them into enacting them.",
        "Stating the reason that makes the target-world desirable ('I need you') or naming, with an imperative, the action that can bring about this world ('Come here'), are two ways, not mutually exclusive, to reach the desired situation.",
        "Other increments could be added without 'exhausting' the meaning of the request, i.e. without instantiating a new or different one.",
        "Thus, the meaning of a request is often alluded to jointly by several elements which emphasize various parameters of the worlds or of the transition situation considered, along with elements referring to the process of requesting itself.",
        "Even when a speaker resorts to the imperative in order to call for an action, it is habitually clear to all that this action is to be enacted in the name of something else.",
        "The functioning of a request is therefore always metonymic (i.e. based on a radical speech/act fracture) in the sense that increments focus on one element or another and yet instantiate the whole request.",
        "Requests might therefore be best described not as 'attempts.",
        ".",
        ".",
        "by the speaker to get the hearer to do something' (Searle, 1979, p. 13) but rather as attempts to involve the addressee into a plan devised to reach a target world – a plan defined especially (but never exclusively) by the projected action(s) of the addressee.",
        "In this perspective, the increments not naming the projected action are not seen as the conditions meant to help the addressee decode that action (in traditional pragmatic examples, these elements strangely disappear in the presence of the imperative); they are understood here as part of the general strategy of sharing of a plan that takes place when a request is instantiated (a 'sharing' which can, of course, be minimal)."

        "The task is therefore to find out which ranks are relevant for the study of requests and what primary distinctions should be acknowledged between the units of these ranks.",
        "Part of what defines a request instantiation is, purely and simply, its 'Universe', understood as what entities, concepts, qualities and relations are verbalized (and regardless of the way they are).",
        "One level of description (at least) should therefore be dedicated to distinctions between the types of elements that appear in speech.",
        "Since the 'Universe' of speakers is not objective but rather peopled and structured by what makes sense in their world-views, some elements are given more prominence than others among the 'worlds and the 'transition situation assumed above.",

        "Regularly, however, actions are named which are not the head-action of the request.",
        "What is verbalized often corresponds either to a ' sub-action of the head-action hoped for, or to a ' germane action which is not a necessary subpart of the head-action but is, in the context, related to it and meant to trigger it.",

        "Other elements than actions are found in the verbalized 'Universe of a request instantiation.",
        "People and objects are often named, some more than others.",
        "Addressees are crucial interactants as they are often hoped to become the agents of the projected head-actions, and they are therefore often named in separate increments (especially to attract their attention, as in (2), or to modalize the request).",
        "In a similar way, the notion of head-object can be useful to refer to those objects that occupy a central position in the representation of the head-action.",
        "Indeed, head-objects are so important on the 'mind map of the speaker that they are commonly named without the action itself ('Scalpel in an operating room, 'The door!",
        "', etc.).",
        "Sometimes, these objects are accompanied by other elements which help specify what is to be done, especially the location where the action is to take place or end.",
        "When people, objects, locations or other elements are verbalized outside the net ofre-lationships found in clauses, they are often pointed at through speech, and the manner can be said to be ' indexical .",
        "Table 1 illustrates the concepts of 'head' action, object and location (FUG_0h36m49s).",
        "If the target-situation is desired (and if other situations, including the current one, are unwanted), it is usually because a change would be beneficial to someone or something (the speaker, the addressee, other people, institutions, moral principles, etc.).",

').",
        "The prosodic boundaries both signal and enact a reorganization of the roles and importance of verbalized elements under pragmatic considerations – a reorganization for which syntactic distinctions fail to account, and which might be erased or downplayed when increments are normalized into 'utterances'.",
        "Still, 'Just' does not function alone.",
        "An accurate semantic-pragmatic description should be able to render the facts (a) that signs have meaning in isolation, (b) that they enter in meaningful larger syntactic structures (on which traditional corpus segmentation has focused) and (c) that prosodic cues often cut through these structures or fuse several of them, an operation of (re)organization which is of semantic-pragmatic relevance.",

        "One theoretical limitation is that this approach, in its current form, does not cover the use of metaphoric language and more generally the lexical contribution of a number of elements (for instance, the nonprofessional and vague verb 'to poke around in (1) is not chosen by chance instead of, say, 'to search for the legal records my firm needs').",
        "As important is the need to take prosody into fuller account and to include nonverbal cues.",
        "Another issue is the fact that repair, backchannel and overlapping tend to be more common in spontaneous speech than in films (work in preparation); these phenomena (all of which can be of pragmatic significance in the context of request-formulation), as well as turn-taking, must be better integrated.",
        "On the plus side, this approach has the advantage of trying to bridge the gap, with strong empirical emphasis, between 'emic parameters such as the speakers beliefs, desires and intentions, and 'etic' cues from the signifier (Pike, 1954; Blum-Kulka, 1981; Reiss, 1985; Jurafsky, 2004).",
        "By focusing on the contribution of increments to the construction of meaning, and by running statistics to reveal which types of increments are used by speakers in which context and according to which concatenation patterns, we should eventually be able to draw a picture of the strategies – conscious or routinized – used when requesting."

        "Traditional speech act theory rests primarily on the structure of isolated sentences.",

        "'Cue-based approaches designed to recognize atomic acts can give accurate descriptions of the speech surface; but the treatment of each unit as 'act tends to blur the deeper interrelations.",
        "The approach presented here, based on the loose inclusion of a lower semantic level under a higher pragmatic level via a structural level, suggests that, as far as the representation of spontaneous spoken language is concerned, gains might be made by broadening the scope of dialogue acts and 'lowering' the aim from the identification of distinct acts to that of the means of their instantiation."
