        "Spontaneous speech, even assuming a perfect ASR, is hard to parse because of the enormous occurrence of disfluencies and syntactic deviations.",
        "Some disfluencies can be regarded as speaker's errors, which are being corrected or remain uncorrected during the speaker's turn.",
        "Such disfluencies are e.g.:",
        "• stammering (We w-went there to-together)",
        "• restart with or without an interregnum",
        "(John no sorry Jane was there, too)",
        "• repetitions (So you like you",
        "like drinking)",
        "• hesitation sounds, long silence, fillers, filler phrases, etc.",
        "(EH so ... you kinda like you know HMM drinking)",
        "In NLP, such disfluencies can be removed before any syntactic or semantic processing since they cause confusion without adding any semantic information.",
        "In machine-learning tasks, dis-fluency is sought to be automatically removed by learning from disfluency-marked corpora or corpora of text edits (Hajic et al., 2008; Fitzgerald and Jelinek, 2008) to smooth the input text into written-language standard before parsing.",
        "On the other hand, there is another sort of dis-fluencies, which do not disturb the course of the dialog, namely contextual ellipsis: even though most people remember being taught at school to answer questions with a complete sentence, not even educated speakers performing a sophisticated dialog always do so, and yet they do not sound incorrect.",
        "Clearly, an extensive use of ellipsis is an inherent feature of verbal interaction between speakers, which is usually smoothly perceived by the listener and thus all right in its place.",
        "Such \"fragmentary utterances that do not have the form of a full sentence according to most traditional grammars, but that nevertheless convey a complete clausal meaning\" are called non-sentential utterances (NSUs).",
        "A consistent reconstruction of their clausal meaning is inevitable for any semantic representation of dialogs.",

        "The confrontation of our current annotation scheme with spoken dialog data has raised issues of ellipsis restoration and textual coreference in non-sentential utterances.",
        "We have found common relations between non-sentential utterances and their contexts, and we have integrated them into our semantic annotation scheme without violating its general principles.",
        "A tentative manual annotation of these relations in a small corpus suggests that such annotation is feasible.",
        "Further investigation on larger data along with machine-learning experiments is intended."
