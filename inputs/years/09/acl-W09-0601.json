        "Many people have difficulty in communicating linguistically because of cognitive or motor impairments.",
        "Such people typically use communication aids to help them interact with other people.",
        "Such communication aids range from simple tools that do not involve computers, such as picture cards, to complex software systems that attempt to \"speak\" for the impaired user.",
        "From a technological perspective, even the most complex communication aids have typically been based on fixed (canned) texts or simple fill-in-the-blank templates; essentially the user selects a text or template from a set of possible utterances, and the system utters it.",
        "We believe that while this may be adequate if the user is simply making a request (e.g., please give me a drink) or answering a question (e.g., I live at home), it is not adequate if the user has a more complex communicative goal, such as engaging in social interaction, or telling a story.",

        "Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) is a term that describes a variety of methods of communication for non-speaking people which can supplement or replace speech.",
        "The term covers techniques which require no equipment, such as sign language and cards with images; and also more technologically complex systems which use speech synthesis and a variety of strategies to create utterances.",
        "The most flexible AAC systems allow users to specify arbitrary words, but communication rates are extremely low, averaging 2-10 words per minute.",
        "This is because many AAC users interact slowly with computers because of their impairments.",
        "For example, some of the children we work with cannot use their hands, so they use scanning interfaces with head switches.",
        "In other words, the computer displays a number of op-",
        "on Natural Language Generation, pages 1-8, 9 Association for Computational Linguistics",
        "tions to them, and then scans through these, briefly highlighting each option.",
        "When the desired option is highlighted, the child selects it by pressing a switch with her head.",
        "This is adequate for communicating basic needs (such as hunger or thirst); the computer can display a menu of possible needs, and the child can select one of the items.",
        "But creating arbitrary messages with such an interface is extremely slow, even if word prediction is used; and in general such interfaces do not well support complex social interactions such as story telling (Waller, 2006).",
        "A number of research projects in AAC have developed prototype systems which attempt to facilitate this type of human-human interaction.",
        "At their most basic, these systems provide users with a library of fixed \"conversational moves\" which can be selected and uttered.",
        "These moves are based on models of the usual shape and content of conversational encounters (Todman & Alm, 2003), and for example include standard conversational openings and closings, such as Hello and How are you.",
        "They also include backchannel communication such as Uh-huh, Great!, and Sorry, can you repeat that.",
        "It would be very useful to go beyond standard openings, closings, and backchannel messages, and allow the user to select utterances which were relevant to the particular communicative context and goals.",
        "Dye et al. (1998) developed a system based on scripts of common interactions (Schank & Abelson, 1977).",
        "For example, a user could activate the MakeAnAppointment script, and then could select utterances relevant to this script, such as I would like to make an appointment to see the doctor.",
        "As the interaction progressed, the system would update the selections offered to the user based on the current stage of the script; for example during time negotiation a possible utterance would be I would like to see him next week.",
        "This system proved effective in trials, but needed a large number of scripts to be generally effective.",
        "Users could author their own texts, which were added to the scripts, but this was time-consuming and had to be done in advance of the conversation.",
        "Another goal of AAC is to help users narrate stories.",
        "Narrative and storytelling play a very important part in the communicative repertoire of all speakers (Schank, 1990).",
        "In particular, the ability to draw on episodes from one's life history in current conversation is vital to maintaining a full impression of one's personality in dealing with others (Polkinghorne, 1991).",
        "Story telling tools for AAC users have been developed, which include ways to introduce a story, tell it at the pace required (with diversions) and give feedback to comments from listeners (Waller, 2006); but again these tools are based on a library of fixed texts and templates.",
        "Natural language generation (NLG) systems generate texts in English and other human languages from non-linguistic input (Reiter and",
        "Newell, Langer, and Hickey (1998) suggest that NLG could be used to generate complete utterances from the limited input that AAC users are able to provide.",
        "For example, the Compansion project (McCoy, Pennington, Badman 1998) used NLP and NLG techniques to expand telegraphic user input, such as Mary go store?, into complete utterances, such as Did Mary go to the store?",
        "Netzer and Elhadad (2006) allowed users to author utterances in the symbolic language BLISS, and used NLG to translate this to English and Hebrew texts.",
        "In recent years there has been growing interest in data-to-text NLG systems (Reiter, 2007); these systems generate texts based on sensor and other numerical data, supplemented with ontologies that specify domain knowledge.",
        "In principle, it seems that data-to-text techniques should allow NLG systems to provide more assistance than the syntactic help provided by Compansion.",
        "For example, if the user wanted to talk about a recent football (soccer) match, a data-to-text system could get actual data about the match from the web, and generate potential utterances from this data, such as Arsenal beat Chelsea 2-1 and Van Persie scored two goals; the user could then select one of these to utter.",
        "In addition to helping users interact with other people, NLG techniques can also be used to educate and encourage children with disabilities.",
        "The STANDUP system (Manurung, Ritchie et al., 2008), for example, used NLG and computational humour techniques to allow children who use AAC devices to generate novel punning jokes.",
        "This provided the children with successful experiences of controlling language, gave them an opportunity to play with language and explore new vocabulary (Waller et al., in press).",
        "In a small study with nine children with cerebral palsy, the children used their regular AAC tools more and also performed better on a test measuring linguistic abilities after they used STANDUP for ten weeks."

        "No more than five events are flagged as interesting, and only these events are shown in the editing interface.",

        "For both stories and social conversations, it would be extremely useful to be able to monitor what the conversational partner is saying.",
        "This is something we hope to investigate in the future.",
        "As most AAC users interact with a small number of conversational partners, it may be feasible to use a speech dictation system to detect at least some of what the conversational partner says.",
        "Last but not least, a major challenge implicit in our systems and indeed in the general architecture is letting users control the NLG system.",
        "Our systems are intended to be speaking aids, ideally they should produce the same utterances as the user would if he was able to talk.",
        "This means that users must be able to control the systems, so that it does what they want it to do, in terms of both content and expression.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, little is known about how users can best control an NLG system."

        "Many people are in the unfortunate position of not being able to speak or type, due to cognitive and/or motor impairments.",
        "Current AAC tools allow such people to engage in simple needs-based communication, but they do not provide good support for richer use of language, such as storytelling and social conversation.",
        "We are trying to develop more sophisticated AAC tools which support such interactions, by using external data and knowledge sources to produce candidate messages, which can be expressed using NLG and speech synthesis technology.",
        "Our work is still at an early stage, but we believe that it has the potential to help AAC users engage in richer interactions with other people."
