        "In current \"troubleshooting\" spoken dialogue systems (SDS)(Williams, 2007), the major part of the conversation is directed by the system, while the user follows the system's instructions.",
        "Once the system decides what instruction to give the user (at the dialogue management level), it faces several decisions to be made at the natural language generation (NLG) level.",
        "These include, deciding which concepts to include in the utterance, deciding the referring expressions (RE) to use in the utterance and so on.",
        "A little-studied problem is to what extent a system could automatically align to the user's lexical knowledge by adapting its RE choices, in particular based on his domain expertise, and how this can be modelled and optimised computationally.",
        "(Issacs and Clark, 1987) show how two interlocutors adapt their language in a conversation by assessing each other's domain expertise during dialogue, by observing how they react to each other's RE choices.",
        "This is called alignment through Audience Design (Clark, 1996; Bell, 1984).",
        "Using inappropriate REs in instructions has been identified as a serious problem affecting a system's usability (Molich and Nielsen, 1990).",
        "In this paper, we treat NLG within a computational learning paradigm (Lemon, 2008; Rieser and Lemon, 2009; Janarthanam and Lemon, 2008).",
        "We examine whether a SDS can automatically learn a lexical alignment policy for audience design, which enables it to choose appropriate REs by predicting the user's lexical knowledge dynamically during the course of the dialogue.",
        "This can avoid clarification requests from the users and keep the dialogues short.",
        "The example given below describes the kind of lexical alignment behaviour that we want the system to learn.",
        "The system chooses \"small white box\" instead of \"ADSL filter\" and \"monitor symbol\" instead of \"network icon\", because it learnt that the user is a novice based on their clarification requests.",
        "However, it switches to using technical terms like \"browser\", when it learns that the user is not a complete novice (as he verifies the description for the network icon in Usr 4).",

        "We then present a reinforcement learning model of lexical alignment due to audience design (in sections 4 &5) .",
        "We then evaluate the User Simulation (section",
        "6) , testing whether a simulation that is sensitive to a system's RE choices can be used to learn good lexical alignment policies.",

        "In this paper, we have shown that by using a statistical User Simulation that is sensitive to RE choices we are able to learn NLG policies that adaptively decide which REs to use based on audience design.",
        "We have shown that the lexical alignment policies learned with this type of simulation are better than a range of hand-coded policies.",
        "Although lexical alignment policies could be hand-coded, the designers would need to invest significant resources every time the list of referring expressions is revised or the conditions of the dialogue change.",
        "Using reinforcement learning, near-optimal lexical alignment policies can be learned quickly and automatically.",
        "This model can be used in any task where interactions need to be tailored to different users' lexical knowledge of the domain.",
        "Lexical alignment in dialogue also happens due to priming (Pickering and Garrod, 2004) and personal experience (Clark, 1996).",
        "We will examine trade-offs in various conditions, like 'instruct' versus 'teach' and low versus high retention users.",
        "Using Wizard-of-Oz studies and knowledge surveys, we plan to make the model more data-driven and realistic (Janarthanam and Lemon, 2009).",
        "We will also evaluate the learned policies with real users."
