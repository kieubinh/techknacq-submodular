        "A well known phenomenon in dialogue situations is alignment of the interlocutors.",
        "An illustrative example is given by Levelt and Kelter (1982), who telephoned shops and either asked the question \"What time does your shop close?\"",
        "or the question \"At what time does your shop close?\".",
        "The answers were likely to mirror the form of the question.",
        "When asked \"At what...",
        "?",
        "\", answers tended to begin with the preposition 'at' (e.g., \"At five o'clock.\").",
        "Conversely, when asked \"What...",
        "?",
        "\", answers tended to begin without the preposition (e.g., \"Five o'clock.\").",
        "Similar alignment phenomena can be observed in many aspects of speech production inter alia in syntactic and lexical choice.",
        "Pickering and Garrod (2004) present the interactive alignment model bringing together all alignment phenomena of speech processing in dialogue.",
        "According to this model, human language comprehension and production are greatly facilitated by alignment of the interlocutors during conversation.",
        "The process of alignment is explained through mutual priming of the interlocutors' linguistic representations.",
        "Thus, it is automatic, efficient, and non-conscious.",
        "A stronger claim of the authors is that alignment – in combination with routines and a dialogue lexicon – is a prerequisite for fluent speech production in humans.",
        "Alignment effects also occur in human-computer interaction.",
        "Brennan (1991) and Branigan et al.",
        "(in press) present evidence that syntactic structures and lexical items used by a computer are subsequently adopted by users.",
        "For this reason, alignment is an important concept for natural language human-computer interaction in general, and for dialogue systems with natural language generation in particular.",
        "Integrating ideas from the interactive alignment model into the microplanning component of natural language generation systems should be beneficial for several reasons.",
        "First, microplanning may become more efficient since the subsets of rules or lexical items in the dialogue lexicon that have been used before can be preferentially searched.",
        "Second, due to self-alignment, the output of the system can become more consistent and therefore easier to understand for the user.",
        "Finally, mutual alignment of user and dialogue system might make the conversation itself more natural and, presumably, cognitively more lightweight for the user.",
        "In this paper we present a computational model for parts of the interactive alignment model that are particularly important in the context of natural language generation.",
        "We describe how this model has been incorporated into the existing SPUD lite system (Stone et al., 2003; Stone, 2002) to yield the alignment-capable microplanner SPUD prime.",

        "Re-use of semantic trees and actions is used to model many dialogue phenomena in Dynamic Syntax and can also explain alignment.",
        "Thus, the authors declare alignment to be a corollary of context re-use.",
        "In particular, reuse of actions is assumed to have a considerable influence on alignment in natural language generation.",
        "Instead of looking through the complete lexicon each time a lexical item is chosen, this kind of lexical search is only necessary if no action – which constructed the same meaning in the given context before – exists in the record.",
        "If such an action exists, it can simply be re-used, which obviously leads to alignment.",

        "According to the authors, lexical and syntactic alignment occur automatically because the lexical items and syntactic constructions to choose from are constrained by the linguistic style adopted.",
        "Finally, Bateman (2006) advocates another proposal according to which alignment in dialogue is predictable for it is an inherently social activity.",
        "Following the social-semiotic view of language, Bateman suggests to model alignment as arising from register and microregister.",

        "For instance, exact timing effects are likely to be not even relevant as, in an actual system, it does not matter how many milliseconds faster the retrieval of a primed lexical item is in contrast to the retrieval of an item that is not primed.",
        "For this reason we adopt an idealised view, in which priming of linguistic structures results from two basic activation mechanisms:",
        "Temporary activation This kind of activation should increase abruptly and then decrease slowly over time until it reaches zero again.",

        "The slope of the function is determined by the parameter a. Additionally, the function is shifted right in order to yield an activation value of 1 for Ar = 1.",

        "A plot of ta(Ar) with different values for a is given in Figure 1a.",

        "The previously described priming-based model of alignment has been implemented by extending the integrated microplanning system SPUD lite (Stone, 2002).",
        "SPUD lite is a lightweight Prolog reimplementation of the SPUD microplanning system (Stone et al., 2003) based on the context-free tree rewriting grammar formalism TAGLET.",
        "Not only the microplanner itself, but also the linguistic structures (the initial TAGLET trees) are represented as Prolog clauses.",
        "SPUD lite carries out the different microplanning tasks (lexical choice, syntactic choice, referring expression generation and aggregation) at once by treating microplanning as a search problem.",
        "During generation it tries to find an utterance which is in accordance with the constraints set by its input (a grammar, a knowledge base and a query).",
        "This is done by searching the search space spanned by the linguistic grammar rules and the knowledge base until a goal state is found.",
        "Non-goal search states are preliminary utterances that are extended by one linguistic structure in each step until a syntactically complete utterance is found which conveys all the specified communicative goals.",
        "Since this search space is large even for relatively small grammars, a heuristic greedy search strategy is utilised.",
        "Our alignment-capable microplanner SPUD prime extends SPUD lite in several ways.",
        "First, we altered the predicate for the initial TAGLET trees by adding a unique identifier ID as well as counters for self/other-recency/frequency values (rs, fs, roand fo; see Section 3).",
        "The activation value of an initial tree is then calculated with equation (4).",
        "Furthermore, we have created a mechanism that enables SPUD lite to change the recency and frequency information attached to the initial trees online during generation.",
        "This is done in three steps with the help of Prolog's meta-programming capabilities: Firstly, the clause of a tree is retrieved from the knowledge base.",
        "Secondly, it is retracted from the knowledge base.",
        "Finally, the clause is (re-)asserted in the knowledge base with updated recency and frequency information.",
        "As a welcome side effect of this procedure, primed initial trees are moved to the top of the knowledge base and – since Prolog evaluates clauses and facts in the order of their appearance in the knowledge base – they can be accessed earlier than unprimed initial trees or initial trees that were primed longer ago.",
        "Thus, in SPUD prime recency of priming directly influences the access of linguistic structures.",
        "Most importantly, the activation values of the initial trees are considered during generation.",
        "Thus, in addition to the evaluation measures used by SPUD lite's heuristic state evaluation function, the mean activation value of the N initial trees {t1,..., tN} of a given search state S is taken into account as a further evaluation measure.",

        "The part of the corpus that we used consists of eight recorded and transcribed dialogues between two interlocutors that play the 'Jigsaw Map Game', a task in which different objects have to be placed correctly on a table.",
        "Speakers take turns in explaining each other where to place the next object in relation to the objects that are already on the table.",
        "Each speaker has to learn a set of name-object relations before the game, such that both use the same names for all but three objects.",
        "Due to this precondition, both speakers use the same lexical referring expressions for most objects and the speaker's lexical alignment behaviour for the differently named objects can be observed easily.",
        "In our evaluation, we concentrate on the generation of nouns by simulating the uses of the three differently learned nouns in the eight dialogues from the perspective of all sixteen interlocutors.",
        "In each test, SPUD prime plays the role of one of the speakers talking to a simulated interlocutor who behaves exactly as in the real experiment.",
        "With this test setup we examined, first, how well SPUD prime can model the alignment behaviour of a real speaker in a real dialogue context and, second, whether our model is flexible enough to consistently emulate different speakers with different alignment behaviour.",
        "In order to find the best model (i.e., the best parameter set {a,/3,m, v}) for each speaker, we simulated all tests with all parameter combinations and counted the number of mismatches between our model's choice and the real speaker's choice.",
        "To make this exhaustive search possible, we limit the set of values for the parameters a and /3 to {1,2,4,6,8,10,14,18,24,30} and the set of values for the parameters M and v to {0,0.1,0.2,..., 1}, resulting in a total of 11 x 10 = 12100 different parameter sets.",
        "Since we want to investigate alignment, A is constantly set to 1.",
        "To illustrate our evaluation method, we first present and discuss the simulation of one particular dialogue (from the Jigsaw Map Game corpus) from the perspective of participant (A).",
        "Before the experiment started, both interlocutors learned the name-object relations 'Raute' (rhombus), 'Ring' (ring), 'Schraube' (bolt) and 'Wiirfel' (cube), additionally participant (A) learned 'Spielfigur' (token), 'Ball' (sphere) and 'Block' (cuboid) and participant (B) learned 'Mannchen' (token), 'Kugel' (sphere) and 'Klotz' (cuboid).",
        "In our simulation, we focus on the use of the differently learned names (the targets) and not on the other names (non-targets).",
        "Table 1 shows the sequence of target nouns as they occurred in the real dialogue (non-targets omitted).",
        "For each parameter set {a, /3, m, v} the dialogue is simulated in the following way:",
        "• When participant (A) used a referring nontarget noun in the dialogue, self-priming of the corresponding rule(s) in SPUD prime's knowledge base is simulated (i.e., the recency and frequency counters are increased).",
        "• When participant (A) used a referring target noun in the dialogue, SPUD prime is queried to generate a noun for the target object.",
        "Then it is noted whether the noun actually generated",
        "Table 1: Sequence of referring target nouns used by participants (A) and (B) in our example dialogue.",
        "is the noun used in the actual dialogue (match) or not (mismatch).",
        "• When participant (B) used a referring noun (target or non-target), priming of the corresponding rule(s) in SPUD prime's knowledge base is simulated.",
        "The evaluation measure for a specific parameter set is the number of mismatches it produces when simulating a dialogue.",
        "Thus the parameter set (or rather sets) which produce the least number of mismatches are the ones that best model the particular speaker under consideration.",
        "For participant (A) of our example dialogue the distribution of parameter sets p producing m mismatches is shown in Table 2.",
        "Four parameter sets produce only two mismatches (in phrase 15 and 22; cf. Table 1) and thus our priming-based alignment model can account for 92% of the target nouns produced by speaker (A).",
        "However, it must be noted that these two mismatches occur at points in the dialogue where the alignment behaviour of (A) is not straightforward.",
        "At target noun 15, both interlocutors have already used the name 'Ball' and then both switch to 'Kugel'.",
        "The mismatch at target 22 is a special case: (A) used 'Kugel' and immediately corrected himself to 'Ball', the name he learned prior to the experiment.",
        "It seems as if the task instruction, to use the learned nouns, suddenly became prevalent.",
        "To evaluate our alignment-capable microplanner, we simulated the noun production for each of the interlocutors from the experiment.",
        "One dialogue has been excluded from the data analysis as the dialogue partners used nouns that none of them had learned in the priming phase.",
        "For each of the remaining 14 interlocutors we varied the parameters a, j6, m and v as described above to identify those parameter set(s) which result in the least number of mismatches.",
        "Each interlocutor produced between 18 and 32 target nouns (N=14, M=23.071, SD=3.936).",
        "Our simulation runs contain between 0 and 19 mismatches overall (N=169400, M=6.35, SD=3.398).",
        "The minimal number of mismatches for each speaker simulation ranges between 0 and 6 (N=14, M=2.286, SD=1.684).",
        "That is, our model can simulate a mean of 89.9% of all target nouns (N=14, M=.899, Min=.667, Max=1.000, SD=.082), which is an improvement of 24.6% on the baseline condition (alignment switched off), where 65.3% of the target nouns are generated correctly (N=14, M=.653, Min=.360, Max=1.000, SD=.071).",
        "As already illustrated in Section 5.1, mismatches typically occur at points in the dialogue where the alignment behaviour of the interlocutor is not straightforward.",
        "As displayed in Table 3 the parameter assignments resulting in least mismatches differ considerably from speaker to speaker.",

        "In this paper, we introduced a priming-based model of alignment which focusses more on the psycholinguistic aspects of interactive alignment and models recency and frequency of use effects – as proposed by Reitter (2008) and Brennan and Clark (1996) – as well as the difference between intrapersonal and interpersonal alignment (Pickering et al., 2003; Pickering and Garrod, 2004).",
        "The presented model is fully parameterisable and can account for different empirical findings and 'personalities'.",
        "It has been implemented in the SPUD prime micro-planner which activates linguistic rules by changing its knowledge base on-line and considers the activation values of those rules used in constructing the current utterance by using their mean activation value as an additional feature in its state evaluation function.",
        "We evaluated our alignment model and its implementation in SPUD prime on a corpus of task-oriented dialogue collected in an experimental setup especially designed for alignment research.",
        "The results of this evaluation show that our priming-based model of alignment is flexible enough to simulate the alignment behaviour of different human speakers (generating target nouns) in the experimental setting.",
        "It should be noted, however, that our model tries to give a purely mechanistic explanation of lexical and syntactic choice and that it, therefore, cannot explain alignment phenomena that are due to social factors (e.g., politeness, relationship, etc.",
        "), audience design or cases, in which a speaker consciously decides whether to align or not (e.g., whether to use a word or its synonym).",
        "While the evaluation has shown that our model can reproduce human alignment behaviour to a high degree, it remains to be investigated which influence each parameter exerts and how exactly the parameters vary across individual speakers.",
        "Nevertheless, the development of the alignment-capable microplanner is only one step in the direction of an intuitive natural language humancomputer interaction system.",
        "In order to reach this goal, the next step is to combine SPUD prime with a natural language understanding system, which should ideally work with the same linguistic representations so that the linguistic structures used by the interlocutor could be primed automatically.",
        "This work is underway.",
        "Furthermore, user studies should be carried out in order to evaluate SPUD prime in a more sophisticated way.",
        "Branigan et al.",
        "(in press) found that human-computer alignment was even stronger than human-human alignment.",
        "But how would the alignment behaviour of human interlocutors change if the computer they are speaking to also aligns to them?",
        "Further, would integration of an alignment-capable dialogue system into a computer interface make the interaction more natural?",
        "And would an embodied conversational agent appear more resonant and more sociable (Kopp, 2008) if it aligned to users during conversation?",
        "The work presented here provides a starting point for the investigation of these questions.",
