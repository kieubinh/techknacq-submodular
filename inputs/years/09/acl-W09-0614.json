        "Our primary objective is to study how participants (hereafter called users) with different domain knowledge and expertise interpret and resolve different types ofreferring expressions (RE) in a situated dialogue context.",
        "We also study the effect of the system's lexical alignment due to priming (Pickering and Garrod, 2004) by the user's choice of REs.",
        "The users follow instructions from an implemented dialogue manager and realiser to perform a technical but realistic task setting up a home Internet connection.",
        "The dialogue system's utterances are manipulated to contain different types of REs - descriptive, technical, tutorial or lexically aligned REs, to refer to various domain objects in the task.",
        "The users' responses to different REs are then logged and studied.",
        "(Janarthanam and Lemon, 2009) presented a framework for reinforcement learning of optimal natural language generation strategies to choose appropriate REs to users with different domain knowledge expertise.",
        "For this, we need user simulations with different domain knowledge profiles that are sensitive to the system's choice of REs.",
        "A WoZ environment is an ideal tool for data collection to build data-driven user simulations.",
        "However, our study requires a novel WoZ environment.",

        "In addition to these, other behaviours, like remaining silent or saying irrelevant things are also accommodated.",
        "e. User's RE Choice panel - The user's choice of REs to refer to the domain objects are annotated by the wizard using this panel.",
        "The dialogue manager drives the conversation by giving instructions to the users.",
        "It follows a deterministic dialogue management policy so that we only study variation in the decisions concerning the choice of REs.",
        "It should be noted that typical WoZ environments (Whittaker et al., 2002) do not have dialogue managers and the strategic decisions will be taken by the wizard.",
        "Our dialogue system has three main responsibilities - choosing the RE strategy, giving instructions and handling clarification requests.",
        "The dialogue system, initially randomly chooses the RE strategy at the start of the dialogue.",
        "The list of strategies are as follows.",
        "1.",
        "Jargon: Choose technical terms for every reference to the domain objects.",
        "2.",
        "Descriptive: Choose descriptive terms for every reference to the domain objects.",
        "3.",
        "Tutorial: Use technical terms, but also augment the description for every reference.",
        "The above three strategies are also augmented with an alignment feature, so that the system can either align or not align with the user's prior choice of REs.",
        "In aligned strategies, the system abandons the existing strategy (jargon, descriptive or tutorial) for a domain object reference when the user uses a different expression from that of the system to refer to the domain object.",
        "For instance, under the descriptive strategy, the ethernet cable is referred to as \"the thick cable with red ends\".",
        "But if the user refers to it as \"ethernet cable\", then the system uses \"ethernet cable\" in subsequent turns instead of the descriptive expression.",
        "In case of non-aligned strategies, the system simply ignores user's use of novel REs and continues to use its own strategy.",

        "for the user.",
        "Based on the user's response, the system identifies the next instruction.",
        "However, the script only contains the dialogue acts.",
        "The dialogue acts are then processed by a built-in realiser component to create the system utterances.",
        "The realiser uses templates in which references to domain objects are changed based on the selected strategy to create final utterances.",
        "By using a fixed dialogue management policy and by changing the REs, we only explore users' reactions to various RE strategies.",
        "The utterances are finally converted to speech and are played back to the user.",
        "The dialogue system handles two kinds of clarification requests - open requests and closed requests.",
        "With open CRs, users request the system for location of various domain objects (e.g. \"where is the ethernet cable?\")",
        "or to describe them.",
        "With closed CRs, users verify the intended reference, in case of ambiguity (e.g. \"Do you mean the thin white cable with grey ends?",
        "\", \"Is it the broadband filter?",
        "\", etc.).",
        "The system handles these requests using a knowledge base of the domain objects.",
        "The primary responsibility of the wizard is to understand the participant's utterance and annotate it as one of the dialogue acts in the Annotation panel, and send the dialogue act to the dialogue system for response.",
        "In addition to the primary responsibility, the wizard also requests confirmation from the user (if needed) and also responds to confirmation requests from the user.",
        "The wizard also observes the user's usage of novel REs and records them in the User's RE Choice panel.",
        "As mentioned earlier, our wizard neither decides on which strategy to use to choose REs nor chooses the next task instruction to give the user.",
