        "This is a programmatic paper on the principles of content determination in natural language generation (NLG).",
        "It arose from the insight that we do not know much about the underlying principles and computational properties of several tasks in NLG.",
        "Especially conceptualization - the selection of the information to be conveyed in a natural language text, and the adaptation of this information to the language-specific requirements - is still a white spot on the generation map (Guhe, 2007).",
        "Content determination is that sub-process during conceptualization that is responsible for the selection of the information to be conveyed and its ordering.",
        "Several authors assume that establishing rhetorical relations between informational units and the successive construction of tree structures for the overall information should also be considered as a content determination task (see, e.g. Reiter and Dale (2000)), but I will ignore this task in this paper and confine my considerations to the selection and ordering of informational units, in particular propositions.",
        "Content determination is coupled with the linguistic domain in two ways, since the content does not only need to be expressible in the target language, but the determination process is already affected by pragmatic organisation principles for specific text types.",
        "I am convinced that game theory is the appropriate tool for a formulation of these principles.",
        "In what follows, I will first explain why content determination should be viewed as a game played by the speaker/system S and the speaker's/system's representation of a listener/user L - the 'user model'.",
        "After that I will outline the different strategies relevant for content determination by means of the content for user-tailored descriptions of numerical data."

        "The various approaches to content determination proposed in the literature may be classified in a two-dimensional way, viz. with respect to information flow (top down vs. bottom-up), and with respect to the methods used (reasoning or the use of schemas).",
        "From an engineering perspective - the dominant view in NLG - a top-down approach, focusing on the communicative goal and using schemas which determine where to realize which information, is the most attractive and most often method used, although it lacks of a theoretical grounding.",
        "A deep reasoning approach would thus be more attractive, but is not always feasible in practice.",
        "One of the problems in content determination is that the amount and quality of the information to be conveyed depends on the interests and cognitive abilities of the respective user and the coherence requirement.",
        "Content determination is selecting material from the domain in the hope that it will permit a coherent realization as a text.",
        "Hence, this subtask should be viewed as a process that is also constrained by pragmatic principles for establishing coherence.",
        "I proceed on the assumption that a theoretically well-founded reasoning approach can be established within the framework of analytic game theory (see, e.g., Shoham and Leyton-Brown (2009)).",
        "The benefit of a game theoretic treatment is its focus on interacting agents and the reasoning mechanisms associated with games: If we are able to show that the content to be conveyed is determined by concepts of rational interaction, then we get insights into the principles that guide the overall content determination process.",
        "The basic ideas are as follows: First, the random device - used in game-theoretic pragmatics to provide S with some meaning - must be replaced by a function that maps informational units of the domain to propositions.",
        "Additionally, L's reasoning capabilities are taken into account.",
        "The interplay of both components reflects S's cognitive effort to construct the proposition and represents some of the adaptive cognitive mechanisms of S. It is well known from pragmatic and psycholinguistic studies that speakers do not only try to minimize their own effort in the production process, but that they take into account features of the listener and adopt content and form of their utterance to the listener's assumed cognitive and linguistic capabilities.",
        "Hence, the process of content determination is guided by speaker-strategies and adaptation processes which should be modelled as adopted addressee-strategies.",
        "Under this view, the ultimate goal of content determination is to find a coherent catenation of propositions that is tailored to the addressee: S is a decision-maker and she is already playing with L at pre-linguistic stages."

        "Jager (2007) describes the conception of game-theoretic pragmatic analyses as follows: A game is an utterance situation with a speaker S and a hearer L as players.",
        "The actions performed by these players are the production and interpretation of utterances, and the payoffs represent the cognitive and linguistic expenses of both players.",
        "If a set M of meanings is given and a set F of linguistic forms, a speaker strategy s is a function from M to F. Accordingly, a hearer strategy h is a function from F to M. In this paper, I assume that M is a set of propositions, i.e. a set of situative, truth-functional, concepts.",
        "Within this framework, the production process is treated in a simplifying way.",
        "A random device assigns some meaning m £ M to S who has to select an appropriate form f £ F. Successful communication is given if L is able to reconstruct m from f. The ^-function defines just this:",
        "I 0 otherwise",
        "S has a choice between simple or more complex expressions to express the meaning m. In order to measure this complexity, a function cost from F to the nonnegative real numbers is given whose exact shape is of no interest for this paper.",
        "The speaker utility us refers to the cost-function in addition to some positive coefficient k that represents the speaker's priorities.",
        "A low value of k indicates that communicative success is more important than minimal effort, and a high value of k means that effort is more important than success.",
        "The addressee's utility can be identified with the ^-function:",
        "In order to adopt Jager's characterization of a game-theoretic model of communication to NLG purposes, one has to modify it into two directions.",
        "The minor change concerns the random device that assigns meanings to the speaker.",
        "I replace this device by a function i that maps informational units d of the domain D to propositions p £ M. The production grammar s picks up these propositions and transforms them into linguistic forms f.",
        "The more substantial change concerns the hearer strategy.",
        "From an NLG perspective, one is not primarily interested in a hearer strategy that maps forms to meanings, but in the effect of the conveyed information w.r.t.",
        "the hearer's information state TL.",
        "The aim of S is to modify TL, but it is L who decides how to process the information conveyed by S. In general, L's interpretation task is to find an explanation for p on the basis of his own beliefs.",
        "In other words, interpretation is ab-ductive reasoning (Hobbs et al., 1993).",
        "Suppose S conveys a set of propositions A.",
        "Then the actions available to L - if A is new information for him - are several update mechanisms up(TL,A).",
        "He may just add A to TL and accept A as new information without finding any explanation for A: up(Tc ,A) = (Tc U A) = Tc.",
        "The other extreme would be to compute the set of all logical consequencesof TcUA, i.e. up(T£,A) = Cn(TcUA).However, this set is just the ideal state of a logically omniscient person; a more realistic view is to characterize the strategies of L by different depths in reasoning, starting from depth = 0 (i.e. TL U A) up to some information state close to Cn(TL U A).",
        "I use up(TL ,A) -< Cn(TL U A) to represent this state.",
        "Note that up(TL,A) -< Cn(TL U A) is not a fixed information state but depends on the user type.",
        "If the players want to be communicatively successful, L should ideally try to find an explanation for A that results in that mentioned information state.",
        "Hence, communicative success with respect to a single proposition p may now be defined by:",
        "The speaker utility is defined as:",
        "and the hearer utility is",
        "Within this overall picture of information exchange and communicative success, content determination is the interplay of i with up(TL ,ran(i)), i.e. the update of L s information state with the range of i.",
        "In the rest of this paper I will show by means of an example how this interplay can be spelled out in detail.",
        "As will hopefully become apparent, the approach amounts to some sort ofgame - a game that takes into account specific strategies of S and the abductive inference strategies of L to create a content that is optimal for both."
