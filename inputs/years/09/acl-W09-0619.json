        "In this paper, we present two experiments designed to examine the impact of linguistic devices, such as discourse cues and connectives, on comprehension and recall in information presentation for natural language generation (NLG) as used in spoken dialogue systems (SDS).",
        "Spoken dialogue systems have traditionally used simple templates to present options (e.g., flights, restaurants) and their attributes to users (Walker et al., 2004).",
        "Recently, however, researchers have proposed approaches to information presentation that use linguistic devices (e.g., but, however, moreover, only, just, also etc.)",
        "in order to highlight specific properties of and relations between items presented to the user, e.g. associations (Polifroni and Walker, 2006) and contrasts (Winterboer and Moore, 2007).",
        "Previous research indicates that linguistic devices such as connectives facilitate comprehension (see Ben-Anath, 2005, for a review).",
        "However, to our knowledge, no empirical validation has been performed to test whether using linguistic devices has an effect on comprehension and recall ofthe information presentated."

        "In order to test whether there are differences in recall, we performed a within-participants reading experiment comparing recall for experiment material presented with or without linguistic devices A total of 24 participants, native English speakers and mostly students of the University of Edinburgh, were paid to participate in the study.",
        "They were naive to the purpose of the experiment but were told that they were about to be presented with a number of consumer products and that they were supposed to answer questions about these.",
        "Each participant read 14 short texts describing consumer products from 14 domains, see Table 1 and Table 2 for examples.",
        "The texts are the type of presentation typically produced by spoken dialogue systems designed to help users select an entity from a set of available options.",

        "Each participant read seven texts of each type, alternating between types.",
        "Ordering of both the domains and the text type was controlled for.",
        "We took particular care to add discourse devices without modifying the propositions in any other way.",
        "After each message, the participant had to answer three questions testing different levels of recall.",

        "In this experiment we used an eye-tracker in order to measure reading times, because reading times are considered to be sensitive to people's ongoing discourse processing/comprehension (Hav-iland and Clark, 1974).",
        "We found that reading the presentation messages containing linguistic devices took generally slightly longer, with participants reading messages containing discourse cues taking 37.93 seconds per message on average, and messages without discourse cues taking 35.28 seconds on average to read.",
        "The question, however, was whether this difference could be attributed exclusively to the number of additional words or whether readers also spent more time to build a mental representation of the presentation's content by reading the parts marked by discourse cues more carefully.",
        "Alternatively, sentence complexity might also increase with the introduction of linguistic cues, which in turn increases reading times.",
        "In order to answer this question, we compared the reading times of interest areas (IA) located directly (one word) after the (potential) location of the discourse marker.",
        "In total, we determined 46 IAs within the 14 messages, each one consisting of two words or around nine characters on average.",
        "The results of the different reading time measures, established with linear-mixed effects model (LME) analyses in R (see Table 1), do not reveal any significant differences between the two conditions, although, surprisingly, IAs had a numerically shorter reading time when linguistic markers were used.",
        "In this repeated measures design experiment, participant, IA, and item were random-effect factors and the fixed-effect factor was whether the presentation contained linguistic devices.",
        "We compared first pass and remaining pass reading times per IA, the total number of passes, and regressions in and out of the IA.",
        "Although sentences containing linguistic devices are more complex and thus should incur longer reading times, our analyses do not any differences in reading times for the words directly following the linguistic devices.",

        "We carried out a web-based user study on Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MT) platform both in order to verify the results obtained in the previous recall experiment and in order to test whether results obtained from casual website users are comparable to those obtained from laboratory participants who focus exclusively on performing the experiment in the lab.",
        "We recruited native English speakers online to carry out the same experiment previously conducted in the lab.",
        "MT is a web-based micro-task platform that allows researchers and developers to put small tasks requiring human intelligence on the web.",
        "Deploying MT is advantageous because it attracts many visitors due to its affiliation with the well established Amazon website and thus eases recruitment of new participants especially from outside the usual student population.",
        "In addition, conducting experiments online significantly reduces the effort involved in data collection for the experimenter.",
        "Moreover, the website allows for convenient payment for both participants and the experimenter.",

        "Kittur et al., 2008).",
        "We had 60 participants reading the same materials that were used in experiment 1.",
        "MT does allow to place restrictions on participant location (only users from the US were allowed to participate to ensure English language skills), for instance, or the number of trials (each participant was only allowed to participate once).",
        "However, one cannot balance gender of participants or control for age and literacy reliably, as user provided data cannot be verified.",
        "Also, one does not know whether participants are conducting another task simultaneously, or are otherwise distracted.",
        "We paid $ 2.50 for participation, which was, given that we expected the experiment to last less than 30 minutes, considerably more than participants would receive for most other tasks available.",
        "We hoped that the higher reward would encourage participants to take the task more seriously.",
        "In order to resemble the interface that was used in the previous experiment as closely as possible in terms of the general \"look and feel\", a web-based interface was implemented using Adobe's Flash format.",
        "We chose the widely used Flash format because it can be integrated into the MT environment easily and allows for tighter user control in comparison with standard HTML pages.",
        "For example, we made it impossible for users to reread the presented information once they read the corresponding question.",
        "With standard HMTL users would have been able to use their browser's back button to do just that.",
        "The experiment was then made available to the users on Amazon's MT website.",
