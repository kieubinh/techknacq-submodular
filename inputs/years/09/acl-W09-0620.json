        "Precision and mathematical form in first and subsequent mentions of numerical facts and their relation to document structure",
        "Sandra Williams and Richard Power",
        "In a corpus study we found that authors vary both mathematical form and precision when expressing numerical quantities.",
        "Indeed, within the same document, a quantity is often described vaguely in some places and more accurately in others.",
        "Vague descriptions tend to occur early in a document and to be expressed in simpler mathematical forms (e.g., fractions or ratios), whereas more accurate descriptions of the same proportions tend to occur later, often expressed in more complex forms (e.g., decimal percentages).",
        "Our results can be used in Natural Language Generation (1) to generate repeat descriptions within the same document, and (2) to generate descriptions of numerical quantities for different audiences according to mathematical ability."

        "This study is part of the NumGen project, which aims (a) to investigate how numerical quantity descriptions vary in English, (b) to specify a grammar that covers these variations, and (c) to develop an algorithm that selects appropriate descriptions for people with different levels of mathematical ability.",
        "We collected, from newspapers, popular science magazines and scientific journals, examples of numerical facts that were mentioned more than once, so that first mentions could be compared with subsequent mentions.",
        "For example in the following text, two mentions of the same numerical fact - the proportion of A grades in UK A-level examinations in 2008 - are underlined:",
        "A-level results show record number of A grades Record numbers ofteenagers have received top A-level grades By Graeme Paton, Education Editor More than a quarter of papers were marked A as results in the so-called gold standard examination reach a new high.",
        "According to figures released today by the Joint Council for Qualifications, 25.9per cent of A-level papers were awarded an A grade this summer... (Daily Telegraph, 14 August 2008)",
        "Comparing the two, (a) the first (More than a quarter) is less precise than the second (25.9 per cent), (b) its mathematical form, a common fraction, is less complex than the decimal percentage form of the second, and (c) its string has more characters (i.e., it is not shorter in length as might be expected if it were a summary).",
        "Also, the two mentions occur in different parts of the document - the first paragraph, and the fifth paragraph.",
        "To compare the precision of numerical expressions we needed a more exact definition of the concept.",
        "We derived the following rules to determine precision:",
        "• Precision increases with the number of significant figures",
        "• Round numbers imply vagueness (implicit approximation)",
        "• Modifiers increase the precision of round numbers when they indicate the direction of approximation (> or <)",
        "• Common proportional quantities imply vagueness (implicit approximation similar to round numbers)",
        "Our first rule concerns arithmetical precision – i.e., the number of significant figures.",
        "Thus 344 with three significant figures is more precise than 340 with only two and 56% with two significant figures is more precise than 50% with one.",
        "Second, we adhere to Krifka's RNRI (round number round interpretation) theory that when speakers or writers mention a round figure such as sixty, they mean that the actual figure is slightly less than or more than the round number unless they explicitly modify it with (say) exactly, and similarly, hearers or readers interpret it as rounded (Krifka, 2007).",
        "As a consequence, sixty and around sixty have the same level of precision, while exactly sixty is more precise than sixty.",
        "Third, we take into account modifiers (or numerical hedges) such as under, over, more than, and verbs such as topped.",
        "So we say that over sixty and topped sixty are more precise than sixty since they give more information.",
        "Finally, we extend Krifka's ideas (2007) to cover common proportional quantities.",
        "Krifka confined his ideas to scalar and numerical quantities, but we propose that they can also be applied to common proportions such as half, two thirds and three quarters and their ratio, decimal, percentage and multiple equivalents.",
        "We hypothesise that when speakers or writers use a common proportion, they implicitly round up or down just the same as with round whole numbers, so we would argue that around a halfis the same level ofpreci-sion as a half, whereas more than halfis more precise than half.",
        "When comparing different types, we take the implied vagueness of common proportions into account, so that we consider 25% to be more precise than one quarter.",
        "Numerical proportions may be expressed by different mathematical forms, e.g., fractions, ratios, percentages.",
        "Complexity of mathematical form denotes the amount of effort and numerical skill required by readers to interpret a numerical quantity; as complexity of mathematical concepts increases, the amount of effort required for comprehension also increases.",
        "As a convenient measure of the complexity of mathematical forms, we employ a scale corresponding to the levels at which they are introduced in the Mathematics Curriculum for Schools (1999); that is, we assume that simple concepts are taught before difficult ones, so that a child learns whole numbers up to ten at Level 1, then much later learns standard index form (e.g., 4.12x10) at Level 8 (table 1)."

        "Regarding mathematical level (i.e., the complexity scale for mathematical form), the trend is for subsequent mentions to have a level equal to that of first mentions, but in the 31 cases where it is unequal, they show a significant trend towards an increase in level – i.e., subsequent mentions are conceptually more difficult.",
        "Our first hypothesis (precision increases from first to subsequent mentions) is thus clearly supported.",
        "Our second hypothesis (level of conceptual complexity increases from first to subsequent mentions) is supported by significant increases in level only where the level changed.",
        "Note that by our definition, complexity of mathematical concepts is distinct from precision: for example, 59 is more precise than 60 but equally complex (both are taught at Level 2 - whole numbers up to 100).",
        "Further investigation revealed that mathematical level tended to remain the same where both mentions were at the beginning of a document (n=14, p < 0.005, in a 2-tailed binomial test, as above).",
