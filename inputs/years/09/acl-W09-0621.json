        "In recent years, text-to-text generation has received increasing attention in the field of Natural Language Generation (NLG).",
        "In contrast to traditional concept-to-text systems, text-to-text generation systems convert source text to target text, where typically the source and target text share the same meaning to some extent.",
        "Applications of text-to-text generation include summarization (Knight and Marcu, 2002), question-answering (Lin and Pantel, 2001), and machine translation.",
        "For text-to-text generation it is important to know which words and phrases are semantically close or exchangable in which contexts.",
        "While there are various resources available that capture such knowledge at the word level (e.g., synset knowledge in WordNet), this kind of information is much harder to get by at the phrase level.",
        "Therefore, paraphrase acquisition can be considered an important technology for producing resources for text-to-text generation.",
        "Paraphrase generation has already proven to be valuable for Question Answering (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Riezler et al., 2007), Machine Translation (Callison-Burch et al., 2006) and the evaluation thereof (Russo-Lassner et al., 2006; Kauchak and Barzilay, 2006; Zhou et al., 2006), but also for text simplification and explanation.",
        "In the study described in this paper, we make an effort to collect Dutch paraphrases from news article headlines in an unsupervised way to be used in future paraphrase generation.",
        "News article headlines are abundant on the web, and are already grouped by news aggregators such as Google News.",
        "These services collect multiple articles covering the same event.",
        "Crawling such news aggregators is an effective way of collecting related articles which can straightforwardly be used for the acquisition of paraphrases (Dolan et al., 2004; Nelken and Shieber, 2006).",
        "We use this method to collect a large amount of aligned paraphrases in an automatic fashion."

        "We aim to build a high-quality paraphrase corpus.",
        "Considering the fact that this corpus will be the basic resource of a paraphrase generation system, we need it to be as free of errors as possible, because errors will propagate throughout the system.",
        "This implies that we focus on obtaining a highprecision in the paraphrases collection process.",
        "Where previous work has focused on aligning news-items at the paragraph and sentence level (Barzilay and El-hadad, 2003), we choose to focus on aligning the headlines of news articles.",
        "We think this approach will enable us to harvest reliable training material for paraphrase generation quickly and efficiently, without having to worry too much about the problems that arise when trying to align complete news articles.",
        "For the development of our system we use data which was obtained in the DAESO-project.",

        "Part of the data in the DAESO-corpus consists of headline clusters crawled from Google News Netherlands in the period April-August 2006.",
        "For each news article, the headline and the first 150 characters of the article were stored.",
        "Roughly 13,000 clusters were retrieved.",
        "Table 1 shows part of a (translated) cluster.",
        "It is clear that although clusters deal roughly with one subject, the headlines can represent quite a different perspective on the content of the article.",
        "To obtain only paraphrase pairs, the clusters need to be more coherent.",
        "To that end 865 clusters were manually subdivided into sub-clusters of headlines that show clear semantic overlap.",
        "Sub-clustering is no trivial task, however.",
        "Some sentences are very clearly paraphrases, but consider for instance the last two sentences in the example.",
        "They do paraphrase each other to some extent, but their relation can only be understood properly with world knowledge.",
        "Also, there are numerous headlines that can not be sub-clustered, such as the first three headlines shown in the example.",
        "We use these annotated clusters as development and test data in developing a method to automatically obtain paraphrase pairs from headline clusters.",
        "We divide the annotated headline clusters in a development set of 40 clusters, while the remainder is used as test data.",
        "The headlines are stemmed using the porter stemmer for Dutch (Kraaij and Pohlmann, 1994).",
        "Instead of a word overlap measure as used by Barzilay and Elhadad (2003), we use a modified TF *IDF word score as was suggested by Nelken and Shieber (2006).",
        "Each sentence is viewed as a document, and each original cluster as a collection of documents.",
        "For each stemmed word i in sentence j, TFij is a binary variable indicating if the word occurs in the sentence or not.",
        "The TF * IDF score is then:",
        "TF.IDFi = TFij • log",
        "|D| is the total number of sentences in the cluster and l{dj : ti £ dj }| is the number of sentences that contain the term ti.",
        "These scores are used in a vector space representation.",
        "The similarity between headlines can be calculated by using a similarity function on the headline vectors, such as cosine similarity.",
        "Our first approach is to use a clustering algorithm to cluster similar headlines.",
        "The original Google News headline clusters are reclustered into finer grained sub-clusters.",
        "We use the k-means implementation in the CLUTO software package.",
        "The k-means algorithm is an algorithm that assigns k centers to represent the clustering of n points (k < n) in a vector space.",
        "The total intra-cluster variances is minimized by the function where ^i is the centroid of all the points Xj £ Si.",
        "The PK1 cluster-stopping algorithm as proposed by Pedersen and Kulkarni (2006) is used to find the optimal k for each sub-cluster:",
        "Here, C r is a criterion function, which measures the ratio of withincluster similarity to be-tweencluster similarity.",
        "As soon as PKl(k) exceeds a threshold, k – l is selected as the optimum number of clusters.",
        "To find the optimal threshold value for cluster-stopping, optimization is performed on the development data.",
        "Our optimization function is an F-score:",
        "precision",
        "We evaluate the numberofaligments betweenpos-sible paraphrases.",
        "For instance, in a cluster of four sentences, (2) = 6 alignments can be made.",
        "In our case, precision is the number of alignments retrieved from the clusters which are relevant, divided by the total number of retrieved alignments.",
        "Recall is the number of relevant retrieved alig-ments divided by the total number of relevant alignments.",
        "We use an Fp-score with a f3 of 0.25 as we favour precision over recall.",
        "We do not want to optimize on precision alone, because we still want to retrieve a fair amount of paraphrases and not only the ones that are very similar.",
        "Through optimization on our development set, we find an optimal threshold for the PK1 algorithm thpk1 = l. For each original cluster, k-means clustering is then performed using the k found by the cluster stopping function.",
        "In each newly obtained cluster all headlines can be aligned to each other.",
        "Our second approach is to calculate the similarity between pairs of headlines directly.",
        "If the similarity exceeds a certain threshold, the pair is accepted as a paraphrase pair.",
        "If it is below the threshold, it is rejected.",
        "However, as Barzilay and El-hadad (2003) have pointed out, sentence mapping in this way is only effective to a certain extent.",
        "Beyond that point, context is needed.",
        "With this in mind, we adopt two thresholds and the Cosine similarity function to calculate the similarity between two sentences:",
        "where V l and V2 are the vectors of the two sentences being compared.",
        "If the similarity is higher than the upper threshold, it is accepted.",
        "If it is lower than the lower theshold, it is rejected.",
        "In the remaining case of a similarity between the two thresholds, similarity is calculated over the contexts of the two headlines, namely the text snippet that was retrieved with the headline.",
        "If this similarity exceeds the upper threshold, it is accepted.",
        "Threshold values as found by optimizing on the development data using again an Fo.25-score, are Thiower = 0.2 and Thupper = 0.5.",
        "An optional final step is to add alignments that are implied by previous alignments.",
