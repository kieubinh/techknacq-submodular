        "Content selection is the task executed by a natural language generation (NLG) system of deciding, given a knowledge-base, which subset of the information available should be conveyed in the generated document (Reiter and Dale, 2000).",
        "Consider the task of generating a cricket match report, given the scorecard for that match.",
        "Such a scorecard would typically contain a large number of statistics pertaining to the game as a whole as well as individual players (e.g. see Figure 1).",
        "Our aim is to identify which statistics should be selected by the NLG system.",
        "Much work has been done in the field of content selection, in a diverse range of domains e.g. weather forecasts (Coch, 1998).",
        "Approaches are usually domain specific and predominantly based on structured tables of well-defined input data.",
        "Duboue and McKeown (2003) attempted a statistical approach to content selection using a substantial corpus of biographical summaries paired with selected content, where they extracted rules and patterns linking the two.",
        "They then used machine learning to ascertain what was relevant.",
        "Barzilay and Lapata (2005) extended this approach but applying it to a sports domain (American football), similarly viewing content selection as a classification task and additionally taking account of contextual dependencies between data, and found that this improved results compared to a content-agnostic baseline.",
        "We aim throughout to extend and improve upon Barzilay and Lapata's methods.",
        "We emphasise that content selection through statistical machine learning is a relatively new area - approaches prior to Duboue and McKeown's are, in principle, much less portable - and as such there is not an enormous body of work to build upon.",
        "This work offers a novel algorithm for data-to-text alignment, presents a new 'grouping' method for sharing knowledge across similar but distinct learning instances and shows that holding back certain data from the machine learner, and reintroducing it later on can improve results."

        "Our data comes from the online Wisden almanack (Cricinfo, 2007), which we used to download 133 match report/scorecard pairs.",
        "We employed an HTML parser to extract the main text from the match report webpage, and the match data-tables from the scorecard webpage.",
        "An example scorecard can be found in Figure 1.",
        "In Figure 1, in the batting section R stands for 'runs made', M for 'minutes played on the field', B for 'number of balls faced'.",
        "4s and 6s are set numbers of runs awarded for hitting balls that reach the boundary.",
        "SR is the number of runs per 100 balls.",
        "In the bowling section, O stands for 'overs Result India won by 63 runs",
        "We use a supervised method to train our data, and thus need to find all 'links' between the scorecard and match report.",
        "We execute this alignment by first creating tags with tag attributes according to the common structure of the scorecards, and tag values according to the data within a particular scorecard.",
        "We then attempt to automatically align the values of those tags with factoids, single pieces of information found in the report.",
        "For example, from Figure 1 the fact that Ten-dulkar was the fourth player to bat on the first team is captured by constructing a tag with tag attribute team1-player4, and tag value 'SR Tendulkar'.",
        "The fact he achieved 113 runs is encapsulated by another tag, with tag attribute as team1-player4JR and tag value as '113'.",
        "Then if the report contained the phrase 'Tendulkar made 113 off 102 balls' we would hope to match the 'Tendulkar' factoid with our tag value 'SR Tendulkar', the '113' factoid with our tag value '113' and replace both factoids with their respective tag attributes, in this case teaml Jplayer4 and teaml-player4JR respectively.",
        "Similar methods for this problem have been employed by Barzilay and Lapata (2005) and",
        "Duboue and McKeown (2003).",
        "The basic idea behind our 6-step process for alignment is that we align those factoids we are",
        "bowled', M for 'maiden overs', R for 'runs conceded' and W for 'wickets taken'.",
        "Econ is 'economy rate', or number of runs per over.",
        "It is important to note that Figure 1 omits the opposing team's innings (comprising new instances of the 'Batting', 'Fall of Wickets' and 'Bowling' sections), and some additional statistics found at the bottom of the scorecard.",
        "most certain of first.",
        "The main obstacle we face when aligning is the large incidence of repeated numbers occurring within the scorecard, as this would imply we have multiple, different tags all with the same tag values.",
        "It is wholly possible (and quite typical) that single figures will be repeated many times within a single scorecard.",
        "Therefore it would be advantageous for us to have some means to differentiate amongst tags, and hopefully select the correct tag when encountering a factoid which corresponds to repeated tag values.",
        "Our algorithm is as follows:",
        "Preprocessing We began by converting all verbalised numbers to their cardinal equivalents, e.g. 'one', 'two' to '1', '2', and selected instances of 'a' into '1'.",
        "Proper Nouns In the irst round of tagging we attempt to match proper names from the scorecard with strings within the report.",
        "Additionally, we maintain a list of all players referenced thus far.",
        "Player-Relevant Details Using the list of players we have accumulated, we search the report for matches on tag values relating to only those players.",

        "Each category was composed of 'groups' (the rows within a category table), with each row referring to a distinct player, and each column referring to different types of action within that category ('attributes').",
        "B&L's technique for the purposes of the machine learning was to assign a '1' or '0' to each row, where a row would receive the value '1' if one or more of the entries in the row was verbalised in the report.",
        "In the context of our data we could apply a similar division, for example, by constructing a category entitled 'Batting' with attributes (columns) 'Runs', 'Balls', 'Minutes', '4s' and '6s' etc., and rows corresponding to players.",
        "In this case a group within that category would correspond to one line of the 'Innings' table in Figure 1.",
        "We note that B&L were selecting content on a row basis, while we are aiming to select individual tag attributes (i.e., specific row/column cell references) within the categories, a more difficult task.",
        "We discuss this further in Section 6.",
        "The technique above allows the machine learning algorithm to be aware that different statistics are semantically related - i.e., each group within a category contains the same 'type' of information.",
        "We therefore think this is a logical starting point for our work, and we aim to expand upon it.",
        "The key step was deciding upon an appropriate division of our scorecard into various categories and the groups for each category in the style of B&L. As can be seen from Figure 1 our input information is a mixture of structured (e.g.",
        "Bowling, Batting sections), semi-structured (Fall of Wickets section) and almost unstructured (Result) information.",
        "This is somewhat unlike B&L's data, which was fully structured in database form.",
        "We deal with this by enforcing a stronger structure - dividing the information into eight of our own 'categories', based roughly on the formatting of the webpages.",
        "These are outlined in Table 1.",
        "The first three categories in the table are quite intuitive and implicit from the respective sections of the scorecard.",
        "There is additional information in a typical scorecard (not shown in Figure 1), which we must also categorise.",
        "The 'Team Statistics' category contains details about the 'extras'scored by each team, as well as the number of points gained by the team towards that particular series.",
        "We divide the remaining tag attributes as follows into three categories: 'Officials' - persons participating in the match, other than the teams (e.g. umpires, referees); 'Match Details' - information that would have been known before the match was played (e.g. venue, date, season); and 'Match Result' - data that could only be known once the match was over (e.g. final result, player of the match).",
        "Finally we have an additional 'Partnerships'category which is given explicitly on a separate webpage referenced from each scorecard, but is also implicit from information contained in the 'Fall of Wickets' and 'Batting' sections.",

        "In fact it is even worse than Bmaj, our worst-performing baseline.",
        "We believe this is because the Majority Baseline is limited in the breadth of tags returned, whereas this method returns very large sets of over 200 tag attributes (due to the many contributing tag attributes of each category) while the average size of the training sets is 24.",
        "Ideally we want to strike a balance between the improved granularity of the Categorized Tags evaluation (without the low accuracy) with the excellent performance of the Categorized Groups evaluation (without the too-broad basketing).",

        "The method is identical to that of Section 3.1, with two important exceptions: The first is that we reintroduce player names after the learning, as above.",
        "The second is that instead of just a binary include/don't-include decision for each tag attribute, we offer a list of verbalised tag attributes to the learner, but anonymising them with respect to the group in which they appear.",
        "This enables the learner to, given any group, predict which tag attributes should be returned, independent of the group in question.",
        "This means groups with often-empty tag values are able to leverage the information from groups with usually populated tag values, hence solving our data-sparsity issues.",
        "For example, this will solve the issue, referenced in Section 4.2 of a lack of training data for particular player-combination partnerships.",
        "Having held back the group to which the tag attributes belong, we reintroduce them enabling discovery of the original tag attribute.",
        "This offers the benefits of categorization, but with a finer-grained approach to the returned sets of tag attributes.",
        "Our results are in Table 7 (row EC) and Figure 3.",
        "We achieved our best F score result of 0.4703 for a relatively low value of T = 20, and we can clearly see that boosting establishes a reasonable ruleset after a small number of iterations - we believe we have resolved the issue of data sparsity.",
        "The fact that this grouping has improved our results compared to feeding the information in 'flat' (as in Section 7.3) emphasises that the construction and make-up of the categories play a key role in defining performance."

        "This paper has presented an exploration of various methods which could prove useful when selecting content given a partially structured database of statistics and output text to emulate.",
        "We began by acquiring the necessary domain data, in the form of scorecards and reports, and employed a six-step process to align scorecard statistics verbalised in the reports.",
        "We next categorised our statistics based on the scorecard format.",
        "We established three baselines - one 'unthinking' probabilistic baseline, a 'sensible' probabilistic one, and another using categorization.",
        "We found that unassisted boosting actually performed worse than our comparable probabilistic baseline, Bprob, but its output was marginally more in line with the typical training data.",
        "We explored how categorization affected our results, and showed that by grouping similar sets of tag attributes together we achieved a 7.4% improvement over the comparable baseline value, Bnops(Table 4).",
        "We further improved this technique in a novel way by sharing structural information between learning instances, and by holding back certain information from the learner.",
        "Our final best F-value marked a relative 15.7% increase on Bnops.",
        "There are multiple avenues still available for exploration.",
        "One possibility would be to further investigate the effects of categorization from Section 3.2, for example by varying the size and number of categories.",
        "We would also like to apply our methods to another domain (e.g. rugby games) to establish the relative generality of our approach."
