        "In present-day Natural-Language Generation (NLG) architectures, elision rules typically form part of the Aggregation component, i.e. of the module that decides how to group conceptual messages into a sentence – a module belonging to the Microplanner (cf. Reiter & Dale, 2000, for an authoritative overview of sentence and text generation technology).",
        "In such generators, the computation of coordinate structures takes place at a relatively early stage of syntactic processing.",
        "However, many types of clausal coordinate ellipsis (CCE) require detailed comparisons of the final syntactic shape of the coordinated clauses (conjuncts).",
        "This is even more true when it is desirable to combine elision constructions, as in German example (1a), where Subgapping – a form of Gapping – combines with Backward Conjunction Reduction (for definitions and examples see Table 1).",
        "Example (1) also illustrates that often more than one elliptical option is available: (1b) shows a variant with Subgapping alone.",
        "If the nonelliptical sentence generator would choose a different Verb order in the second conjunct ('gestutzt werden sollen' as in (1d)), then Subgapping would be the sole alternative.",
        "(1) a.",
        "Die Bäume sollen gefällt werden und The trees should cut-down be and die Sträucher sollen gestutzt werden the shrubs should pruned be 'The trees should be cut down and the shrubs pruned'",

        "c. *Die Bäume sollen gefällt werden und gestutzt werden sollen die Sträucher",
        "d. Die Bäume sollen gefällt werden und gestutzt werden sollen die Sträucher",
        "The comparisons between the clausal conjuncts mainly pertain to the linear order of their major constituents and to identity relations between the lexical material contained in them.",
        "For instance, if a right-peripheral string of lexical items in the anterior conjunct is identical to such a string in the posterior conjunct, then Backward Conjunction Reduction licenses elision of the former string.",
        "In (1a), the two one-word strings 'werden ' meet this requirement.",
        "Language-typological work, e.g. the recent survey by Haspelmath (2007), provides another argument for a \"late\" CCE component.",
        "The main phenomena can be categorized into a small number of basic types, which have been attested in languages belonging to different language families.",
        "This suggests the possibility of a multilingual approach to CCE where the main CCE processes are defined as procedures that are isolated from the \"normal\" grammar rules for nonelliptical structures, and are independent from each other (see Section 4).",
        "Instead of having an aggregation component where the rules for nonelliptical clausal coordinate structures are intermingled with rules for elliptical variants, we consider an alternative approach where the application of the ellipsis rules is deferred until the nonelliptical structures have been completed.",
        "That is, the elision options are calculated and executed during a postediting stage, after the strategic and tactic components of the generator have delivered the nonelliptical versions.",
        "We claim that this modular approach facilitates the development of multilingual CCE components for different languages by switching on and off the individual CCE procedures (e.g. no Gapping in Japanese).",
        "The structure of the paper is as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we introduce the four main CCE phenomena and informally define their treatment in a procedural manner.",
        "Section 3 lays out the basic postediting rules that we implemented in JAVA as a language-neutral algorithm (nicknamed Elleipo, which means 'I leave out' in classical Greek).",
        "In Section 4, we present some findings from language-typological studies and explore their implications for potential multilingual applicability of Elleipo.",
        "Finally, in section 5, we draw some conclusions.",
        "The Elleipo version described here embodies several important improvements to a version described briefly in Harbusch & Kempen (2006), particularly with respect to Subject Gap in clauses with Finite/Fronted Verbs (SGF).",
        "Moreover, the space allowed here enables us to explain Elleipo's inner workings in more detail, and to demonstrate its multilingual potential."

        "Due to this feature, Elleipo can be combined, at least in principle, with various generators.",
        "However, the module needs a formalism-dependent interface that converts generator output to a (simple) canonical form.",

        "Figure 1).",
        "Every categorial node of an input tree is immediately dominated by a functional node.",
        "Each conjunct is rooted in a cate-gorial node whose daughter nodes (immediate constituents) are grammatical functions (Subject, Direct Object, Head, Subordinating Conjunction, Expr(ession), etc.).",

        "Categorial nodes are adorned with numerical identity tags (ID-tags) which express lemma identity.",
        "In Figure 1, the ID \"2\" is attached to the head node of both exemplars of AP 'heute' 'today', thus marking their lemma identity.",
        "In contrast, the Subject NPs 'Hans' and 'Susf carry different ID-tags, indicating that they are not lemma-identical and cannot be elided by any CCE process.",
        "Elleipo is called for every coordination domain within a non-elliptical input clause.",
        "We define a coordination domain as a (sub)tree rooting in a grammatical function node that dominates two or more categorial S-nodes separated by coordinating conjunctions (' and' ).",
        "For any given coordination domain, Elleipo's task consists of three consecutive stages: Preparation, Diagnosis, and ReadOut.",
        "The first job within Preparation is the demarcation of superclauses.",
        "Kempen (2009) introduced this notion in the treatment of Gapping, in particular LDG.",
        "A superclause is either a simple finite or non-finite clause (rooting in an S-node, without any subordinate clauses), or a hierarchy of finite or non-finite clauses where every embedded clause is an immediate daughter of an embedding clause; moreover, none of the participating clauses begins with a subordinating",

        "Next, Elleipo inspects and compares the content of the conjoined clauses by assembling four lists: FUNC-PAIRS, LI-FUNC-PAIRS, LPERIPH and RPERIPH (see Table 2).",
        "The lists",
        "FUNC-PAIRS and LI-FUNC-PAIRS are crucial not only in calculating whether a form of Gapping is applicable but also in the determination of contrastiveness of Gapping remnants.",
        "We presuppose a division of MODifier constituents into MOD types – locative (LMOD), temporal (TMOD, causal (CMOD), etc. – which are recorded in the two lists of pairs.",
        "Gapping requires the set of grammatical functions, including MOD types, in the anterior and posterior conjuncts to be identical.",
        "If so, and if FUNC-PAIRS includes at least one pair of non-coreferential members (carrying different ID-tags), the Boolean variable CONTRAST is set to true.",
        "In the example, FUNC-PAIRS(S0, S;;) includes two pairs of non-coreferential major constituents (the Subjects and the Complements); hence, CONTRAST = true.",
        "LPERIPH is crucial in FCR, where only complete form-identical major constituents may be elided.",
        "RPERIPH is used in BCR, which sometimes leaves incomplete constituents behind, as exemplified by (8) and (9).",
        "For each of the four CCE processes, Elleipo inspects all coordination domains for elision options.",
        "This requires interpreting the lists collected during the Preparation stage.",
        "Any licensed elision option for a word or constituent causes the current value of the parameter CCE-TYPE to be added as a tag to that word or constituent (cf. the subscripts in examples (2) through (10)).",
        "Different elliptical variants (cf. examples (1a/b)) are represented by multiple tags and yield alternative realizations, to be spelled out during the final ReadOut stage.",

        "In the example: GAPPING(S0, S;;, \"g\").",
        "Lemma identity of the Head Verbs of the clausal conjuncts licenses Gapping.",
        "So, the temporal Adverbial Modifier and the Head Verb of the posterior conjunct can both be marked for elision: 'Heute wird Hans sein Auto putzen und heuteg wirdg Susi ihr Fahrrad putzen' (steps 8 and 9).",
        "Earlier on, in step 3 and 4, Elleipo has already noticed that one of the non-lemma-identical pairs – and S;4 – consists of Complement clauses belonging to the same superclause as the coordinated main clauses (i.e. they do not start up a new superclause hierarchy).",
        "In step 6, Elleipo is called recursively for this coordinate subdomain, with argument CCE-TYPE set to \"gg\".",
        "As the Head Verbs of these complement clauses are lemma-identical and the contrastiveness condition holds (i.e. the grammatical function DOBJ occurs in both the anterior and the posterior complement and the exemplars are not lemma-identical), the posterior Verb is marked for elision, yielding ' Heute wird",

        "First, Gapping and BCR cannot elide both tokens of a lexical item.",
        "For instance, if 'putzen' in the anterior conjunct of (15) is elided due to BCR, then its posterior counterpart 'putzen,' which could be Gapped, should remain – and vice-versa.",

        "Third, in Gapping, if only one non-Head-Verb constituent remains (i.e.",
        "Stripping), then (the language-specific equivalent of) the Adverb 'too' is added.",
        "Fourth, SGF requires that FCR, if licensed, is actually executed.",

        "Like FCR, it elides a left-peripheral string of the posterior conjunct; like BCR, the elided string need not be a complete major constituent.",
        "The elided Verb yonde is part of the prenominal Relative clause yonde agenakatta which is a major constituent (immediate daughter) of the NP headed by the Noun hito.",
        "But notice that (16) embodies coordination of NPs rather than clauses.",

        "Haspelmath (2007) also discusses certain languages with Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) as basic word order (Turkish and Korean) which allow Object deletion from non-peripheral positions in the posterior conjunct; i.e., they license the pattern SOV&S_V, as in 'The-boy the-cart pulled and the-girl the-cart pushed.'",
        "Elleipo cannot handle this CCE structure: FCR and BCR require pe-ripherality of the elided constituent; SGF only applies to Subjects; and Gapping presupposes elision of the Head Verb.",
        "In order to encompass the problematic pattern, we may need to define a new CCE process.",
        "However, at least in Turkish SOV&S_V cases, the elision may be due to pragmatic factors.",

        "Because the anterior conjunct may provide such a context, one first needs to rule out contextual recoverability as the licensing factor.",
        "At the same time, Haspelmath also shows that Elleipo's four CCE processes cover a high proportion of CCE patterns occurring cross-linguistically.",
        "(However, he does not discuss SGF.)",
        "A typical illustration is the set of nine \"more widely attested patterns\" of CCE that he enumerates with respect to elision of Objects or Verbs in four language groups with different basic word orders of these patterns are covered by our four CCE processes, except SOV&S_V."
