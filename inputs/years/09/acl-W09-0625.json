        "This paper is about developing techniques for the empirical evaluation of affective natural language generation (NLG).",
        "Affective NLG has been defined as \"NLG that relates to, arises from or deliberately influences emotions or other non-strictly rational aspects of the Hearer\" (De Rosis and Grasso, 2000).",
        "It currently covers two main strands of work, the portrayal of non-rational aspects in an artificial speaker/writer (e.g. the work of Mairesse and Walker (2008) on projecting personality) and the use of NLG in ways sensitive to the non-rational aspects of the hearer/reader and calculated to achieve effects on these aspects (e.g. the work of De Rosis et al.",
        "(1999) on generating instructions in an emotionally charged situation and that of Moore et al.",
        "(2004) on producing appropriate tutorial feedback).",
        "Although there has been success in evaluating work of the first kind, it remains more problematic to evaluate whether work of the second type directly affects emotion or mood, or whether it influences task performance for other reasons.",
        "Since the work of Thompson (1977), NLG tasks have been considered to divide mainly into those involving strategy (\"deciding what to say\") and tactics (\"deciding how to say it\").",
        "It seems clear that one can affect a reader's emotion differently by making different strategic decisions about content (e.g. telling someone that they have passed an exam will make them happier than telling them that they have failed), but it is less clear that tactical alternations (e.g. involving ordering of material, choice of words or syntactic constructions) can have these kinds of effects.",
        "Unfortunately, the exact dividing line between strategy and tactics remains a matter of debate.",
        "For the purpose of this paper, we take \"strategic\" to cover matters of basic propositional content (the basic information to be communicated) and \"tactical\" to include most linguistic issues, including matters of emphasis and focus, inasmuch as they can be influenced by linguistic formulation.",
        "It is important to know whether tactical choices can influence emotions because to a large extent NLG research concentrates on tactical issues (partly because strategic NLG remains a rather domain-specific activity).",
        "Some light on the effects of tactical variations in text is shed by work in Psychology, where there has been a great deal of work on the effects of the \"framing\" of a text (Moxey and Sanford, 2000; Teigen and Brun, 2003).",
        "Some of this has been industrially funded, as there are considerable applications, for instance, in advertising.",
        "The alternative texts considered differ in ways that NLG researchers would call tactical.",
        "For instance, a piece of meat could be described as \"75% lean\" or \"25% fat\", and arguably these are alternative truthful descriptions of the same situation.",
        "However, evaluation of this work has been primarily in terms of whether it affects people's choices or evaluations",
        "Natural Language Generation, pages 146-153, 9 Association for Computational Linguistics",
        "of options available (Levin et al., 1998), or other aspects of task performance (O'Hara and Sternberg, 2001; Brown and Pinel, 2003; Cadinu et al., 2005).",
        "As far as we know it is unknown whether emotions can be affected in this way.",
        "There is therefore an open question about whether it is possible to detect the non-rational effects of different tactical decisions on readers.",
        "We believe that achieving this is important for the further scientific development of affective NLG.",
        "In the rest of this paper, we discuss previous (unsuccessful) attempts to measure emotional effects of tactical decisions in texts (section 2), the particular linguistic choices we have focussed on, including a text validation experiment (section 3) and our choice of a method for measuring emotions (section 4).",
        "In section 5 we then present a new study which for the first time demonstrates significant differences in emotions evoked in readers associated with tactical textual variations.",
        "We then briefly reflect on this result in a concluding section."

      "text": [
        "In (van der Sluis and Mellish, 2008) we described several experiments investigating different methods of measuring the effects of texts on emotions to demonstrate that tactical differences would lead to differences in effects.",
        "Our method was to present participants with texts about cancer-causing chemicals in foods or unexpected health-giving properties of drinking water and to attempt to measure the emotions invoked by different variations of these texts.",
        "However, we were unable to show statistically significant results of tactical variations.",
        "We mentioned the following possible explanations for this:",
        "• We used methods where participants reported on their own emotions.",
        "However, it could be that (in this context) participants were unwilling or unable to report accurately.",
        "• The self-reporting methods used were perhaps not fine grained enough to register the differences between the effects of similar texts.",
        "• The texts themselves were perhaps too subtly different or not long enough to induce strong emotions.",
        "• The participants were perhaps not involved enough in the task to get strong emotions.",
        "We believe that of these, the final reason is the most compelling.",
        "The self-reporting methods used had been validated and used in multiple previous studies in Psychology, and so there was no reason to suggest that they would fundamentally fail in this new context.",
        "The granularity of the measurement methods can be improved relatively simply (see section 4 below).",
        "But it is very believable that the participants would fail to be really concerned by the texts in the experiments reported since the source was unclear, the message a general one not addressed to them individually and the topic (healthy and unhealthy food) one that occurs often enough in newspapers to fail to overcome natural boredom.",
        "The main innovation of the experiment we describe below was in our method of seeking the emotional involvement of the participants.",
        "The texts that the participants read took the form of \"feedback\" on a (fake) IQ test that they undertook as part of the experiment.",
        "We selected university students as the participants, as they would likely be concerned about their intelligence, especially as compared to their peers.",
        "The texts appeared to be written individually for the participants and so sought to engage them directly."

        "As in (van der Sluis and Mellish, 2008), the study we present here sought to evoke positive emotions to differing extents in a reader by tactical manipulations to \"slant\" the tasks positively to varying degrees.",
        "This section describes the text variations used and their validation.",
        "The two texts produced for this experiment were written by hand, but used the following methods to give a more \"positive slant\" to a text.",
        "These are all methods that could be implemented straightforwardly in an NLG system.",
        "In the following, the word \"positive polarity\" is used to refer to propositions giving good news to the reader or attributes which give good news to the reader if they have high values (such as the reader's intelligence).",
        "Similarly \"negative polarity\" refers to items that represent bad news, e.g. failing a test.",
        "For ethical reasons, negative polarity items did not arise in this experiment.",
        "A.",
        "Sentence emphasis - include explicit emphasis in sentences expressing positive polarity propositions (e.g. exclamation marks and phrases such as \"on top of this\").",
        "B.",
        "Choice of vague evaluative adjectives - when evaluating positive polarity attributes, choose vague evaluative adjectives that are more positive over ones that are less positive (e.g. \"excellent\", rather than \"ok\").",
        "C. Choice of vague adverbs - provide explicit emphasis to positive polarity propositions by including vague adverbs expressing great extent (e.g. \"significantly\", rather than \"to some extent\" or no adverb).",
        "D. Choice of verbs - for a positive polarity proposition, choose a verb that emphasises the great extent of the proposition (e.g. \"outperformed\", rather than \"did better than\").",
        "E. Choice of realisation of rhetorical relations - when realising a concession/contrast relation between a positive polarity proposition and one that is negative or neutral, word it so that the positive polarity proposition is in the nucleus (more emphasised) position (e.g. say \"although you did badly on X, you did well on Y\" instead of \"although you did well on Y, you did badly on X\").",
        "The idea is that an NLG system would employ methods of this kind in order to \"slant\" a message positively, rather that to present a message in a more neutral way.",
        "This might be done, for instance, to induce positive emotions in a reader who needs encouragement.",
        "We claim that these choices can be viewed as tactical, i.e. that they are \"allowable\" alternative realisations of the same underlying content.",
        "For instance, we believe a teacher could use such methods in giving feedback to a student needing encouragement without fear of prosecution for misrepresenting the same truth that would be expressed without the use of these methods.",
        "Whenever one words a proposition in different ways, it can be claimed that a (perhaps subtle) change of meaning is involved.",
        "However, in these cases we claim that it is the writer's attitudes that are being manipulated (and reflected in the text).",
        "We can therefore choose between these alternatives by varying the writer, not the underlying message.",
        "Our view is supported by a number of current accounts of the semantics of vague adjectives (though this is not an area without controversy).",
        "Many accounts of vagueness appeal to the idea that there is a norm which an adjective like \"tall\" implicitly refers to, and some of these argue both that the norm itself can be contextually determined and also that the amount by which the norm has to be exceeded has to be \"significant\" to a degree which is \"relativized to some agent\" (Kennedy, 2007).",
        "For instance, with the phrase \"John is tall\"",
        "\"the property [...] attributed to John is not an intrinsic property, but rather a relational one.",
        "Moreover, it is not a property the possession of which depends only on the difference between Johns height and some norm, but also on whether that difference is a significant one.",
        "I take it that whether or not a difference is a significant difference does not depend only on its magnitude, but also on what our interests are\" (Graff, 2000)",
        "It is compatible with these accounts that different agents, with different interests and notions of what is noteworthy, can use vague adjectives in different ways.",
        "Another reason for considering these methods as tactical is that in an NLG system, they would likely be implemented somewhere late in the \"pipeline\".",
        "Probably the best way to check that we are using tactical alternations (according to our definition) is via some kind of text validation experiment with human participants.",
        "Section 3.3 below describes such an experiment, which provides strong support for this position.",
        "For the experiment, we produced two feedback texts describing the same set of intelligence test results, one relatively neutral and one \"positively slanted\" using the above methods.",
        "In the experiment, they were given to participants in two groups, named \"0\" and \"+\" respectively.",
        "Each text consisted of 7 sentences, with a direct correspondance between the sentences of the two texts.",
        "Figure 1 presents the variations used in the feedback used in the experiment for group + (i.e. positively slanted) and group 0 (i.e. neutrally slanted).",
        "Note that the actual numbers are the same in both texts.",
        "A text validation study was conducted in which 15 colleagues participated.",
        "The participants were asked to comment on 12 sentence pairs, the 7 shown in Figure 1 and 5 additional filler pairs.",
        "The following analysis reports on our findings on the 7 sentence pairs shown in Figure 1 only.",
        "In order that we could test our intuitions about the tactical nature of the linguistic alternations (discussed in section 3.1 above), the participants were presented with a scenario where there were two different teachers, Mary Jones and Gordon",

        "There are two broad ways of measuring the emotions of human subjects - physiological methods and self-reporting.",
        "Physiological methods unfortunately tend to have the problems of complex setup and calibration, which mean that it is hard to transport them between tasks or individuals.",
        "In addition, although emotional states are undoubtedly connected to physiological variables, it is not always clear what is being measured by these methods (cf. (Lazarus et al., 1980); (Cacioppo et al., 2000) ).",
        "Because of these problems, we have opted to investigate self-reporting methods, as validated and used widely in psychological experiments.",
        "Three well-established methods that are used frequently in the field of psychology are the Russel Affect Grid (Russell et al., 1989), the Self Assessment Manikin (SAM) (Lang, 1980) and the Positive and",
        "Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) (Watson et al., 1988).",
        "In our previous study (van der Sluis and Mellish, 2008), we had problems with participants understanding how to use the Russel Affect Grid and SAM and so now we opted to use a version of the PANAS test.",
        "The PANAS test is a scale using affect terms that describe positive and negative feelings and emotions.",
        "Participants in the experiment read the terms and indicate to what extent they experi-ence(d) the emotions indicated by each of them using a five point scale ranging from (1) very slightly/not at all, (2) a little, (3) moderately, (4) quite a bit to (5) extremely.",
        "A total score for positive affect is calculated by simply adding the scores for the positive terms, and similarly for negative affect.",
        "As before, we used a simplified version of the PANAS scale in order not to overburden the participants with questions and to avoid bored answering.",
        "In this test, which has been fully validated (Mackinnon et al., 1999), participants have to rate only 10 instead of 20 terms: 5 for positive affect (i.e. alert, determined, enthusiastic, excited, inspired) and 5 for negative affect (i.e. afraid, scared, nervous, upset, distressed).",
        "Our use of the simplified PANAS in this study differed from our previous study, however, by having participants respond to the PANAS questions using a slider, rather than a five point scale.",
        "This means that only two terms were put at the extreme ends of the slider (i.e. 'very slightly/not at all' and 'extremely' were presented but not 'alittle', 'moderately' or 'quite a bit').",
        "The change to use a slider was because van der Sluis and Mellish (2008) observed partipants only using a small part of the possible scale for answers, and within this the five point scale might have lost useful information.",
        "Although our particular experiment focussed on positive affect, we included the negative affect terms partly so that we could detect outliers in our participant set - people who were perhaps extremely nervous about the test or sensitive about their IQ.",

        "An outline of the set up is given in Figure 2.",

        "To make it more difficult for the participant to keep track of how well/poorly she performed over the course of the test, it also said that the test consisted of open and multiple choice questions that had different weight factors in the calculation of the overall score and that would assess various aspects of their intelligence.",
        "Subsequently, the participant was asked to tick a consent form to participate in the study.",
        "Then a questionnaire followed in which the participant was asked about her age, gender and the quality of her English.",
        "She was also asked if she had any experience with IQ tests and how she expected to score on this one.",

        "We did some post-hoc investigation in an attempt to understand the main result more fully.",
        "When looking at the positive PANAS scores in more detail (see Table 2), it turns out that only three of the five positive PANAS terms included in the simplified PANAS test render promising results.",
        "Interactions were found for the terms 'alert' (F(1, 28) = 10.291, p < .003) and 'enthusiastic' (F(1, 28) = 5.651, p < .025).",
        "No interactions were found for the terms 'determined' and 'inspired'.",
        "For 'inspired' however, we found a main effect of feedback type : (F(1, 28) = 8.755, p < .006), which indicates that participants in the +-group could have been more inspired because of their test scores than participants in the 0-group.",
        "Not all of these results would be significant if Bonferroni corrections were made.",
        "It is possible that this result could have been caused by other (systematic but unanticipated) differences between the two groups.",
        "In particular, perhaps the result could be caused by a difference in how well the two groups of participants expected to perform.",
        "As it happens, participants were asked: 'How do you expect to score on an intelligence test?'",
        "before they did the test.",
        "The answers to this question are summarised in Table 3.",
        "This data suggests that participants in the +-group initially had higher expectations.",
        "It is difficult to get a consensus from the psychological literature about how this might have affected the results.",
        "On the one hand, some studies have shown that positive expectations can have an accelerating effect on a person's actual positive emotional experience (Wilson et al., 2003; Wilson and Klaaren, 1992).",
        "Such results might suggest an alternative explanation of the fact that the +-group showed a greater change in positive emotions.",
        "On the other hand, it might be argued that subjects with lower expectations would be more surprised (since both texts presented good results) and so their emotions would have been influenced more significantly.",
        "That is, if a subject already expects to do well then one would not expect that finding that they actually did well would cause much of a change in their emotions.",
        "This would predict that it should be the 0-group that shows the greatest emotion change.",
        "Overall, it is hard to know whether the data about expectations should affect our confidence in the experiment result, though it would be worthwhile controlling for initial expectations in further experiments of this kind."

        "Compared with the previous study of van der Sluis and Mellish (2008), we expected participants to indicate stronger emotional effects, because the text participants were asked to read was about their own capabilities instead of about something in the world around them which they could think would not affect them.",

        "The fact that we have been able to show a significant difference in the emotions induced by the two texts is very encouraging.",
        "It suggests that there is a possible methodology for directly evaluating affective NLG and that the tactical concerns with which much of NLG research is occupied are relevant to affective NLG.",
        "A similar methodology could perhaps now be used to determine the effectiveness of specific NLG methods and mechanisms in terms of inducing emotions.",
        "Although we have now shown that NLG tactical decisions can affect emotions, it remains to be seen what kind of changes in strategy, learning, motivation, etc., can be induced by positive affect and thus how these framing decisions would best be made by an NLG system."
