        "What Game Theory can do for NLG: the case of vague language",

        "To demonstrate some of the strengths and weaknesses of the Game-Theoretical approach, we focus on the utility of vague expressions.",

        "Natural Language Generation (NLG) is the area of computational linguistics that is concerned with the mapping from non-linguistic to linguistic expressions (e.g. Reiter and Dale 2000).",
        "This formulation might be taken to suggest that NLG is best viewed as a kind of translation problem, where the challenge is to find a way to convert a formal expression into (for example) an English one.",
        "In its early years, this may have been a fruitful way to think about NLG but, these days, a better perspective is of NLG as a choice problem.",
        "For after the advances of recent years, the problem is no longer such much \"How on Earth can this information be expressed in English?",
        "\", but rather \"From all the possible ways to express this information in English, which one is the most effective choice?\"",
        "Let us try to say this a bit more precisely.",
        "It is usually fair to assume that the formal expressions from which NLG takes its departure are themselves clear and unambiguous.",
        "Let us call the inputs to the generator Meanings.",
        "Now suppose we have a grammar that tells us how each given Meaning can be expressed in a language such as English.",
        "The task for NLG now is to choose, for each of these Meanings, which of all the different linguistic Forms that can express it (according to the grammar) is the best expression of this particular Meaning.",
        "Ultimately, this choice is likely to depend on a number of other parameters, such as the identity of the hearer, and the words that have earlier been used.",
        "In the present paper, these \"contextual\" issues will largely be ignored, allowing us to simplify by thinking in terms of a mapping from Meanings to Forms.",
        "The perspective that views NLG as a choice problem is far from new (see e.g. McDonald 1987, where it takes a central position); in fact, it forms the methodological spine of Systemic-Functional Grammar, with its AND/OR graphs (Bateman 1997).",
        "Given this perspective, the question comes up what factors determine the choice between different linguistic Forms.",
        "This question is difficult to answer in detail, but at the most abstract level, the answer is likely to have something to do with the \"utility\"of the different Forms that can be generated, and perhaps such additional factors as the cost to the speaker of generating them, and the cost to the hearer of processing (e.g., parsing and interpreting) them.",
        "To utter a sentence is to perform an action, and the choice between different actions is naturally thought of as governed by utility, understood in the broadest possible sense."

        "There can be thousands of dangerous roads on a given night, and it is often impossible to say in a few words exactly which road are dangerous (Turner et al.",
        "2008).",
        "One summary produced by the generator might approximate the data by saying 'Roads in the Highlands are icey' while another might say 'Roads above 500 metres are icey' (assume this covers a larger set of roads).",
        "It matters which of these summaries is generated, because each summary will lead to a different set of roads being treated with salt (i.e., gritted).",
        "The first summary may have 10 false positives (i.e., roads gritted unnecessarily) and 10 false negatives (i.e., dangerous roads not gritted); the second summary might have 100 false positives and only 2 false negatives.",
        "In a situation of this kind, which involves a tradeoff between safety on the one hand, and money and environmental damage (from salt) on the other, decision theory would be a natural framework in which to compare the utility of the two summaries.",
        "If a false positive has a negative utility of – 0.1 and a false negative one of – 0.5, for example, then the first summary wins the day.",
        "(Needless to say, the choice of these constants is crucial, and tricky to justify.)",
        "More specifically, many NLG systems invite a game-theoretical analysis - or an Optimality-Theoretic analysis, which can come down to the same thing (Dekker and Van Rooij 2000; Van Deemter 2004 for an application to NLG).",

        "Game Theory was conceived in the nineteen fourties (Von Neumann and Morgenstern 1944) and has since come to be used extensively by economists, sociologists, biologists, and others.",
        "Far from being limited to games in a limited sense of the word, Game Theory is the mathematical study of rational social interaction and, as such, it is reasonable to expect it to be able to shed light on language use as well.",
        "Perhaps more than anything, it promises to have the potential to explain why communication works the way it does.",
        "For if we could show that people's linguistic behaviour conforms with what it would be rational for them to do, then this would have substantial explanatory value.",

        "8 degrees', but he might also round this off even further, saying that it is 'approximately 40 degrees'.",
        "Even more vaguely, she might tell you that you have 'a high fever'.",

        "First, let us focus on a type of situations where it is relatively easy to understand what the differential benefits of vagueness can be.",
        "We start by examining a game-theoretic study of a different phenomenon: ambiguity.",
        "Like others who have discussed these issues, we take vagueness to arise if an expression allows borderline cases.",
        "The word 'tall', for example, is vague because in a typical context there can be people who are difficult to categorise as either tall or not tall: they are somewhat in between, one is tempted to say.",
        "Ambiguity is something else.",
        "It arises when an expression can be meant in a limited number of different ways.",
        "The word 'letter', for example, is ambiguous because it can refer to one individual character or to the sort of meaningful arrangement of characters that people once used to communicate long distance.",
        "In 1994, two game theorists asked whether a Game Theoretical explanation might be given for strategic use of ambiguity (i.e., where ambiguity is used on purpose), and they came up with the following answer (Aragones and Neeman 1994).",
        "Suppose two unscrupulous politicians position themselves for an election.",
        "Not burdened with any convictions, they are free to choose between three different idiologies (left, right, center), depending on what gives them the highest utility; additionally, they can choose between two commitment levels, chigh and c1ow, both representable as real numbers with chigh > c1ow.",
        "Unfortunately, Aragones and Neeman do not say what a commitment level is, but one might think of a more and a less extreme version of their chosen ideology.",
        "What combination of an ideology and an commitment level should each politician choose?",
        "This depends on the electorate, of course.",
        "Suppose there are three blocs of voters: V(left), V(right) and V(center).",
        "A leftist voter prefers a leftist politician, and preferably one with a high commitment level.",
        "Confronted with a choice between two rightwing politicians, our leftist voter will prefer one with a low commitment.",
        "A rightwing voter behaves as the mirror-image of the leftist voter, while the neutral voter is neutral between the two idiolo-gies but, weary of ideology, she prefers low commitment over high commitment.",
        "Commitment, in other words, is only relevant for a choice between politicians of the same ideology.",
        "If this is the whole story then politicians will choose an ideology and commitment level based on their estimates of the numbers of voters in each bloc, trying to maximise their expected payoff, formulated solely in terms of the likelihood of winning the election.",
        "The task for Game Theory is to work out what combination of strategies might give both politicians the highest possible payoff, for example in the sense that a policy change by just one of the two politicans can never improve his expected payoff.",
        "But Aragones and Neeman's model allows politicians to look beyond the election, towards their anticipated time in government.",
        "Surely, a low commitment is easier to fulfil than a high commitment, particularly in view of unforeseen contingencies, so it is nicer to be elected on a low-commitment platform that does not tie one's hands too much.",
        "To model this, Aragones and Neeman formulate utility in a way that multiplies the probability of a politician's winning the elections with a constant that is negatively correlated to his commitment.",
        "Let Ui(Ii,ci; I2, c2) be the utility for politician i given that politician 1 chooses ideology Ii with commitment level ci, while politician 2 chooses I2 with level c2.",
        "Furthermore, Pi(Ii,ci; I2,c2) represents the probability of i winning the elections given this same constellation of choices.",
        "Let k > chigh.",
        "Under these assumptions one can show that a low commitment level (i.e., c1ow) can sometimes give a politician a slightly lower probability of winning the elections (because his core voters will be less inclined to vote for him), yet a higher overall utility (because his time in office will be easier).",
        "For details see Aragones and Neeman (1994).",
        "It is often thought that Aragones and Neeman's model demonstrates how ambiguity can be used strategically, but that it fails to shed light on vagueness (e.g. De Jaegher 2003).",
        "I do not see, however, how this view stands up to linguistic scrutiny.",
        "To see why, let me construct what strikes me as a possible example.",
        "Suppose the ideology in question - a leftist, or perhaps a populist one - is to take away money from the 10% of richest people and give it to the 10% poorest.",
        "Commitment level, in this case, could be a way of making explicit what percentage of the top 10% to give away.",
        "One position might assert that this has to be, say, 50% of their income, while another position might put this figure at 5%.",
        "But if we identified high commitment with the 50% position and low commitment with the 5% position then none of the two commitment levels would be ambiguous.",
        "To make one of them ambiguous, we would need something like the following:",
        "The ambiguous politicians' game:",
        "- I: take money from the 10% of richest people and divide it equally over the 10% poorest.",
        "- c50: do I with 50% of the money of each of the richest people.",
        "- cambigUoUs: do I with either 5% or 50% of the money of each of the richest people.",
        "But this must be a simplification, for we are dealing with a continuum: there is nothing to exclude percentages in between 25% and 5%, for example.",
        "It seems, therefore, perfectly possible to construct a version of Aragones and Neeman's game - an even more plausible version, I believe - that hinges on vagueness.",
        "For example:",
        "The vague politicians' game: 1 and c50: (as above).",
        "- cvague: do I with a large portion of the money of each of the richest people",
        "Clearly, cvague involves vagueness, because 'a large portion' admits borderline cases.",
        "In all important respects the vague politicians' game is isomorphic to the ambiguous politicians' game: fierce advocates of redistribution would favour c50over cvague, for example, because the latter leaves them uncertain over the amount of redistribution.",
        "It is also plausible that politicians would prefer to avoid a commitment as clear as c50, because future contingencies might make it difficult for them to honour this promise.",
        "In fact, one could extend the game with a second election, in which the electorate could give their verdict on a politician's time in office, and to adapt the utility formula with a third term which represents the probability of winning that second election.",
        "Surely, the breaking of promises doesn't do much for a politician's changes of being re-elected, and a precise promise is easier to break than a vague one.",
        "With help from Aragones and Neeman, we have found a situation in which vagueness has a higher utility than precision.",
        "It should be noted, however, that this model (and that of De Jaegher 2003 likewise) hinges on the fact that the interests of the speaker and the hearer differ: what's good for the politician may be bad for his voters.",
        "NLG systems can be faced with similar asymmetries, for example when an artificial doctor decides to keep its predictions vague to avoid being contradicted by the facts; a doctor who says \"These symptoms will disappear fairly soon\" is less likely to get complaints than one who says \"These symptoms will have disappeared by midnight next Sunday\".",
        "Something similar holds for a roadgritting system (like the one in Turner et al.",
        "2008), which might easily face lawsuits if it gets things too evidently wrong.",

        "So, let us investigate the advantages of vagueness in situations that are typical for today's NLG systems, where the system tries, unselfishly, to assist a user to the best of its ability.",
        "The question why vagueness is used strategically in situations where the interests of speakers and hearers are essentially aligned was asked perhaps most forcefully by the economist Barton Lipman.",
        "First he did this in a brief response to an essay by the famous game theorist Ariel Rubinstein (Lip-man 2000), and later in a growing but still unfinished discussion paper (Lipman 2006).",
        "Lipman uses what we shall call an airport scenario, where player 1 asks player 2 to go to the airport to pick up an acquaintance of player 1.",
        "In its simplest form, the scenario lets player 1 know the referent's height with full precision (assuming that such a thing is possible), while player 2 carries a perfect measuring device.",
        "There are two other people at the airport, and it is assumed that heights are distributed uniformly between a maximum denoted by 1 and a minimum denoted by 0.",
        "The payoff for both players - please note the symmetry!",
        "- is 1 if player 2 successfully picks the referent, while it is 0 if she fails (i.e., the first person she addresses turns out to be someone else).",
        "Lipman observes that, under these assumptions, vagueness would be bad: why would player 2 say 'He is tall', for example, if he can say 'He is 183.721cm'?",
        "By stating his acquaintance's exact height, player 1 will allow player 2 to identify this person with almost complete certainty, given that the chance of two people having the exact same height is almost nil.",
        "Lipman also wonders what would happen if only one predicate was available to player 1.",
        "He proves that, under these assumptions, optimal communication arises if a word is used in accordance with the following rule:",
        "Say 'the tall person' if height(person) > 1/2, else say 'the short person'.",
        "Lipman observes that this concept of 'tall' does not involve vagueness, because the rule does not allow any borderline cases: everyone is either tall or short.",
        "In other words, no rationale for vagueness has yet been found.",
        "Note that Lipman is not questioning that vague utterances can be useful, which they evidently can be (see e.g. Parikh 1994 for a convincing demonstration using a game-theoretic approach).",
        "He is asking whether vague expressions can be more useful than any non-vague expression.",
        "First, let us consider a possible modification of Lipman's scenario.",
        "In this modified airport scenario the speaker knows the heights of all three people at the airport.",
        "Suddenly it becomes easier to understand why vagueness can be useful.",
        "For suppose your acquaintance happens to be the tallest person of the three.",
        "You can then identify him as 'the tall guy'.",
        "Arguably, this is safer than citing the person's height in centimeters, because 'the tall guy' (meaning, in this case, the same as tallest guy) does not require the players to make any measurements: comparisons between heights can often be made in an instant, and with more confidence than absolute measurements.",
        "I dealt with cases of this type in my paper on vague descriptions (van Deemter 2006), where a generator takes numerical height measurements to produce noun phrases that involve gradable adjectives: 'the tall guy', 'the fastest one of the three heavy tortoises'.",
        "In cases like this, one can argue that vagueness is only local, in the same way that ambiguity can be merely local, for example when the sentence as a whole allows one to disambiguate an ambiguous word in it (e.g. when a pronoun gets resolved or a lexical item disambiguated).",
        "In the modified airport scenario, the noun phrase as a whole (e.g., 'the tall guy') allows no borderline cases, so there is no global vagueness here.",
        "Local vagueness is widespread and can make use of different \"precisification\" mechanisms.",
        "When I say of a gymnastic exercise, for example, that it is 'good for young and old', for example, then there is nothing vague about my description of the people involved: I am using vague words to say that this exercise is good for everyone, regardless of age.",
        "Although local vagueness constitutes some kind of answer to Lipman, most linguists assume that globally vague utterances exist as well (even when the interests of the speaker and the hearer are aligned).",
        "Let us assume they are right and continue to look for a rationale.",
        "Secondly, it has been suggested that strategic vagueness can arise from a desire to reduce the \"cost\" of the utterances involved (e.g. Van Rooij 2003, Jager 2008).",
        "One might amplify this idea by arguing that vague words are part of a highly efficient mechanism that makes their meaning dependent on the context in which they are used.",
        "The size constraints on 'a small elephant', for example, are very different from those on 'a small mouse'; this suggests that vague words may not only be efficient to use but also efficient to learn (Van Deemter, in preparation).",
        "All this seems true enough but, as an answer to the question \"Why vagueness?\"",
        "it does not stand up to Lipman-style scrutiny.",
        "Let me explain why not.",
        "Consider the earlier-mentioned doctor, who measures your body temperature as 39.82 Celcius.",
        "By stating that you have 'a high fever' (instead of 'thirty eight point eighty two degrees') the doctor is pruning away details that are of questionable relevance in the situation at hand.",
        "But this does not force him to use language that is vague: language that allows borderline cases, in other words.",
        "He could have achieved a similar economy by rounding, saying that your temperature is '(about) forty degrees'; in this way, he would have reduced information without being vague.",
        "The benefits of information reduction can be modelled in a game where communication informs action: if ' 38.82 Celcius' and ' 39 Celcius' are associated with the same medical action (e.g., to take an aspirin) then the fact that ' 39 Celcius' is \"cheaper\" to produce and to process will tend to give this expression a better utility than '38.82 Celcius'.",
        "But information reduction does not imply vagueness, so we are back at square one: Why vagueness?",
        "It might be thought that things change when uncertainty is taken into account: a measurement of 39.82 Celcius is not as exact as it sounds, for example, because errors are likely.",
        "The result of the measurement is perhaps best conveyed by a normal distribution of which 39.82 is the mean value, and such a complex curve is difficult to put in just a few words.",
        "Still, the argument of the previous paragraph continues to apply, because the curve can be summarised without vagueness: the figure of 38.82 Celcius is one such summary.",
        "A third suggestion (e.g. Veltman 2002) is that vague expressions such as 'high fever' do more than just reduce the information obtained from a measurement.",
        "The expression 'high fever' also adds bias or evaluation to the raw data, namely the information that the temperature in question is worrisome.",
        "You do not need domain knowledge to understand the medical implications: hearing that something medical is 'high' tells you that you should be worried.",
        "Once again, this sounds like an excellent reason for using vagueness, particularly in situations where an understanding of the metric in question cannot be taken for granted (such as oxygen saturation, the metrics for which mean little to most of us).",
        "Still, it is not evident that this justifies the use of vagueness.",
        "If bias needs to be expressed, then why not simply add it?",
        "Why not state the exact temperature (or an approximation of it) and say that this reading should be considered worrisome?",
        "One might respond that this would have been time and space consuming, but if that is a problem then why have no conventions arisen for expressing quantities in two ways, a worrisome and a non-worrisome one?",
        "Why should bias necessarily be coupled with vagueness only, given that it is as easy to think of a crisp expression that contains bias as it is to think of a vague expression that does not (e.g., in the case of an adjective like 'tall')?",
        "A good example of crispness + bias is the word 'obese', in the sense of having a Body Mass Index of over 30.",
        "For the reason why obesity was defined in this way is precisely that this degree of overweight is considered medically worrisome."

        "It is also clear why vagueness can have differential benefits in communication between agents whose interests differ more than just minimally (cf., Horton and Keysar 1996 for experimental evidence of speaker's laziness in situations where their interests are approximately aligned), such as a politician and his potential voters, or like a professional who does not wish to be sued by his clients.",
        "In situations of this kind it can be beneficial for a speaker or an NLG system to obfuscate, exploiting the borderline cases inherent in vague expressions.",
        "Beyond this, it is suprisingly difficult to see how vagueness can be advantageous for NLG.",
        "This is partly because there appear to exist some linguistic issues that NLG researchers are able to disregard.",
        "It seems plausible, for example, that vagueness is unavoidable in situations where no commonly understood metrics are available, for instance when we judge how beautiful a sunset is, how wise a person, or how dismal the weather.",
        "As long as NLG systems use tangible input data (about millimetres rainfall, for example, or body temperature), these reasons for vagueness seem irrelevant.",
        "Similarly, there is much that is unknown about the working of perception even in simple domains.",
        "What is it that allows me to talk about the height of someone I see, for example?",
        "The input to my personal \"generator\" (as opposed to the input to a typical NLG system) might not be equivalent to a tidy number.",
        "(Could it be some inherently vague percept, perhaps?)",
        "These difficult questions (see also Lipman 2006) must remain unanswered here.",
        "Confronted with the claim that Game Theory should be the theoretical backbone to NLG, some people might respond that no new backbone is needed, because the theory of formal languages, conjoined with a properly expressive variant of Symbolic Logic, provides sufficient backbone already.",
        "I believe this objection to be misguided.",
        "Admittedly, the disciplines in question are well suited for saying which Forms can express which Meanings.",
        "But it is far less clear that these disciplines have anything to say about the key problem of NLG: how to choose the most effective way to express a given Meaning in (for example) English.",
        "This is a vacancy that Game Theory would be well placed to fulfill, in my opinion.",
        "The present paper has illustrated this claim by discussing the question when and why a generator should choose a vague expression.",
        "The fact that this discussion has yet to produce a clear conclusion is, in my opinion, not due to any shortcomings of Game Theory, but to the intrinsic difficulty of the problem.",
        "There is, of course, a caveat.",
        "The use of game theory in empirical sciences has, with proper modestly, been described as \"modelling by example\" (e.g. Rasmussen 2001): a mathematical game shows us an example of how things might be, not necessarily how things are.",
        "The situation is familiar to linguists, of course, and from applications of mathematics more generally.",
        "By inspecting a formal grammar, for example, one does not learn much about language, unless there exists evidence that the lingistic Forms and Meanings pair up as specified by the grammar.",
        "In similar fashion, one learns little from a Game Theoretical model unless one has reason to accept the assumptions that were built into it: the choices that it assumes available to the players, and the payoffs related to each outcome of the game, for example.",
        "This means that Game Theory can come to the aid of linguistic pragmatics and NLG, but that only empirical research can tell us what games people actually play when they communicate."
