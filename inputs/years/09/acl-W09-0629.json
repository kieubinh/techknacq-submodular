        "The three editions of the tuna stec have attracted a substantial amount of interest.",
        "In addition to a sizeable body of new work on referring expression generation, as another tangible outcome of these stecs we now have a wide range of different sets of system outputs for the same set of inputs.",
        "A particularly valuable resource is the pairing of these outputs from the submitted systems in each edition with evaluation data.",
        "As this was the last time we are running a stec with the tuna data, we will now make all data sets, documentation and evaluation software from all tuna stecs available to researchers.",
        "We are planning to add to these as many system outputs as we can, so that other researchers can perform evaluations involving these.",
        "We are also planning to complete our evaluations of the evaluation methods we have developed.",
        "Among such experiments will be direct comparisons between the results of the three variants of the identiication experiment we have tried out, and a direct comparison between different designs for human-assessed intrinsic evaluations (e.g. comparing the slider design reported here to preference judgments and rating scales).",
        "Apart from the technological progress in reg which we hope the tuna stecs have helped achieve, perhaps the single most important scien-tiic result is strong evidence for the importance of extrinsic evaluations, as these do not necessarily agree with the results of much more commonly used intrinsic types of evaluations."
