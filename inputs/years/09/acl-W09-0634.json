        "Generation of referring expressions has been studied for the last two decades.",
        "The basic orientation of this research was pursuing an algorithm that generates a minimal description which uniquely identifies a target object from distractors.",
        "Thus the research was oriented and limited by two constraints: minimality and uniqueness.",
        "The constraint on minimality has, however, been relaxed due to the computational complexity of generation, the perceived naturalness of redundant expressions, and the easiness of understanding them (e.g., (Dale and Reiter, 1995; Spanger et al., 2008)).",
        "On the other hand, the other constraint of uniqueness has not been paid much attention to.",
        "One major aim of our research is to relax this constraint on uniqueness because of the reason explained below.",
        "The fundamental goal of our research is to deal with multipartite objects, which have constituents with different attribute values.",
        "Typical domain settings in previous literature use uniform objects like the table A shown in Figure 1.",
        "However, real life is not so simple.",
        "Multipartite objects such as tables B and C can be found easily.",
        "Therefore this paper introduces the concept of parts ofobjects to deal with more complex domains containing such objects.",
        "Hereby the constraint on uniqueness becomes problematic because people easily generate and understand logically ambiguous expressions in such domains.",
        "For example, people often use an expression such as \"the table with red corners\" to identify table B. Logically speaking, this expression is equally applicable both to A and to B, that is, violating the constraint on uniqueness.",
        "And yet people seem to have no problem identifying the intended target correctly and have little reluctance to use such an expression (Evidence is presented in Section 3).",
        "We think that this reflects some type of pragmatic implicature arising from human characteristics of visual perception and that is important both for understanding human-produced expressions and for generating human-friendly expressions in a real environment.",
        "This paper proposes a model of referring expressions both for generation and understanding.",
        "Our model uses probabilities to solve ambiguity under the relaxed constraint on uniqueness while considering human perception.",
        "No adequate data is currently available in order to provide a comprehensive evaluation of our model.",

        "As Horacek (2005) pointed out, however, this standard approach is problematic in a real environment because many physical attributes are non-discrete and the symbolization ofthese continuous attributes have uncertainties.",

        "Some subjects may say it's blue but others may say it's purple.",
        "Moreover, there is the problem of logical ambiguity pointed out in Section 1.",
        "That is, even if an attribute itself is equally applicable to several objects in a logical sense, other available information (such as visual context) might influence the interpretation of a given referring expression.",
        "Such phenomena could be captured by estimating Pr(o p, a) as Pr(a p, o) represents the relevance of attribute value a to part p in object o. Pr(p o) represents the salience of part p in object o.",
        "The underlying idea to deal with the problem of logical ambiguity is \"Ifsome partofan objectis mentioned, itshould be more salient than other parts.\"",
        "This is related to Grice's maxims in a different way from matters discussed in (Dale and Reiter, 1995).",
        "Pr(p\\o) could be computed in some manner by using the saliency map (Itti et al., 1998).",
