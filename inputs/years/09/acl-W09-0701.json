        "There is a widespread belief that spoken dialog systems (SDSs) will have a significant impact in the developing countries of Africa (Tucker and Shalonova, 2004), where the availability of alternative information sources is often low.",
        "Traditional computer infrastructure is scarce in Africa, but telephone networks (especially cellular networks) are spreading rapidly.",
        "In addition, speech-based access to information may empower illiterate or semi-literate people, 98% of whom live in the developing world.",
        "Spoken dialog systems can play a useful role in a wide range of applications.",
        "Of particular importance in Africa are applications such as education, using speech-enabled learning software or kiosks and information dissemination through media such as telephone-based information systems.",
        "Significant benefits can be envisioned if information is provided in domains such as agriculture (Nasfors, 2007), health care (Sherwani et al., ; Sharma et al., 2009) and government services (Barnard et al., 2003).",
        "In order to make SDSs a reality in Africa, technology components such as text-to-speech (TTS) systems and automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are required.",
        "The latter category of technologies is the focus of the current contribution.",
        "Speech recognition systems exist for only a handful of African languages (Roux et al., ; Seid and Gambck, 2005; Abdillahi et al., 2006), and to our knowledge no service available to the general public currently uses ASR in an indigenous African language.",
        "A significant reason for this state of affairs is the lack of sufficient linguistic resources in the African languages.",
        "Most importantly, modern speech recognition systems use statistical models which are trained on corpora of relevant speech (i.e. appropriate for the recognition task in terms of the language used, the profile of the speakers, speaking style, etc.)",
        "This speech generally needs to be curated and transcribed prior to the development of ASR systems, and for most applications speech from a large number of speakers is required in order to achieve acceptable system performance.",
        "On the African continent, where infrastructure such as computer networks is less developed than in countries such as America, Japan and the European countries, the development of such speech corpora is a significant hurdle to the development of ASR systems.",
        "The complexity of speech corpus development is strongly correlated with the amount of data that is required, since the number of speakers that need to be canvassed and the amount of speech that must be curated and transcribed are major factors in determining the feasibility of such development.",
        "In order to minimise this complexity, it is important to have tools and guidelines that can be used to assist in designing the smallest corpora that will be sufficient for typical applications of ASR systems.",
        "As minimal corpora can be extended by sharing data across languages, tools are also required to indicate when data sharing will be beneficial and when detrimental.",
        "In this paper we describe and evaluate a new speech corpus of South African languages currently under development (the Lwazi corpus) and evaluate the extent in which computational analysis tools can provide further guidelines for ASR corpus design in resource-scarce languages."

        "The core linguistic resources being developed include phoneme sets, electronic pronunciation dictionaries and the speech and text corpora required to develop automated speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) systems for all eleven official languages of South Africa.",
        "The usability of these resources will be demonstrated during a national pilot planned for the third quarter of 2009.",
        "All outputs from the project are being released as open source software and open content(Meraka-Institute, 2009).",

        "3.1) and ASR corpus design (Sec.",
        "3.2).",
        "In Sec. 3.3, we also review the analytical tools that we utilise in order to investigate corpus design systematically.",
        "The main linguistic resources required when developing ASR systems for telephone based systems are electronic pronunciation dictionaries, annotated audio corpora (used to construct acoustic models) and recognition grammars.",
        "An ASR audio corpus consists of recordings from multiple speakers, with each utterance carefully transcribed orthographically and markers used to indicate non-speech and other events important from an ASR perspective.",
        "Both the collection of appropriate speech from multiple speakers and the accurate annotation of this speech are resource-intensive processes, and therefore corpora for resource-scarce languages tend to be very small (1 to 10 hours of audio) when compared to the speech corpora used to build commercial systems for world languages (hundreds to thousands of hours per language).",
        "Different approaches have been used to best utilise limited audio resources when developing ASR systems.",
        "Bootstrapping has been shown to be a very efficient technique for the rapid development of pronunciation dictionaries, even when utilising linguistic assistants with limited phonetic training (Davel and Barnard, 2004).",
        "Small audio corpora can be used efficiently by utilising techniques that share data across languages, either by developing multilingual ASR systems (a single system that simultaneously recognises different languages), or by using additional source data to supplement the training data that exists in the target language.",
        "Various data sharing techniques for language-dependant acoustic modelling have been studied, including cross-language transfer, data pooling, language adaptation and bootstrapping (Wheatley et al., 1994; Schultz and Waibel, 2001; Byrne et al., 2000).",
        "Both (Wheatley et al., 1994) and (Schultz and Waibel, 2001) found that useful gains could be obtained by sharing data across languages with the size of the benefit dependent on the similarity of the sound systems of the languages combined.",
        "In the only cross-lingual adaptation study using African languages (Niesler, 2007), similar gains have not yet been observed.",
        "Corpus design techniques for ASR are generally aimed at specifying or selecting the most appropriate subset of data from a larger domain in order to optimise recognition accuracy, often while explicitly minimising the size of the selected corpus.",
        "This is achieved through various techniques that aim to include as much variability in the data as possible, while simultaneously ensuring that the corpus matches the intended operating environment as accurately as possible.",
        "Three directions are primarily employed: (1) explicit specification of phonotactic, speaker and channel variability during corpus development, (2) automated selection of informative subsets of data from larger corpora, with the smaller subset yielding comparable results, and (3) the use of active learning to optimise existing speech recognition systems.",
        "All three techniques provide a perspective on the sources of variation inherent in a speech corpus, and the effect of this variation on speech recognition accuracy.",
        "In (Nagroski et al., 2003), Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is used to cluster data acoustically.",
        "These clusters then serve as a starting point for selecting the optimal utterances from a training database.",
        "As a consequence of the clustering technique, it is possible to characterise some of the acoustic properties of the data being analysed, and to obtain an understanding of the major sources of variation, such as different speakers and genders (Riccardi and Hakkani-Tur, 2003).",
        "Active and unsupervised learning methods can be combined to circumvent the need for transcribing massive amounts of data (Riccardi and Hakkani-Tur, 2003).",
        "The most informative untran-scribed data is selected for a human to label, based on acoustic evidence of a partially and iteratively trained ASR system.",
        "From such work, it soon becomes evident that the optimisation of the amount of variation inherent to training data is needed, since randomly selected additional data does not necessarily improve recognition accuracy.",
        "By focusing on the selection (based on existing transcriptions) of a uniform distribution across different speech units such as words and phonemes, improvements are obtained (Wu et al., 2007).",
        "In our focus on resource-scarce languages, the main aim is to understand the amount of data that needs to be collected in order to achieve acceptable accuracy.",
        "This is achieved through the use of analytic measures of data variability, which we describe next.",
        "In (Badenhorst and Davel, 2008) a technique is developed that estimates how stable a specific phoneme is, given a specific set of training data.",
        "This statistical measure provides an indication of the effect that additional training data will have on recognition accuracy: the higher the stability, the less the benefit of additional speech data.",
        "The model stability measure utilises the Bhat-tacharyya bound (Fukunaga, 1990), a widely-used upper bound of the Bayes error.",
        "If Pi and pi(X) denote the prior probability and class-conditional density function for class i, respectively, the Bhat-tacharyya bound e is calculated as:",
        "When both density functions are Gaussian with mean [ii and covariance matrix Ei, integration of e leads to a closed-form expression for e:",
        "is referred to as the Bhattacharyya distance.",
        "In order to estimate the stability of an acoustic model, the training data for that model is separated into a number of disjoint subsets.",
        "All subsets are selected to be mutually exclusive with respect to the speakers they contain.",
        "For each subset, a separate acoustic model is trained, and the Bhattacharyya bound between each pair of models calculated.",
        "By calculating both the mean of this bound and the standard deviation of this measure across the various model pairs, a statistically sound measure of model estimation stability is obtained."

        "For each phoneme in each of our target languages, we extract all the phoneme occurrences from the 150 speakers with the most utterances per phoneme.",
        "We utilise the technique described in Sec. 3.3 to estimate the Bhattacharyya bound both when evaluating phoneme variability and model distance.",

        "In an earlier analysis of phoneme variability of an English corpus (Badenhorst and Davel, 2008), it was observed that similar trends are observed when utilising different numbers of mixtures in a Gaussian mixture model.",

        "(Asymptotes occur later, but trends remain similar.)",
        "Because of the limited size of the Lwazi corpus, we therefore only report on single-mixture context-independent models in the current section.",
        "As we also observe similar trends for phonemes within the same broad categories, we report on one or two examples from several broad categories which occur in most of our target languages.",
        "Using SAMPA notation, the following phonemes are selected: /a/ (vowels), /m/ (nasals), /b/ and /g/ (voiced plosives) and /s/ (unvoiced fricatives), after verifying that these phonemes are indeed representative of the larger groups.",
        "Figures 1 and 2 demonstrate the effects of variable numbers of phonemes and speakers, respectively, on the value of the mean Bhattacharyya bound.",
        "This value should approach 0.5 for a model fully trained on a sufficiently representative set of data.",
        "In Fig. 1 we see that the various broad categories of sounds approach the asymptotic bound in different ways.",
        "The vowels and nasals require the largest number of phoneme occurrences to reach a given level, whereas the fricatives and plosives converge quite rapidly (With 10 observations per speaker, both the fricatives and plosives achieve values of 0.48 or better for all languages, in contrast to the vowels and nasals which require 30 observations to reach similar stability).",
        "Note that we employed 30 speakers per phoneme group, since that is the largest number achievable with our protocol.",
        "For the results in Fig. 2, we keep the number of phoneme occurrences per speaker fixed at 20 (this ensures that we have sufficient data for all phonemes, and corresponds with reasonable convergence in Fig. 1).",
        "It is clear that additional speakers would still improve the modelling accuracy for especially the vowels and nasals.",
        "We observe that the voiced plosives and fricatives quickly achieve high values for the bound (close to the ideal 0.5).",
        "Figures 1 and 2 - as well as similar figures for the other phoneme classes and languages we have studied - suggest that all phoneme categories require at least 20 training speakers to achieve reasonable levels of convergence (bound levels of 0.48 or better).",
