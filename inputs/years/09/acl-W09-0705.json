        "Automatic Lemmatisation is an important process for many applications of text mining and natural language processing (NLP) (Plisson et al., 2004).",
        "Within the context of this research, lem-matisation is defined as a simplified process of morphological analysis (Daelemans and Strik, 2002), through which the inflected forms of a word are converted/normalised under the lemma or base-form.",
        "For example, the grouping of the inflected forms 'swim', 'swimming' and 'swam' under the base-form 'swim' is seen as an instance of lem-matisation.",
        "The last part of this definition applies to this research, as the emphasis is on recovering the base-form from the inflected form of the word.",
        "The base-form or lemma is the simplest form of a word as it would appear as headword in a dictionary (Erjavec and Dzeroski, 2004).",
        "Lemmatisation should, however, not be confused with stemming.",
        "Stemming is the process whereby a word is reduced to its stem by the removal of both inflectional and derivational morphemes (Plisson et al., 2004).",
        "Stemming can thus be viewed as a \"greedier\" process than lem-matisation, because a larger number of morphemes are removed by stemming than lemmatisa-tion.",
        "Given this general background, it would therefore be necessary to have a clear understanding of the inflectional affixes to be removed during the process of lemmatisation for a particular language.",
        "There are essentially two approaches that can be followed in the development of lemmatisers, namely a rule-based approach (Porter, 1980) or a statistically/data-driven approach (Chrupala, 2006).",
        "The rule-based approach is a traditional method for stemming/lemmatisation (i.e. affix stripping) (Porter 1980; Gaustad and Bouma, 2002) and entails the use of language-specific rules to identify the base-forms (i.e. lemmas) of word forms."

        "The first automatic lemmatiser for Setswana was developed by Brits (2006).",
        "As previously mentioned, one of the most important aspects of developing a lemmatiser in any language is to define the inflectional affixes that need to be removed during the transformation from the surface form to the lemma of a particular word.",
        "In response to this question, Brits (2006) found that only stems (and not roots) can act independently as words and therefore suggests that only stems should be accepted as lemmas in the context of automatic lemmatisation for Setswana.",
        "Setswana has seven different parts of speech.",
        "Brits (2006) indicated that five of these seven classes cannot be extended by means of regular morphological processes.",

        "Brits (2006) formalized rules for the alterations and implemented these rules as regular expressions in FSA 6 (Van Noord, 2002), to create finite state transducers.",
        "These finite state transducers generated C++ code that was used to implement the Setswana lemmatiser.",
        "This lem-matiser achieved a linguistic accuracy figure of 62,17%, when evaluated on an evaluation subset of 295 randomly selected Setswana words.",

        "Ragel was developed by using traditional methods for stemming/lemmatisation (i.e. affix stripping) (Porter, 1980; Kraaij and Pohlmann, 1994) and consists of language-specific rules for identifying lemmas.",

        "During this phase, the training data is examined and various statistical calculations are computed that aid the system during classification.",
        "This training data is then stored in memory as sets of data points.",
        "The evaluation instance(s) are then presented to the system and their class is computed by interpolation to the stored data points according to the selected algorithm and algorithm parameters.",
        "The last step in the process consists of generating the correct lemma(s) of the evaluation instance(s), according to the class that was awarded during the classification process.",
        "The generic architecture of the machine learning based lemmatiser is illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "A negative aspect of the Machine Learning method for developing a lemmatiser is that a large amount of lemma-annotated training data is required.",
        "Currently, there is a data set available that contains only 2,947 lemma-annotated Set-swana words.",
        "This is the evaluation data set constructed by Brits (2006) to evaluate the performance of the rule-based Setswana lemmatiser.",
        "A data set of 2,947 words is considered to be very small in machine learning terms.",
        "Memory based learning requires that lemmatisation be performed as a classification task.",
        "The training data should therefore consist of feature vectors with assigned class labels (Chrupala, 2006).",
        "The feature vectors for each instance consist of the letters of the inflected word.",
        "The class labels contain the information required to transform the involved word form from the inflected form to the lemma.",
        "The class labels are automatically derived by determining the character string (and the position thereof) to be removed and the possible replacement string during the transformation from wordform to lemma.",
        "This is determined by firstly obtaining the longest common substring between the inflected word and the manually identified lemma.",

        "This data set is very small in comparison with the 73,000 instances contained in the training data of Lia.",
        "The linguistic accuracy figure of 64.06% furthermore indicates that a machine learning based lemmatiser for Setswana that yields better results than a rule-based lemmatiser can be developed with a relatively small data set.",
        "We are confident that further increases in the linguistic accuracy figure will be obtained by enlarging the training data set.",

        "The most important result of the research presented in this paper is, however, that existing methodologies and research can be applied to fast-track the development of linguistic resources or improve existing linguistic resources for resource-scarce languages, a result that is especially significant in the African context."
