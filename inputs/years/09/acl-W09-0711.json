        "In a manuscript William Labov (1987) states that although linguistics is a field with a long historical tradition and with a high degree of consensus on basic categories, it experiences a fundamental de-vision concerning the role that quantitative methods should play as part of the research progress.",
        "Linguists differ in the role they assign to the use of natural language examples in linguistic research and in the publication of its results.",
        "In this paper we suggest that the general availability of richly annotated, multilingual data directly suited for scientific publications could have a positive impact on the way we think about language, and how we approach linguistics.We encourage the systematic generation of linguistic data beyond what emerges from fieldwork and other descriptive studies and introduce an online glossing tool for textual data annotation.",
        "We argue that the availability of such an online tool will facilitate the generation of in-depth annotated linguistic examples as part of linguistic research.",
        "This in turn will allow the build-up of linguistic resources which can be used independent of the research focus and of the theoretical framework applied.",
        "The tool we would like to present is a non-expert-user system designed in particular for the work with lesser documented languages.",
        "It has been used for the documentation of several African languages, and has served for two projects involving universities in Africa."

        "The role that digital tools play in all fields of modern linguistics can not be underestimated.",
        "This is partially due to the success of computational linguistics and its involvement in fields such as lexicography, corpus linguistics and syntactic parsing, to just name some.",
        "Most crucially however this development is due to the success of IT in general and in particular to the World Wide Web which has created new standards also for linguistic research.",
        "Through the internet our perception of 'data' and publication of linguistic results has changed drastically only in a matter of a few years.",
        "Although the development of language resources and language technology for African languages is increasing steadily, the digital revolution and the resources and possibilities it offers to linguistics are mostly seized by researchers in the First World connected to work centering around the key languages.",
        "For this paper we would like to conceive of this situation in terms of lost opportunities: At present formal linguistics and linguistic research conducted on Third World languages are mostly undertaken with very little knowledge of each other and hardly any exchange of research results.",
        "Likewise, language documentation, which has roots in language typology and computational linguistics, only partially coincides with work in African linguistics.",
        "Yet, it is evident that the general availability of linguistic material from a bigger sample of languages will eventually not only affect the way in which we think about language, but also might have an impact on linguistic methodology and on the way we go about linguistic research.",
        "If you are only a few mouse clicks away from showing that a certain generalization only holds for a limited set of languages, but truly fails to describe a given phenomenon for a wider sample, statements claiming linguistic generality have to be phrased much more carefully.",
        "Our perception of the nature of language could truly benefit from general access to representative multilingual data.",
        "It therefore would seem a linguistic goal in itself to (a) work towards a more general and more straightforward access to linguistic resources, (b) encourage the systematic generation of linguistic data beyond what emerges from fieldwork and other descriptive studies and (c) advocate the generation of a multilingual data pool for linguistic research."

      "text": [
        "It is well known that the generation of natural language examples enriched by linguistic information in the form of symbols is a time consuming enterprise quite independent of the form that the raw material has and the tools that were chosen.",
        "Equally well known are problems connected to the generation and storage of linguistic data in the form of standard document files or spread sheets (Bird and Simons 2003).",
        "Although it is generally agreed on that linguistic resources must be kept in a sustainable and portable format, it remains less clear, how a tool should look that would help the linguist to accomplish these goals.",
        "For the individual researcher it is not easy to decide which of the available tools serve his purpose best.",
        "To start with it is often not clear which direction research will take, which categories of data are needed and in which form the material should be organized and stored.",
        "But perhaps even more importantly most tools turn out to be so complex that the goal of mastering them becomes an issue in its own right.",
        "Researchers that work together with communities that speak an endangered or lesser documented language experience that digital tools used for language documentation can be technically too de-manding.Training periods for annotators become necessary together with technical help and maintenance by experts which not necessarily are linguists themselves.",
        "In this way tool management develops into an issue in itself taking away resources from the original task at hand - the linguistic analysis.Linguists too often experience that some unlucky decision concerning technical tools gets data locked in systems which cannot be accessed anymore after a project, and the technical support coming along with it,has run out of funding.",
        "In the following we would like to introduce a linguistic tool for text annotation called TypeCraft, which we have created through combining several well-understood tools of knowledge management.",
        "Needless to say, TypeCraft will not solve all the problems mentioned above, yet it has some new features that make data annotation an easier task while adding discernibility and general efficiency.",
        "That one can import example sentences directly into research papers is one of these features.",
        "In addition TypeCraft is a collaboration and knowledge sharing tool, and, combined with database functionality, it offers some of the most important functions we expect to see in a digital language documentation tool.",
        "In the following we will address glossing and illustrate present day glossing standards with examples from Akan, a Kwa language spoken in Ghana, to then turn to a more detailed description of TypeCraft.",
        "However, a brief overview over the main features of TypeCraft seems in order at this point.",
        "TypeCraft is a relational database for natural language text combined with a tabular text editor for interlinearized glossing, wrapped into a wiki which is used as a collaborative tool and for online publication.",
        "The system, which has at present 50 users and a repository of approximately 4000 annotated phrases, is still young.",

      "text": [
        "The use ofglosses in the representation ofprimary data became a standard for linguistic publications as late as in the 1980s (Lehmann, 2004) where interlinear glosses for sample sentences started to be required for all language examples except those coming from English.",
        "However, the use of glossed examples in written research was, and still is, not accompanied by a common understanding of its function, neither concerning its role in research papers nor its role in research itself.",
        "It seems that glosses, when occurring in publications, are mostly seen as a convenience to the reader.",
        "Quite commonly information essential to the understanding of examples is given in surrounding prose, and often without any appropriate reflection in the glosses themselves.",
        "Let us look at a couple of examples with interlinear glosses taken at random from the list of texts containing Akan examples.",
        "These examples are taken from the online database Odin at Fresno State University.",
        "The Odin database (http:/www.csufresno.edu/odin/) is a repository of interlinear glossed texts which have been extracted mainly from linguistic papers.",
        "The database itAnnotation Collaboration Data Migration tabular interface for word level glossing - automatic sentence breakup drop down reference list of linguistic symbols word and morpheme deletion and insertion lazy annotation mode (sentence parsing) customized sets of sentence level tags for the annotation of construction level properties individual work spaces for users that would like to keep data private data sharing for predefined groups such a research collaborations data export from the TypeCraft database to the TypeCraft wiki access to tag sets and help pages from the TypeCraft wiki access to information laid out by other annotators or projects.",

        "Akan is one of the Kwa languages spoken in Ghana.",
        "The first example from the Odin database, here given as (1), comes from a paper by (Haspelmath, 2001)",
        "(1) Amamaame sika.",
        "Ama give 1SG money 'Ama gave me money. '",

        "who FOC Ama is-looking-for?",
        "'Who is it that Ama is looking for?'",
        "Except for Ameka, the authors quote Akan examples which are excerpted from the linguistic literature.",
        "Often examples coming from African languages have a long citation history and their validation is in most cases nearly impossible.",
        "When we compare (1) - (4) we notice a certain inconsistency for the annotation of no which is glossed as 'the' (1), 'that' (3) and as DEF (2) respectively.",
        "This difference could indicate that Akan does not make a lexical distinction between definiteness and deixis, most likely however we simply observe a 'glossing figment'.",
        "The general lack of part of speech information in all examples easily leads us astray; should we for example assume that na in example (4) is a relative pronoun?",
        "The general lack of proper word level glossing makes the data for other linguists quite useless, in particular if they are not themselves native speakers or experts in exactly this language.Maa is a past form, but that tense marking is derived by suffixation is only indicated in (2) via a hyphen between the translational gloss and the PAST tag.",
        "Likewise rehwehw ein(4)is a progressive form, yet the lack of morpheme boundaries, and consistent annotation prevents that these and similarly glossed serve as a general linguistic resource.",
        "Purely translational glosses might be adequate for text strings which serve as mere illustrations; however, for linguistic data,that is those examples that are (a) either crucial for the evaluation of the theoretical developxment reported on, or (b) portray linguistic pattern of general interest, to provide morphosyntactic and morpho-functional as well as part of speech information would seem best practice.",
        "It seems that linguists underestimate the role that glossing, if done properly,could play as part of linguist research.",
        "Symbolic rewriting and formal-grammar development are two distinct modes of linguistic research.",
        "Yet there is no verdict that forces us to express descriptive generalizations exclusively by evoking a formal apparatus of considerable depth.",
        "Instead given simplicity and parsimony of expression it might well be that symbolic rewriting serves better for some research purposes than theoretical modeling.",
        "One can not replace one by the other.",
        "Yet which form of linguistic rendering is the best in a given situation should be a matter of methodological choice.",
        "Essential is that we realize that we have a choice.",
        "Sizing the opportunity that lies in the application of symbolic rewriting, of which interlinear glossing is one form, could make us realize that the generation of true linguistic resources is not exclusively a matter best left to computational linguists."

        "To share data within the system or online is a function that can be selected by the user.",
        "Different from Toolbox, which is a linguistic data management system known to many Africanists, TypeCraft is a relational database and therefore by nature has many advantages over file based systems like Toolbox.",
        "This concerns both, data integrity and data migration.",
        "In addition databases in general offer a greater flexibility for data search.For example, it is not only possible to extract all serial verb constructions for all (or some) languages known to TypeCraft, it is also possible to use the gloss index to find all serial verb constructions where a verb receives a marking specific to the second verb in an SVC.",
        "The other mayor difference between Toolbox and TypeCraft is that TypeCraft is an online system which brings many advantages, but also some disadvantages.",
        "An online database is a multi-user system, that is, many people can access the same data at the same time independent of were they physically are.",
        "Distributive applications are efficient tools for international research collaboration.",
        "TypeCraft is designed to allow data sharing and collaboration during the process of annotation.",
        "Yet although there are many advantages to an online tool, to be only online is at the same time a major disadvantage.",
        "Not all linguists work with a stable internet connection, and in particular for work in the field TypeCraft is not suitable.",
        "TypeCraft uses Unicode, so that every script that the user can produce on his or her PC can be entered into the browser, which for TypeCraft must be Mozilla Firefox.",
        "Different from Toolbox TypeCraft insists on a set of linguistic glosses, reflecting standards advocated for example by the Leipzig Convention distributed by the Max Planck Institute for Evaluationary Anthropology or an initiative such a GOLD (Farrar and Lewis, 2005).Yet, TypeCraft still allows a user-driven flexibility when it comes to the extension of the tag-set, as explained in the next section."
