        "The aim of the paper is to show that even a small bilingual lexical resource can be submitted to this project and gradually developed into a machine-processable form that can then interact with other FreeDict resources.",
        "We also present the immediate benefits of locating bilingual African dictionaries in this project.",
        "We have found FreeDict to be a very promising project with a lot of potential, and the present paper is meant to spread the news about it, in the hope to create an active community of linguists and lexicographers of various backgrounds, where common research subprojects can be fruitfully carried out."

        "The FreeDict project was started by Horst Eyer-mann in 2000 and initially hosted bilingual dictionaries produced by concatenating (crossing) the contents of the dictionaries in the Ergane project (http://download.travlang.com/Ergane/), with Esperanto as the interlanguage.",
        "At first, the data was kept in the DICT format (Faith and Martin, 1997).",
        "DICT (Dictionary Server Protocol) is by now a well-established TCP-based query/response protocol that allows a client to access definitions from a set of various dictionary databases.",
        "It provides data in textual form, but it also has the potential of providing MIME-encoded content.",
        "The clients can be free-standing desktop applications or they can be integrated into editors or web browsers.",
        "DICT web gateways also exist (see e.g. http://dict.org/).",
        "The DICT format is a plain text format with an accompanying index file.",
        "The FreeDict-DICT interface initially used so-called \"c5 files\".",
        "A c5 example of an entry from version 0.0.1 of Swa-hili-English dictionary is presented below.",
        "passenger(s)",
        "Later on, the project adopted the TEI P4 standard (Sperberg-McQueen and Burnard, 2002) as its primary format, and with the help of its second administrator, Michael Bunk, created tools for conversion from the TEI into a variety of other dictionary platforms.",
        "A simple dictionary editor was also created.",
        "The change of the primary format was a very fortunate move, thanks to which we can today recommend the project as the possible home for free African language dictionaries big and small.",
        "We are going to base our discussion on the Swahili-English dictionary, the first FreeDict dictionary encoded according to the guidelines of TEI P5 XML standard (TEI Consortium, 2007).",
        "The dictionary in its current form is an offshoot of a different project of ours that we decided to make available on a free license and in version 0.4 contains over 2600 headwords.",
        "We use it to demonstrate a possible process of dictionary development, from the simplest to the advanced, machine-processable form.",
        "2 From glossaries to rich lexical databases: the possible shapes of FreeDict dictionaries",
        "A dictionary can begin its life at FreeDict as a simple glossary, with the simplest format possible, as shown in the made-up entry below:",
        "<form><orth>alasiri</orth></form> <def>afternoon</def> </entry>",
        "The next example entry comes from Swahili-English xFried Freedict Dictionary, version 0.0.2, compiled by Beata Wojtowicz.",
        "That dictionary contained around 1500 entries of varied quality.",
        "It was based on a dictionary extracted from Morris P. Fried's Swahili-Kiswahili to English Translation Program, to which selected entries from the first FreeDict Swahili-English dictionary (compiled by Horst Eyermann) were added.",
        "That version also introduced information on parts of speech.",
        "On the way to version 0.3, the entry looked as follows:",
        "<entry xml:id=\"alasiri\"> <form><orth>alasiri</orth></form> <gramGrp><pos>n</pos></gramGrp>",
        "All the bracketed information was then turned into separate <note/> elements, in order to make the translation equivalents easily processable (see Prinsloo and de Schryver, 2002, for remarks on processability of translation equivalents).",
        "The change was performed by regex search-and-replace, roughly from review of all the new <note/> elements extracted by an XPath query.",
        "Depending on the regularity of expressions in brackets, some additional words would be inserted into the search string, to be converted into <note/> elements of the appropriate type.",
        "Initially, only @type=\"hint\" was used, as the most generic.",
        "At the moment, there are several more specialized type values, including @type=\"editor\", which contains editorial remarks that will not be shown to the user but will remain in the source.",
        "@type-less <note/> elements are used for quick localized communication between editors and are discarded by XSLT scripts when preparing the source version for release (they are also clearly marked by the CSS stylesheet that accompanies the dictionary, so that the editors can easily spot each note when reviewing the dictionary in a browser).",
        "FreeDict advocates the use of some other types of notes: recording the last editor of the entry, the date of the latest modification, and the degree of certainty, valuable in this kind of projects (where, e.g., some automated changes would set the certainty level to \"low\" and as such requiring editorial approval).",
        "In the current version, 0.4, the <sense/> element looks as follows.",
        "This is what we decided to keep in version 0.4, exactly for the purpose of illustrating the possible development stages of dictionaries.",
        "In the next version, the <sense/> element will eventually attain the form currently (i.e., after September 2007) recommended by the TEI Guidelines for translation equivalents:",
        "The <quote/> element holds the translation equivalent that can be an anchor for dictionary",
        "such expressions per single element content, etc.).",
        "Sometimes, an XSL transformation may turn out to do a better job, thanks to the many string-handling functions of XPath 2.0.",
        "reversal or concatenation.",
        "The <def/> element above is not abused anymore and holds a real definition, i.e., an \"explanatory equivalent\", which may become a sense-discriminating note in the reversed dictionary.",
        "We stress that each of the XML structures presented above (some of them admittedly bordering on tag abuse) conforms to the general P5 format and can be easily processed and published.",
        "In other words, dictionary editors are not forced to conform to the final format in order to see their work being used and commented on.",
        "The next section presents another aspect of dictionary creation, where what matters is the ease of data manipulation and filling in the predictable information for the developer.",
        "3 Plural forms: an illustration of automated creation of entries",
        "At the stage of development at which brackets have been eliminated from translation equivalents, a relatively simple entry might look as shown below.",
        "This is an entry as created by a developer, to be further processed by XSLT.",
        "This entry is then processed and turned into the form presented below.",
        "<xr type=\"plural-form\"><ref tar-get=\"#maadui\">maadui</ref></xr> <gramGrp> <def>opponent</def> <note type=\"hint\">in games or sports</note> </sense> </entry>",
        "If the plural form does not exist in the dictionary, the script creates an entry for it:",
        "<orth>maadui</orth> </form> <gramGrp> <xr type=\"plural-sense\">Plural of <ref target=\"#adui\">adui</ref> </xr> <def>enemy</def> <def>opponent <note type=\"hint\">in games or sports</note></def> </sense> </entry>",
        "The equivalents in this kind of automatically created entries for plurals will remain within <def/> elements even after we adopt the cit/quote system mentioned above in the discussion of alasiri.",
        "This is because <def/> elements are not anchors for dictionary reversal, and plural entries will be skipped by the reversal tools, unless the plural/collective form has its own unique meaning, as is the case with e.g. majani, which is morphologically the plural form of jani \"leaf; blade of grass\", but apart from that, it should also be glossed as \"grass\", and it is the latter form that should become a headword in the reversed, English-Swahili dictionary.",
        "Another area where the XML format and tools give excellent results is text normalization.",
        "An earlier example shows unnecessary spaces in version 0.0.2: <def> afternoon</def>.",
        "Handling these required only the use of an XPath function normalize-space(), which strips all the unwanted whitespace characters.",
        "All the indexing is also done automatically.",
        "The indexing system in this particular dictionary is based on the shape of the headword, which it is easy to convert into form acceptable by the XML ID attributes (the XPath translate() and replace() functions are handy here).",
        "All the entries are first reordered alphabetically, then the script checks for homographs and assigns them appropriate indexes (e.g. chapa-1 for the noun meaning \"brand\", chapa-2 for the verb meaning \"beat\") and appropriate attributes used later in the creation of superscripts (suppressed in the plain-text DICT format).",
        "Multiple senses are also treated similarly – each receives its own @xml:id attribute and numbering (see the example of adui above).",
        "We emphasize the fact that the encoding format makes it possible to reduce the developer's workload, with each stage of the dictionary enhancement being publishable.",
        "This allows one to work on the dictionary on and off, in their spare time."

        "Version 0.4 of our dictionary does not yet display the differences between bound stems and free forms, but we will transfer this functionality (which we use in another project) to one of the future versions.",
        "This will make it possible for us to, e.g., add hyphens to bound forms and prepend \"-a \" to adjectives introduced by the \"-a of relationship\", adding extra structure visible to the end user, but ignored in sorting or queries.",

        "The vocalic pre-prefixes should not be used for the purpose of arranging headwords, because if they are, all nouns end up under one of the three letters.",
        "Instead, class prefixes (ka, m, mu) should form the basis for alphabetization.",
        "In the XML/TEI format adopted by FreeDict, such problems are easily solved, either by using a separate element to hold the pre-prefix, or by the use of an appropriate attribute.",
        "The former solution is illustrated below.",
        "The default value for the @extent attribute is \"full\", so it only needs to be mentioned where the value is different.",
        "An AfLaT reviewer rightly points out that in an electronic dictionary, alphabetization is irrelevant.",
        "Indeed, the DICT format features separate \"dictionary\" and \"index\" files, and searching is done on the index file, which addresses the relevant portions of the dictionary file.",
        "The issue of alphabetization arises, however, in two cases: when preparing a print version of the dictionary, or when using the dictionary outside of the DICT system (this is a \"working view\" for the maintainers that can also be used as an out-of-the-box view for users).",
        "In connection with the first case – preparing print/PDF versions of dictionaries – it is worth pointing out that conversion from TEI XML into various publication formats is made easy thanks to the open-source XSLT conversion suite maintained by Sebastian Rahtz (http://www.tei-c.org/Tools/Stylesheets/).",
        "As for the \"out-of-the-box preview\", FreeDict dictionaries, by virtue of being marked up in XML, can be equipped with CSS stylesheets that make it possible to display the XML source in the browser, as if it were an HTML page.",

        "It may be that the effort needed to create language resources in e.g. Lexique Pro, an excellent free tool by SIL International (http://www.lexiquepro.com/) is smaller, but there are differences in that Lexique Pro is a Windows-only closed-source program whose native MDF (Multi-Dictionary-Formatter) format is not as flexible as XML and therefore cannot be processed by the many tools that handle XML and TEI in particular.",
        "Consequently, the perspectives for reuse of Lexique Pro dictionaries in computational linguistic applications are much smaller.",

        "That would undoubtedly enhance the attractiveness of the project.",
