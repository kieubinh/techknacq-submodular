        "Zulu and Xhosa belong to the Nguni languages, a group of languages from the South-eastern Bantu zone and, as two of the eleven official languages of South Africa, are spoken by approximately 9 and 8 million mother-tongue speakers, respectively.",
        "In terms of natural language processing, particularly computational morphology, the Bantu languages including Zulu and Xhosa certainly belong to the lesser-studied languages of the world.",
        "One of the few Bantu languages for which computational morphological analysers have been fully developed so far is Swahili (Hur-skainen, 1992; De Pauw and De Schryver, 2008).",
        "A computational morphological analyser prototype for Zulu (ZulMorph) is in an advanced stage of development, the results of which have already been used in other applications.",
        "Preliminary experiments and results towards obtaining morphological analysers for Xhosa, Swati and Ndebele by bootstrapping ZulMorph were particularly encouraging (Bosch et al., 2008).",
        "This bootstrapping process may be briefly summarised as a sequence of steps in which the baseline analyser, ZulMorph, is applied to the new language (in this case Xhosa) and then systematically extended to include the morphology of the other language.",
        "The extensions concern the word root lexicon, followed by the grammatical morpheme lexicons and finally by the appropriate morphophonological rules.",
        "The guiding principle in this process is as follows: Use the Zulu morphological structure wherever applicable and only extend the analyser to accommodate differences between the source language (Zulu) and the target language (in this case Xhosa).",
        "So far the question as to whether the bootstrapped analyser, extended to include Xhosa morphology, could also improve the coverage of the Zulu analyser was not specifically addressed in Bosch et al.",
        "(2008).",
        "Cross-linguistic similarity and its exploitation is a rather wide concept.",
        "In its broadest sense it aims at investigating and developing resources and technologies that can be compared and linked, used and analysed with common approaches, and that contain linguistic information for the same or comparable phenomena.",
        "In this paper the focus is on the morphological similarities and dissimilarities between Zulu and Xhosa and how these cross-linguistic similarities and dissimilarities inform the bootstrapping of a morphological analyser for Zulu and Xhosa.",
        "In particular, issues such as open versus closed classes, and language specific morphotactics and alternation rules are discussed.",
        "Special attention is given to the word root lexicons.",
        "In addition, the procedure for bootstrapping is broadened to include a guesser variant of the morphological analyser.",
        "The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 2 gives a general overview of the morphological structure of the languages concerned.",
        "The modelling and implementation approach is also discussed.",
        "This is followed in sections 3 and 4 by a systematic exposition of the cross-linguistic dissimilarities pertaining to morphotactics and morphophonological alternations.",

        "Bantu languages are characterised by a rich agglutinating morphological structure, based on two principles, namely the nominal classification system, and the concordial agreement system.",
        "According to the nominal classification system, nouns are categorised by prefixal morphemes.",
        "These noun prefixes have, for ease of analysis, been assigned numbers by scholars who have worked within the field of Bantu linguistics, In Zulu a noun such as umuntu 'person' for instance, consists of a noun prefix umu- followed by the noun stem -ntu and is classified as a class 1 noun, while the noun isitha 'rival' consists of a noun prefix isi- and the noun stem -tha and is classified as a class 7 noun.",
        "Noun prefixes generally indicate number, with the uneven class numbers designating singular and the corresponding even class numbers designating plural.",
        "The plural forms of the above examples would therefore respectively be the class 2 noun abantu 'persons' and the class 8 noun izitha 'rivals'.",
        "We follow Meinhofs (1932:48) numbering system which distinguishes between 23 noun prefixes altogether in the various Bantu languages.",
        "The concordial agreement system is significant in the Bantu languages because it forms the backbone of the whole sentence structure.",
        "Con-cordial agreement is brought about by the various noun classes in the sense that their prefixes link the noun to other words in the sentence.",
        "This linking is manifested by a concordial morpheme that is derived from the noun prefix, and usually bears a close resemblance to the noun prefix, as illustrated in the following example: Izitsha lezi ezine zephukile 'These four plates are broken'",
        "This concordial agreement system governs grammatical correlation in verbs, adjectives, possessives, pronouns, and so forth.",
        "Bantu languages are predominantly agglutinating and po-lymorphematic in nature, with affixes attached to the root or core of the word.",
        "The morphological make-up of the verb is considerably more complex than that of the noun.",
        "A number of slots, both preceding and following the verb root may contain numerous morphemes with functions such as derivations, inflection for tense-aspect and marking of nominal arguments.",
        "Examples are cross-reference of the subject and object by means of class (or per-son-/number-)specific object markers, locative affixes, morphemes distinguishing verb forms in clause-final and non-final position, negation etc.",
        "Despite the complexities of these domains, they are comparable across language boundaries, specifically Nguni language boundaries, with a degree of formal similarity that lends itself to exploitation for bootstrapping purposes.",
        "In the modelling and implementation of the morphological structure a finite-state approach is followed.",
        "The suitability of finite-state approaches to computational morphology is well known and has resulted in numerous software toolkits and development environments for this purpose (cf. Koskenniemi, 1997 and Karttunen, 2001).",
        "Yli-Jyr√§ (2005) discusses the importance of a finite-state morphology toolkit for lesser-studies languages.",
        "He maintains that \"[a]lthough some lexicons and morphological grammars can be learned automatically from texts ... fully automatic or unsupervised methods are not sufficient.",
        "This is due to two reasons.",
        "First, the amount of freely available corpora is limited for many of the less studied languages.",
        "Second, many of the less studied languages have rich morphologies that are difficult to learn accurately with unsupervised methods\".",
        "The Xerox finite-state tools (Beesley and Karttunen, 2003) as one of the preferred toolkits for modelling and implementing natural language morphology, is used in this work.",
        "The morphological challenges in computational morphological analysis comprise the modelling of two general linguistic components, namely morphotactics (word formation rules) as well as morphophonological alternations.",
        "Ideally, the morphotactics component should include all and only word roots in the language, all and only the affixes for all parts-of-speech (word categories) as well as a complete description of the valid combinations and orders of these morphemes for forming all and only the words of the language concerned.",
        "Moreover, the morpho-phonological alternations rules should constitute all known sound changes that occur at morpheme boundaries.",
        "The combination of these two components constitutes an accurate model of the morphology of the language(s) under consideration.",
        "The Xerox lexicon compiler, lexc, is well-suited to capturing the morphotactics of Zulu.",
        "A lexc script, consisting of cascades of so-called continuation classes (of morpheme lexicons) representing the (concatenative) morpheme sequencing, is compiled into a finite-state network.",
        "The Xerox regular expression language, xfst, provides an extended regular expression calculus with sophisticated Replace Rules for describing the morphophonological alternations rules of Zulu.",
        "The xfst script is also compiled into a finite-state network.",
        "These networks are finally combined by means of the operation of composition into a so-called Lexical Transducer that constitutes the morphological analyser and contains all the morphological information of Zulu, including derivation, inflection, alternation and compounding.",
        "Pretorius and Bosch (2002) address the suitability of this approach to Zulu morphology and illustrate it by means of examples of lexc and xfst scripts for modelling the Zulu noun.",
        "A detailed exposition of the design and implementation of ZulMorph may be found in Pre-torius and Bosch (2003).",
        "In addition to considering both the accurate modelling of the morpho-tactics and the morphophonological alternation rules, they also address implementation and other issues that need to be resolved in order to produce a useful software artefact for automated morphological analysis.",
        "Issues of implementation include a justification for the finite-state approach followed, designing for accuracy and correctness and decisions regarding the analyser's interface with its environment and its usage.",
        "Particular attention is paid to the handling of exceptions; the modelling of separated dependencies by means of so-called flag-diacritics; the specification of lexical forms (analyses) in terms of morphological granularity and feature information; the choice of an associated and appropriate morphological tag set and also the positioning of these tags in relation to the morphemes they are associated with in the morphological analyses (lexical forms) that are rendered.",
        "The components of ZulMorph, including its scope in terms of word categories and their morphological structure, are summarised in Table 1 while its lexical coverage as reflected by the number of different noun stems, verb roots etc.",
        "is discussed in section 5.",
        "The bootstrapping of ZulMorph to provide for Xhosa as well requires a careful investigation of the cross-linguistic similarities and dissimilarities and how they are best modelled and implemented.",

        "In this paper we focused on two aspects of cross-linguistic similarity between Zulu and Xhosa, namely the morphological structure (morphotactics and alternation rules) and the word root lexicons.",
        "Regarding the morphological structure only differences between Zulu and Xhosa were added.",
        "Therefore, Zulu informed Xhosa in the sense that the systematically developed grammar for Zul-Morph was directly available for the Xhosa analyser development, which significantly reduced the development time for the Xhosa prototype compared to that for ZulMorph.",
        "Special attention was also given to the so-called \"open\" class, which represents the word root lexicons for specifically nouns and verbs.",
        "The acquisition and coverage of these lexicons proved to be crucial for the success of the analysers under development.",
        "Since we were fortunate in having access to word root lexicons for both Zulu and Xhosa we included what was available in such a way that word roots could be shared between the languages.",
        "Here, although to a lesser extent, Xhosa also informed Zulu by providing a current (more up to date) Xhosa lexicon.",
        "In addition, the guesser variant was employed in identifying possible new roots in the test corpora, both for Zulu and for Xhosa.",
        "In general it is concluded that bootstrapping morphological analysers for languages that exhibit significant structural and lexical similarities may be fruitfully exploited for developing analysers for lesser-resourced languages.",
        "Future work includes the application of the approach followed in this work to the other Nguni languages, namely Swati and Ndebele (Southern and Zimbabwe); the application to larger corpora, and the subsequent construction of standalone versions.",
        "Finally, the combined analyser could also be used for (corpus-based) quantitative studies in cross-linguistic similarity."
