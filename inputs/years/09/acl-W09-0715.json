        "Many languages, especially on the African continent, are under-resourced in that they have very few computational linguistic tools or corpora (such as lexica, taggers, parsers or treebanks) available.",
        "Here, we will concentrate on the task of developing part-of-speech taggers for Amharic, the official working language of the government of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia: Ethiopia is divided into nine regions, each with its own nationality language; however, Amharic is the language for countrywide communication.",
        "Amharic is spoken by about 30 million people as a first or second language, making it the second most spoken Semitic language in the world (after Arabic), probably the second largest language in Ethiopia (after Oromo), and possibly one of the five largest languages on the African continent.",
        "The actual size of the Amharic speaking population must be based on estimates: Hudson (1999) analysed the Ethiopian census from 1994 and indicated that more than 40% of the population then understood Amharic, while the current size of the Ethiopian population is about 80 million.",
        "In spite of the relatively large number of speakers, Amharic is still a language for which very few computational linguistic resources have been developed, and previous efforts to create language processing tools for Amharic – e.g., Alemayehu and Willett (2002) and Fissaha (2005) – have been severely hampered by the lack of large-scale linguistic resources for the language.",
        "In contrast, the work detailed in the present paper has been able to utilize the first publicly available medium-sized tagged Amharic corpus, described in Section 5.",
        "However, first the Amharic language as such is introduced (in Section 2), and then the task of part-of-speech tagging and some previous work in the field is described (Section 3).",
        "Section 4 details the tagging strategies used in the experiments, the results of which can be found in Section 6 together with a short discussion.",
        "Finally, Section 7 sums up the paper and points to ways in which we believe that the results can be improved in the future."

        "The definite article attaches to the end of a noun, as do conjunctions, while prepositions are mostly prefixed.",
        "The first effort on Amharic morphological processing was a rule-based system for verbs (and nouns derived from verbs) which used root patterns and affixes to determine lexical and inflectional categories (Bayou, 2000), while Bayu (2002) used an unsupervised learning approach based on probabilistic models to extract stems, prefixes, and suffixes for building a morphological dictionary.",
        "The system was able to successfully analyse 87% of a small testdata set of 500 words.",

        "Argaw and Asker (2007) created a rule-based stemmer for a similar task, and using 65 rules and machine readable dictionaries obtained 60.0% accuracy on fictional text (testing on 300 unique words) and 76.9% on news articles (on 1503 words, of which 1000 unique)."

        "It has been morphologically analysed and manually part-of-speech tagged by staff at ELRC, the Ethiopian Languages Research Center at Addis Ababa University (Demeke and Getachew, 2006).",
        "The corpus is available both infidel and transcribed into a romanized version known as SERA, System for Ethiopic Representation in ASCII (Ya-cob, 1997).",
        "We worked with the transliterated form (202,671 words), to be compatible with the machine learning tools used in the experiments.",
        "Unfortunately, the corpus available on the net contains quite a few errors and tagging inconsistencies: nine persons participated in the manual tagging, writing the tags with pen on hard copies, which were given to typists for insertion into the electronic version of the corpus – a procedure obviously introducing several possible error sources.",
        "Before running the experiments the corpus had to be \"cleaned\": many non-tagged items have been tagged (the human taggers have, e.g., often tagged the headlines of the news texts as one item, end-of-sentence punctuation), while some double tags have been removed.",
        "Reflecting the segmentation of the original Amharic text, all whitespaces were removed, merging multiword units with a single tag into one-word units.",
        "Items like '\"' and ' /' have been treated consistently as punctuation, and consistent tagging has been added to word-initial and word-final hyphens.",
        "Also, some direct tagging errors and misspellings have been corrected.",
        "Time expressions and numbers have not been consistently tagged at all, but those had to be left as they were.",
        "Finally, many words have been transcribed into SERA in several versions, with only the cases differing.",
        "However, this is also difficult to account for (and in the experiments below we used the case sensitive version of SERA), since the SERA notation in general lets upper and lower cases of the English alphabet represent different symbols infidel (the Amharic script).",

        "The main differences between the two tagsets pertain to the treatment ofprepositions and conjunctions: in 'ELRC' there are specific classes for, e.g., pronouns attached with preposition, conjunction, and both preposition and conjunction (similar classes occur for nouns, verbs, adjectives, and numerals).",
        "In addition, numerals are divided into cardinals and ordinals, verbal nouns are separated from other nouns, while auxiliaries and relative verbs are distinguished from other verbs.",
        "The full tagset is made up of thirty subclasses of the basic classes, based on type of word only: the tags contain no information on grammatical categories (such as number, gender, tense, and aspect).",
        "Thirdly, for comparison reasons, the full tagset was mapped to the 10 tags used by Fissaha (2005).",
        "These classes include one for Residual (R) which was assumed to be equivalent to <UNC>.",
        "In addition, <CONJ> and <PREP> were mapped to Ad-position (AP), and both <N> and <PRON> to N. The other mappings were straight-forward, except that the 'BASIC' tagset groups all verbs together, while Fissaha kept Auxiliary (AUX) as its own class.",
        "This tagset will be referred to as 'SISAY'.",
        "For evaluation of the taggers, the corpus was split into 10 folds.",
        "These folds were created by chopping the corpus into 100 pieces, each of about 2000 words in sequence, while making sure that each piece contained full sentences (rather than cutting off the text in the middle of a sentence), and then merging sets of 10 pieces into a fold.",

        "The dramatic increase in the tagger's performance on these folds is surprising, but a clear indication of one of the problems with n-fold cross validation: even though the results represent averages after n runs, the choice of the original folds to suit a particular tagging strategy is of utmost importance for the final result.",
        "Table 4 shows the 22 features used to represent an instance (Wordn) in the Maximum Entropy tagger.",
        "The features are calculated per token within sentences: the starting token of a sentence is not affected by the characteristics of the tokens ending the previous sentence, nor the other way around.",
        "Thus not all features are calculated for all tokens.",
        "In terms of accuracy, the MaxEnt tagger is by far the best of the three taggers, and on all three tagsets, when allowed to select its own folds.",
        "Still, as Table 3 shows, the variation of the results for each individual fold was then substantially larger.",
        "It should also be noted that TnT is by far the fastest of the three taggers, in all respects: in terms of time to set up and learn to use the tagger, in terms of tagging speed, and in particular in terms of training time.",
        "Training TnT is a matter of seconds, but a matter of hours for MALLET/MaxEnt and SvMTool.",
        "On the practical side, it is worth adding that TnT is robust, well-documented, and easy to use, while MALLET and SVMTool are substantially more demanding in terms of user effort and also appear to be more sensitive to the quality and format of the input data."

        "The paper has described experiments with applying three state-of-the-art part-of-speech taggers to Amharic, using three different tagsets.",
        "All taggers showed worse performance than previously reported results for English.",
        "The best accuracy was obtained using a Maximum Entropy approach when allowed to create its own folds: 90.1% on a 30 tag tagset, and 94.6 resp.",
        "94.5% on two reduced sets (11 resp.",
        "10 tags), outperforming an HMM-based (TnT) and an SVM-based (SVMTool) tagger.",
        "On predefined folds all taggers got comparable results (92.5-92.8% on the reduced sets and 4-7% lower on the full tagset).",
        "The SVM-tagger performs slightly better than the others overall, since it has the best performance on unknown words, which are four times as frequent in the 200K words Amharic corpus used than in the (six times larger) English Wall Street Journal corpus.",
        "TnT gave the best results for known words, but had the worst performance on unknown words.",
        "In order to improve tagging accuracy, we will investigate including explicit morphological processing to treat unknown words, and combining taggers.",
        "Judging from previous efforts on combining taggers (Section 3.3), it is far from certain that the combination of taggers actually ends up producing better results than the best individual tagger.",
        "A prerequisite for successful combination is that the taggers are sufficiently dissimilar; they must draw on different characteristics of the training data and make different types of mistakes.",
        "The taggers described in this paper use no other knowledge source than a tagged training corpus.",
        "In addition to incorporating (partial) morphological processing, performance could be increased by including knowledge sources such as machine readable dictionaries or lists of Amharic stem forms (Section 2.2).",
        "Conversely, semi-supervised or unsupervised learning for tagging clearly are interesting alternatives to manually annotate and construct corpora for training taggers.",
        "Since there are few computational resources available for Amharic, approaches as those briefly outlined in Section 3.2 deserve to be explored."
