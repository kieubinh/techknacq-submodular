        "The small size of the corpus, the absence of native speakers, and the variation attested in the multitude of textual witnesses require a model of encoding – rather than tagging – that moves from the formal distributional registration of linguistic elements to functional deductions.",
        "The model is illuminated by an example from verb inflection.",
        "It shows how a corpus-based analysis can improve upon the inflectional paradigms given in traditional grammars and how the various orthographic representations can be accounted for by an encoding system that registers both the paradigmatic forms and their attested realizations."

        "If we wish to make a linguistic analysis of ancient texts, in our case the Hebrew Bible and its Syriac translation, the Peshitta (ca.",
        "2nd century CE), we are confronted with a number of challenges:",
        "• There is no native speaker of the languages involved.",
        "We do not know in advance what categories are relevant in the linguistic analysis, what functions a certain construction has, or what functional oppositions there exist in the language system.",
        "For this reason we should avoid as much as we can any model that presupposes knowledge about the language.",
        "• We have only written sources.",
        "Hence we are challenged by the complex interaction between orthographic conventions and morphological phenomena.",
        "There are even some orthographic practices which, it is claimed, have never been supported by a phonological or morphological realization (see section 4.5).",
        "• We are dealing with multiple unique documents.",
        "In philology, the text of the Hebrew Bible or its Syriac translation is an abstract notion, a scholarly construct.",
        "The corpus that we enter into our database consists of the concrete witnesses to the abstract text.",
        "Textual variants provide useful information about language variation and development (section 4.5).",
        "• We are dealing with a small corpus.",
        "The Hebrew Bible contains about 300.000400.000 words (depending on whether we count graphic words or functional words); the vocabulary consists of about 8.000 lexemes.",
        "Moreover, because of the context in which our research takes place, at the boundary of linguistics and philology, our aim is the construction of a database with a correctly encoded text.",
        "Because we want to understand the text, rather than merely collect knowledge about the language system, we have set high standards of accuracy for the encoding of the text.",
        "These challenges lead to the following dilemmas for the computational analysis of ancient texts:",
        "• Data-oriented or theory-driven?",
        "Since approaches that presuppose linguistic knowledge are problematic, we want to be",
        "data-oriented, rather than theory-driven.",
        "However, approaches that merely try to extract knowledge from the corpus with a minimum of human input are insufficient because of the size of our corpus and because we want knowledge about the text, not just about the language.",
        "• Priority for the corpus or the language?",
        "Due to the lack of native speakers, the sole basis for our knowledge about the language is the corpus, but, at the same time, the corpus can only be accessed through some linguistic knowledge and some basic understanding of the text.",
        "We cannot start from scratch, avoiding any preliminary understanding of the text, its language, its features, and its meaning.",
        "This understanding is shaped by our scholarly and cultural tradition.",
        "It is based on transmitted knowledge.",
        "But we have to find ways in which the computational analysis does not only imitate or repeat traditional interpretations.",
        "The challenges and dilemmas mentioned above require a model that is deductive rather than inductive; that goes from form (the concrete textual data) to function (the categories that we do not know a priori); that entails registering the distribution of linguistic elements, rather than merely adding functional labels – in other words, that involves encoding rather than tagging; that registers both the paradigmatic forms and their realizations; that allows grammatical categories and formal descriptions to be redefined on the basis of corpus analysis; and that involves interactive analytical procedures, which are needed for the level of accuracy we aim for.",
        "In the distributional analysis at word level, for example, we mark prefixes and suffixes, rather than tagging a form as \"imperfect 2ms\" etc.",
        "Similarly on clause level we identify patterns such as \"subject + participle + complement\", as against the usual practice of giving functional clause labels such as \"circumstantial clause\"."

        "Unfortunately, the Peshitta project soon abandoned the inclusion of the Index Orthograhicus.",
        "It appears only in the sample edition and one other volume (Vol.",
        "IV/6, containing Odes, the Prayer of Manasseh, Apocryphal Psalms, Psalms of Solomon, Tobit and 1(3) Esdras).",
        "including the fact that the final letter is ignored in punctuation, that it is frequently omitted in writing (Nöldeke, 2001:§50), and that it does not affect poetic patterns (Brockelmann, 1960:45).",

        "In the word-level analysis (cf. section 2.1) the forms listed in table 2 are encoded as follows:",
        "As we said above, the square bracket to the right marks the verbal ending and the ampersand a paradigmatically unexpected letter.",
        "Thus our encoding in table 3 implies that we take the verbal ending -wn as an allomorph of w with an additional -n. Alternatively we could decide to introduce a separate morpheme -wn besides -w. The equals sign is used for the disambiguation of forms that have the same consonantal representation.",
        "We use it to distinguish the three verbal endings t and for distinguishing the y of the perfect 3fs from the y of the imperative 3fs.",
        "A round bracket marks a paradigmatically expected but absent letter.",
        "Thus we have taken the imperfect form 3fs KTBJ as the paradigmatic form, although KTB occurs as well.",
        "To deal with this material in an appropriate way it is important to use an encoding system in which both the attested surface forms and the abstract morphemes can be retrieved.",
        "Thus 'wqdw 'they burnt (it)' (Judges 1:8; our transcription: >WQDW) is a form of the verb yqd (JQD), with the causative prefix '- (>).",
        "We mark the causative stem morpheme with two square brackets to the left (cf. sample 8), indicate with the round bracket to the right that the first letter of the lexeme is absent, and mark with the ampersand the w that has come instead.",
        "The square bracket to the right marks the verbal ending.",
        "This results in the following encoding:",
        "Encoding:",
        "Paradigmatic forms: Realizations:",
        "This way of encoding the verb forms attested in multiple textual witnesses provides us with a large database from which language variation data can be retrieved.",
        "In some cases language development is involved as well, and the data can be used for diachronic analysis.",
        "For this research we can build upon the work done by the Syriac scholar Sebastian Brock.",
        "One of the phenomena Brock (2003:99-100) observed was that in West Syriac Biblical manuscripts some orthographic innovations are attested, including the addition of a y to the perfect 3fp, the imperfect 3fs and, on analogy, the perfect 3fs.",
        "It is a debated issue whether this ending reflects a morpheme that was once pronounced (thus Boyarin, 1981) or just an orthographic convention (thus Brock, 2003; cf. Van Peursen, 2008:244).",
        "Our approach enables us to deploy a practice that is completely new in Syriac scholarship, namely the possibility of testing assumptions upon the data (cf. Talstra & Dyk, 2006).",
        "We can test, for example, what happens if we redefine the distribution of ktb and ktbw (cf. section 4.2) and take the zero ending and the w as allomorphs for the 3rd person masculine.",
        "In our model such a reinterpretation of the material can be registered formally by changing the relevant sections in the Word Grammar.",
        "Since the lemmatization is done automatically on the basis of the morphologically encoded text and a functional description of the morphemes, there is no need to change the lemmatization in all separate instances manually.",
        "We have done this experiment for Judges 1 in nineteen manuscripts.",
        "This chapter contains 54 perfect forms 3m (except for third-weak verbs).",
        "In the bottom-up analysis (cf. section 2) the effect is that the decision on whether a 3m verb is singular or plural is not taken at word level, but at a later stage of the procedure, in which the verb is matched with a subject or another element that reveals its number.",
        "At first sight the results of our experiment were not exciting.",
        "In those 26 cases where the grammatical number of the subject is unambiguous, the 'regular' forms are dominant: Only three times is there an irregular form (singular ktbw or plural ktb), once in one manuscript, twice in two manuscripts.",
        "Nevertheless, our experiment yielded some interesting observations.",

        "In the first place we discovered that in 28 cases the grammatical number remained ambiguous even in the clause-level analysis because the subject was a collective noun (which in Syriac can take either a singular or a plural).",
        "In these ambiguous cases the traditional analysis of ktb as a singular and ktbw as a plural implies a striking alternation of singular and plural forms, e.g. 1:10 'and Judah went (w'zl, singular) ... and [they] killed (wqtlw, plural)'.",
        "In our experiment, this became mere orthographic variation.",
        "Consequently, in the final stage of the bottom-up analytical procedure, the text hierarchical analysis (section 2.4), we arrived at a more elegant text hierarchical structure, because many of the recurrent subject changes caused by the singular/plural alternation had been resolved.",
        "Secondly, the experiment overcame the rather arbitrary division between 'real' and orthographic variants in the Leiden Peshitta edition.",
        "In this edition, whenever there may be some doubt as to whether the verb is in the singular or in the plural, variation between ktb and ktbw forms is taken as 'real' and the variant is included in the critical apparatus; whenever there is no doubt, the variation is considered orthographic and the variant is listed in the Index Orthographicus (sample edition and vol.",
        "IV/6) or not mentioned at all (other volumes; cf. Dirksen, 1972:vii-ix).",
        "This editorial policy leads to the somewhat arbitrary decision that nht 'descended' in 1:9 (Ms 16c1, 16g3; other manuscripts: nhtw) is an orthographic variant, because the subject is the plural bnyyhwd' 'sons of Judah, Judahites', whereas in 1:10, where the subject is just yhwd' 'Judah', 'zlw 'went' (Ms 17a3; other manuscripts: 'zl) is a real variant.",
        "In 1:26, the same form 'zlw (Ms 19c1; other manuscripts have again 'zl) is taken as orthographic, because the subject is the singular noun gbr' '(the) man'.",
        "In our experiment all these variant readings are treated equally."

      "text": [
        "We hope to have shown how the analytical procedure (section 2) and the workflow of the wordlevel analysis (section 3) meet the challenges of working with ancient documents (section 1), due to their form-to-function approach, their use of encoding rather than tagging, their distinction between paradigmatic forms and their realizations, and because of the exigencies of accuracy in the case of an ancient limited corpus.",
        "In the word-level analysis we lean heavily on existing grammars.",
        "For that reason our approach could be regarded as theory-driven, even though we consider it one of our main tasks to revise and refine the paradigm on the basis of the actual corpora.",
        "Our encodings should be considered as hypotheses about the data that can be subjected to testing and experiment (section 4.6).",
        "Unlike projects that concern the acceleration of POS tagging (Ringger et al., 2007; Caroll et al., 2007) we start one level below, with the morphology.",
        "'Encoding rather than tagging' is not just a practical, but a crucial methodological characteristic of our model.",
        "(For new insights that it produced regarding Syriac morphology see the publications by Bakker, Van Keulen and Van Peursen in the bibliography).",
        "We differ from the computer implementation of morphological rules (Kiraz, 2001) in that our work is more deductive and focused on the interaction between orthography and morphology, because we start with the actual forms attested in the manuscripts.",
        "Our position in relation to these other projects is mainly determined by the philological demands that direct our research (see section 1).",
        "Whereas at the morphological level the information provided by traditional grammars is relatively stable, at the higher linguistic levels they provide much less solid ground.",
        "The gradually built up datasets (analogous to the Analytical Lexicon at word level) of phrase patterns, clause patterns, or verbal valence contain much information that is not properly dealt with in traditional grammars.",
        "At these levels the analysis becomes more data-oriented.",
        "Thus in the analysis of phrase structure Van Peursen (2007) found many complex patterns that have not been dealt with in traditional grammars.",
        "We have taken our examples from Syriac, but the same analytical procedures have been applied to other forms of Aramaic (Biblical Aramaic and Targum Aramaic) and Biblical Hebrew.",
        "Because of the separation of the analytical programs and the language-specific auxiliary files, it should be possible to apply it to other languages as well.",
        "This would mainly require writing the appropriate language definition files.",
        "Although our model is in principle language-independent, the morphological analysis presented in this paper is especially apt for Semitic languages because of their rich morphology."
