        "The majority of these methods rely on the existence of function words as separate text units.",
        "However, in morphology-rich languages, in particular Semitic languages such as Hebrew and Arabic, the equivalents of such function words are usually written as morphemes attached as prefixes to other words.",
        "As a result, they are missed by word-based pattern discovery methods, causing many useful patterns to be undetected and a drastic deterioration in performance.",
        "To enable high quality lexical category acquisition, we propose a simple unsupervised word segmentation algorithm that separates these morphemes.",

        "In many NLP tasks, we wish to extract information or perform processing on text using minimal knowledge on the input natural language.",
        "Towards this goal, we sometimes find it useful to divide the set of words in natural language to function words and content words, a division that applies in the vast majority of languages.",
        "Function words (or grammatical words, e.g., a, an, the, in, of, etc) are words that have little or highly ambiguous lexical meaning, and serve to express grammatical or semantic relationships with the other words in a sentence.",
        "In some morphologically-rich languages, important function words are not written as space-separated units but as morphemes attached as prefixes to other words.",
        "This fact can cause problems when statistically analyzing text in these languages, for two main reasons: (1) the vocabulary of the language grows, as our lexical knowledge comes solely from a corpus (words appear with and without the function morphemes); (2) information derived from the presence of these morphemes in the sentence is usually lost.",
        "In this paper we address the important task of a fully unsupervised acquisition of Hebrew lexical categories (or concepts - words sharing a significant aspect of their meaning).",
        "We are not aware of any previous work on this task for Hebrew.",
        "Due to the problem above, the performance of many acquisition algorithms deteriorates unacceptably.",
        "This happens, for example, in the (Davidov and Rappoport, 2006) algorithm that utilizes automatically detected function words as the main building block for pattern construction.",
        "In order to overcome this problem, one should separate such prefixes from the compound words (words consisting of function morphemes attached to content words) in the input corpus.",
        "When we consider some particular word, there are frequently many options to split it to smaller strings.",
        "Fortunately, the set of function words is small and closed, and the set of grammatical sequences of function prefixes is also small.",
        "Hence we assume it does not cost us much to know in advance what are the possible sequences for a specific language.",
        "Even when considering the small number of possible function words, the task of separating them is not simple, as some words may be ambiguous.",
        "When reading a word that starts with a prefix known to be a function morpheme, the word may be a compound word, or it may be a meaningful word by itself.",
        "For example, the word \"hsws\" in Hebrew can be interpreted as \"hsws\" (hesitation), or \"h sws\" (the horse).",
        "The segmentation of the word is context dependent - the same string may be segmented differently in different contexts.",
        "One way of doing such word prefix segmentation is to perform a complete morphological disambiguation of the sentence.",
        "The disambiguation algorithm finds for each word its morphological attributes (POS tag, gender, etc.",
        "), and decides whether a word is a compound word or a word without prefixes.",
        "A disambiguation algorithm generally relies on a language-specific morphological analyzer.",
        "It may also require a large manually tagged corpus, construction of which for some particular language or domain requires substantial human labor.",
        "We avoid the utilization of such costly and language-specific disambiguation algorithms and manually annotated data.",
        "In this paper we present a novel method to separate function word prefixes, and evaluate it using manually labeled gold standards in Hebrew and Arabic.",
        "We incorporate the method into a pattern-based Hebrew concept acquisition framework and show that it greatly improves state-of-art results for unsupervised lexical category acquisition.",
        "This improvement allows the pattern-based unsupervised framework to use one-tenth of the Hebrew data in order to reach a similar level of results.",
        "Section 2 discusses related work, and Section 3 reviews the word categories discovery algorithm.",
        "Section 4 presents the word prefix segmentation algorithm.",
        "Results are given in Section 5."

        "Both studies evaluate performance on a segmented text, and not just on words in the lexicon.",
        "However, their algorithm, while achieving good performance (97% accuracy), relies on a training set - a manually segmented corpus of about 110,000 words, while our unsupervised framework does not require any annotation and is thus easier to implement and to apply to different domains and languages.",
        "Snyder and Barzilay (2008) study the task of unsupervised morphological segmentation of multiple languages.",

        "They obtain 63.87 F-Score for Hebrew words segmentation (prefix and suffix), where recall and precision is calculated based on all possible segmentation points.",
        "Another type of segmentation algorithms involves utilization of language-specific morphological analyzers for complete morphological disambiguation.",
        "In Hebrew each word usually has more than one possible POS (along with other attributes, such as gender, number, etc.).",
        "Assuming we have a morphological analyzer (producing the set of possible analyses for a given word), we can try to discover the correct segmentation of each word.",
        "Levinger et al.",
        "(1995) developed a method for disambiguation of the results provided by a morphological analyzer for Hebrew.",
        "Adler and El-hadad (2006) proposed an unsupervised algorithm for word segmentation.",
        "They estimate an initial language model (using (Levinger et al., 1995)) and improve this model with EM.",
        "Direct comparison to their work is problematic, however, since we avoid utilization of a language-specific mor-phology/POS analyzer.",
        "There are also studies of this type that utilize labeled data (Bar-Haim et al., 2005), where the language model is learned from the training data.",
        "Extensive research has been done on word segmentation, where, unlike in our study, the segmentation is evaluated for every word, regardless of its context.",
        "Creutz (2003) presents an algorithm for unsupervised segmentation under these assumptions.",
        "He proposes a probabilistic model which utilizes the distributions of morpheme length and frequency to estimate the quality of the induced morphemes.",
        "Dasgupta and Ng (2007) improves over (Creutz, 2003) by suggesting a simpler approach.",
        "They segment a prefix using the word frequency with and without a prefix.",
        "Other recent studies that follow the context-independent setup include (Creutz and Lagus, 2005; Keshava their methods on English, Finnish and Turkish.",
        "All of these studies, however, assume context-independency of segmentation, disregarding the ambiguity that may come from context.",
        "This makes it problematic to apply the proposed methods to context-dependent morphology types as in Hebrew and Arabic.",
        "The guiding goal in the present paper is the concept acquisition problem.",
        "Concept acquisition of different kinds has been studied extensively.",
        "The two main classification axes for this task are the type of human input and annotation, and the basic algorithmic approach used.",
        "The two main algorithmic approaches are clustering of context feature vectors and pattern-based discovery.",
        "The first approach is to map each word to a feature vector and cluster these vectors.",
        "Example of such algorithms are (Pereira et al., 1993) and (Lin, 1998) that use syntactic features in the vector definition.",
        "Pantel and Lin (2002) improves on the latter by clustering by committee.",
        "Recently, there is a growing interest in the second main algorithmic approach, usage of lexico-syntactic patterns.",
        "Patterns have been shown to produce more accurate results than feature vectors, at a lower computational cost on large corpora discover categories using two basic pre-specified patterns (\"x and y\", \"x or y\").",
        "Some recent studies have proposed frameworks that attempt to avoid any implicit or explicit pre-specification of patterns.",
        "Davidov and Rappoport (2006) proposed a method that detects function words by their high frequency, and utilizes these words for the discovery of symmetric patterns.",
        "Their method is based on two assumptions: (1) some function words in the language symmetrically connect words belonging to the same category; (2) such function words can be detected as the most frequent words in language.",
        "While these assumptions are reasonable for many languages, for some morphologically rich languages the second assumption may fail.",
        "This is due to the fact that some languages like Hebrew and Arabic may express relationships not by isolated function words but by morphemes attached in writing to other words.",
        "As an example, consider the English word \"and', which was shown to be very useful in concept acquisition (Dorow et al., 2005).",
        "In Hebrew this word is usually expressed as the morpheme \"w\" attached to the second word in a conjunction (\"... wsws\" - \"... and horse\").",
        "Patterns discovered by such automatic pattern discovery algorithms are based on isolated words, and hence fail to capture \"and\"-based relationships that are very useful for detection ofwords belonging to the same concept.",
        "Davidov and Rappoport (2006) reports very good results for English and Russian.",
        "However, no previous work applies a fully unsupervised concept acquisition for Hebrew.",
        "In our study we combine their concept acquisition framework with a simple unsupervised word segmentation technique.",
        "Our evaluation confirms the weakness of word-based frameworks for morphology-rich languages such as Hebrew, and shows that utilizing the proposed word segmentation can overcome this weakness while keeping the concept acquisition approach fully unsupervised."

        "In this study we use word segmentation to improve the (Davidov and Rappoport, 2006) method for discovery of word categories, sets of words sharing a significant aspect of their meaning.",
        "An example for such a discovered category is the set of verbs {dive, snorkel, swim, float, surf, sail, drift, ...}.",
        "Below we briefly describe this category acquisition algorithm.",
        "The algorithm consists of three stages as follows.",
        "First, it discovers a set of pattern candidates, which are defined by a combination of high frequency words (denoted by H) and slots for low frequency (content) words (denoted by C).",
        "An example for such a pattern candidate is 'x belongs to y', where 'x' and 'y' stand for content word slots.",
        "The patterns are found according to a predefined set of possible meta-patterns.",
        "The meta-patterns are language-independent and consist of up to 4 words in total, from which two are (non-adjacent) content words.",
        "Four meta-patterns are used: CHC, CHCH, CHHC, HCHC.",
        "Second, those patterns which give rise to symmetric lexical relationships are identified.",
        "The meaning of phrases constructed from those patterns is (almost) invariant to the order of the content words contained in them.",
        "An example for such a pattern is 'x and y'.",
        "In order to identify such useful patterns, for each pattern we build a graph following (Widdows and Dorow, 2002).",
        "The graph is constructed from a node for each content word, and a directed arc from the node 'x' to 'y' if the corresponding content words appear in the pattern such that 'x' precedes 'y'.",
        "Then we calculate several symmetry measures on the graph structure and select the patterns with best values for these measures.",
        "The third stage is the generation of categories.",
        "We extract tightly connected sets of words from the unified graph which combines all graphs of selected patterns.",
        "Such sets of words define the desired categories.",
        "The patterns which include the 'x and y' substring are among the most useful patterns for generation of categories (they were used in (Dorow et al., 2005) and discovered in all 5 languages tested in (Davidov and Rappoport, 2006)).",
        "However, in Hebrew such patterns can not be found in the same way, since the function word 'and' is the prefix 'w' and not a standalone high frequency word.",
        "Another popular set of patterns are ones including 'x or y'.",
        "Such patterns can be identified in Hebrew, as 'or' in Hebrew is a separate word.",
        "However, even in this case, the content word represented by 'x' or 'y' may appear with a prefix.",
        "This damages the construction of the pattern graph, since two different nodes may be created instead of one - one for a regular content word, the other for the same word with a prefix.",
        "Consequently, it is reasonable to assume that segmenting the corpus in advance should improve the results of discovery of word categories."

        "The Morfessor Categories-MAP algorithm gets a list of words and their frequencies, and returns the segmentation for every word.",

        "Our method significantly outperforms both the baseline and Morfessor-based segmentation.",

        "Hence we follow the human judgment evaluation scheme presented in (Davidov and Rappoport, 2006), for the categories obtained from the segmented corpus.",
        "We compared three methods of word categories discovery.",
        "The first is random sampling of words into categories.",
        "The second is k-means, where each word is mapped to a vector, and similarity is calculated as described in (Pantel and Lin, 2002).",
        "We applied k-means to the set of vectors, with similarity as a distance function.",
        "If a vector had low similarity with all means, we leave it unattached.",

        "Running the algorithm 10 times, with different initial means each time, produced 60 clusters with three or more words.",

        "The experiment contained two parts.",
        "In Part I, subjects were given 40 triplets of words and were asked to rank them using the following scale: (1) the words definitely share a significant part of their meaning; (2) the words have a shared meaning but only in some context; (3) the words have a shared meaning only under a very unusual context/situation; (4) the words do not share any meaning; (5) I am not familiar enough with some/all of the words.",

        "To check this assumption, we have applied the concept acquisition algorithm on several web-based corpora of several languages, while choosing corpora size to be exactly equal to the size of the Hebrew corpus (130Mb) and utilizing exactly the same parameters.",
        "We did not perform quality evaluation, but measured the number of concepts and concept size.",
        "Indeed the number of categories was (190, 170, 159, 162, 150, 29) for Russian, English, Spanish, French, Turkish and Arabic respectively, clearly inferior for Arabic in comparison to these European and Slavic languages.",
        "A similar tendency was observed for average concept size.",
        "At the same time prefix separation does help to extract 148 concepts for Hebrew, making it nearly inline with other languages.",
        "In contrast, our preliminary experiments on English and Russian suggest that the effect of applying similar morphological segmentation on these languages in insignificant.",
        "In order to test whether more data can substitute segmentation even for Hebrew, we have obtained by means of crawling and web queries a larger (while potentially much more noisy) web-based 2GB Hebrew corpus which is based on forum and news contents.",
        "Our goal was to estimate which unsegmented corpus size (if any) can bring similar performance (in terms of concept number, size and quality).",
        "We gradually increased corpus size and applied the concept acquisition algorithm on this corpus.",
        "Finally, we have obtained similar, nearly matching, results to our 130MB corpus for a 1.2GB Hebrew subcorpus of the 2GB Hebrew corpus.",
        "The results remain stable for 4 different 1.2GB subsets taken from the same 2GB corpus.",
        "This suggests that while segmentation can be substituted with more data, it may take roughly x10 more data for Hebrew to obtain the same results without segmentation as with it."
