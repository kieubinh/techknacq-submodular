        "For the past three decades, there has been a great deal of work on the automatic identification (ID) of languages from the speech signal alone.",
        "Recently, accent and dialect identification have begun to receive attention from the speech science and technology communities.",
        "The task of dialect identification is the recognition of a speaker's regional dialect, within a predetermined language, given a sample of his/her speech.",
        "The dialect-identification problem has been viewed as more challenging than that of language ID due to the greater similarity between dialects of the same language.",
        "Our goal in this paper is to analyze the effectiveness of a phonotactic approach, i.e. making use primarily of the rules that govern phonemes and their sequences in a language – a techniques which has often been employed by the language ID community – for the identification of Arabic dialects.",
        "The Arabic language has multiple variants, including Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), the formal written standard language of the media, culture and education, and the informal spoken dialects that are the preferred method of communication in daily life.",
        "While there are commercially available Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems for recognizing MSA with low error rates (typically trained on Broadcast News), these recognizers fail when a native Arabic speaker speaks in his/her regional dialect.",
        "Even in news broadcasts, speakers often code switch between MSA and dialect, especially in conversational speech, such as that found in interviews and talk shows.",
        "Being able to identify dialect vs. MSA as well as to identify which dialect is spoken during the recognition process will enable ASR engines to adapt their acoustic, pronunciation, morphological, and language models appropriately and thus improve recognition accuracy.",
        "Identifying the regional dialect of a speaker will also provide important benefits for speech technology beyond improving speech recognition.",
        "It will allow us to infer the speaker's regional origin and ethnicity and to adapt features used in speaker identification to regional original.",
        "It should also prove useful in adapting the output of text-to-speech synthesis to produce regional speech as well as MSA - important for spoken dialogue systems' development.",
        "In Section 2, we describe related work.",
        "In Section 3, we discuss some linguistic aspects of Arabic dialects which are important to dialect identification.",
        "In Section 4, we describe the Arabic dialect corpora employed in our experiments.",
        "In Section 5, we explain our approach to the identification of Arabic dialects.",

        "For example, the Phone Recognition followed by Language Modeling (PRLM) approach uses phonotactic information to identify languages from the acoustic signal alone (Zissman, 1996).",
        "In this approach, a phone recognizer (not necessarily trained on a related language) is used to tokenize training data for each language to be classified.",
        "Phonotactic language models generated from this tokenized training speech are used during testing to compute language ID likelihoods for unknown utterances.",

        "The analysis of these differences is done by comparing percentages of vocalic intervals (%V) and the standard deviation of intervocalic intervals (AC) across the two groups.",

        "The complexity of syllabic structure of a language/dialect and the existence of vowel reduction in a language are good correlates with the rhythmic structure of the language/dialect, hence the importance of such a cue for language/dialect identification (Ramus, 2002).",
        "As far as we could determine, there is no previous work that analyzes the effectiveness of a phonotactic approach, particularly the parallel PRLM, for identifying Arabic dialects.",
        "In this paper, we build a system based on this approach and evaluate its performance on five Arabic dialects (four regional dialects and MSA).",
        "In addition, we experiment with six phone recognizers trained on six languages as well as three MSA phone recognizers and analyze their contribution to this classification task.",
        "Moreover, we make use of a discriminative classifier that takes all the perplexities of the language models on the phone sequences and outputs the hypothesized dialect.",
        "This classifier turns out to be an important component, although it has not been a standard component in previous work."

        "Different social associations exist as is common in many other languages around the world.",
        "The relationship between MSA and the dialect in a specific region is complex.",
        "Arabs do not think of these two as separate languages.",

        "Although Arabic dialects and MSA vary on many different levels – phonology, orthography, morphology, lexical choice and syntax – we will focus on phonological difference in this paper.MSA's phonological profile includes 28 consonants, three short vowels, three long vowels and two diphthongs (/ay/ and /aw/).",
        "Arabic dialects vary phonologically from standard Arabic and each other.",
        "Some of the common variations include the following (Holes, 2004; Habash, 2006):",
        "The MSA consonant (/q/) is realized as a glottal stop /'/ in Egy and Lev and as /g/ in Glf and Irq.",
        "For example, the MSA word /tari:q/ 'road' appears as /tari:'/ (Egy and Lev) and /tari:g/ (Glf and Irq).",

        "These changes do not apply to modern and religious borrowings from MS A.",
        "For instance, the word for 'Qur'an' is never pronounced as anything but /qur'a:n/.",
        "The MSA alveolar affricate (/dj/) is realized as /g/ in Egy, as /j/ in Lev and as /y/ in Glf.",
        "Irq preserves the MSA pronunciation.",
        "For example, the word for 'handsome' is /djami:l/ (MSA, Irq), /gami:l/ (Egy), /jami:l/ (Lev) and /yami:l/ (Glf).",
        "The MSA consonant (/k/) is generally realized as /k/ in Arabic dialects with the exception of Glf, Irq and the Palestinian rural sub-dialect of Lev, which allow a /c/ pronunciation in certain contexts.",
        "For example, the word for 'fish' is /samak/ in MSA, Egy and most of Lev but /simacV in Irq and Glf.",
        "The MSA consonant /#/ is pronounced as /t/ in Lev and Egy (or /s/ in more recent borrowings from MSA), e.g., the MSA word /tfala^a/ 'three' is pronounced /tala:ta/ in Egy and /tla:te/ in Lev.",
        "Irq and Glf generally preserve the MSA pronunciation.",
        "The MSA consonant /£/ is pronounced as /d/ in Lev and Egy (or /z/ in more recent borrowings from MSA), e.g., the word for 'this' is pronounced /ha:£a/ in MSA versus /ha:da/ (Lev) and /da/ Egy.",
        "Irq and Glf generally preserve the MSA pronunciation.",
        "The MSA consonants /d/ (emphatic/velarized d) and /£/ (emphatic /£/) are both normalized to /d/ in Egy and Lev and to /5J in Glf and Irq.",
        "For example, the MSA sentence Malla yadrubu/ 'he continued to hit' is pronounced /dall yudrub/ (Lev) and Mall yudrub/ (Glf).",
        "In modern borrowings from MSA, /£/ is pronounced as /z/ (emphatic z) in Egy and Lev.",
        "For instance, the word for 'police officer' is /£a:bit/ in MSA but /za:bit/ in Egy and Lev.",
        "In some dialects, a loss of the emphatic feature of some MSA consonants occurs, e.g., the MSA word /lati:f/ 'pleasant' is pronounced as /lati:f/ in the Lebanese city sub-dialect of Lev.",
        "Emphasis typically spreads to neighboring vowels: if a vowel is preceded or succeeded directly by an emphatic consonant (/d/, /s/, /t/, /£/) then the vowel becomes an emphatic vowel.",
        "As a result, the loss of the emphatic feature does not affect the consonants only, but also their neighboring vowels.",
        "Other vocalic differences among MSA and the dialects include the following: First, short vowels change or are completely dropped, e.g., the MSA word /yaktubu/ 'he writes' is pronounced /yiktib/ (Egy and Irq) or /yoktob/ (Lev).",
        "Second, final and unstressed long vowels are shortened, e.g., the word /mata:ra:t/ 'airports' in MSA becomes /matara:t/ in many dialects.",
        "Third, the MSA diphthongs /aw/ and /ay/ have mostly become /o:/ and /e:/, respectively.",

        "Thus, we adopt the phonotactic approach to distinguishing among Arabic dialects.",
        "As mentioned in Section 2, the PRLM approach to language identification (Zissman, 1996) has had considerable success.",
        "Recall that, in the PRLM approach, the phones of the training utterances of a dialect are first identified using a single phone recognizer.",
        "Then an n-gram language model is trained on the resulting phone sequences for this dialect.",

        "Parallel PRLM is an extension to the PRLM approach, in which multiple (k) parallel phone recognizers, each trained on a different language, are used instead of a single phone recognizer (Ziss-man, 1996).",
        "For training, we run all phone recognizers in parallel on the set of training utterances of each dialect.",

        "For example, an MSA phone recognizer typically does not model the phoneme /g/; however, an English phone recognizer does.",
        "As described in Section 3, this phoneme is an important cue to distinguishing Egyptian Arabic from other Arabic dialects.",
        "Moreover, phone recognizers are prone to many errors; relying upon multiple phone streams rather than one may lead to a more robust model overall.",
        "In our experiments, we have used phone recognizers for English, German, Japanese, Hindi, Mandarin, and Spanish, from a toolkit developed by Brno University of Technology.",
        "These phone recognizers were trained on the OGI multilanguage database (Muthusamy et al., 1992) using a hybrid approach based on Neural Networks and Viterbi decoding without language models (open-loop) (Matejka et al., 2005).",
        "Since Arabic dialect identification is our goal, we hypothesize that an Arabic phone recognizer would also be useful, particularly since other phone recognizers do not cover all Arabic consonants, such as pharyngeals and emphatic alveo-lars.",
        "Therefore, we have built our own MSA phone recognizer using the HMM toolkit (HTK) (Young et al., 2006).",

        "The longer the utterance, the better we expect the system to perform.",
        "We can observe from these results that regardless of the test-utterance duration, the best distinguished dialect among the four dialects is Egyptian (F-Measure of 94% with 30s test utterances), followed by Levantine (F-Measure of 84% with 30s), and the most confusable dialects, according to the classification confusion matrix, are those of the Gulf and Iraqi Arabic (F-Measure of 68.7%, 67.3%, respectively with 30s).",
        "This confusion is consistent with dialect classifications that consider Iraqi a sub-dialect of Gulf Arabic, as mentioned in Section 3.",
        "We were also interested in testing which phone recognizers contribute the most to the classification task.",
        "We observe that employing a subset of the phone recognizers as opposed to all of them provides us with better results.",
        "Table 1 shows which phone recognizers are selected empirically, for each test-utterance duration condition.",
        "Table 1: Accuracy of the four-way classification (four colloquial Arabic dialects) and the best combination of phone recognizers used per test-utterances duration; The phone recognizers used are: E=English, G=German, H=Hindi, M=Mandarin, S=Spanish, ArbO=open-loop MSA without emphatic vowels, ArbOE=open-loop MSA with emphatic vowels, ArbLME=MSA with emphatic vowels and bi-gram phone LM",
        "We observe that the MSA phone recognizers are the most important phone recognizers for this task, usually when emphatic vowels are modeled.",
        "In all scenarios, removing all MSA phone recognizers leads to a significant drop in accuracy.",
        "German, Mandarin, Hindi, and Spanish typically contribute to the classification task, but English, and Japanese phone recognizers are less helpful.",
        "It is possible that the more useful recognizers are able to capture more of the distinctions among the Arabic dialects; however, it might also be that the overall quality of the recognizers also varies.",
        "Considering MSA as a dialectal variant of Arabic, we are also interested in analyzing the performance of our system when including it in our classification task.",
        "In this experiment, we add MSA as the fifth dialect.",
        "We perform the same steps described above for training, using the MSA corpus described in Section 4.",
        "For testing, we use also our 150 hypothesized MSA speakers as our test set.",
        "Interestingly, in this five-way classification, we observe that the F-Measure for the MSA class in the cross-validation task is always above 98% regardless of the test-utterance duration, as shown in Figure 3.",
        "It would seem that MSA is rarely confused with any of the colloquial dialects: it appears to have a distinct phonotactic distribution.",
        "This explanation is supported by linguists, who note that MSA differs from Arabic dialects in terms of its phonology, lexicon, syntax and morphology, which appears to lead to a profound impact on its phonotactic distribution.",
        "Similar to the four-way classification task,",
        "we add it back.",

        "In this paper, we have shown that four Arabic colloquial dialects (Gulf, Iraqi, Levantine, and Egyptian) plus MSA can be distinguished using a phonotactic approach with good accuracy.",
        "The parallel PRLM approach we employ thus appears to be effective not only for language identification but also for Arabic dialect ID.",
        "We have found that the most distinguishable dialect among the five variants we consider here is MSA, independent of the duration of the test-utterance (F-Measure is always above 98.00%).",
        "Egyptian Arabic is second (F-Measure of 90.2% with 30s test-utterances), followed by Levantine (F-Measure of 79.4%, with 30s test).",
        "The most confusable dialects are Iraqi and Gulf (F-Measure of 71.7% and 68.3%, respectively, with 30s test-utterances).",
        "This high degree of Iraqi-Gulf confusion is consistent with some classifications of Iraqi Arabic as a sub-dialect of Gulf Arabic.",
        "We have obtained a total accuracy of 81.60% in this five-way classification task when given 30s-duration utterances.",
        "We have also observed that the most useful phone streams for classification are those of our Arabic phone recognizers – typically those with emphatic vowels.",
        "As mentioned above, the high F-measure for MSA may be due to the MSA corpora we have used, which differs in genre from the dialect corpora.",
        "Therefore, one focus of our future research will be to collect MSA data with similar recording conditions to the other dialects to validate our results.",
        "We are also interested in including prosodic features, such as intonational, durational, and rhythmic features in our classification.",
        "A more long-term and general goal is to use our results to improve ASR for cases in which code-switching occurs between MSA and other dialects."
