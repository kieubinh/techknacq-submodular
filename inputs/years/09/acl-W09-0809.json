        "The emergence of phrase-based statistical machine translation (PSMT) (Koehn et al., 2003a) has been one of the major developments in statistical approaches to translation.",
        "Allowing translation of word sequences (phrases) instead of single words provides PSMT with a high degree of robustness in word selection and in local-word reordering.",
        "Recent developments have shown that improvements in PSMT quality are possible using syntax.",
        "One such development is the pre-translation reordering approach, which adjusts the source sentence to resemble target-language word order prior to translation.",
        "This is typically done using rules that are either manually created or automatically learned from word-aligned parallel corpora.",
        "One particular variety of this approach, proposed by Elming (2008), uses a large set of linguistic features to automatically learn reordering rules.",
        "The rules are applied non-deterministically; however, phrase-internal word-alignments are used to ensure that the intended reordering does not come undone because of phrase internal reordering (Elming, 2008).",
        "This approach was shown to produce improved MT output on English-Danish MT, a relatively closely-related and similarly-structured language pair.",
        "In this paper, we study whether this approach can be extended to distant language pairs, specifically English-to-Arabic.",
        "We achieve significant improvement in translation quality over related approaches, measured by manual as well as automatic evaluations on this task.",
        "This proves the viability of this approach on distant languages.",
        "We also examined the effect of the alignment method on learning reordering rules.",
        "Interestingly, our experiments produced better translation using rules learned from automatic alignments than using rules learned from manual alignments.",
        "In the next section, we discuss and contrast related work.",
        "Section 3 describes aspects of English and Arabic structure that are relevant to reordering.",
        "Section 4 describes the automatic induction of reordering rules and its integration in PSMT.",

        "Much work has been done in syntactic reordering for SMT, focusing on both source and target-language syntax.",
        "In this paper, we adapt an approach that utilizes source-syntax information as opposed to target-side syntax systems (Yamada and Knight, 2001; Galley et al., 2004).",
        "This is because we are translating from English to Arabic and we are discouraged by recent results indicating Arabic parsing is not at a stage that makes it usable in MT (Habash et al., 2006).",
        "While several recent authors using a pre-translation (source-side) reordering approach have achieved positive results, it has been difficult to integrate syntactic information while retaining the strengths of the statistical approach.",
        "In some studies, reordering decisions are done \"deterministically\" by supplying the decoder with a canonical word order (Xia et al., 2007; Habash, 2007).",
        "These reordering rules are either manually specified or automatically learned from alignments; and they are always placed outside the actual PSMT system.",
        "By contrast, other studies (Crego and Marino, 2007; Zhang et al., 2007; Li et al., 2007; Elming, 2008) are more in the spirit of PSMT, in that multiple reorderings are presented to the PSMT system as (possibly weighted) options that are allowed to contribute alongside other parameters.",
        "Specifically, we follow the pre-translation reordering approach of Elming (2008).",
        "This approach has been proven to remedy shortcomings of other pre-translation reordering approaches by reordering the input word sequence, but scoring the output word sequence.",
        "Elming (2008) only examined the approach within English - Danish, a language pair that displays little reordering.",
        "By contrast, in this paper, we target the more demanding reordering task of translating between two distant languages, English and Arabic.",
        "While much work has been done on Arabic to English MT (Habash and Sadat, 2006; Lee, 2004) mostly focusing on addressing the problems caused by the rich morphology of Arabic, we handle the less described translation direction: English to Arabic.",
        "Recently, there are some new publications on English to Arabic MT.",
        "Sarikaya and Deng (2007) use joint morphological-lexical language models to re-rank the output of English dialectal-Arabic MT, and Badr et al.",
        "(2008) report results on the value of the morphological decomposition of Arabic during training and describe different techniques for re-composition of Arabic in the output.",
        "We differ from the previous efforts targeting Arabic in that (1) we do not address morphology issues through segmentation (more on this in section 3) and (2) we focus on utilizing syntactic knowledge to address the reordering challenges of this translation direction."

      "heading": "3. Arabic Syntactic Issues",
      "text": [
        "Arabic is a morphologically and syntactically complex language with many differences from English.",
        "Arabic morphology has been well studied in the context of MT.",
        "Previous results all suggest that some degree of tokenization is helpful when translating from Arabic (Habash and Sadat, 2006; Lee, 2004).",
        "However, when translating into a morphologically rich language, target tokenization means that the translation process is broken into multiple steps (Badr et al., 2008).",
        "For our experiments, Arabic was not segmented apart from simple punctuation tokenization.",
        "This low level of segmentation was maintained in order to agree with the segmentation provided in the manually aligned corpus we used to learn our rules (section 6.1).",
        "We found no simple means for transferring the manual alignments to more segmented language.",
        "We expect that better performance would be achieved by introducing more Arabic segmentation as reported by Badr et al.",
        "(2008).",
        "As such, and unlike previous work in PSMT translating into Arabic, we focus here on syntax.",
        "We plan to investigate different tokenization schemes for syntactic preprocessing in future work.",
        "Next, we describe three prominent English-Arabic syntactic phenomena that have motivated some of our decisions in this paper.",
        "First is verb-subject order.",
        "Arabic verb subjects may be: (a.)",
        "pro-dropped (verb conjugated), (b.)",
        "pre-verbal (SVO), or (c.) post-verbal (VSO).",
        "Although the English SVO order is possible in Arabic, it is not always preferred, especially when the subject is particularly long.",
        "Unfortunately, this is the harder case for PSMT to handle.",
        "For small subject noun phrases (NP), PSMT might be able to handle the reordering in the phrase table if the verb and subject were seen in training.",
        "But this becomes much less likely with very long NPs that exceed the size of the phrases in a phrase table.",
        "The example in Figure 1 illustrates this point.",
        "Bolding and italics are used to mark the verb and subordinating conjunction that surround the subject NP (19 tokens) in English and what they map to in Arabic, respectively.",
        "Secondly, Arabic adjectival modifiers typically follow their nouns with the exception of some superlative adjectives.",
        "However, English adjectival modifiers can follow or precede their nouns depending on the size of the adjectival phrase: single word adjectives precede but multi-word adjectives phrases follow (or precede while hyphenated).",
        "For example, a tall man translates as J>.jJ» Jp-j rjl [NP-SBJ The general coordinator of the railroad project among the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council, Hamid Khaja,] [V announced] [SUB that...] [V A<jln] [NP-SBJ Almnsq Al^Am lmsrw<j Alskh AlHdyd byn dwl mjls Alt^Awn Alxlyjy HAmd xAjh] [SUBAn...] Twyl 'man tall'; however, the English phrase a man tall of stature translates with no reordering as Jj3^ Js>-j rjl Twyl AlqAmh 'man tall the-stature'.",
        "So does the superlative the tallest man translating into Jc>j J ATwl rjl 'tallest man.'",
        "Finally, Arabic has one syntactic construction, called Idafa, for indicating possession and compounding, while English has three.",
        "The Idafa construction typically consists of one or more indefinite nouns followed by a definite noun.",
        "For example, the English phrases the car keys, the car's keys and the keys of the car all translate into the Arabic SjL^JI ^j'lio mfAtyH AlsyArh 'keys the-car.'",
        "Only one of the three English constructions does not require content word reordering."

      "text": [
        "Following Elming (2008), we define reordering as two word sequences, left sequence (LS) and right sequence (RS), exchanging positions.",
        "These two sequences are restricted by being parallel consecutive, maximal and adjacent.",
        "The sequences are not restricted in length, making both short and long distance reordering possible.",
        "Furthermore, they need not be phrases in the sense that they appear as an entry in the phrase table.",
        "Figure 2 illustrates reordering in a word alignment matrix.",
        "The matrix contains reorderings between the light grey sequences (s'2 and s|) and the dark grey sequences (s5j and s|).",
        "On the other hand, the sequences s| and s| are not considered for reordering, since neither one is maximal, and s| is not consecutive on the target side.",
        "Table 1 contains an example of the features available to the algorithm learning reordering rules.",
        "We include features for the candidate reordering sequences (LS and RS) and for their possible left (LC) and right (RC) contexts.",
        "In addition to words and parts-of-speech (POS), we provide phrase structure (PS) sequences and subordination information (SUBORD).",
        "The PS sequence is made up of the highest level nodes in the syntax tree that cover the words of the current sequence and only these.",
        "Subordinate information can also be extracted from the syntax tree.",
        "A subordinate clause is defined as inside an SBAR constituent; otherwise it is a main clause.",
        "Our intuition is that all these features will allow us to learn the best rules possible to address the phenomena discussed in section 3 at the right level of generality.",
        "In order to minimize the amount of training data, word and POS sequences are annotated as too long (T/L) if they are longer than 4 words, and the same for phrase structure (PS) sequences if they are longer than 3 units.",
        "A feature vector is only used if at least one of these three levels is not T/L for both LS and RS, and T/L contexts are not included in the set.",
        "This does not constrain the possible length of a reordering, since a PS sequence of length 1 can cover an entire sentence.",
        "In the example in Table 1, LS and RS are single words, but they are not restricted in length.",
        "The span of the contexts varies from a single neighboring word to all the way to the sentence border.",
        "In the example, LS and RS should be reordered, since adjectives appear as post-modifiers in Arabic.",
        "In order to learn rules from the annotated data, we use a rule-based classifier, Ripper (Cohen, 1996).",
        "The motivation for using Ripper is that it allows features to be sets of strings, which fits well with our representation of the context, and it produces easily readable rules that allow better understanding of the decisions being made.",
        "In section 6.3, extracted rules are exemplified and analyzed.",
        "The probabilities of the rules are estimated using Maximum Likelihood Estimation based on the information supplied by Ripper on the performance of the individual rules on the training data.",
        "These logarithmic probabilities are easily integrat-able in the log-linear PSMT model as an additional parameter by simple addition."

        "The decoder used for the baseline system is Pharaoh (Koehn, 2004) with its distance-penalizing reordering model.",
        "Since Pharaoh does not support word lattice input, we use our own decoder for the experiments.",

        "The search algorithm of our decoder is similar to the RG graph decoder of (Zens et al., 2002).",

        "Both these scorings are performed in a phrase-independent manner.",

        "ings of the systems.",
        "This shows the TO scoring to be significantly superior to the other methods (p < 0.01 using Wilcoxon signed-rank testing).",
        "Another interesting observation is that reordering rules learned from automatic alignments lead to significantly better translation than rules learned from manual alignment.",
        "Due to the much higher quality of the manual alignment, the opposite might be expected.",
        "However, this may be just a variant on the observation that alignment improvements (measured against human references) seldom lead to MT improvements (Lopez and Resnik, 2006).",
        "The MAN alignments may in fact be better than GDF, but they are most certainly more different in nature from real alignment than the GDF alignments are.",
        "As such, the MAN alignments are not as powerful as we would have liked them to be.",
        "In our data sets, the GDF rules, seem less specific, and they therefore apply more frequently than the MAN rules.",
        "On average, this results in more than 7 times as many possible reordering paths per sentence.",
        "This means that the GDF rules supply the decoder with a larger search space, which in turn means more proposed translation hypotheses.",
        "This may play a big part in the effect of the rule sets.",
        "Table 5 shows the reordering choices made by the approaches in decoding.",
        "Most noticeable is that the SO approach is strongly biased against phrase internal reorderings; TO uses more than 30 times as many phrase internal reorderings as SO.",
        "In addition, TO is less likely to reject a rule proposed reordering.",
        "The 50 sentences from the manual evaluation are also manually analyzed with regards to reordering.",
        "For each reordering in these sentences, the four systems are ranked according to how well the area affected by the reordering is translated.",
        "This indicates that the SO approach's bias against phrase internal reorderings may hurt performance.",
        "25% of the time, when SO chooses an external reordering, while the TO approach chooses an internal reordering, the TO approach gets a better translation.",
        "Only in 7% of the cases is it the other way around.",
        "Another discovery from the analysis is when TO chooses an internal reordering and NO rejects the reordering.",
        "Here, TO leads to a better translation 45% of the time, while NO never outperforms TO.",
        "In these cases, either approach has used a phrase to cover the area, but via rule-based motivation, TO has forced a less likely phrase with the correct word order through.",
        "This clearly shows that local reordering is not handled sufficiently by phrase internal reordering alone.",
        "These need to be controlled too.",
        "The rule learning resulted in 61 rules based on manual alignments and 39 based on automatic alignments.",
        "Of these, the majority handled the placement of adjectives, while only a few handled the placement of the verb.",
        "A few of the rules that were learned from the manual alignment are shown in table 6.",
        "The first two rules handle the placement of the finite verb in Arabic.",
        "Rule 16 states that if a finite verb appears in front of a subordinate clause, then it should be moved to sentence initial position with a probability of 68%.",
        "Due to the restrictions of sequence lengths, it can only swap across maximally 4 words or a sequence of words that is describable by maximally 3 syntactic phrases.",
        "The SBAR condition may help restrict the reordering to finite verbs of the main clause.",
        "This rule and its probability goes well with the description given in sections 3, since VSO order is not obligatory.",
        "The subject may be unexpressed, or it may appear in front of the verb.",
        "This is even more obvious in rule 27, which has a probability of only 43%.",
        "Rules 11 and 1 deal with the inverse ordering of adjectives and nouns.",
        "The first is general but uncertain, the second is lexicalized and certain.",
        "The reason for the low probability of rule 11 is primarily that many proper names have been mis-tagged by the parser as either JJ or NN, and to a lesser extent that the rule should often not apply if the right context is also an NN.",

        "Finally, rule 37 handles compound nouns.",
        "Here a singular noun is moved to the right of a plural noun, if the right context is a preposition, and the left context is neither an adjective nor a singular noun.",
        "This rule handles compound nouns, where the modifying function of the first noun often is hard to distinguish from that of an adjective.",
        "The left context restrictions server the same purpose as the left context in rule 1; these should often be moved together with the singular noun.",
        "The function of the right context is harder to explain, but without this restriction, the rule would have been much less successful; dropping from a probability of71%to51%.",

        "We have explored the syntactic reordering approach previously presented in (Elming, 2008) within a more distant language pair, English-Arabic.",
        "A translation direction that is highly under-represented in MT research, compared to the opposite direction.",
        "We achieve significant improvement in translation quality over related approaches, measured by manual as well as automatic evaluations on this task.",
        "Thus proving the viability of the approach on distant languages.",
        "We also examined the effect of the alignment method on learning reordering rules.",
        "Interestingly, our experiments produced better translation using rules learned from automatic alignments than using rules learned from manual alignments.",
        "This is an aspect we want to explore further in the future.",
        "In future work, we would also like to address the morphological complexity of Arabic together with syntax.",
        "We plan to consider different segmentations for Arabic and study their interaction with translation and syntactic reordering.",
        "An important aspect of the TO approach is that it uses phrase internal alignments during translation.",
        "In the future, we wish to examine the effect their quality has on translation.",
        "We are also interested in examining the approach within a standard phrase-based decoder such as Moses (Koehn et al., 2003b) or a hierarchical phrase system (Chiang, 2005).",
        "The idea of training on reordered source language is often connected with pre-translation reordering.",
        "The present approach does not employ this strategy, since this is no trivial matter in a non-deterministic, weighted approach.",
        "Zhang et al.",
        "(2007) proposed an approach that builds on unfolding alignments.",
        "This is not an optimal solution, since this may not reflect their rules.",
        "Training on both original and reordered data may strengthen the approach, but it would not remedy the problems of the SO approach, since it would still be ignorant of the internal reorderings of a phrase.",
        "Nevertheless, it may strengthen the TO approach even further.",
