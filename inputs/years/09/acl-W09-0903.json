        "Those structures are called messages and they were previously used in the context of a multi-document summarization system of evolving events.",
        "The series of experiments that we are proposing are essentially composed from two stages.",
        "In the first stage we are trying to extract a representative vocabulary of words.",
        "This vocabulary is later used in the second stage, during which we apply to it various clustering approaches in order to identify the clusters of predicates and arguments – or frames and semantic roles, to use the jargon of Frame Semantics.",

        "Take a sentence, any sentence for that matter; step back for a while and try to perceive that sentence in its most abstract form.",
        "What you will notice is that once you try to abstract away sentences, several regularities between them will start to emerge.",
        "To start with, there is almost always an action that is performed.",
        "Then, there is most of the times an agent that is performing this action and a patient or a benefactor that is receiving this action, and it could be the case that this action is performed with the aid of a certain instrument.",
        "In other words, within a sentence – and in respect to its action-denoting word, or predicate in linguistic terms – there will be several entities that are associated with the predicate, playing each time a specific semantic role.",
        "The notion of semantic roles can be traced back to Fillmore's (1976) theory of Frame Semantics.",
        "According to this theory then, a frame is a conceptual structure which tries to describe a stereotypical situation, event or object along with its participants and props.",
        "Each frame takes a name (e.g. Commercial Transaction) and contains a list of Lexical Units (LUs) which actually evoke this frame.",
        "An LU is nothing else than a specific word or a specific meaning of a word in the case of polysemous words.",
        "To continue the previous example, some LUs that evoke the frame of Commercial Transaction could be the verbs buy, sell, etc.",
        "Finally, the frames contain several frame elements or semantic roles which actually denote the abstract conceptual entities that are involved with the particular frame.",
        "Research in semantic roles can be distinguished into two major branches.",
        "The first branch of research consists in defining an ontology of semantic roles, the frames in which the semantic roles are found as well as defining the LUs that evoke those frames.",
        "The second branch of research, on the other hand, stipulates the existence of a set of frames, including semantic roles and LUs; its goal then, is the creation of an algorithm that given such a set of frames containing the semantic roles, will be able to label the appropriate portions of a sentence with the corresponding semantic roles.",
        "This second branch of research is known as semantic role labeling.",
        "Most of the research concerning the definition of the semantic roles has been carried out by linguists who are manually examining a certain amount of frames before finally defining the semantic roles and the frames that contain those semantic roles.",
        "Two such projects that are widely known are the FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998; Ruppenhofer et al., 2006) and PropBank/NomBank (Palmer et al., 2005; Meyers et al., 2004).",
        "Due to the fact that the aforementioned projects are accompanied by a large amount of annotated data, computer scientists have started creating algorithms, mostly based on statistics (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Xue, 2008) in order to automatically label the semantic roles in a sentence.",
        "Those algorithms take as input the frame that contains the roles as well as the predicate of the sentence.",
        "Despite the fact that during the last years we have seen an increasing interest concerning semantic role labeling, we have not seen many advancements concerning the issue of automatically inducing semantic roles from raw textual corpora.",
        "Such a process of induction would involve, firstly the identification of the words that would serve as predicates and secondly the creation of the appropriate clusters of word sequences, within the limits of a sentence, that behave similarly in relation to the given predicates.",
        "Although those clusters of word sequences could not actually be said to serve in themselves as the semantic roles, they can nevertheless be viewed as containing characteristic word sequences of specific semantic roles.",
        "The last point has the implication that if one is looking for a human intuitive naming of the semantic role that is implied by the cluster then one should look elsewhere.",
        "This is actually reminiscent of the approach that is carried out by PropBank/NomBank in which each semantic role is labeled as Argi through Arg5 with the semantics given aside in a human readable natural language sentence.",
        "our goal in this paper is to contribute to the research problem of frame induction, that is of the creation of frames, including their associated semantic roles, given as input only a set of textual documents.",
        "More specifically we propose a general methodology to accomplish this task, and we test its first stage which includes the use of corpus statistics for the creation of a subset of words, from the initial universe of initial words that are present in the corpus.",
        "This subset will later be used for the identification of the predicates as well as the semantic roles.",
        "Knowing that the problem of frame induction is very difficult in the general case, we limit ourselves to a specific genre and domain trying to exploit the characteristics that exist in that domain.",
        "The domain that we have chosen is that of the terroristic incidents which involve hostages.",
        "Nevertheless, the same methodology could be applied to other domains.",
        "The rest of the paper is structured as follows.",
        "In section 2 we describe the data on which we have applied our methodology, which itself is described in detail in section 3.",
        "Section 4 describes the actual experiments that we have performed and the results obtained, while a discussion of those results follows in section 5.",
        "Finally, section 6 contains a description of the related work while we present our future work and conclusions in section 7."

        "The annotated data that we have used in order to perform our experiments come from a previous work on automatic multi-document summarization of events that evolve through time (Afantenos et al., 2008; Afan-tenos et al., 2005; Afantenos et al., 2004).",
        "The methodology that is followed is based on the identification of similarities and differences – between documents that describe the evolution of an event – synchronically as well as diachronically.",
        "In order to do so, the notion of Synchronic and Diachronic cross document Relations (SDRs), was introduced.",
        "SDRs connect not the documents themselves but some semantic structures that were called messages.",
        "The connection of the messages with the SDRs resulted in the creation of a semantic graph that was then fed to a Natural Language Generation (NLG) system in order to produce the final summary.",
        "Although the notion of messages was originally inspired by the notion of messages as used in the area of NLG, for example during the stage of Content Determination as described in (Reiter and Dale, 1997), and in general they do follow the spirit of the initial definition by Reiter & Dale, in the following section we would like to make it clear what the notion of messages represents for us.",
        "In the rest of the paper, when we refer to the notion of messages, it will be in the context of the discussion that follows.",
        "The intuition behind messages, is the fact that during the evolution of an event we have several activities that take place and each activity is further decomposed into a series of actions.",
        "Messages were created in order to capture this abstract notion of actions.",
        "Of course, actions usually implicate several entities.",
        "In this case, entities were represented with the aid of a domain ontology.",
        "Thus, in more formal terms a message m can be defined as follows:",
        "In order to give a simple example, let us take for instance the case of the hijacking of an airplane by terrorists.",
        "In such a case, we are interested in knowing if the airplane has arrived to its destination, or even to another place.",
        "This action can be captured by a message of type arrive whose arguments can be the entity that arrives (the airplane in our case, or a vehicle, in general) and the location that it arrives.",
        "The specifications of such a message can be expressed as follows:",
        "Structure Theory (RST) (Taboada and Mann, 2006), with the difference that in the case of SDRs the relations hold across documents, while in the case of RSTs the relation hold inside a document.",
        "arrive (what, place)",
        "what : Vehicle place : Location",
        "The concepts Vehicle and Location belong to the ontology of the topic; the concept Airplane is a subconcept of the Vehicle.",
        "A sentence that might instantiate this message is the following:",
        "The Boeing 747 arrived at the airport of Stanstend.",
        "The above sentence instantiates the following message:",
        "The domain which was chosen was that of terroristic incidents that involve hostages.",
        "An empirical study, by three people, of 163 journalistic articles – written in Greek – that fell in the above category, resulted in the definition of 48 different message types that represent the most important information in the domain.",
        "At this point we would like to stress that what we mean by \"most important information\" is the information that one would normally expect to see in a typical summary of such kinds of events.",
        "Some of the messages that have been created are shown in Table 1; figure 1 provides full specifications for two messages.",
        "negotiate (who, with_whom, about) who : Person with_whom: Person",
        "about: Activity free (who, whom, from) whom: Person from : Place V Vehicle",
        "Although in an abstract way the notion of messages, as presented in this paper approaches the notion of frame semantics – after all, both messages and frame semantics are concerned with \"who did what, to whom, when, where and how\" – it is our hope that our approach could ultimately be used for the problem of frame induction.",
        "Nevertheless, the two structures have several points in which they differ.",
        "In the following section we would like to clarify those points in which the two differ.",
        "As it might have been evident until now, the notions of messages and frame semantics are quite similar, at least from an abstract point of view.",
        "In practical terms though, the two notions exhibit several differences.",
        "To start with, the notion of messages has been used until now only in the context of automatic text summarization of multiple documents.",
        "Thus, the aim of messages is to capture the essential information that one would expect to see in a typical summary of this do-main.",
        "In contrast, semantic roles and the frames in which they exist do not have this limitation.",
        "Another differentiating characteristic of frame semantics and messages is the fact that semantic roles always get instantiated within the boundaries of the sentence in which the predicate exists.",
        "By contrast, in messages although in the vast majority of the cases there is a one-to-one mapping from sentences to messages, in some of the cases the arguments of a message, which correspond to the semantic roles, are found in neighboring sentences.",
        "The overwhelming majority of those cases (which in any case were but a few) concern referring expressions.",
        "Due to the nature of the machine learning experiments that were performed, the actual entities were annotated as arguments of the messages, instead of the referring expressions that might exist in the sentence in which the message's predicate resided.",
        "A final difference that exists between messages and frame semantics is the fact that messages were meant to exist within a certain domain, while the definition of semantic roles is usually independent of a domain."

        "tf.idf: For each word in the corpus we calculate its tf.idf.",

        "The corpus was initially used in the context of training a multi-document summarization system.",
        "Out of the 3,027 sentences that the corpus contains, about one third (1,017 sentences) were annotated with the 48 message types that were mentioned in section 2.1.",

        "Using the four different statistical measures presented in the previous section, we tried to reconstruct that set.",
        "In order to understand how the statistical measures behaved, we varied for each one of them the value of the threshold used.",

        "For the Document Frequency it represents the n% most frequent words that appear in each document separately.",
        "For tf.idf it represents the words with the highest n% tf.idf score in each document.",
        "Finally for the Inter-document Frequency the threshold represents the verbs and nouns that appear in at least n documents.",

        "For the case of the Inter-document Frequency, we varied the threshold from 1 to 73 which represents the maximum number of documents in which a word appeared.",

        "A first remark that we can make in respect to those graphs is that concerning the collection frequency, document frequency and tf.idf measures, for small threshold numbers we have more or less high precision values while the recall and fallout values are low.",

        "This high F-measure though comes at a certain cost since the Fallout is at 31.16%.",

        "As we have earlier said, a motivating factor of this paper is the automatic induction of the structures that we have called messages; the extracted lexicon of verbs and messages will later be used by an unsupervised clustering algorithm in order to create the classes of words which will correspond to the message types.",
        "For this reason, although we prefer to have an F-measure as high as possible, we also want to have a fallout measure as low as possible, so that the number of false positives will not perturb the clustering algorithm.",

        "The immediate next step in the process involves the application of various unsupervised clustering techniques on the obtained lexicon in order to create the 48 different classes each one of which will represent a distinct vocabulary for the 48 different message types.",
        "We are currently experimenting with several algorithms such K-means, Expectation-Minimization (EM), Cobweb and Farthest First.",
        "In addition to those clustering algorithms, we are also examining the use of various lexical association measures such as Mutual Information, Dice coefficient, x, etc.",
        "Although this approach will provide us with clusters of predicates and candidate arguments, still the problem of linking the predicates with their arguments remains.",
        "Undoubtedly, the use of more linguistically oriented techniques, such as syntactic analysis, is inevitable.",
        "We are currently experimenting with the use of a shallow parser (chunker) in order to identify the chunks that behave similarly in respect to a given cluster of predicates.",
        "Concerning the evaluation of our approach, the highest F-measure score (61,87%) was given by the Collection Frequency statistical measure with a threshold value of 46%.",
        "This high F-measure though came at the cost of a high Fallout score (31.16%).",
        "Since the extracted lexicon will later be used as an input to a clustering algorithm, we would like to minimize as much as possible the false positives.",
        "By consequence we have opted in using the Inter-document Frequency measure which presents an F-measure of 54.40% and a much more limited Fallout of 8.86%."
