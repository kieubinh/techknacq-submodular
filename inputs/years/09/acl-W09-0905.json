        "In human category acquisition, the immediate local context of a word has proven to be a reliable indicator of its grammatical category, or part of speech (e.g., Mintz, 2002, 2003; Redington et al., 1998).",
        "Likewise, category induction techniques cluster word types together (e.g., Clark, 2003; Schütze, 1995), using similar information, i.e., distributions of local context information.",
        "These methods are successful and useful (e.g. Koo et al., 2008), but in both cases it is not always clear whether errors in lexical classification are due to a problem in the induction algorithm or in what contexts count as identifying the same category (cf. Dickinson, 2008).",
        "The question we ask, then, is: what role does the context on its own play in defining a grammatical category?",
        "Specifically, when do two contexts identify the same category?",
        "Many category induction experiments start by trying to categorize words, and Parisien et al.",
        "(2008) categorize word usages, a combination of a word and its context.",
        "But to isolate the effect the context has on the word, we take the approach of categorizing contexts as a first step towards clustering words.",
        "By separating out contexts for word clustering, we can begin to speak of better disambiguation models as a foundation for induction.",
        "We aim in this paper to thoroughly investigate what category properties contexts can or cannot distinguish by themselves.",
        "With this approach, we are able to more thoroughly examine the categories used for evaluation.",
        "Evaluation of induction methods is difficult, due to the variety of corpora and tagsets in existence (see discussion in Clark, 2003) and the variety of potential purposes for induced categories (e.g., Koo et al., 2008; Miller et al., 2004).",
        "Yet improving the evaluation of category induction is vital, as evaluation does not match up well with grammar induction evaluation (Headden III et al., 2008).",
        "For many evaluations, POS tags have been mapped to a smaller tagset (e.g., Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007; Toutanova and Johnson, 2008), but there have been few criteria for evaluating the quality of these mappings.",
        "By isolating contexts, we can investigate how each mapping affects the accuracy of a method and the lexicon.",
        "Using corpus annotation also allows us to explore the relation between induced categories and computationally or theoretically-relevant categories (e.g., Elworthy, 1995).",
        "While human category acquisition results successfully divide a lexicon into categories, these categories are not necessarily ones which are appropriate for many computational purposes or match theoretical syntactic analysis.",
        "This work can also serve as a platform to help drive the design of new tagsets, or refinement of old ones, by outlining which types of categories are or are not applicable for category induction.",
        "After discussing some preliminary issues in section 2, in section 3 we examine to what extent contexts by themselves can distinguish different category properties and how this affects evaluation.",
        "Namely, we propose that corpus tagsets should be clear about identifying syntactic/distributional properties and about how tagset mappings for evaluation should outline how much information is lost by mapping.",
        "In section 4, in more preliminary work, we add lexical information to contexts, in order to merge them together and see which still identify the same category."

      "text": [
        "Research on language acquisition has addressed how humans learn categories of words, and we use this as a starting point.",
        "Mintz (2002) shows that local context, in the form of a frame of two words surrounding a target word, leads to the target's categorization in adults, and Mintz (2003) shows that frequent frames supply category information in child language corpora.",
        "A frame is not decomposed into its left and right sides (cf., e.g., Reding-ton et al., 1998; Clark, 2003; Schütze, 1995), but is taken as their joint occurrence (Mintz, 2003).",
        "For category acquisition, frequent frames are used, those with a frequency above a certain threshold.",
        "These predict category membership, as the set of words appearing in a given frame should represent a single category.",
        "The frequent frame you __ it, for example, largely identifies verbs, as shown in (1), taken from child-directed speech in the CHILDES database (MacWhinney, 2000).",
        "For frequent frames in six subcorpora of CHILDES, Mintz (2003) obtains both high type and token accuracy in categorizing words.",
        "b. you|see it",
        "The categories do not reflect fine-grained linguistic distinctions, though, nor do they fully account for ambiguous words.",
        "Indeed, accuracies slightly degrade when moving from \"Standard Labeling\" to the more fine-grained \"Expanded La-beling,\" from .98 to .91 in token accuracy and from .93 to .91 in type accuracy.",
        "In scaling the method beyond child-directed speech, it would be beneficial to use annotated data, which allows for ambiguity and distinguishes a word's category across corpus instances.",
        "Furthermore, even though many frames identify the same category, the method does not thoroughly specify how to relate them.",
        "It has been recognized for some time that wider contexts result in better induction models (e.g., Parisien et al., 2008; Redington et al., 1998), but many linguistic distinctions rely on lexical information that cannot be inferred from additional context (Dickinson, 2008), so focusing on short contexts can provide many insights.",
        "The use of frames allows for frequent recurrent contexts and a way to investigate corpus categories, or POS tags (cf., e.g., Dickinson and Jochim, 2008).",
        "An added benefit of starting with this method is that it can be converted to a model of online acquisition (Wang and Mintz, 2007).",
        "For this paper, however, we only investigate the type of information input into the model.",
        "Frequency The core idea of using frames is that words used in the same context are associated with each other, and the more often these contexts occur, the more confidence we have that the frame indicates a category.",
        "Setting a threshold to obtain the 45 most frequent frames in each subcorpus (about 80,000 words on average), (Mintz, 2003) allows a frame to occur often enough to be meaningful and have a variety of target words in the frame.",
        "To determine what category properties frames pinpoint (section 3), we use two thresholds to define frequent.",
        "Singly occurring frames cannot provide any information about groupings of words, so we first consider frames that occur more than once.",
        "This gives a large number of frames, covering much of the corpus (about 970,000 tokens), but frames with few instances have very little information.",
        "For the other threshold, frequent frames are those which have a frequency of 200, about 0.03% of the total number of frames in the corpus.",
        "One could explore more thresholds, but for comparing tagset mappings, these provide a good picture.",
        "The higher threshold is appropriate for combining contexts (section 4), as we need more information to tell whether two frames behave similarly.",
        "Accuracy To evaluate, we need a measure of the accuracy of each frame.",
        "Mintz (2003) and Red-ington et al.",
        "(1998) calculate accuracy by counting all pairs of words (types or tokens) that are from the same category, divided by all possible pairs of words in a grouping.",
        "This captures the idea that each word should have the same category as every other word in its category set.",
        "Viewing the task as disambiguating contexts (see section 3), however, this measurement does not seem to adequately represent cases with a majority label.",
        "For example, if three words have the tag X and one Y, pairwise comparison results in an accuracy of 50%, even though X is dominant.",
        "To account for this, we measure the precision of the most frequent category instances among all instances, e.g., 75% for the above example (cf. the notion of purity in Manning et al., 2008).",
        "Additionally, we only use measurements of token precision.",
        "Token precision naturally handles ambiguous words and is easy to calculate in a POS-annotated corpus."

      "text": [
        "In automatic category induction, a category is often treated as a set, or cluster, of words (Clark, 2003; Schütze, 1995), and category ambiguity is represented by the fact that words can appear in more than one set.",
        "Relatedly, one can cluster word usages, a combination of a word and its context (Parisien et al., 2008).",
        "An erroneous classification occurs when a word is in an incorrect set, and one source of error is when the contexts being treated as indicative of the same category are actually ambiguous.",
        "For example, in a bigram model, the context be __ identifies nouns, adjectives, and verbs, among others.",
        "Viewed in this way, it is important to gauge the precision of contexts for distinguishing a category (cf. also Dickinson, 2008).",
        "In other words, how often does the same context identify the same category?",
        "And how fine-grained is the category that the context distinguishes?",
        "To test whether a frame defines a single category in non-child-directed speech, we focus on which categorical properties frames define, and for this we use a POS-annotated corpus.",
        "Due to its popularity for unsupervised POS induction research (e.g., Goldberg et al., 2008; Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007; Toutanova and Johnson, 2008) and its often-used tagset, for our initial research, we use the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), with 36 tags (plus 9 punctuation tags), and we use sections 00-18, leaving held-out data for future experiments.",
        "Defining frequent frames as those occurring at least 200 times, we find 79.5% token precision.",
        "Additionally, we have 99 frames, identifying 14 types of categories as the majority tag (common noun (NN) being the most prevalent (37 frames)).",
        "For a threshold of 2, we have 77.3% precision for 67,721 frames and 35 categories.",
        "With precision below 80%, we observe that frames are not fully able to disambiguate these corpus categories.",
        "These corpus categories, however, are composed of a variety of morphological and syntactic features, the exact nature of which varies from tagset to tagset.",
        "By merging different tags, we can factor out different types of morphological and syntactic properties to determine which ones are more or less easily identified by frames.",
        "Accuracy will of course improve by merging tags; what is important is for which mappings it improves.",
        "We start with basic categories, akin to those in Mintz (2003).",
        "Despite the differences among tagsets, these basic categories are common, and merging POS tags into basic categories can show that differences in accuracy have more to do with stricter category labels than language type.",
        "We merged tags to create basic categories, as in table 1 (adapted from Hepple and van Genabith (2000); see appendix A for descriptions).",
        "These broader categories result in the accuracies in table 2, and we also record accuracies for the similar PTB-17 tagset used in a variety of unsupervised tagging experiments (Smith and Eisner, 2005), which mainly differs by treating VBG and VBN uniquely.",

        "Given the predominance of verbs and nouns, we focus on distinguishing linguistic properties within these categories.",
        "For example, simply by merging nouns and leaving all other original tags unchanged, we move from 79.5% token precision to 88.4% (for the threshold of 200).",
        "Leaving all other mappings as in table 1, we merge nouns and verbs along two dimensions: their common syntactic properties or their common morphological properties.",
        "Ideally, we prefer frames to pick out syntactic properties, since morphological properties can assumedly be determined from word-internal properties (see Clark, 2003; Christiansen and Monaghan, 2006).",
        "Specifically, we can merge nouns by noun type (PRP [pronoun], NN/NNS [common noun], NNP/NNPS [proper noun]) or by noun form, in this case based on grammatical number (PRP [pronoun], NN/NNP [singular noun], NNS/NNPS [plural noun]).",
        "We can merge verbs by finiteness (MD [modal], VBP/VBZ/VBD [finite verb], VB/VBG/VBN [nonfinite verb]) or by verb form",
        "VBG [-ing], VBZ [-s]).",
        "In the latter case, verbs with consistently similar forms are grouped – e.g., see can be a baseform (VB) or a present tense verb (VBP).",
        "The results are given in tables 3 and 4.",
        "We find that merging verbs by finiteness and nouns by noun type results in higher precision.",
        "This confirms that contexts can better distinguish syntactic, but not necessarily morphological, properties.",
        "As we will see in the next section, this mapping also maintains distinctions in the lexicon.",
        "Such use of local contexts, along with tag merging, can be used to evaluate tagsets which claim to be distributional (see, e.g., Dickinson and Jochim, 2008).",
        "It should be noted that we have only explored category mappings which merge tags, ignoring possible splits.",
        "While splitting a tag like TO (to) into prepositional and infinitival uses would be ideal, we do not have the information automatically available.",
        "We are thus limited in our evaluation by what the tagset offers.",
        "Some tag splits can be automatically recovered (e.g., splitting PRP based on properties such as person), but if it is automatically recoverable from the lexicon, we do not necessarily need context to identify it, an idea we turn to in the next section.",
        "Some of the category distinctions made by frames are more or less important for the context to make.",
        "For example, it is detrimental if we conflate VB and VBP because this is a prominent ambiguity for many words (e.g., see).",
        "On the other hand, there are no words which can be both VBP (e.g., see) and VBZ (e.g., sees).",
        "Ideally, induction methods would be able to distinguish all these cases – just as they often make distinctions beyond what is in a tagset – but there are differences in how problematic the mappings are.",
        "If we group VB and VBP into one tag, there is no way to recover that distinction; for VBP and VBZ, there are at least different words which inherently take the different tags.",
        "Thus, a mapping is preferred which does not conflate tags that vary for individual words.",
        "To calculate this, we compare the original lexicon with a mapped lexicon and count the number of words which lose a distinction.",
        "Consider the words accept and accepts: accept varies between VB and VBP; accepts is only VBZ.",
        "When we map tags based on verb form, we count 1 for accept, as VB and VBP are now one tag (Verb).",

        "This merging of contexts is different than clustering words (e.g., Clark, 2000; Brown et al., 1992), but is applicable, as word clustering relies on knowing which contexts identify the same category.",
        "On their own, frames at best distinguish only very broad categorical properties.",

        "Part of this might be due to the fact that NN is still a large majority (76% of the frames).",
        "Additionally, we find that, although the frame tokens make up only 5.2% of the corpus and the types make up 15.9% of the target lexicon, those types correspond to 67.2% of the target corpus tokens."
