        "In one of their seminal papers (Hauser et al., 2002), Noam Chomsky and his co-authors remarked that if a Martian ever graced our planet then it would be awestruck by the unique ability of the humans to communicate among themselves through the medium of language.",
        "However, if our Martian naturalist were meticulous then it might also note the surprising coexistence of 6700 such mutually unintelligible languages across the world.",
        "Till date, the terrestrial scientists have no definitive answer as to why this linguistic diversity exists (Pinker, 1994).",
        "Previous work in the area of language evolution has tried to explain the emergence of this diversity through two different background models.",
        "The first one assumes that there is a set of predefined language configurations and the movement of a particular language on this landscape is no more than a random walk (Tom-lin, 1986; Dryer, 1992).",
        "The second line of research attempts to relate the ecological, cultural and demographic parameters with the linguistic parameters responsible for this diversity (Arita and Taylor, 1996; Kirby, 1998; Livingstone and Fyfe, 1999; Nettle, 1999).",
        "From the above studies, it turns out that linguistic diversity is an outcome of the language dynamics in terms of its evolution, acquisition and change.",
        "In this work, we attempt to investigate the diversity that exists across the consonant inventories of the world's languages through an evolutionary framework based on network growth.",
        "The use of a network based model is motivated from the fact that in the recent years, complex networks have proved to be an extremely suitable framework for modeling and studying the structure and dynamics of linguistic systems (Cancho and Sole, 2001; Dorogovtsev and Mendes, 2001; Cancho and Sole, 2004; Sole et al., 2005).",
        "Along the lines of the study presented in (Choudhury et al., 2006), we model the structure of the inventories through a bipartite network, which has two different sets of nodes, one labeled by the languages and the other by the consonants.",
        "Edges run in between these two sets depending on whether a particular consonant is found in a particular language.",
        "This network is termed the Phoneme-Language Network or PlaNet in (Choudhury et al., 2006).",
        "We construct five such networks that respectively represent the consonant inventories belonging to the five ma jor language families namely, the Indo-European (IE-PlaNet), the Afro-Asiatic (AA-PlaNet), the Niger-Congo (NC-PlaNet), the Austronesian (ANPlaNet) and the Sino-Tibetan (ST-PlaNet).",
        "The emergence ofthe distribution ofoccurrence of the consonants across the languages of a family can be explained through a growth model for the PlaNet representing the family.",
        "We employ the preferential attachment based growth model introduced in (Choudhury et al., 2006) and later analytically solved in (Peruani et al., 2007) to explain this emergence for each of the five families.",
        "The model involves a single parameter that is essentially meant to introduce randomness in the otherwise predominantly preferential growth process.",
        "We observe that if we combine the inventories for all the families together and then attempt to fit this new data with our model, the value of the parameter is significantly different from that of the individual families.",
        "This indicates that the dynamics within the families is quite different from that across them.",
        "There are possibly two factors that regulate this dynamics: the innate preference of the speakers towards acquiring certain linguistic structures over others and shared ancestry of the languages within a family.",
        "The prime contribution of this paper lies in the mathematical model that naturally captures and quantifies the diversification process of the language inventories.",
        "This diversification, which is arguably an effect of language acquisition and change, can be viewed as a manifestation of the process of preferential attachment at a higher level of abstraction.",
        "The rest of the paper is laid out as follows.",
        "Section 2 states the definition of PlaNet, briefly describes the data source and outlines the construction procedure for the five networks.",
        "In section 3 we review the growth model for the networks.",
        "The experiments and the results are explained in the next section.",

        "In other words, the inventories of genetically related languages are similar (i.e., they share a lot of consonants) because they have evolved from the same parent language through a series of linguistic changes, and the chances that they use a large number of consonants used by the parent language is naturally high.",
        "Observation II: We observe a very interesting relationship between the approximate age of the language family and the values of e obtained in each case (see Table 3).",

        "In this paper, we presented a method of network evolution to capture the emergence of linguistic diversity that manifests in the five major language families of the world.",
        "How does the growth model, if at all, captures the process of language dynamics?",
        "We argue that preferential attachment is a high level abstraction of language acquisition as well as language change.",
        "We sketch out two possible explanations for this fact, both of which are merely speculations at this point and call for detailed experimentation.",
        "It is a well known fact that the process of language acquisition by an individual largely governs the course of language change in a linguistic community.",
        "In the initial years of language development every child passes through a stage called babbling during which he/she learns to produce non-meaningful sequences of consonants and vowels, some of which are not even used in the language to which they are exposed (Jakobson, 1968; Locke, 1983).",
        "Clear preferences can be observed for learning certain sounds such as plosives and nasals, whereas fricatives and liquids are avoided.",
        "In fact, this hierarchy of preference during the babbling stage follows the cross-linguistic frequency distribution of the consonants.",
        "This innate frequency dependent preference towards certain phonemes might be because of phonetic reasons (i.e., for articulatory/perceptual benefits).",
        "It can be argued that in the current model, this innate preference gets captured through the process of preferential attachment.",
        "An alternative explanation could be conceived of based on the phenomenon of language transmission.",
        "Let there be a community of N speakers communicating among themselves by means of only two consonants say /k/ and /g/.",
        "Let the number of /k/ speakers be m and that of /g/ speakers be n. If we assume that each speaker has l descendants and that language inventories are transmitted with high fidelity then after i generations, the number of /k/ speakers should be ml and that of /g/ speakers should be nl%.",
        "Now if m > n and l > 1 then for sufficiently large values of i we have ml » nl%.",
        "Stated differently, the /k/ speakers by far outnumbers the /g/ speakers after a few generations even though the initial difference between them is quite small.",
        "This phenomenon is similar to that of preferential attachment where language communities get attached to, i.e., select consonants that are already highly preferred.",
        "In this context e can be thought to model the accidental errors during transmission.",
        "Since these errors accumulate over time, this can intuitively explain why older language families have a higher value of e than the younger ones.",
        "In fact, preferential attachment (PA) is a universally observed evolutionary mechanism that is known to shape several physical, biological and socio-economic systems (Newman, 2003).",
        "This phenomenon has also been called for to explain various linguistic phenomena (Choudhury and Mukherjee, to appear).",
        "We believe that PA also provides a suitable abstraction for the mechanism of language acquisition.",
        "Acquisition of vocabulary and growth of the mental lexicon are few examples of PA in language acquisition.",
        "This work illustrates another variant of PA applied to explain the structure of consonant inventories and their diversification across the language families.",
