        "The phenomenon of meaning-preserving corrections given by an adult to a child involves several aspects: (1) the child produces an incorrect utterance, which the adult nevertheless understands, (2) the adult produces a correct utterance with the same meaning and (3) the child recognizes the adult utterance as having the same meaning as its previous utterance, and takes that as a signal that its previous utterance is not correct according to the adult grammar.",
        "An adequate model of this phenomenon must incorporate utterances and meanings, account for how the child and adult can understand each other's meanings, and model how meaning-preserving corrections interact with the child's increasing mastery of language production.",
        "In this paper we are concerned with how a learner who has learned to comprehend utterances might go about learning to produce them.",
        "We consider a model of language comprehension and production based on finite sequential and subsequential transducers.",
        "Utterances are modeled as finite sequences of words and meanings as finite sequences of predicates.",
        "Comprehension is interpreted as a mapping of utterances to meanings and production as a mapping of meanings to utterances.",
        "Previous work (Castel-lanos et al., 1993; Pieraccini et al., 1993) has applied subsequential transducers and the OSTIA algorithm to the problem of learning to comprehend language; here we apply them to the problem of learning to produce language.",
        "For ten natural languages and a limited domain of geometric shapes and their properties and rela- tions we define sequential transducers to produce pairs consisting of an utterance in that language and its meaning.",
        "Using this data we empirically explore the properties of the OSTIA and DD-OSTIA algorithms for the tasks of learning comprehension and production in this domain, to assess whether they may provide a basis for a model of meaning-preserving corrections."

        "The role of corrections in language learning has recently received substantial attention in Grammatical Inference.",
        "The kinds of corrections considered are mainly syntactic corrections based on proximity between strings.",
        "For example, a correction of a string may be given by using edit distance (Becerra-Bonache et al., 2007; Kinber, 2008) or based on the shortest extension of the queried string (Becerra-Bonache et al., 2006), among others.",
        "In these approaches semantic information is not used.",
        "However, in natural situations, a child's erroneous utterances are corrected by her parents based on the meaning that the child intends to express; typically, the adult's corrections preserve the intended meaning of the child.",
        "Adults use corrections in part as a way of making sure they have understood the child's intentions, in order to keep the conversation \"on track\".",
        "Thus the child's utterance and the adult's correction have the same meaning, but the form is different.",
        "As Chouinard and Clark point out (2003), because children attend to contrasts in form, any change in form that does not mark a different meaning will signal to children that they may have produced something that is not acceptable in the target language.",
        "Results in (Chouinard and Clark, 2003) show that adults reformulate erroneous child utterances often enough to help learning.",
        "Moreover, these re sults show that children can not only detect differences between their own utterance and the adult reformulation, but that they do make use of that information.",
        "Thus in some natural situations, corrections have a semantic component that has not been taken into account in previous Grammatical Inference studies.",
        "Some interesting questions arise: What are the effects of corrections on learning syntax?",
        "Can corrections facilitate the language learning process?",
        "One of our long-term goals is to find a formal model that gives an account of this kind of correction and in which we can address these questions.",
        "Moreover, such a model might allow us to show that semantic information can simplify the problem of learning formal languages.",
        "A simple computational model of semantics and context for language learning incorporating semantics was proposed in (Angluin and Becerra-Bonache, 2008).",
        "This model accommodates two different tasks: comprehension and production.",
        "That paper focused only on the comprehension task and formulated the learning problem as follows.",
        "The teacher provides to the learner several example pairs consisting of a situation and an utterance denoting something in the situation; the goal of the learner is to learn the meaning function, allowing the learner to comprehend novel utterances.",
        "The results in that paper show that under certain assumptions, a simple algorithm can learn to comprehend an adult's utterance in the sense of producing the same sequence of predicates, even without mastering the adult's grammar.",
        "For example, receiving the utterance the blue square above the circle, the learner would be able to produce the sequence of predicates (bl, sq, ab, ci).",
        "In this paper we focus on the production task, using sequential and subsequential transducers to model both comprehension and production.",
        "Adult production can be modeled as converting a sequence of predicates into an utterance, which can be done with access to the meaning transducer for the adult's language.",
        "However, we do not assume that the child initially has access to the meaning transducer for the adult's language; instead we assume that the child's production progresses through different stages.",
        "Initially, child production is modeled as consisting of two different tasks: finding a correct sequence of predicates, and inverting the meaning function to produce a kind of \"telegraphic speech\".",
        "For example, from (gr, tr, le, sq) the child may produce green triangle left square.",
        "Our goal is to model how the learner might move from this telegraphic speech to speech that is grammatical in the adult's sense.",
        "Moreover, we would like to find a formal framework in which corrections (in form of expansions, for example, the green triangle to the left of the square) can be given to the child during the intermediate stages (before the learner is able to produce grammatically correct utterances) to study their effect on language learning.",
        "We thus propose to model the problem of child language production as a machine translation problem, that is, as the task of translating a sequence of predicate symbols (representing the meaning of an utterance) into a corresponding utterance in a natural language.",
        "In this paper we explore the possibility of applying existing automata-theoretic approaches to machine translation to model language production.",
        "In Section 2, we describe the use of subsequential transducers for machine translation tasks and review the OSTIA algorithm to learn them (Oncina, 1991).",
        "In Section 3, we present our model of how the learner can move from telegraphic to adult speech.",
        "In Section 4, we present the results of experiments in the model made using OSTIA.",
        "Discussion of these results is presented in Section 5 and ideas for future work are in Section 6."

        "Subsequential transducers (SSTs) are a formal model of translation widely studied in the literature.",
        "SSTs are deterministic finite state models that allow input-output mappings between languages.",
        "Each edge of an SST has an associated input symbol and output string.",
        "When an input string is accepted, an SST produces an output string that consists of concatenating the output substrings associated with sequence of edges traversed, together with the substring associated with the last state reached by the input string.",
        "Several phenomena in natural languages can be easily represented by means of SSTs, for example, the different orders of noun and adjective in Spanish and English (e.g., un cuadrado rojo - a red square).",
        "Formal and detailed definitions can be found in (Berstel, 1979).",
        "For any SST it is always possible to find an equivalent SST that has the output strings assigned to the edges and states so that they are as close to the initial state as they can be.",
        "This is called an Onward Subsequential Transducer (OST).",
        "It has been proved that SSTs are learnable in the limit from a positive presentation of sentence pairs by an efficient algorithm called OSTIA (Onward Subsequential Transducer Inference Algorithm) (Oncina, 1991).",
        "OSTIA takes as input a finite training set of input-output pairs of sentences, and produces as output an OST that generalizes the training pairs.",
        "The algorithm proceeds as follows (this description is based on (Oncina, 1998)):",
        "â€¢ A prefix tree representation of all the input sentences of the training set is built.",
        "Empty strings are assigned as output strings to both the internal nodes and the edges of this tree, and every output sentence of the training set is assigned to the corresponding leaf of the tree.",
        "The result is called a tree subsequential transducer.",
        "â€¢ An onward tree subsequential transducer equivalent to the tree subsequential transducer is constructed by moving the longest common prefixes of the output strings, level by level, from the leaves of the tree towards the root.",
        "â€¢ Starting from the root, all pairs of states of the onward tree subsequential transducer are considered in order, level by level, and are merged if possible (i.e., if the resulting transducer is subsequential and does not contradict any pair in the training set).",
        "SSTs and OSTIA have been successfully applied to different translation tasks: Roman numerals to their decimal representations, numbers written in English to their Spanish spelling (Oncina, 1991) and Spanish sentences describing simple visual scenes to corresponding English and German sentences (Castellanos et al., 1994).",
        "They have also been applied to language understanding tasks (Castellanos et al., 1993; Pieraccini et al., 1993).",
        "Moreover, several extensions of OSTIA have been introduced.",
        "For example, OSTIA-DR incorporates domain (input) and range (output) models in the learning process, allowing the algorithm to learn SSTs that accept only sentences compatible with the input model and produce only sentences compatible with the output model (Oncina and Varo, 1996).",
        "Experiments with a language understanding task gave better results with OSTIA-",
        "DR than with OSTIA (Castellanos et al., 1993).",
        "Another extension is DD-OSTIA (Oncina, 1998), which instead of considering a lexicographic order to merge states, uses a heuristic order based on a measure of the equivalence of the states.",
        "Experiments in (Oncina, 1998) show that better results can be obtained by using DD-OSTIA in certain translation tasks from Spanish to English."

        "As we have seen in the previous section, SSTs are an interesting approach to machine translation.",
        "Therefore, we explore the possibility of modeling language production using SSTs and OSTIA, to see whether they may provide a good framework to model corrections.",
        "As described in (Angluin and Becerra-Bonache, 2008), after learning the meaning function the learner is able to assign correct meanings to utterances, and therefore, given a situation and an utterance that denotes something in the situation, the learner is able to point correctly to the object denoted by the utterance.",
        "To simplify the task we consider, we make two assumptions about the learner at the start of the production phase: (1) the learner's lexicon represents a correct meaning function and (2) the learner can generate correct sequences of predicates.",
        "Therefore, in the initial stage of the production phase, the learner is able to produce a kind of \"telegraphic speech\" by inverting the lexicon constructed during the comprehension stage.",
        "For example, if the sequence of predicates is (bl, sq, ler, ci), and in the lexicon blue is mapped to bl, square to sq, right to ler and circle to ci, then by inverting this mapping, the learner would produce blue square right circle.",
        "In order to explore the capability of SSTs and OSTIA to model the next stage of language production (from telegraphic to adult speech), we take the training set to be input-output pairs each of which contains as input a sequence of predicates (e.g., (bl, sq, ler, ci)) and as output the corresponding utterance in a natural language (e.g., the blue square to the right of the circle).",

        "Looking at the sizes of the transducers learned by OSTIA and DD-OSTIA in the production task, we see that the numbers of states agree for all languages except Turkish.",
        "(Recall from our discussion in Section 4 that there may be differences in the behavior of the transducers learned by OSTIA and DD-OSTIA at convergence.)",
        "For the production task, Mandarin gives the smallest transducer; for this fragment of the language, the translation of correct predicate sequences into utterances can be achieved with a 1-state transducer.",
        "In contrast, English and Spanish both require 2 states to handle articles correctly.",
        "For example, in the transducer in Figure 3, the predicate for a circle (ci) is translated as el circulo if it occurs as the first object (in state 1) and as circulo if it occurs as second object (in state 2) because del has been supplied by the translation of the intervening binary relation (le, ler, or ab.)",
        "Greek gives the largest transducer for the production task, with 9 states, and requires the largest number of samples for DD-OSTIA to achieve convergence, and one of the largest numbers of samples for OSTIA.",
        "Despite the evidence of the extremes of Mandarin and Greek, the relation between the size of the transducer for a language and the number of samples required to converge to it is not monotonic.",
        "In our model, one reason that learning the production task may in general be more difficult than learning the comprehension task is that while the mapping of a word to a predicate does not depend on context, the mapping of a predicate to a word or words does (except in the case of our Mandarin transducer.)",
        "As an example, in the comprehension task the Russian words triugolnik, triugolnika and triugonikom are each mapped to the predicate tr, but the reverse mapping must be sensitive to the context of the occurrence of tr.",
        "These results suggest that OSTIA or DD-OSTIA may be an effective method to learn to translate sequences of predicates into natural language utterances in our domain.",
        "However, some of our objectives seem incompatible with the properties of OSTIA.",
        "In particular, it is not clear how to incorporate the learner's initial knowledge of the lexicon and ability to produce \"telegraphic speech\" by inverting the lexicon.",
        "Also, the intermediate results of the learning process do not seem to have the properties we expect of a learner who is progressing towards mastery of production.",
        "That is, the intermediate transducers perfectly translate the predicate sequences used to construct them, but typically produce other translations that the learner (using the lexicon) would know to be incorrect.",
        "For example, the intermediate transducer from Figure 1 translates the predicate sequence (ci) as el circulo a la izquierda del circulo verde, which the learner's lexicon indicates should be translated as (ci, le, ci, gr)."

        "Further experiments and analysis are required to understand how these results will scale with larger domains and languages.",
        "In this connection, it may be interesting to try the experiments of (Castel-lanos et al., 1993) in the reverse (production) direction.",
        "Finding a way to incorporate the learner's initial lexicon seems important.",
        "Perhaps by incorporating the learner's knowledge of the input domain (the legal sequences of predicates) and using the domain-aware version, OSTIA-D, the intermediate results in the learning process would be more compatible with our modeling objectives.",
        "Coping with errors will be necessary; perhaps an explicitly statistical framework for machine translation should be considered.",
        "If we can find an appropriate model of how the learner's language production process might evolve, then we will be in a position to model meaning-preserving corrections.",
        "That is, the learner chooses a sequence of predicates and maps it to a (flawed) utterance.",
        "Despite its flaws, the learner's utterance is understood by the teacher (i.e., the teacher is able to map it to the sequence of predicates chosen by the learner) and responds with a correction, that is, a correct utterance for that meaning.",
        "The learner, recognizing that the teacher's utterance has the same meaning but a different form, then uses the correct utterance (as well as the meaning and the incorrect utterance) to improve the mapping of sequences of predicates to utterances.",
        "It is clear that in this model, corrections are not necessary to the process of learning comprehension and production; once the learner has a correct lexicon, the utterances of the teacher can be translated into sequences of predicates, and the pairs of (predicate sequence, utterance) can be used to learn (via an appropriate variant of OSTIA) a perfect production mapping.",
        "However, it seems very likely that corrections can make the process of learning a production mapping easier or faster, and finding a model in which such phenomena can be studied remains an important goal of this work."
