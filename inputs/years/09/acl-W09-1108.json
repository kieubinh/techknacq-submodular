        "Comprehensive lexical resources for many domains and languages are essential for most NLP applications.",
        "One of the most utilized types of such resources is a repository of concepts: sets of lexical items sharing a significant aspect of their meanings (e.g., types of food, tool names, etc).",
        "While handcrafted concept databases (e.g., WordNet) are extensively used in NLP, manual compilation of such databases is labor intensive, error prone, and somewhat arbitrary.",
        "Hence, for many languages and domains great efforts have been made for automated construction of such databases from available corpora.",
        "While language-specific and domain-specific studies show significant success in development of concept discovery frameworks, the majority of domains and languages remain untreated.",
        "Hence there is a need for a framework that performs well for many diverse settings and is as unsupervised and language-independent as possible.",
        "Numerous methods have been proposed for seed-based concept extraction where a set of concept patterns (or rules), or a small set of seed words for each concept, is provided as input to the concept acquisition system.",
        "However, even simple definitions for concepts are not always available.",
        "To avoid requiring this type of input, a number of distributional and pattern-based methods have been proposed for fully unsupervised seedless acquisition of concepts from text.",
        "Pattern-based algorithms were shown to obtain high quality results while being highly efficient in comparison to distributional methods.",
        "Such fully unsupervised methods do not incorporate any language-specific parsers or taggers, so can be successfully applied to diverse languages.",
        "However, unsupervised pattern-based methods suffer from several weaknesses.",
        "Thus they are frequently restricted to single-word terms and are unable to discover multiword expressions in efficient and precise manner.",
        "They also usually ignore potentially useful part-of-speech and other syntactic information.",
        "In order to address these weaknesses, several studies utilize language-specific parsing or tagging systems in concept acquisition.",
        "Unfortunately, while improving results, this heavily affects the language-and domain-independence of such frameworks, and severely impacts efficiency since even shallow parsing is computationally demanding.",
        "In this paper we present a method to utilize the information induced by unsupervised parsers in an unsupervised pattern-based concept discovery framework.",
        "With the recent development of fast fully unsupervised parsers, it is now possible to add parser-based information to lexical patterns while keeping the language-independence of the whole framework and still avoiding heavy computational costs.",
        "Specifically, we incorporate the bracketings induced by the parser into the meta-patterns used by a symmetric patterns and graph-based unsupervised concept discovery algorithm.",
        "We performed a thorough evaluation on two English corpora (the BNC and a 68GB web corpus) and on a 33GB Russian corpus.",
        "Evaluations were done using both human judgments and WordNet, in similar settings as that of the leading unsupervised previous work.",
        "Our results show that utilization of unsupervised parser both improves the assignment of single-word terms to concepts and allows high-precision discovery and assignment of ofmultiword expressions to concepts."

      "text": [
        "Much work has been done on lexical acquisition of all sorts and the acquisition of concepts in particular.",
        "Concept acquisition methods differ in the type of corpus annotation and other human input used, and in their basic algorithmic approach.",
        "Some methods directly aim at concept acquisition, while the direct goal in some is the construction of hyponym ('is-a') hierarchies.",
        "A subtree in such a hierarchy can be viewed as defining a concept.",
        "A major algorithmic approach is to represent word contexts as vectors in some space and use distributional measures and clustering in that space.",
        "Pereira (1993), Curran (2002) and Lin (1998) use syntactic features in the vector definition.",
        "(Pantel and Lin, 2002) improves on the latter by clustering by committee.",
        "Caraballo (1999) uses conjunction and appositive annotations in the vector representation.",
        "Several studies avoid requiring any syntactic annotation.",
        "Some methods are based on decomposition of a lexically-defined matrix (by SVD, PCA etc), e.g. (Schütze, 1998; Deerwester et al., 1990).",
        "While great effort has been made for improving the computational complexity of distributional methods (Gorman and Curran, 2006), they still remain highly computationally intensive in comparison to pattern approaches (see below), and most of them do not scale well for very large datasets.",
        "The second main approach is to use lexico-syntactic patterns.",
        "Patterns have been shown to produce more accurate results than feature vectors, at a lower computational cost on large corpora (Pan-tel et al., 2004).",
        "Since (Hearst, 1992), who used a manually prepared set of initial lexical patterns, numerous pattern-based methods have been proposed for the discovery of concepts from seeds.",
        "Other studies develop concept acquisition for on-demand tasks where concepts are defined by user-provided seeds.",
        "Many of these studies utilize information obtained by language-specific parsing and named entity recognition tools (Dorow et al., 2005).",
        "Pantel et al.",
        "(2004) reduce the depth of linguistic data used, but their method requires POS tagging.",
        "TextRunner (Banko et al., 2007) utilizes a set of pattern-based seedless strategies in order to extract relational tuples from text.",
        "However, this system contains many language-specific modules, including the utilization of a parser in one of the processing stages.",
        "Thus the majority of the existing pattern-based concept acquisition systems rely on pattern/word seeds or supervised language-specific tools, some of which are very inefficient.",
        "Davidov and Rappoport (2006) developed a framework which discovers concepts based on high frequency words and symmetry-based pattern graph properties.",
        "This framework allows a fully unsupervised seedless discovery of concepts without relying on language-specific tools.",
        "However, it completely ignores potentially useful syntactic or morphological information.",
        "For example, the pattern 'X and his Y' is useful for acquiring the concept of family member types, as in \"his siblings and his parents'.",
        "Without syntactic information, it can capture noise, as in \"... in ireland) and his wife)\" (parentheses denote syntactic constituent boundaries).",
        "As another example, the useful symmetric pattern \"either X or Y\" can appear in both good examples (\"choose either Chihuahua or Collie.\")",
        "and bad ones (\"either Collie or Australian Bulldog\").",
        "In the latter case, the algorithm both captures noise (\"Australlian\" is now considered as a candidate for the 'dog type' concept), and misses the discovery of a valid multiword candidate (\"Australlian Bulldog\").",
        "While symmetry-based filtering greatly reduces such noise, the basic problem remains.",
        "As a result, incorporating at least some parsing information in a language-independent and efficient manner could be beneficial.",
        "Unsupervised parsing has been explored for several decades (see (Clark, 2001; Klein, 2005) for recent reviews).",
        "Recently, unsupervised parsers have for the first time outperformed the right branching heuristic baseline for English.",
        "These include",
        "Bod, 2007), an exemplar based approach (Dennis, 2005), guiding EM using contrastive estimation (Smith and Eisner, 2006), and the incremental parser of Seginer (2007) which we use here.",
        "These works learn an unlabeled syntactic structure, dependency or constituency.",
        "In this work we use constituency trees as our syntactic representation.",
        "Another important factor in concept acquisition is the source of textual data used.",
        "To take advantage of the rapidly expanding web, many of the proposed frameworks utilize web queries rather than local corpora (Etzioni et al., 2005; Davidov et al., 2007; Paşca and Van Durme, 2008; Davidov and Rappoport, 2009).",
        "While these methods have a definite practical advantage of dealing with the most recent and comprehensive data, web-based evaluation has some methodological drawbacks such as limited repeatability (Kilgarriff, 2007).",
        "In this study we apply our framework on offline corpora in settings similar to that of previous work, in order to be able to make proper comparisons."

        "This parser has advantages in three major aspects relevant to this paper.",
        "First, it achieves state of the art unsupervised parsing performance: its F-score is 75.9% for sentences of up to 10 words from the PennTreebank and 59% for sentences of the same length from the German NEGRA (Brants, 1997) corpus.",

        "Our Pentium 2.8GHB machines with 4GHB RAM can store in memory the lexicon created by up to 0.2M sentences.",
        "We thus divided our corpora to batches of 0.2M sentences and parsed each of them separately.",
        "Note that in this setup parsing quality might be even better than the quality reported in (Seginer, 2007), since in the setup reported in that paper the parser was applied to a few thousand sentences only.",

        "The parsing algorithm creates the common-cover links structure of a sentence in an incremental manner.",
        "This means that the parser reads the words of a sentence one after the other and, as each word is read, it is only allowed to add links that have one of their ends at that words (and update existing ones).",
        "Words which have not yet been read are not available to the parser at this stage.",
        "This restriction is inspired by psycholinguistics research which suggests that humans process language incrementally.",
        "This results in a significant restriction of the parser's search space, which is the reason it is so fast.",
        "During its initial stage the parser builds a lexicon containing, for each word, statistics helping the decision of whether to link that word to other words.",
        "The lexicon is updated as any new sentence is read.",

        "The 50 triplets were obtained as follows.",
        "We have randomly selected 40 concept pairs (C+,C): C+ in P+ and C in P using five following restrictions: (1) concepts should contain at least 10 words; (2) for a selected pair, C+ should share at least half of its single-word terms with C, and C should share at least half of its words with C+; (3) C+ should contain at least 3 MWEs; (4) C should contain at least 3 words not appearing in C+; (5) C+ should contain at least 3 single-word terms not appearing in C.",
        "These restrictions allow to select concept pairs such that C+ is similar to C while they still carry enough differences which can be examined.",
        "We selected the triplets as following: for pairs (C+, C) ten triplets include terms appearing in both C+ and C (Both column in Table 2), ten triplets include singleword terms appearing in C+ but not C (P+ single column), ten triplets include single-word terms appearing in C but not C+ (P column), ten triplets include MWEs appearing in C+ (P+ mwe column) and ten triplets include random terms obtained from P+ concepts (Rand column).",
        "Table 2: Results of evaluation by human judgment of three data sets.",
        "P+ single/mwe: single-word/MWE terms existing only in P+ concept; P: single-word terms existing only in P concept; Both: terms existing in both concepts; Rand: random terms.",
        "See text for detailed explanations.",
        "The first part of Table 2 gives the average percentage of triplets that were given scores of 1 or 2 (that is, 'significant shared meaning').",
        "The second part gives the average score of a triplet (1 is best).",
        "In these lines scores of 5 were not counted.",
        "Inter-evaluator Kappa between scores are 0.68/0.75/0.76 for DMOZ, BNC and Russian respectively.",
        "We can see that terms selected by P and skipped by P+ receive low scores, at the same time even singleword terms selected by P+ and skipped by P show very high scores.",
        "This shows that using parser data, the proposed framework can successfully avoid selection of erroneous terms, while discovering high-quality terms missed by P. We can also see that P+ performance on MWEs, while being slightly inferior to the one for single-word terms, still achieves results comparable to those of single-word terms.",
        "Thus our algorithm can greatly improve the results not only by discovering of MWEs but also by improving the set of single word concept terms.",
        "WordNet-based evaluation.",
        "The major guideline in this part of the evaluation was to compare our results with previous work (Davidov and Rappoport, 2006; Widdows and Dorow, 2002) without the possible bias of human evaluation.",
        "We have followed their methodology as best as we could, using the same WordNet (WN) categories and the same corpora.",
        "This also allows indirect comparison to several other studies, thus (Widdows and Dorow, 2002) reports results for an LSA-based clustering algorithm that are vastly inferior to the pattern-based ones.",
        "The evaluation method is as follows.",
        "We took the exact 10 WN subsets referred to as 'subjects' in (Widdows and Dorow, 2002), and removed all multiword items.",
        "We then selected at random 10 pairs of words from each subject.",
        "For each pair, we found the largest of our discovered concepts containing it.",
        "The various morphological forms or clear typos of the same word were treated as one in the evaluation.",
        "We have improved the evaluation framework for Russian by using the Russian WordNet (Gelfenbey-nand et al., 2003) instead of back-translations as done in (Davidov and Rappoport, 2006).",
        "Preliminary examination shows that this has no apparent effect on the results.",
        "For each found concept C containing N words, we computed the following: (1) Precision: the number of words present in both C and WN divided by N; (2) Precision*: the number of correct words divided by N. Correct words are either words that appear in the WN subtree, or words whose entry in the American Heritage Dictionary or the Britannica directly defines them as belonging to the given class (e.g., 'murder' is defined as 'a crime').",
        "This was done in order to overcome the relative poorness of WN; (3) Recall: the number of words present in both C and WN divided by the number of words in WN; (4) The percentage of correctly discovered words (according to Precision*) that are not in WN.",

        "Hence, windowing could be relaxed allowing to obtain more data with sufficiently high precision.",

        "We can see that while windowing is still essential even with available parser data, using this data we can significantly reduce windowing requirements, allowing us to discover more concepts from the same data.",
        "Timing requirements are modest, considering we parsed such large amounts of data.",
        "BNC parsing took 45 minutes, and the total single-machine processing time for the 68Gb DMOZ corpus was 4 days.",
