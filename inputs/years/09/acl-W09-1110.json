        "This trend is not surprising as a primary motivation for machine learning solutions is to reduce the manual effort required to achieve state of the art performance.",
        "However, one notable advantage ofdiscrimi-native classifiers is the capacity to encode arbitrarily complex features, which partially accounts for their popularity.",

        "In this context, a lexical feature provides one bit of information to the prediction function while a SRWL feature provides information content proportional to its SRWL entropy H(W).",
        "To study one aspect of this phenomena empirically, we examine the rate at which words are first encountered in our training corpus from Section 4, as shown by Figure 3.",
        "The first observation is the usefulness of SRWL feature abstraction in general as we see that when including an entire SRWL from (Pantel and Lin, 2002) whenever the first element of the list is encountered, we cover the unigram vocabulary much more rapidly.",
        "The second observation is that when sentences are presented in the order of the average SRWL entropy of their words, this coverage rate is further accelerated.",

        "There has been significant recent work on designing learning algorithms which attempt to reduce annotation requirements through a more sophisticated annotation method.",
        "These methods allow the annotator to directly specify information about the feature space in addition to providing labels, which is then incorporated into the learning algorithm (Huang and Mitchell, 2006; Raghavan and Allan, 2007; Zaidan et al., 2007; Druck et al., 2008; Zaidan and Eisner, 2008).",
        "Additionally, there has been recent work using explanation-based learning techniques to encode a more expressive feature space (Lim et al., 2007).",
        "Amongst these works, the only interactive learning protocol is (Raghavan and Allan, 2007) where instances are presented to an expert and features are labeled which are then emphasized by the learning algorithm.",
        "Thus, in this case, although additional information is provided the feature space itself remains static.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this is the irst work that interactively modiies the feature space by abstracting the FGFs."

        "This work introduces the interactive feature space construction protocol, where the learning algorithm selects examples for which the feature space is believed to be deicient and uses existing semantic resources in coordination with a domain expert to abstract lexical features with their SRWL names.",
        "While the power of SRWL abstraction in terms of sample complexity is evident, incorporating this information is fraught with pitfalls regarding the introduction of additional ambiguity.",
        "This interactive protocol inds examples for which the domain expert will recognize promising semantic abstractions and for which those semantic abstraction will significantly improve the performance of the learner.",
        "We demonstrate the effectiveness of this protocol on a named entity and relation extraction system.",
        "As a relatively new direction, there are many possibilities for future work.",
        "The most immediate task is effectively quantifying interaction costs with a user study, including the impact of including users with varying levels of expertise.",
        "Recent work on modeling the costs of the active learning protocol (Settles et al., 2009; Haertel et al., 2009) provides some insight on modeling costs associated with interactive learning protocols.",
        "A second potentially interesting direction would be to incorporate other semantic resources such as lexical patterns (Hearst, 1992) or Wikipedia-generated gazetteers (Toral and Murioz, 2006)."
