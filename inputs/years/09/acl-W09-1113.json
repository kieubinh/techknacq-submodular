        "Any person engaged in normal skilled reading produces an alternating series of rapid eye movements and brief fixations that forms a rich and detailed behavioral record of the reading process.",
        "In the last few decades a great deal of experimental evidence has accumulated to suggest that the eye movements of readers are reflective of ongoing language processing and thus provide a useful source of information for making inferences about the linguistic processes involved in reading (Clifton et al., 2007).",
        "In psycholinguistic research, eye movement data is now commonly used to study how experimental manipulations of linguistic stimuli manifest themselves in the eye movement record.",
        "Another related strand of research primarily attempts to understand what determines when and where the eyes move during reading.",
        "This line of research has led to mathematically well specified accounts of eye movement control in reading being instantiated as computational models (Legge et al., 1997; Reichle et al., 1998; Salvucci, 2001; Engbert et al., 2002; McDonald et al., 2005; Feng, 2006; Reilly and Radach, 2006; Yang, 2006).",
        "(For a recent overview, see (Reichle, 2006).)",
        "These models receive text as input and produce predictions for the location and duration of eye fixations, in approximation to human reading behavior.",
        "Although there are substantial differences between the various models, they typically combine both mechanisms of visuo-motor control and linguistic processing.",
        "Two important points of divergence concern the extent to which language processing influences eye movements and whether readers process information from more than one word at a time (Starr and Rayner, 2001).",
        "More generally, the models that have emerged to date are based on different sets of assumptions about the underlying perceptual and cognitive mechanisms that control eye movements.",
        "The most influential model so far, the E-Z Reader model (Reichle et al., 1998; Reichle et al., 2003; Pollatsek et al., 2006), rests on the assumptions that cognitive / lexical processing is the engine that drives the eyes through the text and that words are identified serially, one at a time.",
        "Although eye movement models typically have parameters that are fitted to empirical data sets, they are not based on machine learning in the standard sense and their predictions are hardly ever tested on unseen data.",
        "Moreover, their predictions are normally averaged over a whole group of readers or words belonging to a given frequency class.",
        "In this study, however, we investigate whether saccadic eye movements during reading can be modeled using machine learning.",
        "The task we propose is to learn to predict the eye movements of an individual reader reading a specific text, using as training data the eye movements recorded for the same person reading other texts.",
        "Predicting the eye movements of an individual reader on new texts is arguably a hard problem, and we therefore restrict the task to predicting word-based fixations (but not the duration of these fixations) and focus on a first pilot experiment investigating whether we can outperform a reasonable baseline on this task.",
        "More precisely, we present experimental results for a transition-based model, using a log-linear classifier, and show that the model significantly outperforms the baseline of always predicting the most frequent saccade.",
        "In addition, we show that even this simple model is able to capture frequency effects on eye movements observed in human readers.",
        "We want to emphasize that the motivation for this modeling experiment is not to advance the state of the art in computational modeling of eye movements during reading.",
        "For this our model is far too crude and limited in scope.",
        "The goal is rather to propose a novel approach to the construction and evaluation of such models, based on machine learning and model assessment on unseen data.",
        "In doing this, we want to establish a reasonable baseline for future research by evaluating a simple model with a restricted set of features.",
        "In future studies, we intend to investigate how results can be improved by introducing more complex models as well as a richer feature space.",
        "More generally, the machine learning approach explored here places emphasis on modeling eye movement behavior with few a priori assumptions about underlying cognitive and physiological mechanisms.",
        "The rest of the paper is structured as follows.",
        "Section 2 provides a brief background on basic characteristics of eye movements in reading.",
        "The emphasis is on saccadic eye movements rather than on temporal aspects of fixations.",
        "Section 3 defines the novel task of learning to predict fixations during reading and discusses different evaluation metrics for this task.",
        "Section 4 presents a transition-based model for solving this task, using a log-linear classifier to predict the most probable transition after each fixation.",
        "Section 5 presents experimental results for the model using data from the Dundee corpus (Kennedy and Pynte, 2005), and Section 6 contains conclusions and suggestions for future research."

        "Perhaps contrary to intuition, the eyes of readers do not move smoothly across a line or page of text.",
        "It is a salient fact in reading research that the eyes make a series of very rapid ballistic movements (called saccades) from one location to another.",
        "In between saccades, the eyes remain relatively stationary for brief periods of time (fixations).",
        "Most fixations last about 200-300 ms but there is considerable variability, both between and within readers.",
        "Thus, some fixations last under 100 ms while others last over 500 ms (Rayner, 1998).",
        "Much of the variability in fixation durations appears associated to processing ease or difficulty.",
        "The number of characters that is within the region of effective vision on any fixation is known as the perceptual span.",
        "For English readers, the perceptual span extends approximately four characters to the left and fifteen characters to the right of the fixation.",
        "Although readers fixate most words in a text, many words are also skipped.",
        "Approximately 85% of the content words are fixated and 35% of the function words (Carpenter and Just, 1983).",
        "Variables known to influence the likelihood of skipping a word are word length, frequency and predictability.",
        "Thus, more frequent words in the language are skipped more often than less frequent words.",
        "This is true also when word length is controlled for.",
        "Similarly, words that occur in constrained contexts (and are thus more predictable) are skipped more often than words in less constrained contexts.",
        "Although the majority of saccades in reading is relatively local, i.e., target nearby words, more distant saccades also occur.",
        "Most saccades move the eyes forward approximately 7-9 character spaces.",
        "Approximately 15% of the saccades, however, are regressions, in which the eyes move back to earlier parts of the text (Rayner, 1998).",
        "It has long been established that the length of saccades is influenced by both the length of the fixated word and the word to the right of the fixation (O'Regan, 1979).",
        "Regressions often go back one or two words, but occasionally they stretch further back.",
        "Such backward movements are often thought to reflect linguistic processing difficulty, e.g., because of syntactic parsing problems.",
        "Readers, however, are often unaware of making regressions, especially shorter ones."

For example, the text Mary had a lit-tie lamb is represented by T = (Mary, had, a, little, lamb); a reading of this text where the sequence of fixations is Mary - little - Mary - lamb is represented by F = (1, 4,1, 5); and the corresponding fixation set is S(F) = {1, 4, 5}.",

The training data consist of fixation sequences F1,..., Fk for reading events distinct from E involving the same person P but different texts T1;..., Tk.",

        "Table 2 shows the fixation accuracy, and precision, recall and Fl for fixations and skips, for each of the ten different models and the average across all models (bottom row).",
        "Fixation accuracy is compared to the baseline of always predicting the most frequent saccade type (Progress(2) for readers a and e, and Progress(l) for the rest).",
        "If we consider the fixation accuracy, we see that all models improve substantially on the baseline models.",
        "The mean difference between models and baselines is highly significant (p < .001, paired t-test).",
        "The relative improvement ranges from 4.4 percentage points in the worst case (model of reader f) to 20.1 percentage points in the best case (model of reader e).",
        "The highest scoring model, the model of reader d, has an accuracy of 78.9%.",
        "The lowest scoring model, the model of reader g, has an accuracy of 56.6%.",
        "This is also the reader for whom there is the smallest number of sentences in the test data (129), which means that a large number of sentences were removed prior to testing because of the greater number of non-local saccades made by this reader.",
        "Thus, this reader has an unusually varied saccadic behaviour which is particularly hard to model.",
        "Comparing the precision and recall for fixation and skips, we see that while precision tends to be about the same for both categories (with a few notable exceptions), recall is consistently higher for fixations than for skips.",
        "We believe that this is due to a tendency of the model to overpredict fixations, especially for low-frequency words.",
        "This has a great impact on the F1 measure (unweighted harmonic mean of precision and recall), which is considerably higher for fixations than for skips.",
        "Figure 1 shows the distributions of fixations grouped by reader and model.",
        "The models appear reasonably good at adapting to the empirical fixation distribution of individual readers.",
        "However, the models typically tend to look at more words than the readers, as noted above.",
        "This suggests that the models lack sufficient information to learn to skip words more often.",
        "This might be overcome by introducing features that further encourage skipping of words.",
        "In addition to word length and word frequency, that are already accounted for, n-gram probability could be included as a measure of predictability, for example.",
        "We also note that there is a strong linear relation between the capability of fitting the empirical distribution well and achieving high fixation accuracy (Pearson's r: -0.91, as measured by taking the differences of each pair of distributions and correlating them with the fixation accuracy of the models).",
        "Figure 2 shows the mean observed and predicted fixation and skipping probability as a function of word frequency class, averaged over all readers.",
        "As seen here, model prediction is responsive to frequency class in a fashion comparable to the readers, although the predictions typically tend to exaggerate the observed frequency effect.",
        "In the lower to medium classes (1-3), almost every word is fixated.",
        "Then there is a clear drop in fixation probability for words in frequency class 4 which fits well with the observed fixation probability.",
        "Finally there is another drop in fixation probability for the most frequent words (5).",
        "The skipping probabilities for the different classes show the corresponding reverse trend."

        "In this paper we have defined a new machine learning task where the goal is to learn the saccadic eye movement behavior of individual readers in order to predict the sequence of word fixations for novel reading events.",
        "We have discussed different evaluation metrics for this task, and we have established a first benchmark by training and evaluating a simple transition-based model using a log-linear classifier to predict the next transition.",
        "The evaluation shows that even this simple model, with features limited to a few relevant properties in a small context window, outperforms a majority baseline and captures some of the word frequency effects on eye movements observed in human readers.",
        "This pilot study opens up a number of directions for future research.",

        "For example, given the sequential nature of the task, it seems natural to explore probabilistic sequence models such as HMMs (see for example Feng (2006)).",
        "With respect to evaluation, we need to develop metrics that are sensitive to the sequential behavior of models, such as the fixation sequence similarity measure discussed in Section 3, and investigate to what extent results can be generalized across readers.",
        "With respect to the task itself, we need to introduce additional aspects of the reading process, in particular the duration of fixations.",
        "By pursuing these lines of research, we should be able to gain a better understanding of how machine learning methods in eye movement modeling can inform and advance current theories and models in reading and psycholinguistic research."
