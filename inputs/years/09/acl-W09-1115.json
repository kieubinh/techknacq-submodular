        "Automatic generation of slide presentations is a task the Computational Linguistics community has not yet pursued in much depth.",
        "A robust system capable of generating slide presentations from papers would save the author much tedium when organizing her presentations.",
        "In this paper we investigate this task from a novel perspective.",
        "While others have developed interesting approaches to slide generation from documents by modeling the problem in a unique way (Utiyama and Hasida, 1999; Shibata and Kuro-hashi, 2005), the aim of the research this paper initiates is to discover how humans create slide presentations, focusing more specifically on academic papers.",
        "Thus we take a corpus-based approach to the problem, and as a first step focus on the task of automatically aligning slide presentations to academic papers.",
        "We built a corpus of 296 slide-paper pairs and implemented four slide to paper aligners which utilize popular information retrieval methods such as TF-IDF term weighting and query expansion.",
        "In this paper we show that, in this application, TF-IDF term weighting is inferior to a simpler scoring mechanism based only on the number of matched terms and query expansion degrades aligner performance.",

        "Shibata and Kurohashi (2005) convert Japanese documents to slide representation by parsing their discourse structures and representing the resulting tree in an outline format.",
        "While (Utiyama and Hasida, 1999) and (Shibata and Kurohashi, 2005) generate slides from documents by modeling the task in creative ways, we aim to learn something deeper regarding how humans actually go about the task.",
        "Creating a corpus of slide/paper pairs will enable us to study the intricacies involved in how real humans approach this task.",
        "Our current focus is slide to paper (region) alignment, which can be categorized best as alignment between monolingual comparable corpora, but",

        "Barzilay and El-hadad (2003) incorporate context to facilitate alignment between monolingual comparable corpora by first learning paragraph matching rules in a supervised way, and then refining the alignment at the sentence level within paragraphs.",
        "Nelken and Shieber (2008) used TF-IDF term weighting with logistic regression to align sentences from pericopes in the gospels of the new testament.",
        "Callan (1994) analyzed various ways to define document passages and identified three main passage types, discourse (based on physical structure of the document), semantic (based on topic boundaries), and window (based on token distance) and suggests that while discourse passages may be an attractive way to define and retrieve document passages, due to reasons related to sloppy writing, visual aids, or other factors, paragraph boundaries may not be the best indicators of content boundaries.",
        "Our alignment task differs from that of (Barzilay and Elhadad, 2003) and (Nelken and Shieber, 2008) in two ways.",
        "First, Barzilay align like-chunks between the two documents.",
        "That is, they are either aligning sentences to sentences or paragraphs to paragraphs.",

        "Second, Barzilay and working with comparable corpora in which the same information is assumed to be present in each document, but expressed in a different way.",
        "We are not able to necessarily make this assumption, in fact we show in this paper that as much as half of the information in slide presentations may not be present in the corresponding paper.",
        "The concept of query expansion that we implement in some of our aligners is also not new.",

        "Workshop proceedings are an ideal source for our data because they often provide the papers and slide presentations side-by-side.",
        "Using this strategy, we manually extracted 296 slide-paper pairs.",
        "The papers were downloaded in PDF format and the slides were a mixture of PDF and Powerpoint formats.",
        "Before working with these files, we converted them to a custom XML format which represents relevant parts of the original data as logical regions.",
        "In the case of slides, regions include bullets, headings, and other text spans.",
        "In the case of papers, regions include regions (or passages) which correspond to paragraphs, section headings, and list items.",
        "To work with PDF data, we convert it to a custom XML format which represents logical chunks or regions of the paper.",
        "In our approach we delimit regions by orthographic boundaries.",
        "Orthographic boundaries delimit the physical structure of a paper and describe the paper in a physical fashion in terms of paragraphs, headings, bullets, etc.",
        "We do recognize that there are other ways to define paper regions though.",
        "As Callan (1994) observes, academic papers could also be represented via semantic boundaries which delimit the topical structure of papers and describe them in terms of where new topics are introduced and where old ones are no longer discussed.",
        "We prefer using orthographic boundaries in our approach for two reasons.",
        "First, detecting orthographic boundaries can be accomplished with simple heuristics while topic boundary detection requires more sophisticated methods, thus implementation is easier.",
        "Second, because orthographic boundaries are far less subjective than topic boundaries, it's easier to verify the validity of orthographic boundaries than semantic ones.",
        "Preprocessing Powerpoint files is significantly simpler than PDF files.",
        "To convert the Powerpoint data to our custom XML, we first convert the Powerpoint file to an OpenOffice.org3 ODP file via the document converter tool that comes standard with OpenOffice.",
        "ODP files are already encoded with a rich XML which already describes physical regions such as list items, bullets, and other text, so region identification is unnecessary.",

        "A complete alignment module would thus need to be able to discern if the information in a region comes from the target paper or if it does not.",
        "When it does, the task of the aligner is then to choose the region in the paper that is summarized or from which the excerpt is taken.",
        "Our original hypothesis was that the vast majority of the data in a given slide presentation would come from the target paper and concluded that a reasonable first attempt at building an aligner could be made under this assumption.",
        "We approach the task of aligning slide regions to paper regions with methods popular in information retrieval.",
        "When aligning a slide region to a paper region, we treat the slide region as a search query and the target regions as documents in the information retrieval sense.",
        "We compare two TF-IDF based scoring methods and the effect of query expansion by building four different aligners, each of which corresponds to one combination of scoring type and usage of query expansion.",
        "Table 1 shows a diagram indicating which aligners have which features.",
        "To prepare both the slide region and paper for alignment, certain preprocessing tasks are executed by all our aligners.",
        "The general procedure all our aligners follow is outlined below:",
        "1.",
        "For each token in each region in the paper, the token's TF-IDF score is calculated, where the token's term frequency is the frequency of the token's stem in the region and the term's document frequency is the number of regions containing the token's stem.",
        "2.",
        "The slide region is tokenized and part-of-speech tagged with the SNoW tagger (Roth, 1998) and noncontent words are removed.",
        "We consider content words to be any token which is either a noun, adjective, verb, adverb, or cardinal number.",

        "Scoring method 2 is implemented by aligners C and D and is based on the quantity of matched terms, reverting to scoring method 1 only in the case of a tie.",
        "Thus, to calculate the score for a slide region relative to a target paper region with method 2, the number of search terms with non-zero TF-IDF scores for the paper region is counted and the region with the largest number of such search terms wins.",

        "Query expansion is one way to consider terms which are semantically near, but orthographically different from the search terms.",

        "Our implementation of query expansion is utilized by aligners B and D and uses Wordnet (Fellbaum, 1998) to extract synonyms of search terms.",
        "When a slide region undergoes query expansion our aligner executes the following steps:",

        "Collectively, these four presentations with their respective papers amount to 587 alignment decisions which were evaluated according to the following guidelines.",
        "If the slide region is either an excerpt from the chosen paper region or if the slide region is an abstract of the chosen paper region, the alignment is judged as good.",
        "In cases where the matching excerpt or abstract text spans more than one paper region, the alignment is judged as good if the aligner selected any of the involved regions.",
        "Otherwise, the alignment is judged as bad and an error code is recorded.",
        "The three error codes we utilize are BR, NR, and ER.",
        "BR is short for \"better region\" and indicates that the alignment is bad because the chosen paper region is not the paper region from which the slide region is extracted or generated, but such a region does indeed exist.",
        "NR is short for \"no region\" and indicates that the alignment is bad because there is no region in the paper to which the slide region should be aligned.",
        "ER is short for \"existing region\" and indicates that the alignment is bad because the aligner decided there was no paper region to which the slide region should be aligned, but in fact there was.",
        "Also, the type of each slide region was recorded as either frontmatter (which covers text spans such as titles, authors, dates, and addresses), outline, heading, bullet, or diagram.",
        "Table 2 illustrates the composition of the four presentations insofar as slide region type is concerned.",
        "The distribution of slide region types is not surprising.",
        "Table 2 shows that two of our presentations included diagrams and the other two did not, and that bullets not surprisingly account for more slide regions than any other region type.",
        "Table 3 shows the percentage of slide regions which have a target paper region (i.e. the percentage of alignable slide regions).",
        "One surprising observation is that only about half (57%) of the slide bullets were alignable.",

        "Raw accuracy is the number of slide regions correctly aligned out of the total number of slide regions.",
        "Alignable accuracy is the percentage of alignable slide regions which were aligned correctly.",
        "Given the surprising results that a large percentage of slide regions need not come from the paper, any fully fledged slide to paper aligner would need a module which first filters out the unalignable slide regions.",
        "Because such a module is not implemented in our aligners, as our aligners make the assumption that each slide region has a corresponding paper region, we limit most of our accuracy evaluation to alignable accuracy rather than raw accuracy.",
        "From tables 4 and 5 we can easily see the importance of such a filtering module.",
        "As our best aligner, which achieves an average alignable accuracy of 75%, only achieves an average raw accuracy of50%.",
        "Tables 6 and 7 show what percentage of an aligner's errors correspond to which error types.",
        "Because our aligners are based on term matching, the only way for them to predict no alignment is for the average TF-IDF score of the terms to be zero (no matching terms anywhere).",
        "Because this is a very rare event, ER-type errors are also extremely rare, and are excluded from our error analysis.",
        "We can see from tables 6 and 7 that our poorer aligners (A and B) have a fairly even split between BR-type and NR-type errors, while our better aligners (C and D) have a far greater percentage of NR-type errors, indicating that the features we are investigating can only reduce BR-type errors.",
        "This verifies the importance of the proposed alignability module which first filters out unalignable slide regions.",
        "Tables 8 and 9 analyze how well query expansion and scoring method 2 reduce errors by measuring the percentage of errors made by one aligner, which were not made by another.",
        "Four pairings of aligners are considered: A and B, A and C, B and D, and C and D. By comparing aligner A to B and C to D, we have one measure of the error reduction achieved by adding query expansion to an aligner.",
        "If the addition of query expansion enables an aligner to correctly align slide regions which its query expansion-less counterpart could not, then we should see large percentages of errors being corrected when comparing aligner A to B and C to D. By comparing aligner A to C and B to D, we have a measure of the error reduction achieved by implementing scoring method 2 instead of method 1.",
        "Tables 8 and 9 show that aligner D significantly reduced aligner B's errors and aligner C significantly reduced aligner A's errors, but aligner B did not improve much on A, nor did D on C. In other words, adding query expansion did not significantly reduce errors, but using scoring method 2 instead of 1 did."

Synonyms are semantically closer to the original term than hypernyms, hyponyms, or other semantically related terms, and our results show that introducing this small amount of semantic distance is (a little bit) detrimental.",

        "NR-type errors, meaning the alignment was bad because the system selected a paper region when in fact there was no correct paper region.",
        "A robust slide to paper aligner would need to have a module capable of filtering out unalignable slide regions.",
        "If this task were solved and implemented on our better aligners, raw accuracy would raise from 50% to about 75% on average which is nearing the level of robustness necessary for real-world applications.",
        "We also suggest that, in regard to alignable slide regions, performance would be significantly boosted by taking context into account, both on the slide and paper side.",
        "We noticed during evaluation that many of the BR-type errors occurred when the slide region in question lacked the necessary terms, but the terms existed in nearby slide regions.",
        "Examples of this include when for instance, the title is broken across two lines and the second line only has a word or two in it, or when a heading is rather non-descriptive but the sub-bullets beneath it contain many relevant terms to the topic.",
        "Incorporating terms of nearby slide regions (perhaps in query-expansion fashion), rather than just treating each one as an independent search query will certainly boost performance.",
        "Likewise on the paper end, it is reasonable to assume that in most cases, the topic of one region is similar to the topics of adjacent regions.",
