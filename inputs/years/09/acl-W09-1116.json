        "Pronoun resolution systems need the knowledge of noun gender that advises that Glen is usually masculine (and thus referred to by he) while Glenda is feminine.",
        "English third-person pronouns are grouped in four gender/number categories: masculine (he, his, him, himself), feminine (she, her, herself), neutral (it, its, itself), and plural (they, their, them, themselves).",
        "We broadly refer to these gender and number classes simply as gender.",
        "The objective of our work is to correctly assign gender to English noun tokens, in context; to determine which class of pronoun will refer to a given noun.",
        "One successful approach to this problem is to build a statistical gender model from a noun's association with pronouns in text.",

        "English differs from other languages like French and German in that gender is not an inherent grammatical property of an English noun, but rather a property of a real-world entity that is being referred to.",
        "A common noun like lawyer can be (semanti-cally) masculine in one document and feminine in another.",
        "While previous statistical gender models learn gender for noun types only, we use document context to correctly determine the current gender class of noun tokens, making dynamic decisions on common nouns like lawyer and ambiguous names like Ford.",
        "Furthermore, if a noun type has not yet been observed (an unknown word), previous approaches cannot estimate the gender.",
        "Our system, on the other hand, is able to correctly determine that unknown words corroborators and propeller-heads are plural, while Pope Formosus is masculine, using learned contextual and morphological cues.",
        "Our approach is based on the key observation that while gender information from noun-pronoun cooccurrence provides imperfect noun coverage, it can nevertheless provide rich and accurate training data for a large-scale discriminative classifier.",

        "The relative value of the context and type-based features is now reversed: using only context-based features (Context-Semi) achieves 92.4%, while using only type-based features (Type-Semi) achieves 91.3%.",
        "This is because much of the type information is already implicit in the PathGender counts.",
        "The Type-Auto predictions contribute little information, only fragmenting the data and leading to over-training and lower accuracy.",
        "on the other hand, the Context-Auto predictions improve accuracy, as these scores provide orthogonal and hence helpful information for the semi-supervised classifier.",
        "Combining Full-Auto with our enhanced path gender counts, PathGender+, results in the overall best performance, 95.5% for Full-Semi, significantly better than PathGender+ alone.",
        "This is a 50% error reduction over the PathGender system, strongly confirming the benefit of our semi-supervised approach.",
        "To illustrate the importance of the unlabeled data, we created a system that uses all features, including the PathGender+ counts, and trained this system using only the gold standard training data.",
        "This system was unable to leverage the extra features to improve performance; its accuracy was 92.0%, roughly equal to PathGender+ alone.",
        "While SVMs work well with high-dimensional data, they simply cannot exploit features that do not occur in the training set.",
        "We can improve performance further by doing some simple coreference before assigning gender.",
        "Currently, we only group nouns with the same string, and then decide gender collectively for the group.",
        "There are a few cases, however, where an ambiguous surname, such as Willey, can only be classified correctly if we link the surname to an earlier instance of the full name, e.g. Katherine Willey.",
        "We thus added the following simple post-processing rule: if a noun is classified as masculine or feminine (like the ambiguous Willey), and it was observed earlier as the last part of a larger noun, then reassign the gender to masculine or feminine if one of these is the most common path-gender count for the larger noun.",
        "We back off to counts for the first name (e.g. Kathleen .",
        "* ) if the full name is unobserved.",
        "This enhancement improved the PathGender and PathGender+ systems to 93.3% and 94.3%, respectively, while raising the accuracy of our Full-Semi system to 96.7%.",
        "This demonstrates that the surname-matching post-processor is a simple but worthwhile extension to a gender predictor.",
        "The remaining errors represent a number of challenging cases: United States, group, and public labeled as plural but classified as neutral; spectator classified as neutral, etc.",
        "Some of these may yield to more sophisticated joint classification of corefer-ence and gender, perhaps along the lines of work in named-entity classification (Bunescu and Mooney, 2004) or anaphoricity (Denis and Baldridge, 2007).",
        "While gender has been shown to be the key feature for statistical pronoun resolution (Ge et al., 1998; Bergsma and Lin, 2006), it remains to be seen whether the exceptional accuracy obtained here will translate into improvements in resolution performance.",
        "However, given the clear utility of gender in coreference, substantial error reductions in gender assignment will likely be a helpful contribution.",

        "Gender mistakes account for 35% of their system's errors.",

        "other statistical approaches to English noun gender are discussed in Section 2.",
        "In languages with 'grammatical' gender and plentiful gold standard data, gender can be tagged along with other word properties using standard supervised tagging techniques (Hajic and Hladka, 1997).",
        "While our approach is the first to exploit a dual or orthogonal representation of English noun gender, a bootstrapping approach has been applied to determining grammatical gender in other languages by Cucerzan and Yarowsky (2003).",
        "In their work, the two orthogonal views are: 1) the context of the noun, and 2) the noun's morphological properties.",
        "Bootstrapping with these views is possible in other languages where context is highly predictive ofgen-der class, since contextual words like adjectives and determiners inflect to agree with the grammatical noun gender.",
