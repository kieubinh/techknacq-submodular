        "Recent trends in machine translation illustrate that highly accurate word and phrase translations can be learned automatically given enough parallel training data (Koehn et al., 2003; Chiang, 2007).",
        "However, large parallel corpora exist for only a small fraction of the world's languages, leading to a bottleneck for building translation systems in low-density languages such as Swahili, Uzbek or Punjabi.",
        "While parallel training data is uncommon for such languages, more readily available resources include small translation dictionaries, comparable corpora, and large amounts of monolingual data.",
        "The marked difference in the availability of monolingual vs parallel corpora has led several researchers to develop methods for automatically learning bilingual lexicons, either by using monolingual corpora (Rapp, 1999; Koehn and Knight, 2002; Schafer and Yarowsky, 2002; Haghighi et al., 2008) or by exploiting the cross-language evidence of closely related \"bridge\" languages that have more resources (Mann and Yarowsky, 2001).",
        "This paper investigates new ways of learning translations from monolingual corpora.",
        "We extend the Rapp (1999) model of context vector projection using a seed lexicon.",
        "It is based on the intuition that translations will have similar lexical context, even in unrelated corpora.",
        "For example, in order to translate the word \"airplane\", the algorithm builds a context vector which might contain terms such as \"passengers\", \"runway\", \"airport\", etc.",
        "and words in target language that have their translations (obtained via seed lexicon) in surrounding context can be considered as likely translations.",
        "We extend the basic approach by formulating a context model that uses dependency trees.",
        "The use of dependencies has the following advantages:",
        "• Long distance dependencies allow associated words to be included in the context vector even if they fall outside of the fixed-window used in the baseline model.",
        "• Using relationships like parent and child instead of absolute positions alleviates problems when projecting vectors between languages with different word orders.",
        "• It achieves better performance than baseline context models across the board, and better performance than statistical translation models on Top-10 accuracy for noun translation when trained on identical data.",
        "We further show that an extension based on part-of-speech clustering can give similar accuracy gains for learning translations of all word-types, deepening the findings of previous literature which mainly focused on translating nouns (Rapp, 1999; Koehn",
        "The literature on translation lexicon induction for low-density languages falls in to two broad categories: 1) Effectively utilizing similarity between languages by choosing a high-resource \"bridge\" language for translation (Mann and Yarowsky, 2001; Schafer and Yarowsky, 2002) and 2) Extracting noisy clues (such as similar context) from monolingual corpora with help of a seed lexicon (Rapp, 1999; Koehn and Knight, 2002; Schafer and Yarowsky, 2002, Haghighi et al., 2008).",
        "The latter category is more relevant to this work and is explained in detail below.",
        "The idea of words with similar meaning having similar contexts in the same language comes from the Distributional Hypothesis (Harris, 1985) and Rapp (1999) was the first to propose using context of a given word as a clue to its translation.",
        "Given a German word with an unknown translation, a German context vector is constructed by counting its surrounding words in a monolingual German corpus.",
        "Using an incomplete bilingual dictionary, the counts of the German context words with known translations are projected onto an English vector.",
        "The projected vector for the German word is compared to the vectors constructed for all English words using a monolingual English corpus.",
        "The English words with the highest vector similarity are treated as translation candidates.",
        "The original work employed a relatively large bilingual dictionary containing approximately 16,000 words and tested only on a small collection of 100 manually selected nouns.",
        "Koehn and Knight (2002) tested this idea on a larger test set consisting of the 1000 most frequent words from a German-English lexicon.",
        "They also incorporated clues such as frequency and orthographic similarity in addition to context.",
        "Schafer and Yarowsky, (2002) independently proposed using frequency, orthographic similarity and also showed improvements using temporal and word-burstiness similarity measures, in addition to context.",
        "Haghighi et al., (2008) made use of contextual and orthographic clues for learning a generative model from monolingual corpora and a seed lexicon.",
        "All of the aforementioned work defines context similarity in terms of the adjacent words over a window of some arbitary size (usually 2 to 4 words), as initially proposed by Rapp (1999).",
        "We show that the model for surrounding context can be improved by using dependency information rather than strictly relying on adjacent words, based on the success of dependency trees for monolingual clustering and disambiguation tasks (Lin and Pantel, 2002; Padó and Lapata, 2007) and the recent developments in multilingual dependency parsing literature (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006; Nivre et al., 2007).",
        "We further differentiate ourselves from previous work by conducting a second evaluation which examines the accuracy of translating all word types, rather than just nouns.",
        "While the straightforward application of context-based model gives a lower overall accuracy than nouns alone, we show how learning a mapping of part-of-speech tagsets between the source and target language can result in comparable performance to that of noun translation."

        "Table 1: Contrasting context words derived from the adjacent vs dependency models for the above example",
        "The four vectors for positions -1, +1, 2 and +2 in the baseline model get mapped to immediate parent (-1), immediate child (+1), grandparent (-2) and grandchild (+2).",

        "Note that while we are limiting to four positions in the tree, it does not imply that only a maximum of four context words are selected since the word can have multiple immediate children depending upon the dependency parse of the sentence.",

        "number of context words varying with the number of children and parents at the two levels.",
        "Another advantage of this method is that it alleviates the reordering problem as we use tree positions (consisting of head-words) as compared to the adjacent position in the baseline context model.",
        "For example, if the source spanish word to be translated was \"prosperidad\", then in the example shown in Figure 2, in case of adjacent context, the context word \"economica\" will show up in +1 position in Spanish and 1 position in English (as adjectives come before nouns in English) but in case of dependency context, the adjective will be the child of noun and hence will show up in +1 position in both languages.",

        "As a second contribution, we go beyond previous literature which evaluated only on nouns.",
        "We showed how preserving a word's part-of-speech in translation can improve performance.",
        "We further proposed a solution to an interesting sub-problem encountered on the way.",
        "Since part-of-speeech tagsets are not identical across two languages, we propose a way of learning their mapping automatically.",
        "Restricting candidate space based on this learned tagset mapping resulted in 18% improvement over the direct application of context-based model to all word-types.",
        "Dependency trees help improve the context for translation substantially and their use opens up the question of how the context can be enriched further making use of the hidden structure that may provide clues for a word's translation.",
        "We also believe that the problem of learning the mapping between tagsets in two different languages can be used in general for other NLP tasks making use of projection of words and its morphological/syntactic properties between languages.",
