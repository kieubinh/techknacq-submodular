        "In unsupervised parsing an algorithm should uncover the syntactic structure of an input sentence without using any manually created structural training data.",
        "The last decade has seen significant progress in this field of research (Klein and Manning, 2002; Klein and Manning, 2004; Bod, 2006a; Bod, 2006b; Smith and Eisner, 2006; Seginer, 2007).",
        "achieve good performance, these parsers should be trained on large amounts of manually created training data from a domain similar to that of the sentences they parse (Lease and Charniak, 2005; Mc-Closky and Charniak, 2008).",
        "In the highly variable Web, where many of these systems are used, it is very difficult to create a representative corpus for manual annotation.",
        "The high cost of manual annotation of training data for supervised parsers imposes a significant burden on their usage.",
        "A possible answer to this problem can be provided by high quality parses produced by unsupervised parsers that require little to no manual efforts for their training.",
        "These parses can be used either as input for applications, or as training material for modern supervised parsers whose output will in turn be used by applications.",
        "Although unsupervised parser results improve, the quality of many of the parses they produce is still too low for such goals.",
        "For example, the Seginer (2007) parser achieves an F-score of 75.9% on the wsj 10 corpus and 59% on the negra10 corpus, but the percentage of individual sentences with an F-score of 100% is 21.5% for wsj10 and 11% for negra 10.",
        "When requirements are relaxed, only asking for an F-score higher than 85%, percentage is still low, 42% for wsj 10 and 15% for negra 10.",
        "In this paper we address the task of a fully unsupervised assessment of high quality parses created by an unsupervised parser.",
        "The assessment should be unsupervised in order to avoid the problems mentioned above with manually trained supervised parsers.",
        "Assessing the quality ofa learning algorithm's output and selecting high quality instances has been addressed for supervised algorithms (Caru-ana and Niculescu-Mizil, 2006) and specifically for supervised parsers (Yates et al., 2006; Reichart and Rappoport, 2007; Kawahara and Uchimoto, 2008; Ravi et al., 2008).",
        "Moreover, it has been shown to be valuable for supervised parser adaptation between domains (Sagae and Tsujii, 2007; Kawahara and Uchimoto, 2008; Chen et al., 2008).",
        "However, as far as we know the present paper is the first to address the task of unsupervised assessment of the quality of parses created by unsupervised parsers.",
        "Our POS-based Unsupervised Parse Assessment (pupa) algorithm uses statistics about POS tag sequences in a batch of parsed sentences.",
        "The constituents in the batch are represented using the POS sequences of their yield and of the yields of neighboring constituents.",
        "Constituents whose representation is frequent in the output of the parser are considered to be of a high quality.",
        "A score for each range of constituent length is calculated, reflecting the robustness of statistics used for the creation of the constituents of that length.",
        "The final sentence score is a weighted average of the scores calculated for each constituent length.",
        "The score thus integrates the quality of short and long constituents into one score reflecting the quality of the whole parse tree.",
        "pupa provides a quality score for every sentence in a parsed sentences set.",
        "An NLP application can then decide if to use a parse or not, according to its own definition of a high quality parse.",
        "For example, it can select every sentence whose score is above some threshold, or the k top scored sentences.",
        "The selection strategy is application dependent and is beyond the scope of this paper.",
        "The unsupervised parser we use is the Seginer (2007) incremental parser, which achieves state-ofthe-art results without using manually created POS tags.",
        "The POS tags we use are induced by the unsupervised tagger of (Clark, 2003).",
        "Since both tagger and parser do not require any manual annotation, pupa identifies high quality parses without any human involvement.",
        "The incremental parser of (Seginer, 2007) does not give any prediction of its output quality, and extracting such a prediction from its internal data structures is not straightforward.",
        "Such a prediction can be given by supervised parsers in terms of the parse likelihood, but this was shown to be of medium quality (Reichart and Rappoport, 2007).",
        "While the algorithms of Yates et al.",
        "(2006), Kawa-hara and Uchimoto (2008) and Ravi et al.",
        "(2008) are supervised (Section 3), the ensemble based sepa algorithm (Reichart and Rappoport, 2007) can be applied to unsupervised parsers in a way that preserves the unsupervised nature of the selection task.",
        "To compare between two algorithms, we use each of them to assess the quality of the sentences in English and German corpora (WSJ and NEGRA).",
        "We show that for every sentence length (up to 20) the quality of the top scored k sentences according to pupa is higher than the quality of sepa's list (for every k).",
        "As in (Reichart and Rappoport, 2007), the quality of a set selected from the parser's output is evaluated using two measures: constituent F-scoreand average sentence F-score.",
        "Section 2 describes the pupa algorithm, Section 3 discusses previous work, and Sections 4 and 5 present the evaluation setup and results.",
        "2 The POS-based Unsupervised Parse Assessment (PUPA) Algorithm",
        "In this section we detail our parse assessment algorithm.",
        "Its input consists of a set / of parsed sentences, which in our evaluation scenario are produced by an unsupervised parser.",
        "The algorithm assigns each parsed sentence a score reflecting its quality.",
        "The algorithm has three steps.",
        "First, the words in I are POS tagged (in our case, using the fully unsupervised POS induction algorithm of Clark (2003)).",
        "Second, POS statistics about the constituents in I are collected.",
        "Finally, a quality score is calculated for each parsed sentence in I using the POS statistics.",
        "In the following we detail the last two steps.",
        "Collecting POS statistics.",
        "In its second step, the algorithm collects statistics about the constituents in the input set I.",
        "Recall that the yield of a constituent is the set of words covered by it.",
        "The pupa constituent representation (PCR) consists of three features: (1) the ordered POS tag sequence of the constituent's yield, (2) the constituents' right context, and (3) the constituents' left context.",
        "We define context to be the leftmost and rightmost POS tags in the yield of the neighbor of the constituent (if there is only one POS tag in the neighbor's yield, this POS tag is the context).",
        "For the right and left contexts we consider the right and left neighbors respectively.",
        "A constituent C1 is the right neighbor of a constituent C2 if C\\ is the highest level constituent such that the first word in the yield of C\\ comes immediately after the last word in the yield of C2.",
        "A constituent Ci is the left neighbor of a constituent C2 if C1 is the highest level constituent such that the first word in the yield of C2 comes immediately after the last word in the yield of C1.",
        "Figure 1 shows an example, an unlabeled tree for the sentence 'I will give you the ball'.",
        "The tree has 6 constituents (C0-C5).",
        "C3 and C4 have both right and left neighbors.",
        "For C3, the POS sequence of its yield is POS2, POS3 , the left neighbor is C1 and thus the left context is POS1, and the right neighbor is C4 and thus the right context is POS4.",
        "Note that the left and right neighbors of C3 have only one POS tag in their yield and therefore this POS tag is the context.",
        "For C4 the yield is POS4, the left neighbor is C3 (and thus the left context is POS2,POS3), and the right neighbor is C5 (and thus the right context is POS5,POS6).",
        "C1, whose yield is POS1, has only a right neighbor, C2, and thus its right context is",
        "POS2,POS6 and its left context is NULL.",
        "C2 and C5 while for C5 this is C4 (with the context POS4).",
        "The right context of both constituents is NULL.",
        "As all sentence level constituents, C0 has no neighbors, and thus both its left and right contexts are NULL.",
        "We have also explored other representations of left and right contexts based on the POS tags of their yields.",
        "In these, we represented the left/right neighbor using only the leftmost/rightmost POS tags of its yield or other subsets of the yield's POS tags.",
        "These variations produced lower quality results than the main variant above in our experiments, which were for English and German.",
        "Exploring the suitability of our representation for other languages is left for future research.",
        "Score computation.",
        "The third and last step of the algorithm is a second pass over I for computing a quality score for each parse tree.",
        "Short constituents tend to be more frequent than long ones.",
        "In order not to distort our score due to parsing errors in short constituents, pupa computes the grade using a division into lengths, in three steps.",
        "First, constituents are assigned to bins according to their length, each bin containing the constituents of a certain range of lengths.",
        "Denote this range by W (for width), and the number of bins by N(W).",
        "For example, in our experiments the longest possible constituent is of length 20, so we can take W = 5, resulting in N(W) = 4: bin 1 for constituents of length 1-5, bin 2 for constituents of length 6-10, and so on for bins 3, 4.",
        "The score of bin is given by",
        "Where X is the maximal number of occurrences of constituents in the bin that we consider as important for the score (see below for its selection), | Q | is the number of constituents in bin i occurring at least t times in the batch of parsed sentences, and \\C %\\ is the number of constituents in bin i.",
        "In words, the score is a weighted average: the fraction of the constituents in the bin occuring at least 2 times (with weight X), plus the fraction of the constituents in the bin occuring at least 3 times (with weight X – 1), etc, until the fraction of the constituents in the bin occuring at least X times (with weight 2).",
        "A score for the division into N bins is given by",
        "Where Z is the maximum bin score (according to (1)) and M is the number of bins containing at least one constituent.",
        "If, for example, N(W) = 4 and there is no constituent whose length is between 11 and 15 then bin number 3 is empty.",
        "If every other bin contains at least one constituent, M = 3.",
        "To get a final score for the parse tree of sentence S that is independent of a specific bin division, we sum the scores of the various bin division:",
        "where Y is the length of S (which is also its maximum bin width).",
        "PupaScore thus takes values in the [0,1] range.",
        "In equation (1), if, for example, X = 20 then the weight of the fraction of the bin's constituents occurring at least 2 times is 20 while the weight of the fraction of the constituents occurring at least 10 times is 12 and of the fraction of constituents occurring at least 20 times is 2.",
        "We consider the number of times a constituent appears in a batch to be an indication of its correctness.",
        "The difference between 3 and 2 occurrences is therefore more indicative than the difference between 20 and 19 occurrences.",
        "More generally, the more times a constituent occurs, the less indicative any additional appearance is.",
        "In equation (2) we give all bins the same weight.",
        "Short constituents are more frequent and are generally more likely to be correct.",
        "However, the correctness of long constituents is an indication that the parser has a correct interpretation of the tree structure and that it is likely to create a high quality tree.",
        "The usage of equal bin weights was done to balance the tendency of parse trees to have more short constituents.",
        "Parameters.",
        "pupa has two parameters: X, the maximal number of occurrences considered in equation (1), and P, the number of POS tags induced by the unsupervised POS tagger.",
        "In the following we present the unsupervised technique we used to tune these parameters.",
        "Figure 2 shows nc(t), the number of constituents appearing at least t times in wsj20 (left) and ne-gra20 (right).",
        "For both corpora, the pattern is shown when using 5 POS tags (P = 5, solid line) and 50 POS tags (P = 50, dashed line).",
        "The distribution obeys Zipf's law: many constituents appear a small number of times while a few constituents appear a large number of times.",
        "We denote the t value where the slope changes from steep to moderate by teibaw.",
        "Practically, we approximate the 'real' elbow value and define telbow to be the smallest t for which nc(t + 1) – nc(t) = 1.",
        "When P = 5, telbow is 32 for WSJ and 19 for NEGRA.",
        "When P = 50, telbow is 15 for WSJ and 9 for NEGRA.",
        "The number of constituents appearing more than telbow times is considerably smaller than the number of constituents appearing telbow times or less.",
        "Therefore, the fact that a constituent appears telbow + S times (for a positive integer S) is not a better indication of its quality than the fact that it appears telbow times.",
        "We thus select X to be telbow.",
        "The graphs also demonstrate that for both corpora, telbow for P = 50 is smaller than telbow for P = 5.",
        "Generally, telbow is a monotonically decreasing function of P. Lower telbow values imply that pupa would be less distinctive between constituents quality (see equation (1); recall that X = telbow).",
        "We thus want to select the P value that maximizes telbow.",
        "We therefore minimize P. telbow values for P g {3,..., 10} are very similar.",
        "Indeed, pupa achieves its best performance for P g {3,..., 10} and it is insensitive to the selection of P in this range.",
        "In Section 5 we report results with P = 5."

        "We introduced pupa, an algorithm for unsupervised parse assessment that utilizes pOS sequence statistics.",
        "pupa is a fully unsupervised algorithm whose parameters can be tuned in an unsupervised manner.",
        "Experimenting with the Seginer unsupervised parser and Clark's unsupervised POS tagger on English and German corpora, pupa was shown to outperform both the leading parse assessment algorithm for supervised parsers (sepa, even when its parameters are tuned on manually annotated development data) and a strong baseline (mc).",
        "Using pupa, we extracted high quality parses from the output of a parser which requires raw text as input, using pOS tags induced by an unsupervised tagger.",
        "pupa thus provides a way of obtaining high quality parses without any human involvement.",
        "For future work, we intend to use parses selected by pupa from the output of unsupervised parsers as training data for supervised parsers, and in NLp applications that use parse trees.",
        "A challenge for the first direction is the fact that state of the art supervised parsers require labeled parse trees, while modern unsupervised parsers create unlabeled trees.",
        "Combining pupa with algorithms for labeled parse trees induction (Haghighi and Klein, 2006; Reichart and Rappoport, 2008) is a one direction to overcome this challenge.",
