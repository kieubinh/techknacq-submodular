        "Evaluation of clustering results is a challenging task.",

        "Many NLP works have used external clustering evaluation measures (see Section 2).",
        "Recently, two measures have been proposed that avoid many of the weaknesses of previous measures and exhibit several attractive properties (see Sections 2 and 3): the vi measure (Meila, 2007) and the v measure (Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2007).",
        "However, each ofthese has a serious drawback.",
        "The possible values of vi lie in [0, 2log N], where N is the size of the clustered dataset.",

        "We will illustrate the behavior of some measures using three extreme cases: the single cluster case, in which all data elements are put in the same single cluster; the singletons case, in which each data element is put in a cluster of its own; and the no knowledge case, in which the class distribution within each cluster is identical to the class distribution in the entire dataset.",
        "If the single cluster solution is not the perfect one, the no knowledge solution is the worst possible solution.",

        "As noted by (Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2007), the Q measure does not explicitly address the completeness of the suggested clustering.",
        "Due to the cost term, if two clusterings have the same H(C K) value, the model prefers the one with the lower number of clusters, but the trade-off between homogeneity and completeness is not explicitly addressed.",
