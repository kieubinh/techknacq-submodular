        "Generally, building an automated text classification system consists of two key subtasks.",
        "The first task is text representation which converts the content of documents into compact format so that they can be further processed by the text classifiers.",
        "Another task is to learn the model of a text classifier which is used to classify the unlabeled documents.",
        "This paper proposes a substantially new model for text representation to improve effectiveness of text classification by semantic ordering.",
        "Our motivation for the research presented here came from (Dorrer et al., 2001) who demonstrated the viability of database searching by visible light using a quantum algorithm, albeit on meaningless items.",
        "The question was, what kind of document representation would be necessary to extend their in-principle results to include semantics, one that has been leading us to test both periodic and non-periodic functions for this purpose.",
        "Since representation and retrieval by colors was implied in their method, we speculated that the following components could be useful in a rephrased model: (a) a metaphorically presented spectral expression of lexical semantic phenomena, (b) a ranked one-dimensional condensate of multidimensional sense structure, and (c) representation of documents and queries by functions in L2 space with a similarity measure.",
        "Our anticipation was that by matching these components, a new model could demonstrate new capacities in general, and contribute to computing meaning by waves in particular.",
        "Semantic ordering (component b) is an approximation of what (Cruse, 1986) referred to as a sense spectrum, i.e. a series of points - called local senses and constituting lexical units -, in a one-dimensional semantic continuum (component a).",
        "Apart from differentiating between the conceptual content of the same word in terms of its senses in word pairs, i.e. their semantic relatedness, it also compresses the result in spectral form.",
        "The scalar values of this spectrum have the double potential of being a condensed measure for semantic weighting, and, tentatively, they can play the role of mass in experiments where gravity is called in as a metaphor for text categorization and information retrieval (Paij-mans, 1997; Shi et al., 2005; Wittek et al., 2009).",
        "This paper addresses text categorization by means of non-periodical functions only.",
        "In support of Cruse's point, recently it has been demonstrated by measurements that sense classification errors made by their maximum entropy based word sense disambiguation system were partly remedied once instead of a fine-grained view, a more coarse-grained view of senses was adopted (Palmer et al., 2006).",
        "Improvement of sense classification accuracy linked with \"zooming out\" in terms of observation granularity indicates, in our eyes, the \"fluid\", perhaps spectral nature of sense inasmuch as it is impossible to precisely distinguish between the borderlines and some fuzziness is implied both in the phenomenon and its perception.",
        "This \"fluidity of language\", as Palmer et al.",
        "call it, is in accord with the theory of shared semantic representations in psycholinguistics (Rodd et al., 2002), according to which related senses share a portion of their meaning representation in the mental lexicon; it also supports an earlier observation of two of the present authors based on the same methodology as outlined in this paper, namely that using continuous functions for information retrieval leads to content representation without exact term or document locations, one which is regional in its nature and subject to a mathematical uncertainty principle (Wittek and Daranyi, 2007).",
        "We approach our problem in three steps: (1) whether distributional semantics alone is enough for the representation of word meaning, (2) whether semantic relatedness between word pairs can be expressed in an ordered form while preserving lexical field structure, and if (3) the uniqueness of entries in such an order can be expressed by functions rather than scalars such as distance.",
        "As we will show, this line of thought leads to performance improvement in text classification by using kernel-based feature weighting.",
        "Since the early days of the vector space model, it has been debated whether it is a proper carrier of meaning of texts (Raghavan and Wong, 1986), arguing if distributional similarity is an adequate proxy for lexical semantic relatedness (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006).",
        "We argue for the need to enrich distributional semantics-based text representation by other components because with the statistical, i.e. devoid of word semantics approaches there is generally no way to improve both precision and recall at the same time, increasing one is done at the expense of the other.",
        "For example, casting a wider net of search terms to improve recall of relevant items will also bring in an even greater proportion of irrelevant items, lowering precision.",
        "In the meantime, practical approaches have been proliferating, especially with developments in kernel methods in the last decade (Joachims, 1998; Cristianini et al., 2002).",
        "Some researchers suggested a more general mathematical framework to accommodate the needs that the vector space model cannot satisfy (van Rijs-bergen, 2004).",
        "This paper explores the opportunities of this representation in the domain of text classification by introducing it as a new nonlinear semantic kernel.",
        "Another aspect of the same problem is term expansion for document classification and retrieval.",
        "By automatically selecting expansion terms for a text classification system to expand a document vector by adding terms that are related to the terms already in the document, performance can be improved (Hu et al., 2008).",
        "Such new terms can either be statistically related to the original terms or chosen from lexical resources such as thesauri, controlled vocabularies, ontologies and the like.",
        "However, in doing so the fundamental question often overlooked is whether the expansion terms extracted are equally related to the document and are useful for text classification.",
        "In what follows we propose a form of term expansion with decreasing importance of those terms that are less related, as contrasted with rigid term expansion.",
        "This can be carried out by a combination of semantic ordering and using function space for classification.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 overviews text classification by support vector machines, expanding on traditional text similarity measures (Section 2.1), semantic smoothing kernels (Section 2.2), term expansion strategies (Section 2.3), and finally introduces our semantic kernels in the L2 space (Section 2.4).",
        "Section 3 discusses experimental results and Section 4 concludes the paper."

        "Text categorization is the task of assigning unlabeled documents into predefined categories.",
        "Given a collection of (d1,d2,..., dN} documents, and a C = (c1, c2,c\\c\\] set of predefined categories, the task is, for each document dj (j G (1,2,..., N}), to assign a decision to file dj under a or a decision not to file dj under a (c G C) by virtue of a function $, where the function $ is also referred to as the classifier, or model, or hypothesis, or rule.",
        "Supervised text classification is a machine learning technique for creating the function $ from training data.",
        "The training data consist of pairs of input documents, and desired outputs (i.e., classes).",
        "Support vector machines have been found the most effective by several authors (Joachims, 1998).",
        "The proposed semantic text classification method is grounded in the kernel methods underlying support vector machines.",
        "A support vector machine is a kind of supervised learning algorithm.",
        "In its simplest, linear form, a support vector machine is a hyperplane that separates a set of positive examples from a set of negative examples with maximum margin (Shawe-Taylor and Cristianini, 2004).",
        "The strength of kernel methods is that they allow a mapping (/>(.)",
        "of x to a higher dimensional space.",
        "In the dual formulation of the mathematical programming problem, only the kernel matrix K(xj; Xj) = ^(xj)'^(xj) is needed in the calculations.",
        "Intuitively, if a text fragment of two documents address similar topics, it is highly possible that they share lots of substantive terms.",
        "After having removed the stopwords and stemmed the rest, the stemmed terms construct a vector representation for each text document.",
        "Let aj be a document vector in the vector space model, that is, aj = k=1 akjek, where M is the number of index terms, akj is some weighting (e.g., term frequency), and ek is a basis vector of the M-dimensional Euclidean space.",
        "This representation is also referred to as the bag-of-words (BOW) model.",
        "Given this representation, semantic relatedness of a pair of text fragments is computed as the cosine similarity of their corresponding term vectors which is defined as:",
        "One enrichment strategy is to use a semantic smoothing kernel while calculating the similarity between two documents.",
        "Any linear kernel for texts is characterized by K(ai; aj) = aiS'Saj, where S is an appropriately shaped matrix commonly referred to as semantic smoothing matrix (Siolas and d'Alche Buc, 2000; Shawe-Taylor and Cristianini, 2004; Basili et al., 2005; Mavroeidis et al., 2005; Bloehdorn et al., 2006).",
        "The presence of S changes the orthogonality of the vector space model, as this mapping should introduce term dependence.",
        "A recent attempt tried to manually construct S with the help of a lexical resource (Siolas and d'Alche Buc, 2000).",
        "The entries in the symmetric matrix S express the semantic similarity between the terms i and j.",
        "Entries in this matrix are inversely proportional to the length of the WordNet hierarchy path linking the two terms.",
        "The performance, measured over the 20NewsGroups corpus, showed an improvement of 2 % over the the basic vector space method.",
        "Moreover, the semantic matrix S is almost fully dense, hence computational issues arise.",
        "In a similar construction, (Bloehdorn et al., 2006) defined the matrix entries as weights of superconcepts of the two terms in the WordNet hierarchy.",
        "Focusing on special subcategories of Reuters-21578 and on the TREC Question Answering Dataset, they showed consistent improvement over the baseline.",
        "As (Mavroei-dis et al., 2005) pointed out, polysemy will remain a problem in semantic smoothing kernels.",
        "A more complex way of calculating the semantic similarity as the matrix entries was also proposed (Basili et al., 2005).",
        "For a more general discussion on semantic similarity see Section 2.4.1.",
        "An early attempt to overcome the untenable orthogonality assumption of the vector space model was proposed under the name of generalized vector space model (Wong et al., 1985).",
        "The article which proposed the model did not provide empirical results, and since then the model has been regarded of large theoretical importance with less impact on actual applications.",
        "The model takes a distributional approach, focusing on term co-occurrences.",
        "The underlying assumption is that term correlations are captured by the co-occurrence information.",
        "That is, two terms are semantically related if they co-occur often in the same documents.",
        "By eliminating orthogonality, documents can be seen as similar even if they do not share any terms.",
        "The term cooccurrence matrix is AA', hence the model takes A' as the semantic similarity matrix S. A major drawback of the generalized vector space model is that it replaces the orthogonality assumption with another questionable assumption.",
        "The computational needs are tremendous too, if the dimensions of A are considered.",
        "Moreover, the co-occurrence matrix is not sparse anymore.",
        "Latent semantic indexing (or latent semantic analysis) was another attempt to bring more linguistic and psychological aspects to language processing via a kernel.",
        "Conceptually, latent semantic indexing is similar to the generalized vector space model, it measures semantic information through co-occurrence analysis in the corpus.",
        "From the algorithmic perspective it is an enormous problem that textual data have a large number of relevant features.",
        "This results in huge computational needs and the classification models may overfit the data.",
        "The number of features can be reduced by multivariate feature extraction methods.",
        "In latent semantic indexing, the dimension of the vector space is reduced by singular value decomposition (Deerwester et al., 1990).",
        "Using rank reduction, terms that occur together very often in the same documents are merged into a single dimension of the feature space.",
        "The dimensions of the reduced space correspond to the axes of greatest variance.",
        "For latent semantic indexing, by dual representation the kernel matrix is K = VXkV', where Xk is a diagonal matrix containing the k largest singular values of the singular value decomposition of the vector space, and V holds the right singular vectors of the decomposition.",
        "The new kernel matrix can be obtained directly from K by applying an eigenvalue decomposition of K (Cristianini et al., 2002).",
        "The computational complexity of performing an eigenvalue decomposition on the kernel matrix is a major drawback of latent semantic indexing.",
        "In order to eliminate the bottleneck of the traditional BOW representation, previous approaches in term expansion enriched this convention by external lexical resources such as WordNet.",
        "As a first step, these methods generate new features for each document in the dataset.",
        "These new features can be synonyms or homonyms of document terms as in (Hotho et al., 2003; Rodriguez and Hidalgo, 1997), or expanded features for terms, sentences and documents as in (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2005), or term context information for word sense disambiguation such as topic signatures (Agirre and De Lacalle, 2003; Agirre et al., 2004).",
        "Then, the generated new features replace the old ones or are appended to the document representation, and construct a new vector representation ai for each text document.",
        "The similarity measure of document pairs is defined as:",
        "I ai II aj I",
        "The basic assumption of our framework is that terms can be arranged in an order such that consecutive terms are semantically related.",
        "Hence each term acquires a unique position, and this position ties the term to its semantically related neighbors.",
        "However, given a BOW representation with a cosine similarity measure, this position would not improve classification performance.",
        "Therefore we suggest to associate a mathematical function with each term, thus mapping terms and documents to the L2 space, and using the inner product of this space to express similarity.",
        "The choice of function will determine to which extent neighboring terms, i.e., the enriching terms, are considered in calculating the similarity between two documents.",
        "This section first introduces an algorithm that produces the aforementioned semantic order, then the semantic kernels in the L2 space are discussed.",
        "The proposed kernels assume that there is a semantic order between terms.",
        "Let V denote a set of terms (t1; t2,..., tn} and let d(tj, tj) denote the semantic distance between the terms tj and tj.",
        "The initial order of the terms is not relevant, though it is assumed to be alphabetic.",
        "Let G = (V, E) denote a weighted undirected graph, where the weights in the set E are defined by the distances between the terms.",
        "Various lexical resource-based (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006) and distributional measures (Mohammad and Hirst, 2005) have been proposed to measure semantic relatedness and distance between terms.",
        "Terms can be corpus-or genre-specific.",
        "Manually constructed general-purpose lexical resources include many usages that are infrequent in a particular corpus or genre of documents.",
        "For example, one of the 8 senses of company in WordNet is a visitor/visitant, which is a hyponym of person (Lin, 1998).",
        "This sense of the term is practically never used in newspaper articles, hence distributional attributes should be taken into consideration.",
        "Composite measures that combine the advantages of both approaches have also been developed (Resnik, 1995; Jiang and Conrath, 1997).",
        "This paper relies on the Jiang-Conrath composite measure (Jiang and Con-rath, 1997), which has been shown to be superior to other measures (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006), and we also found that this measure works the best for the purpose.",
        "The Jiang-Conrath metric measures the distance between two senses by using the hierarchy of WordNet.",
        "By denoting the lowest superordinate of two senses s1 and s2 in the hierarchy with LSuper(s1,s2), the metric is calculated as follows:",
        "where IC(s) is the information content of a sense s based on a corpus.",
        "Distance between two terms is calculated according to the following equation:",
        "t1 and t2 are two terms, and sen(tj) is the set of senses of tj.",
        "The distance between two terms is usually defined as the minimum of the sense distances.",
        "We chose maximum because it ensures that only closely related terms will be placed to adjacent positions by the algorithm below.",
        "Finding a semantic ordering of terms can be translated to a graph problem: a minimum-weight Hamiltonian path G' of G gives the ordering by reading the nodes from one of the paths to the other.",
        "G is a complete graph, therefore such a path always exists, but finding it is an NP-complete problem.",
        "The following greedy algorithm is similar to the nearest neighbor heuristic for the solution of the traveling salesman problem.",
        "It creates a graph G' = (V', E'), where V' = V and E' c E. This G' graph is a spanning tree of G in which the maximum degree of a node is two, that is, the minimum spanning tree is a path between two nodes.",

        "While high-quality lexical resources enable such an ordering in themselves, the procedure can benefit from data derived from the specific corpora in study - semantic relatedness measures such as the Jiang-Conrath similarity operate this way.",
        "Secondly, once the ordering is done and a sense spectrum is constructed, weights expressing statistical relationships between terms and documents are borrowed from the vector space model to form the basis for constructing hypothetical signals of content, documents as continuous functions.",

        "With this bijective (one-to-one) mapping, each term is assigned a physical wavelength and frequency.",
        "Figure 3 shows an example of such a term spectrum.",
        "On the other hand, we have only begun to test the applicability of periodic functions in L2 space (Wit-tek and Daranyi, 2007), hence a well-established link to semantic computing by waves is missing for the time being.",
        "A possible compromise between the non-periodic vs. periodic approaches can be to apply wavelets instead of waves, a direction where our ongoing research shows promising results.",
        "These will be reported elsewhere.",
        "In a broader frame of thought, we are also working on the optical equivalents of the vector space model and the generalized vector space model as a first step toward coding more semantics in mathematical objects, and putting them to work in novel computing environments."
