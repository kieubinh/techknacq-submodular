        "Many applications in the context of natural language processing or information retrieval may be largely improved if they were able to fully exploit the rich semantic information annotated in high-quality, publicly available resources such as the FrameNet and the Word-Net databases.",
        "Nevertheless, the practical use of similar resources is often biased by the limited coverage of semantic phenomena that they provide.",
        "A natural solution to this problem would be to automatically establish anchors between these resources that would allow us 1) to jointly use the encoded information, thus possibly overcoming limitations of the individual corpora, and 2) to extend each resource coverage by exploiting the information encoded in the others.",
        "In this paper, we present a supervised learning framework for the mapping of FrameNet lexical units onto WordNet synsets based on a reduced set of novel and semantically rich features.",
        "The automatically learnt mapping, which we call MapNet, can be used 1) to extend frame sets in the English FrameNet, 2) to populate frame sets in the Italian FrameNet via MultiWordNet and 3) to add frame labels to the MultiSemCor corpus.",

        "In recent years, the integration of manually-built lexical resources into NLP systems has received growing interest.",
        "In particular, resources annotated with the surface realization of semantic roles, like FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) or PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) have shown to convey an improvement in several NLP tasks, from question answering (Shen and Lapata, 2007) to textual entailment (Burchardt et al., 2007) and shallow semantic parsing (Giuglea and Moschitti, 2006).",
        "Nonetheless, the main limitation of such resources is their poor coverage, particularly as regards FrameNet.",
        "Indeed, the latest FrameNet release (v. 1.3) contains 10,195 lexical units (LUs), 3,380 of which are described only by a lexicographic definition without any example sentence.",
        "In order to cope with this lack of data, it would be useful to map frame information onto other lexical resources with a broader coverage.",
        "We believe that WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), with 210,000 entries in version 3.0, can represent a suitable resource for this task.",
        "In fact, both FrameNet and WordNet group together semantically similar words, and provide a hierarchical representation of the lexical knowledge (in WordNet the relations between synsets, in FrameNet between frames, see Ruppen-hofer et al.",
        "(2006)).",
        "On the other hand, WordNet provides a more extensive coverage particularly for adjectives and nouns denoting artifacts and natural kinds, that are mostly neglected in FrameNet.",
        "In this paper, we present an approach using Support Vector Machines (SVM) to map FrameNet lexical units to WordNet synsets.",
        "The proposed approach addresses some of the limitations of previous works on the same task (see for example De Cao et al.",
        "(2008) and Johansson and Nugues (2007)).",
        "Most notably, as we do not train the SVM on a perframe basis, our model is able to cope also with those frames that have little or no annotated sentences to support the frame description.",
        "After learning a very fast model on a small set of annotated lexical unit-synset pairs, we can automatically establish new mappings in never-seen-before pairs and use them for our applications.",
        "We will evaluate the effect of the induced mappings on two tasks: the automatic enrichment of lexical unit sets in the English and Italian FrameNet via MultiWordNet (Pianta et al., 2002), and the annotation of the MultiSemCor corpus (Bentivogli and Pianta, 2005) with frame labels.",
        "The discussion is structured as follows: in Section 2 we review the main characteristics of FrameNet and WordNet; in Section 3 we discuss previous attempts to establish a mapping between them; in Section 4 we describe our supervised approach to map lexical units onto synsets; Section 5 details the dataset that we employed for our experiments; Section 6 describes the novel features that we used to characterize the mapping; Section 7 details the results of our experiments; in Section 8 we apply the mapping to three resource annotation tasks; finally, in Section 9 we draw our conclusions."

        "The FrameNet database (Baker et al.",
        "(1998), Fillmore et al.",
        "(2003)) is an English lexical resource based on the description of some prototypical situations, the frames, and the frame-evoking words or expressions associated to them, the lexical units (LU).",
        "Every frame corresponds to a scenario involving a set of participants, the frame elements (FEs), that are typically the semantic arguments shared by all LUs in a frame.",

        "Frame: cause_to_wake stituent bearing the FE label is written in italics.",
        "The FrameNet resource is corpus-based, i.e. every lexical unit should be instantiated by at least one example sentence.",
        "Besides, every lexical unit comes with a manual lexicographic definition.",
        "The latest database release contains 795 frame definitions and 10,195 lexical units, instantiated through approximately 140.000 example sentences.",
        "Despite this, the database shows coverage problems when exploited for NLP tasks, and is still being extended by the Berkeley group at ICSI.",
        "WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) is a lexical resource for English based on psycholinguistics principles and developed at Princeton University.",
        "It has been conceived as a computational resource aimed at improving some drawbacks of traditional dictionaries such as the circularity of definitions and the ambiguity of sense references.",
        "At present, it covers the majority of nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs in the English language, organized in synonym sets called synsets, which correspond to concepts.",
        "WordNet also includes a rich set of semantic relations across concepts, such as hyponymy, entailment, antonymy, similar-to, etc.",
        "Each synset is encoded as a set of synomyms having the same part of speech and described by a definition or gloss.",
        "In some cases, one or more example sentences may also be reported.",
        "The Princeton English WordNet has also been augmented with domain labels (Magnini and Cavaglia, 2000) that group synsets into homogeneous clusters in order to reduce polysemy in the database.",
        "We believe that mapping FrameNet LUs to WordNet synsets would have at least three different advantages: 1) for the English FrameNet, it would automatically increase the number of LUs for frame by importing all synonyms from the mapped synset(s), and would allow to exploit the semantic and lexical relations in WordNet to enrich the information encoded in FrameNet.",
        "This would help coping with coverage problems and disambiguating the LU senses.",
        "2) For WordNet, it would be possible to add a semantic layer between the synset level and the domain level represented by frame relations, and to enrich the synsets with a computational description of the situation they refer to together with the semantic roles involved.",
        "3) Since frames are mostly defined at conceptual level, the FrameNet model is particularly suitable for cross-lingual induction (Boas, 2005).",
        "In this framework, the FrameNet-WordNet mapping could help modelling frame-based resources for new languages using minimal supervision.",
        "In fact, the availability of multilingual resources like MultiWordNet (Pianta et al., 2002) and EuroWordNet (Vossen, 1998) allows to easily populate frame sets for new languages with reduced human effort and near-manual quality by importing all lemmas from the mapped synsets.",

        "Differently from other models, the SVM is not trained on a per-frame basis and we do not rely on the number of the annotated sentences for a LU in the FrameNet corpus, thus our mapping algorithm performs well also with poorly-annotated LUs.",
        "After creating MapNet, the mapping between FrameNet and WordNet, we applied it to three tasks: the automatic induction of new LUs for English FrameNet, the population of frames for Italian FrameNet and the annotation of the MultiSemCor corpus with frame information.",
        "A preliminary evaluation shows that the mapping can significantly reduce the manual effort for the development and the extension of FrameNet-like resources, both in the phase of corpus annotation and of frame population.",
        "In the future, we plan to improve the algorithm by introducing syntactic features for assessing similarity between LU definitions and WordNet glosses.",
        "We also want to merge all information extracted and collected for Italian FrameNet and deliver a seed version of the resource to be validated.",
        "Finally, we plan to extend the mapping to all languages included in MultiWordNet, i.e. Spanish, Portuguese, Hebrew and Romanian."
