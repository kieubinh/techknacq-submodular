        "In 2006 and 2007 the shared tasks were devoted to the parsing of syntactic dependencies, using corpora from up to 13 languages.",
        "In 2008, the shared task (Surdeanu et al., 2008) used a unified dependency-based formalism, which modeled both syntactic dependencies and semantic roles for English.",

        "As in 2008, the CoNLL-2009 shared task combined dependency parsing and the task of identifying and labeling semantic arguments of verbs (and other parts of speech whenever available).",

        "• Joint task (syntactic dependency parsing and semantic role labeling), or",
        "• SRL-only task (syntactic dependency parses have been provided by the organizers, using state-of-the art parsers for the individual languages).",
        "In contrast to the previous year, the evaluation data indicated which words were to be dealt with (for the SRL task).",
        "In other words, (predicate) disambiguation was still part of the task, whereas the identification of argument-bearing words was not.",
        "This decision was made to compensate for the significant differences between languages and between the annotation schemes used.",

        "Closed Challenge The aim of this challenge was to compare performance ofthe participating systems in a fair environment.",
        "Systems had to be built strictly with information contained in the given training corpus, and tuned with the development section.",
        "In addition, the lexical frame files (such as the Prop-Bank and NomBank for English, the valency dictionary PDT-Vallex for Czech etc.)",
        "were provided and may have been used.",
        "These restrictions mean that outside parsers (not trained by the participants' systems) could not be used.",
        "However, we did provide the output of a single, state-of-the-art dependency parser for each language so that participants could build a SRL-only system (using the provided parses as inputs) within the closed challenge (as opposed to the 2008 shared task).",
        "Open Challenge Systems could have been developed making use of any kind of external tools and resources.",
        "The only condition was that such tools or resources must not have been developed with the annotations of the test set, both for the input and output annotations of the data.",
        "In this challenge, we were interested in learning methods which make use of any tools or resources that might improve the performance.",
        "The comparison of different systems in this setting may not be fair, and thus ranking of systems is not necessarily important.",
        "In 2008, systems participating in the open challenge could have used state-of-the-art parsers for the syntactic dependency part of the task.",
        "This year, we have provided the output of these parsers for all the languages in an uniform way, thus allowing an orthogonal combination of the two tasks and the two challenges.",
        "For the SRL-only task, participants in the closed challenge simply had to use the provided parses only.",
        "Despite the provisions for the SRL-only task, we are more interested in the approaches and results of the Joint task.",
        "Therefore, primary system ranking is provided for the Joint task while additional measures are computed for various combinations of parsers and SRL methods across the tasks and challenges.",
        "The data format used in this shared task has been based on the CoNLL-2008 shared task, with some differences.",
        "The data follows these general rules:",
        "• The files contain sentences separated by a blank line.",
        "• A sentence consists of one or more tokens and the information for each token is represented on a separate line.",
        "• A token consists of at least 14 fields.",
        "The fields are separated by one or more whitespace characters (spaces or tabs).",
        "Whitespace characters are not allowed within fields.",
        "The data is thus a large table with whitespace-separated fields (columns).",
        "The fields provided in the data are described in Table 1.",
        "They are identical for all languages, but they may differ in contents; for example, some fields might not be filled for all the languages provided (such as the FEAT or PFEAT fields).",
        "For the SRL-only task, participants have been provided will all the data but the PRED and APREDs, which they were supposed to fill in with their correct values.",
        "However, they did not have to determine which tokens are predicates (or more precisely, which are the argument-bearing tokens), since they were marked by 'Y' in the FILLPRED field.",
        "For the Joint task, participants could not (in addition to the PRED and APREDs) see the goldstandard nor the predicted syntactic dependencies (HEAD, PHEAD) and their labels (DEPREL, PDE-",
        "PREL).",
        "These syntactic dependencies were also to be filled by participants' systems.",
        "In both tasks, participants have been free to use any other data (columns) provided, except the LEMMA, POS and FEAT columns (to get more 'realistic' results using only their automatically predicted variants PLEMMA, PPOS and PFEAT).",
        "Besides the corpus proper, predicate dictionaries have been provided to participants in order to be able to properly match the predicates to the tokens in the corpus; their contents could have been used e.g. as features for the PRED/APREDs predictions (or even for the syntactic dependencies, i.e., for filling in the PHEAD and PDEPREL fields).",
        "The system of filling-in the APREDs follows the 2008 pattern; for each argument-bearing token (predicate), a new APREDn column is created in the order in which the predicate token is encountered within the sentence (i.e., based on its ID seen as a numerical value).",
        "Then, for each token in the sentence, the value in the intersection of the APREDn column and the token row is either left unfilled (if the token is not an argument), or a predicate-argument label(s) is(are) filled in.",

        "• some of the fields (e.g. the APREDx) and values (ARG0 – A0 etc.)",
        "have been renamed.",

        "• Challenge: open or closed",
        "• Domain: in-domain data (IDD, separated from training corpus) or out-of-domain data (OOD)",
        "Joint task participants are also evaluated separately on the syntactic dependency task (labeled attachment score, LAS).",
        "Finally, systems competing in both tasks are compared on semantic role labeling alone, to assess the impact of the the joint pars-ing/SRL task compared to an SRL-only task on pre-parsed data.",
        "Finally, as an explanatory measure, precision and recall of the semantic labeling task have been computed and tabulated.",
        "We have decided to omit several evaluation figures that were reported in previous years, such as the percentage of completely correct sentences (\"Exact Match\"), unlabeled scores, etc.",
        "With seven languages, two tasks (plus two challenges, and the IDD/OOD distinction), there are enough results to get lost even as it is.",
        "The LAS score is defined similarly as in the previous shared tasks, as the percentage of tokens for which a system has predicted the correct HEAD and DEPREL columns.",
        "The unlabeled attachment score (UAS), i.e., the percentage of tokens with correct HEAD regardless if the DEPREL is correct, has not been officially computed this year.",
        "No precision and recall measures are applicable, since all systems are supposed to output a single dependency with a single label (see also below the footnote to the description of the combined score).",
        "The semantic propositions are evaluated by converting them to semantic dependencies, i.e., we create n semantic dependencies from every predicate to its n arguments.",
        "These dependencies are labeled with the labels of the corresponding arguments.",
        "Additionally, we create a semantic dependency from each predicate to a virtual ROOT node.",

        "Starting with the POS and FEAT fields, it can be seen that Catalan, Czech and Spanish use only the 12 major part-of-speech categories as values of the POS field (with richly populated FEAT field); English and Chinese are the opposite extreme, disregarding the use of the FEAT field completely and coding everything as a POS value.",

        "For example, the unconditioned probability of \"subjects\" is almost the same for all the six other languages (between 6 and 8 percent).",
        "The probability mass covered by the first five most frequent DEPRELs is also almost the same (again, except for Japanese), suggesting that the labeling task might have similar difficulty.",

        "Differences between PropBank and NomBank stem from differences between noun and verb argument structure; differences in treatment of nouns and verbs in the Penn Treebank; and differences in the sophistication of previous research about noun and verb argument structure.",

        "The main difference between the 2008 and 2009 version of the corpora is the generation of word lemmas.",
        "In the 2008 version the only lemmas provided were predicted using the built-in lemmatizer in WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) based on the most frequent sense for the form and the predicted part-of-speech tag.",
        "These lemmas are listed in the 2009 corpus under the PLEMMA column.",
        "The LEMMA column in the 2009 version of the corpus contains lemmas generated using the same algorithm but using the correct Treebank part-of-speech tags.",

        "The German in-domain dataset is based on the annotated verb instances of the SALSA corpus (Bur-chardt et al., 2006), a total of around 40k sentences.",
        "SALSA provides manual semantic role annotation on top of the syntactically annotated TIGER newspaper corpus, one of the standard German treebanks.",
        "The original SALSA corpus uses semantic roles in the FrameNet paradigm.",
        "We constructed mappings between FrameNet frame elements and PropBank argument positions at the level of frame-predicate pairs semi-automatically.",
        "For the frame elements of each frame-predicate pair, we first identified the semantically defined PropBank Arg-0 and Arg-1 positions.",
        "To do so, we annotated a small number of very abstract frame elements with these labels (Agent, Actor, Communicator as Arg-0, and Theme, Effect, Message as Arg-1) and percolated these labels through the FrameNet hierarchy, adding further manual labels where necessary.",
        "Then, we used frequency and grammatical realization information to map the remaining roles onto higher-numbered Arg roles.",
        "We considerably simplified the annotations provided by SALSA, which use a rather complex annotation scheme.",
        "In particular, we removed annotation for multi-word expressions (which may be non-contiguous), annotations involving multiple frames for the same predicate (metaphors, underspecification), and inter-sentence roles.",
        "The out-of-domain dataset was taken from a study on the multilingual projection of FrameNet annotation (Padó and Lapata, 2005).",
        "It is sampled from the EUROPARL corpus and was chosen to maximize the lexical coverage, i.e., it contains of a large number of infrequent predicates.",
        "Both syntactic and semantic structure were annotated manually, in the TIGER and SALSA format, respectively.",
        "Since it uses a simplified annotation schemes, we did not have to discard any annotation.",
        "For both datasets, we converted the syntactic TIGER (Brants et al., 2002) representations into dependencies with a similar set of head-finding rules used for the preparation of the CoNLL-X shared task German dataset.",
        "Minor modifications (for the conversion of person names and coordinations) were made to achieve better consistency with datasets of other languages.",
        "Since the TIGER annotation allows non-contiguous constituents, the resulting dependencies can be non-projective.",
        "Secondary edges were discarded in the conversion.",
        "As for the automatically constructed features, we used Tree-Tagger (Schmid, 1994) to produce the PLEMMA and PPOS columns, and the Morphisto morphology (Zielinski and Simon, 2008) for PFEAT.",
        "For Japanese, we used the Kyoto University Text Corpus (Kawahara et al., 2002), which consists of approximately 40k sentences taken from Mainichi Newspapers.",
        "Out of them, approximately 5k sentences are annotated with syntactic and semantic dependencies, and are used the training, development and test data of this year's shared task.",
        "The remaining sentences, which are annotated with only syntactic dependencies, are provided for the training corpus of syntactic dependency parsers.",
        "This corpus adopts a dependency structure representation, and thus the conversion to the CoNLL-2009 format was relatively straightforward.",
        "However, since the original dependencies are annotated on the basis of phrases (Japanese bunsetsu), we needed to automatically convert the original annotations to word-based ones using several criteria.",
        "We used the following basic criteria: the words except the last word in a phrase depend on the next (right) word, and the last word in a phrase basically depends on the head word of the governing phrase.",
        "Semantic dependencies are annotated for both verbal predicates and nominal predicates.",
        "The semantic roles (APRED columns) consist of 41 surface cases, many of which are case-marking postpositions such as ga (nominative), wo (accusative) and ni (dative).",
        "Semantic frame discrimination is not annotated, and so the PRED column is the same as the LEMMA column.",
        "The original corpus contains coreference annotations and inter-sentential semantic dependencies, such as inter-sentential zero pronouns and bridging references, but we did not use these annotations, which are not the target of this year's shared task.",
        "To produce the PLEMMA, PPOS and PFEAT columns, we used the morphological analyzer JU-",
        "MAN and the dependency and case structure analyzer KNP .",

        "This year's task has been demanding in several respects, but certainly the most difficulty came from the fact that participants had to tackle all seven languages.",
        "It is encouraging that despite this added affort the number of participating systems has been almost the same as last year (20 vs. 22 in 2008).",
        "There are several positive outcomes from this year's enterprise:",
        "• we have prepared a unified format and data for several very different lanaguages, as a basis for possible extensions towards other languages and unified treatment of syntactic depenndecies and semantic role labeling across natural languages;",
        "• 20 participants have produced SRL results for all seven languages, using several different methods, giving hope for a combined system with even substantially better performance;",
        "• initial results have been provided for three languages on out-of-domain data (being in fact quite close to the in-domain results).",
        "Only four systems tried to apply what can be described as joint learning for the syntactic and semantic parts of the task.",
        "(Morante et al., 2009) use a true joint learning formulation that phrases syntactico-semantic parsing as a series of classification where the class labels are concatenations of syntactic and semantic edge labels.",
        "They predict (a), the set of syntactico-semantic edge labels for each pair of tokens; (b), the set of incoming syntactico-semantic edge labels for each individual token; and (c), the existence of an edge between each pair of tokens.",
        "Subsequently, they combine the (possibly conflicting) output of the three classifiers by a ranking approach to determine the most likely structure that meets all well-formedness constraints.",
        "(Lluls et al., 2009) present a joint approach based on an extension of Eisner's parser to accommodate also semantic dependency labels.",
        "This architecture is similar to the one presented by the same authors in the past edition, with the extension to a second-order syntactic parsing and a particular setting for Catalan and Spanish.",
        "(Gesmundo et al., 2009) use an incremental parsing model with synchronous syntactic and semantic derivations and a joint probability model for syntactic and semantic dependency structures.",
        "The system uses a single input queue but two separate stacks and synchronizes syntactic and semantic derivations at every word.",
        "The synchronous derivations are modeled with an Incremental Sigmoid Belief Network that has latent variables for both syntactic and semantic states and connections from syntax to semantics and vice versa.",
        "(Dai et al., 2009) designed an iterative system to exploit the interconnections between the different subtasks of the CoNLL shared task.",
        "The idea is to decompose the joint learning problem into four subtasks - syntactic dependency identification, syntactic dependency labeling, semantic dependency identification and semantic dependency labeling.",
        "The initial step is to use a pipeline approach to use the input of one subtask as input to the next, in the order specified.",
        "The iterative steps then use additional features that are not available in the initial step to improve the accuracy of the overall system.",
        "For example, in the iterative steps, semantic information becomes available as features to syntactic parsing, so on and so forth.",
        "Despite these results, it is still not clear whether joint learning has a significant advantage over other approaches (and if yes, then for what languages).",
        "It is thus necessary to carefully plan the next shared tasks; it might be advantageous to bring up a similar task in the future once again, and/or couple it with selected application(s).",
        "There, (we hope) the benefits of the dependency representation combined with semantic roles the way we have formulated it in 2008 and 2009 will really show up."
