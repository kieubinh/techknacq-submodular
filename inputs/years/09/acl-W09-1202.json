        "The task of semantic role labeling is to label the senses of predicates in the sentence and labeling the semantic role of each word in the sentence relative to each predicate.",
        "The difficulty of this shared task is to perform joint task on dependency parsing and semantic role labeling.",

        "This section briefly describes the main components of our system: a) system flow; b) syntactic parsing; c) semantic role labeling; d) an iterative approach to perform joint syntactic-semantic parsing.",
        "As many systems did in CoNLL Shared Task 2008, the most direct way for such task is pipeline approach.",
        "First, Split the system into four subtasks: syntactic dependency parsing, syntactic dependency relation labeling, predicate sense labeling and semantic role labeling.",
        "Then, execute them one by one.",
        "In our system, we extend this pipeline system to an iterative system so that it can do a joint labeling to improve the performance.",
        "Our iterative system is based on the pipeline system.",
        "For the first iteration (original step), we use the pipeline system to parse and label the whole sentence.",
        "For the rest iterations (iterative step), we use another pipeline system to parse and label it.",
        "The structure of this pipeline is the same as the original one, but each subtask can have much more features than the original subtask.",
        "Because the whole sentence has been labeled in the original step, all information is available for every subtask.",
        "For example, when doing syntactic dependency relation labeling, we can add some features about sense and semantic role.",
        "It seems like using syntactic results to do semantic labeling, then using semantic results to improve syntactic labeling.",
        "This is the core idea of our joint system.",
        "Figure 1 shows the main flow of our system.",
        "In the dependency parsing step, we split the task into two sub-problems: syntactic dependency parsing and syntactic dependency relation labeling.",
        "In the syntactic dependency parsing stage, MSTParser, a dependency parser that searches for maximum spanning trees over directed graphs, is applied.",
        "Due to the differences between the seven languages, we use different parameters to train a parsing model.",
        "Specifically, as Czech and German languages are none-projective and the others are projective, we train Czech and German languages with parameter \"none-projective\" and the others with \"projective\".",

        "When labeling the sense of each predicate, we build a classification model for each predicate.",
        "As the senses of different predicates are usually unrelated even if they have the same sense label, this makes it difficult for us to use only one classifier to label them.",

        "The set of predicates in the training set cannot cover all predicates.",
        "For new predicates in the test set, no classification model can be found for them, and we build a most common sense for them.",

        "The usage of these two types of model is the same.",
        "The only difference is that they use different features.",
        "The iterative model can get more information, so they can use more features.",

        "The performance may be improved because the viewer is extended.",
        "Some structural error and semantic conflict can be fixed.",
        "Although the usage of the two types of model is the same, there are some differences when building the models.",
        "In the iterative step, all information is available for doing parsing and labeling.",
        "For example, when doing syntactic dependency relation labeling in the iterative step, the fields \"HEAD\", \"DEPREL\", \"PRED\" and \"APREDs\" are filled by the pervious iteration.",
        "So all these information can be used in the iterative step.",
        "This will cause one issue: use \"HEAD1\" to label \"HEAD2\".",
        "When training the model, \"HEAD1\" is golden.",
        "The classifier will build a model directly and let \"HEAD2\" equal to \"HEAD1\".",
        "However, in the iterative step, \"HEAD1\" is not golden, but such model makes it impossible to change the results..",
        "The iterative step will be useless.",
        "We design a simple method to avoid this issue.",
        "• Firstly, split the training set into N (N>1) subsets.",
        "• Secondly, for each subset, use the left N-1 subsets to build an original sub-model (use features in the pipeline step).",
        "• Thirdly, use each sub-model to label the corresponding subset.",
        "• Lastly, use these labeled N subsets to extract samples (use features in the iterative step) for building the iterative model.",
        "In this way, the \"HEAD1\" is not golden any more.",
        "And for each sub-task, we can use the similar method to build the original model and the iterative model.",
        "Moreover, in our system, we only build the iterative models for syntactic dependency relation labeling and semantic role labeling.",
        "For syntactic dependency parsing, we use an approach with very high time and space complexity, so it is not added to the iterative step.",
        "Thus, its results will not be changed in the iterative step.",
        "For sense labeling, we build classification models for every predicate.",
        "There are too many models and each model contains only a few classes.",
        "We think they are not suitable for building the iterative model.",
        "But, as its previous subtask (syntactic dependency relation labeling) is added to the iterative step, it is useful to add it to the iterative step.",
        "Though we do not build an iterative model for sense labeling, we can directly use its pipeline model.",
        "This is another advantage of our iterative model: if one subtask is not suitable for doing iterative labeling/parsing, we can use its pipeline model instead."
