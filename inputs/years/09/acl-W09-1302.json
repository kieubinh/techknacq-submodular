        "Clinical applications for decision support, biosurveillance and quality of care assessment depend on patient data described in unstructured, free-text reports.",
        "For instance, patient data in emergency department reports contain valuable indicators for biosurveillance applications that may provide early signs and symptoms suggestive of an outbreak.",
        "Quality assurance departments can use free-text medical record data to assess adherence to quality care guidelines, such as determining whether an MI patient was given an aspirin within twenty-four hours of arrival.",
        "In either application, one must consider how to address the question of time, but each of the applications requires a different level of temporal granularity: the biosurveillance system needs a coarse-grained temporal model that discerns whether the signs and symptoms are historical or recent.",
        "In contrast, the quality assurance system needs a fine-grained temporal model to identify the admission event, when (or if) aspirin was given, and the order and duration of time between these events.",
        "One important problem in natural language processing is extracting the appropriate temporal granularity for a given task.",
        "Many solutions exist for extracting temporal information, and each is designed to address questions of various degrees of temporal granularity, including determining whether a condition is historical or recent, identifying explicit temporal expressions, and identifying temporal relations among events in text.",
        "(Chapman et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2008; Irvine et al., 2008; Verhagen and Pus-tejovsky, 2008; Bramsen et al., 2006).",
        "We previously extended the NegEx algorithm in ConText, a simple algorithm that relies on lexical cues to determine whether a condition is historical or recent (Chapman et al., 2007).",
        "However, ConText performs with moderate recall (76%) and precision (75%) across different report types implying that trigger terms and simple temporal expressions are not sufficient for the task of identifying historical conditions.",
        "In order to extend work in identifying historical conditions, we conducted a detailed annotation study of potentially useful temporal classification features for conditions found in six genres of clinical text.",
        "Our three main objectives were: (1) characterize the temporal similarity and differences found in different genres of clinical text; (2) determine which features successfully predict whether a condition is historical, and (3) compare ConText to machine learning classifiers that account for this broader set of temporal features."

        "A few recent applications, such as TimeText and TN-TIES (Zhou et al., 2008; Irvine et al., 2008), identify medically relevant events from clinical texts and use temporal expressions to order the events.",
        "One method attempts to order temporal segments of clinical narratives (Bramsen et al., 2006).",
        "One key difference between these previous efforts and our work is that these systems identify all temporal expressions from the text and attempt to order all events.",
        "In contrast, our goal is to determine whether a clinical condition is historical or recent, so we focus only on temporal information related to the signs, symptoms, and diseases described in the text.",
        "Therefore, we ignore explicit temporal expressions that do not modify clinical conditions.",
        "If a condition does not have explicit temporal modifiers, we still attempt to determine the historical status for that condition (e.g., \"Denies cough\").",
        "In order to improve the ability to determine whether a condition is historical, we carried out this annotation study to identify any useful temporal information related to the clinical conditions in six clinical genres.",
        "Building on work in this area, we explored temporal features used in other temporal annotation studies.",
        "TimeML is a well-known standard for complex, temporal annotation.",

        "ConText, an extension of the NegEx algorithm, temporally classifies conditions as historical, recent, or hypothetical using lexical cues such as history, new, and if, respectively (Chapman et al., 2007).",
        "Drawing from these applications, we used state and temporal trigger terms like active, unchanged, and history to capture coarse, temporal information about a condition.",

        "An example of this is \"The patient is a 50 year old male with history of hypertension.\"",
        "Intuitively, one would think that a past tense verb would always predict historical; however, we found the presence of a past tense verb with no aspect was a feature only when the condition was in the Patient History section.",
        "Sometimes the absence of a verb in conjunction with another feature value predicted a condition as historical.",
        "For example, in the sentences \"PAST MEDICAL",
        "HISTORY: History of COPD.",
        "Also diabetes... \" also functioned as a trigger term that extended the scope of a previous trigger term, history, in the antecedent sentence.",
        "A few historical trigger terms were discovered as simple rules by the rule learners: no change, previous, known, status post, and history.",
        "A few rules incorporated both a trigger term and a particular section header value.",
        "One rule predicted historical if the trigger term was status post and the condition occurred in the History of Present Illness section.",
        "This rule would classify the condition CABG as historical in \"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is...status post CABG.\"",
        "One important detail to note is that a number of the temporal expressions categorized as Fuzzy Time also act as trigger terms, such as history and status post â€“ both of which were learned by J48.",
        "A historical trigger term did not always predict the category historical.",
        "In the sentence \"No focal sensory or motor deficits on history f history may suggest that the condition was not previously documented, but was interpreted as not presently identified during the current physical exam.",
        "Finally, sections appeared in the majority of JRip and RL historical rules: 4/8 simple rules and 13/18 compound rules.",
        "A few sections were consistently classified as historical: Past Medical History, Allergies, and Social History.",
        "One important point to address is that these sections were manually annotated.",
        "Our results revealed a few unexpected observations.",
        "We found at least two trigger terms indicated in the J48 rules, also and status post, which did not have the same predictive ability across report genres.",
        "For instance, in the statement \"TRANSFER DIAGNOSIS: status post coiling for left posterior internal carotid artery aneurysm,\" status post indicates the reason for the transfer as an inpatient from the Emergency Department and the condition is recent.",
        "In contrast, status post in a Surgical Pathology report was interpreted to mean historical (e.g., PATIENT HISTORY: Status post double lung transplant for COPD.)",
        "In these instances, document knowledge of the meaning of the section may be useful to resolve these cases.",
        "One other unexpected finding was that the trigger term chronic was predictive of recent rather than historical.",
        "This may seem counterintuitive; however, in the statement \"We are treating this as chronic musculoskeletal pain with oxycodone\", the condition is being referenced in the context of the reason for the current visit.",
        "Contextual information surrounding the condition, in this case treating or administering medication for the condition, may help discriminate several of these cases.",
        "Our third objective was to assess ConText in relation to the rules learned from manually annotated temporal features.",
        "J48 and ConText emphasized the use of trigger terms as predictors of whether a condition was historical or recent and performed with roughly the same overall accuracy.",
        "JRip and RL learned rules that incorporated other feature values including sections and temporal expressions, resulting in a 12% increase in historical recall over ConText and a 31% increase in historical recall over J48.",
        "Many of the rules we learned can be easily extracted and incorporated into ConText (e.g., trigger terms previous and no change).",
        "The ConText algorithm largely relies on the use of trigger terms like history and one section header, Past Medical History.",
        "By incorporating additional section headers that may strongly predict historical, ConText could potentially predict a condition as historical when a trigger term is absent and the header title is the only predictor as in the case of \"ALLERGIES: peanut allergy\".",
        "Although these sections header may only be applied to Emergency Department and Discharge Summaries, trigger terms and temporal expressions may be generalizable across genre of reports.",
        "Some rules do not lend themselves to ConText's trigger-term-based approach, particularly those that require sophisticated representation and reasoning.",
        "For example, ConText only reasons some simple durations like several day history.",
        "ConText cannot compute dates from the current visit to reason that a condition occurred in the past (e.g., stroke in March 2000).",
        "The algorithm performance would gain from such a function; however, such a task would greatly add to its complexity."
