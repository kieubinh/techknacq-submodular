        "With the explosive growth of the volume of published biomedical research, it is challenging to keep up to date with the underlying knowledge available in the form of free text.",
        "The necessity of understanding actions of individual biological components in system context rather than in isolation, extends the coverage of literature far beyond the capabilities of individual scientists.",
        "Text mining is an emerging field that attempts to deal with these challenges (Ananiadou and McHought, 2006; Cohen and Hersh, 2005; Spasic et al., 2005).",
        "Text mining requires a significant amount of domain knowledge.",
        "A large number of biomedical ontologies already exist, and hold much of the information.",
        "Some of the ontologies have been designed for modeling domain knowledge, e.g. FMA (Rosse and Mejino, 2003) and GO (Ashburner et al., 2000), others are developed for potential applications, e.g.",
        "MeSH (Lowe and Barnett, 1994) for indexing the medical literature.",
        "Whatever purposes the ontologies were built for, they are used to support text mining for tasks such as access to text, natural language processing, and information integration.",
        "Developers of text mining applications often look for appropriate ontologies that can be integrated into their systems, rather than develop new ontologies from scratch.",
        "The choice of ontology may, however, have a major impact on the performance of the text mining system, including the quality of the results.",
        "Selecting an appropriate ontology relies on evaluation and comparison of the available ontologies.",
        "Unfortunately, there is often a lack of documentation of the qualities of the ontologies.",
        "A number of methodologies for evaluating ontologies have been proposed, mainly for evaluating one ontology at a time.",
        "However, it is difficult for users by using these methods to make a decision on ontology selection.",
        "The various evaluation methods can be classified into three main categories: 1) Those that evaluate ontologies against a set of criteria defined by human (e.g. (Lozano and Gomez, 2004) suggests 160 criteria).",
        "Most of the evaluation criteria are from the point of view of ontology building.",
        "They are not applicable for the selection of ontologies for a particular application.",
        "2) Those that include methods to gather statistics about the nature of ontologies (e.g. (Gangemi et al., 2006) proposes 32 measures for depth, width, fan-out, etc).",
        "The problem for this kind of methods is that it is not clear how to use these statistics for ontology selection among alternatives.",
        "3) Those that are application-dependent evaluations.",
        "For example, ontologies are evaluated against a corpus in (Brewster et al., 2004) regarding the domain of an IE system, and (Porzel and Malaka, 2004) evaluates the quality of an ontology regarding a relation tagging task by using gold standard data tagged by human.",
        "While evaluating ontologies for the particular application is a relatively straightforward method, evaluations may be sensitive to the test dataset, and it may also be expensive to perform evaluations for many ontologies.",
        "In this paper we propose a framework for selecting the most appropriate ontology for a particular text mining application.",
        "The framework comprises three components for selection, and uses and extends some of existing ontology evaluation and validation methods regarding the requirements of text mining in the area.",
        "After a brief overview of the related work, we introduce our framework in section 3.",
        "In section 4 we show how to use the framework in the setting of selecting an ontology for the gene normalization system described in (Tan, 2008)."

        "In principle biomedical ontologies provide formal representations of domain knowledge for text mining in the area, but they are used for different purposes such as providing a model for storing, searching and querying a repository of text; providing domain knowledge for natural language processing; providing a framework for information integration; or several of the above purposes.",
        "Based on a literature study and experience in building systems, in this section we suggest criteria for selecting an ontology for a given biomedical text mining application.",
        "The criteria are organized in three components of a framework.",
        "Component 1",
        "In the first component the criteria for ontology selection are given in two dimensions: content and supporting technologies.",
        "The combined requirements from the two dimensions lead to a list of candidate ontologies.",
        "Content What are the requirements on the content of ontology given an application?",
        "We propose three characteristics to be considered,",
        "- Type What is the kind of the ontology required in the scenario?",
        "Ontologies can be distinguished into three basic types (Stenzhorn et al., 2005): top ontologies, e.g. BFO (Smith, 2004), contain only a restricted set of highly general classes, such as Function and Object, which are not tied to any particular domain of interest; top-domain ontologies, e.g. BioTop (Stenzhorn et al., 2005), contain all classes that are essentially needed to describe a certain domain, such as Organism, Cell and Tissue in the case of biology; and domain ontologies, e.g. GO (Ash-burner et al., 2000), contain classes that comprehensively describe a certain domain of interest.",
        "For example, for natural language processing tasks such as entity recognition, a topdomain ontology may be sufficient.",
        "- Scope What are the main subjects that need to be covered in a top-domain or domain ontology required by the application?",
        "For example, gene and disease are the domains that concern (Hristovski et al., 2005).",
        "- Representation What kind ofinformation needs to be present in the ontology?",
        "From a knowledge representation point of view, ontologies can have the following components: concepts, which represent sets or classes of entities in a domain; relations between concepts, instances, which represent the actual entities; and axioms, which represent facts that are always true in the topic area of the ontology (Lambrix et al., 2007).",
        "Which components should be present in the ontology, depends to some extent on the purpose of the ontology in the application.",
        "For example, if an ontology is used as resource for NLP in the application, components concepts and instances both may be necessary, but not relations and axioms.",

        "Do the locations of essential concepts in the is-a and part-of hierarchies meet the expectation?",
