        "Dictionaries of biomedical concepts (e.g. diseases, medical treatments) are critical source of background knowledge for systems doing biomedical information retrieval, extraction, and automated discovery.",
        "However, the rapid pace of biomedical research and the lack of constraints on usage ensure that such dictionaries are incomplete.",
        "Focusing on medical treatment concepts (e.g. drugs, medical procedures and medical devices), we have developed an unsupervised, iterative pattern learning approach for constructing a comprehensive dictionary of medical treatment terms from randomized clinical trial (RCT) abstracts.",
        "We have investigated different methods of seeding, either with a seed pattern or seed instances (terms), and have compared different ranking methods for ranking extracted context patterns and instances.",
        "When used to identify treatment concepts from 100 randomly chosen, manually annotated RCT abstracts, our medical treatment dictionary shows better performance (precision:0.40, recall: 0.92 and F-measure: 0.54) over the most widely used manually created medical treatment terminology (precision: 0.41, recall:",
        "Dictionary based natural language processing systems have been widely used in recognizing medical concepts from free text.",
        "For example, the MetaMap program is used to map medical text to concepts from the most widely used biomedical terminology, the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)",
        "Metathesaurus (Aronson, 2000).",
        "It identifies various forms of UMLS concepts in text and returns them as a ranked list using a five-step process: identifying simple noun phrases (NP's), generating variants of each phrase, finding matched phrases, assigning scores to matched phrases and composing mappings.",
        "However, its performance largely depends on the quality of the underlying UMLS Metathesaurus and its manually created rules and variants.",
        "One study has shown that, of the medical concepts identified by human subjects, more than 40% were not in UMLS (Pratt, 2003).",
        "Other examples of mapping text to controlled biomedical terminologies include (Cohen, 2005) and (Fang, 2006).",
        "Many other systems make heavy use of biomedical terminologies directly such as the work of Blaschke, et al.",
        "(Blaschke, 2002) and Friedman et al.",
        "(Friedman, 2001).",
        "Biomedical terminology is highly dynamic, both because biomedical research is itself highly dynamic, but also because there are essentially no constraints on the use of new terminological variants, making the terms used in free text quite different from the canonical forms listed in controlled terminologies.",
        "To contrast UMLS with actual text mentions, there are 150 different chemotherapy concepts in UMLS.",
        "The majority of these terms derive from the diseases they are used to treat.",
        "For example cancer chemotherapy, AIDS chemotherapy, brain disorder chemotherapy, and alcoholism chemotherapy.",
        "On the other hand, we have identified more than 1,000 different chemotherapy types mentioned in RCT (Randomized Clinical Trial) report abstracts, with most of the names derived from the chemicals contained in the chemotherapy regimen, such as platinum-based chemotherapy or fluorouracil-based chemotherapy.",
        "There is little overlap between the chemotherapy terms in UMLS and the ones used in RCT abstracts.",
        "Even for simple drug names as 5-fluorouracil and tamox-ifen, there are many clinically distinct and important variants of these drugs which are absent in UMLS as distinct terms/concepts, such as intralesional 5-fluorouracil, topical 5-fluorouracil, intrahepatic arterial 5-Fluorouracil, adjuvant sequential tamox-ifen, and neoadjuvant tamoxifen.",
        "There has been considerable work on expanding the coverage of biomedical dictionaries through morphological variants, but these approaches require an initial term dictionary with reasonable extensive coverage.",
        "Examples include the approaches developed by Krauthammer and Nenadic (Krauthammer, 2004), Tsuruoka and Tsujii (Tsu-ruoka, 2004) & (Tsuruoka, 2003), Bodenreider, et al.",
        "(Bodenreider, 2002), and Mukherjea and colleagues (Mukherjea, 2004).",
        "An important shortcoming with static, human derived terminologies that cannot easily be addressed by looking for variants of existing terms is the fact that continual developments in medical therapies constantly gives rise to new terms.",
        "Examples include, Apomab, Bap-ineuzumab, Bavituximab, Etaracizumab, and Figi-tumumab.",
        "These all represent a new generation of targeted biological agents currently in clinical trials none of which appear in UMLS.",
        "Clearly we need to develop techniques to deal with this dynamic terminology landscape.",
        "MEDLINE is the most extensive and authoritative source of biomedical information.",
        "Large quantities of biomedical text are available in MEDLINE's collection of RCT reports with over 500,000 abstracts available.",
        "RCT reports are a critical resource for information about diseases, their treatments, and treatment efficacy.",
        "These reports have the advantage of being highly redundant (a disease or treatment name is often reported in multiple RCT abstracts), medically related, coherent in writing style, trustworthy and freely available.",
        "In our recent study (Xu, 2008), we have developed and evaluated an automated, unsupervised, iterative pattern learning approach for constructing a comprehensive disease dictionary from RCT abstracts.",
        "When used to identify disease concepts from 100 manually annotated clinical abstracts, the disease dictionary shows significant performance improvement (F1 increased by 35-88%) over UMLS and other disease terminologies.",
        "It remained to be demonstrated that these bootstrapping techniques are indeed rapidly retargetable and can be extended to other situations, and so we have extended our scope to investigate medical treatment names in addition to disease terms in this work.",
        "Our approach is inspired by the framework adopted in several bootstrapping systems for learning term dictionaries, including (Brin, 1998), (?",
        "), and (Agichtein, 2000).",
        "These approaches are based on a set of surface patterns (Hearst , 1992), which are matched to the text collection and used to find instance-concept relations.",
        "Similar systems include that of Snow and colleagues (Snow, 2005), which integrates syntactic dependency structure into pattern representation and has been applied to the task of learning instance-of relations, and the approach developed of Caprosaso, et al.",
        "(Caprosaso, 2007) which focussed on learning text context patterns to identify mentions of point mutations.",
        "All iterative learning systems suffer from the inevitable problem of spurious patterns and instances introduced in the iterative process.",
        "To analyze different approaches to addressing this issue, we have compared three different approaches to ranking extracted patterns and three different approaches to ranking extracted instances.",
        "Because such systems also depend on an initial seeding with either a seed pattern or term instance, an important question is whether these different starting points lead to different results.",
        "We investigated this issue by starting from each point separately and compared the final results."

        "Our instance ranking assigns high confidence scores to common and non specific terms like this drug, the treatment or this procedure since they are often associated with highly ranked patterns many times.",
        "These anaphoric terms often refer to treatment names previously specified.",
        "There are at least two ways to address this problem.",
        "The first is to assign low scores to terms starting with a determiner such as the or this.",
        "Another way to improve the instance ranking algorithm is to take into account of the overall context of the term.",
        "For example, these anaphora often appear in specific sections of RCT reports such as the result section, and refer to terms from previous sections.",
        "Specific examples include \"Treatment with this drug should be attempted in intractable cases\" (PMID 09038009) and \"The efficacy of the treatment was 88 and 95%o in group 1 and 2, respectively\" (PMID 14520944).",
        "The terms from title, background or conclusion sections could be assigned higher scores than the ones from result section.",
        "Beyond these simple heuristics, more sophisticated approaches might take advantage of the work in anaphora resolution, such as (Baldwin, 2001).",
        "The lexicon consists of terms with mixed hierarchies, including general terms as chemotherapy, surgery, corticosteroids, antibiotics, and specific terms as fluorouracil, oral or intravenous 5-Fluorouracil, cisplatin, nephrectomy.",
        "In order to make this dictionary more useful, additional work is needed to organize the terms and build ontologies based on the lexicon.",
        "Previous work has shown that learning multiple semantic types simultaneously can improve precision (Thelen, 2002) & (Curran, 2007), and it remains to be seen if that approach can be combined with the prioritization of pattern and extracted instance rankings here to give better overall performance.",
        "Other possible extensions and improvements include various approaches to slow the learning process and discover new patterns and instances more conservatively, at the expense of more iterations.",
        "Further improvements can be expected from integrating active learning approaches to include the involvement of a human judge in the process, analogous to the tag-a-little, learn-a-little method proposed as part of the Alembic Workbench (Day, 1997).",
        "Because our approach ranks both extracted patterns and instances, it is amenable to such techniques.",
        "Indeed, active learning has been found to provide considerable gains in corpus annotation model for semi-automated terminology compilation.",
