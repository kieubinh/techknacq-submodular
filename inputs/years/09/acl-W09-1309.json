        "These parameters were set to the same values that were used when the system was applied to general biomedical terms (Stevenson et al., 2008) since these were found to perform well.",

        "Performance of our system on this task is higher than would be expected for most WSD tasks suggesting that the problem of abbreviation disambiguation is simpler than the disambiguation of general terms.",
        "The most probable reason for this is that the various expansions of abbreviations in our corpus are more distinct and better defined than senses for general terms.",
        "For example, the three possible expansions for \"ANA\" in our corpus are a professional body (\"American Nurses Association\"), a type of medical test (\"antinuclear\") and a neurotransmitter (\"Anandamide\").",
        "It is likely that these diverse meanings will tend to occur in very different contexts and in documents with different topics.",
        "On the other hand it is widely accepted that distinctions between possible meanings of words in natural language are often vague (Kilgarriff, 1993).",
        "It is likely that clearer distinctions between possible expansions of abbreviations make the task of identifying the correct one more straightforward than identifying meanings of ambiguous words.",
        "In addition, the creation of annotated data for WSD is often hampered by the difficulty in obtaining sufficient agreement between annotators (Artstein and Poesio, 2008; Weeber et al., 2001) and this problem does not apply to our automatically-generated corpus.",
        "Results in Table 2 indicate that CUIs are useful features in the disambiguation of abbreviations.",
        "This is in contrast with previous experiments on ambiguous terms in biomedical documents (Stevenson et al., 2008) in which it was found that the best performance as obtained using only linguistic and MeSH features.",
        "It is likely that the clear distinction between expansions of abbreviations is the reason behind this difference.",
        "CUIs are assigned automatically by the MetaMap program (Aronson, 2001).",
        "However, this assignment is very noisy.",
        "It is likely that the various expansions of abbreviations are distinct enough for this noise to be tolerated by the learning algorithms while it causes problems when the meanings are closer together, such as in the case of ambiguous terms.",
        "Table 3 shows the performance of the best WSD system (VSM learning algorithm with all features) for each abbreviation in the three subsets of our corpus.",
        "Our system performs well for all abbreviations.",
        "Accuracy is no lower than 92% for any abbreviation using Corpus.100 and no lower than 97% for Cor-pus.300, demonstrating that the approach is robust.",
        "In fact, the approach still performs well for abbreviations with low baseline scores, such as \"APC\", \"BPD\" and \"LAM\".",
        "It is interesting to note that the abbreviations with the lowest performance tend to have expansions that are closely related.",

        "This paper has presented an approach to the disambiguation of ambiguous abbreviations in biomedical documents.",
        "We treat this problem as a form of WSD and apply a system that combines a wider range of features than have been previously applied, including those which are commonly used within",
        "WSD systems in addition to information from two domain-specific knowledge sources.",
        "The approach is evaluated using a corpus of abbreviations automatically mined from Medline and found to identify the correct expansion with accuracy of up to 99%.",
        "This figure is higher than previously reported results for abbreviation disambiguation systems, although direct comparison is difficult due to the use of different data sets.",
        "It was also found that best performance could be obtained using a simple machine learning algorithm and a diverse range of knowledge sources.",
        "Performance of our system is higher than is normally achieved by WSD systems when applied to general terms and we suggest that the reason for this is that the various expansions of abbreviations are better defined and more distinct than the senses of ambiguous words.",
        "This study has been limited to the disambiguation of abbreviations consisting of exactly three letters.",
        "Possibilities for future work include experimenting with abbreviations of various lengths.",
