        "The task of identifying the organisms which are involved in research described in biomedical articles is extremely important for the field of biomedical information extraction (IE), both in itself and in connection with other tasks.",
        "In itself, because the concept of biological taxonomy is basic for every researcher: organisms and their taxonomic classification can be used very effectively in various contexts, for example to restrict searches, a classical information retrieval (IR) task.",
        "At the same time, any biomedical text mining system would be incomplete without the possibility to use organisms as concepts, e.g. in finding (statistical) associations, which can",
        "* Corresponding author",
        "then be used to form hypotheses about causal relations.",
        "The necessity of identifying organisms is even more evident as part of other important entity recognition tasks in biomedical information extraction (IE), e.g. identification and disambiguation of proteins mentioned in the literature.",
        "For example, within the PPI task (identification of protein-protein interactions) of Biocreative II (Krallinger et al., 2008), the identification of the focus organism was seen by many participants as an essential subtask in order to properly disambiguate protein names.",
        "Protein interactions are fundamental for most biological processes, therefore they are at the focus of a huge and fast growing number of biomedical papers.",
        "As these cannot all be read or even inspected by the researchers, databases such as IntAct (Kerrien et al., 2006) or MINT (Zanzoni et al., 2002) try to create a reliable catalogue of experimentally detected interactions by extracting them \"manually\" from the literature through the usage of human experts.",
        "This is known as \"curation\", a costly and time-consuming process, which could be speeded up much by efficient, robust and precise extraction tools.",
        "One of the most important obstacles for efficient automatic identification of proteins is the extreme ambiguity of the commonly used protein names in the literature.",
        "The fragmentation of the biomedical scientific community into lots of extremely specialized sub-communities seems to be the main reason for this ambiguity.",
        "In most cases, the ambiguity is between homologous proteins of different species.",
        "Any human reader belonging to the sub-community concerned can, in general, disambiguate an ambiguous protein name like \"goat\" (which can refer to proteins found in four different organisms: human, rat, mouse and zebrafish), as the species is obvious to them from the context.",
        "However, this ambiguity remains problematic for IE systems (and even for curators in some cases) and needs to be solved before more complex tasks, such as protein interaction detection, can be effectively tackled (Rinaldi et al., 2008).",
        "Our goal is to be able to identify automatically the focus organisms, i.e. the organisms that are mentioned in the paper as the hosts of the experiments described, or as the sources of the entities involved.",
        "This information can then be used for tagging papers for more efficient organism-based information retrieval, or, more commonly, for the disambiguation of other entities mentioned in the same paper.",
        "Since organism recognition is normally performed with reference to a taxonomical organization (of Linnean origin) of all known organisms (in our case, the NCBI taxonomy) this task is often referred to as \"TX task\".",
        "In the rest of this paper we describe in section 2 the resources used and the approach followed in order to extract and rank candidate organisms.",
        "In section 3 we present our results and propose a more fine grained interpretation of the task, which we again evaluate.",
        "Finally in section 4 we compare our approach to previous work and discuss its limitations."

        "Our approach can be described briefly as (1) find all explicit mentions of organisms either by their scientific or \"common\" names; (2) count these mentions and combine the resulting numbers with a simple use of statistics to arrive at a ranked list or a simple set of organisms which can be used, among other things, to disambiguate ambiguous protein names in the article under investigation.",
        "The first step for this approach was to choose a widely accepted taxonomy which not just includes unambiguous identifiers for all known organisms, but also provides a sufficiently large list of names for them.",
        "The taxonomy selected for this was the NCBI Taxonomy.",
        "As most of these organism are unlikely to ever occur in biomedical literature, we decided to restrict our interest to the organisms for which a UniProt organism mnemonic identifier exists.",
        "UniProt (UniProt Consortium, 2007) is a database containing detailed information about known proteins, obtained by a process of curation of the biomedical literature.",
        "For every protein, a \"mnemonic\" identifier is defined (e.g. HBAJTUMAN for \"Human Hemoglobin A\") which is composed by a shorthand for the protein name and a simple unique identifier for the organism.",
        "Within the UniProt entry for the protein, the organism is also referred to by its NCBI identifier, allowing the construction of a mapping from the mnemonic identifiers for the organisms used by UniProt to their equivalent NCBI identifiers.",
        "The set of organism that have a UniProt mnemonic identifier (11,444 organisms) probably covers the near totality of organisms that have been subject to research in molecular biology.",
        "In the NCBI taxonomy 31,733 names are defined for that subset of organisms.",
        "Although several classes of names are defined by NCBI, for the purpose of this work we distinguish only between \"scientific names\" and the other classes (pooled together as \"common names\").",
        "As an additional source of information, we used the IntAct database of protein interactions for two different purposes:",
        "• to derive statistical measures used later by the program, most importantly the frequency of each focus organism in papers curated by IntAct (using the IntAct annotations as the sources of the 'focus').",
        "• to derive a gold standard against which our programs could be tested",
        "IntAct provides an annotated set of protein interactions.",
        "Each interaction is enriched with detailed information about the two proteins involved",
        "names.dmp connects one or several names (619,325) of different nameclasses (such as \"scientific\" or \"common\") to each node.",
        "The nodes (taxa) are referred to by numeric identifiers.",
        "(from which the reference organisms can be recovered), and with the identifier of the paper from which the interaction was originally derived in the curation process.",
        "This allows to build a gold standard by associating each paper to its focus organisms.",
        "The sample used in our experiments is a set of 621 PubMed-indexed full text articles, dating from 1995 to 2007, for which IntAct annotations are available.",
        "As an initial experiment, we performed a simple lexical lookup of the names of the 11,444 organisms under consideration.",
        "In previous applications of IE techniques for biomedical literature (Kappeler simple techniques for the generation of variants of the known names significantly benefited the recall of the application.",
        "For example, multiword protein names can be subject to a number of minor variants, such as the introduction of hyphens or the separation of compound words, which make automatic recognition more challenging.",
        "In the case of organism names, although our initial expectations were similar, we found the benefit (in terms of additional recall) of such variants to be extremely limited, possibly because names of species are used more consistently than the names of proteins or genes.",
        "Therefore it was possible to implement a simpler approach to recognition of organism names, based on lexical lookup against a database containing all names of interest, coupled with a simple normalization step which removes trivial orthographic differences (such as hyphens) between the key word in the database and the lookup word from the document (for details see (Kaljurand et al., 2009)).",
        "The inclusion of other biomedical NE's (such as protein names, method names, cell line names) in the database together with a strict implementation of the \"longest match\" principle leads to better precision by eliminating false positives caused by matching organism names with a fragment of a multiword term for another entity (such as the method \"yeast two-hybrid\").",
        "As mentioned, the names provided by the NCBI taxonomy have been classified into \"scientific names\" or \"common names\".",
        "Using only \"scientific names\" appeared as an effective way to obtain better precision, but we soon discovered that precision of the common names suffered most by a few very bad names, such as \"Li\", which is a \"common name\" for LIV (Louping ill virus) in the taxonomy, but appears only (and very frequently) as Chinese surname in the texts.",
        "By eliminating about 25 of similar misleading \"common names\" the results of this class rose to the same level as the \"scientific names\", so there was no reason to exclude the whole class (as that would have harmed recall).",
        "Since the bibliography might contain spurious mentions of other organisms, we automatically removed it from the main text.",
        "However, contrary to expectations, this did not lead to better results for this task (at least after the elimination of the misleading \"common names\" mentioned above), but was not reversed because of its effects on other tasks.",
        "An intuition from other tasks was to use the abstracts instead of the full text of the articles, because that would tend to exclude accidental mentions of organisms leading to false positives.",
        "But a main problem of this approach is that many abstracts do not yield any organism mentions.",
        "Whenever they do though, their precision is high.",
        "So there is a strong case for giving the mentions there a higher weight, but obviously the rest of the article plays an important role as well.",
        "We experimentally found that counting an \"abstract mention\" as equivalent to 25 \"fulltext mentions\" worked best.",
        "An experiment using all names provided by NCBI and considering all mentions of those names in the fulltext version of each article led to a recall of 83%, leading us to conclude that either the taxonomy does not contain all names used, or some organisms are suggested to the human reader by the context and/or his anticipations.",
        "The first of these problems was adressed by adding some generated names to the termbase, the second by the use of a default.",
        "Several possible ways of generating new names automatically from the names in the database were considered, but only two were applied successfully, as described below.",
        "One of them was the automatic generation of additional names from the nameclass \"scientific name\" (for organisms of species or subspecies level) by the process of replacing the first word (which would be the genus name in the classical Linnean binomial nomenclature) by its first letter and a dot.",
        "The resulting names, such as \"E. coli\", are widely used, but not included in the taxonomy.",
        "A seemingly large disadvantage of this approach is its potential for ambiguity: 338 of the resulting names refer to more than one organism.",
        "But the test on our sample showed that of these only 4 occurred at all, only 1 more than once: \"C. elegans\" (potentially referring to the organisms identified in UniProt as",
        "CAEEL, CENEL, CESEL and CUNEL) which always stood for CAEEL, i.e. \"Caenorhabditis ele-gans\".",
        "So excluding the other options for \"C. ele-gans\" eliminated the ambiguity (at least in our sample).",
        "We observed that this type of name is in frequent use only for few species and in this case the unabbreviated name is often used first, so the addition of this generated nameclass added little to recall.",
        "The other type of name missing from the taxonomy is the use of the (Linnean) genus name for a very frequent species, e.g. \"Arabidopsis\" used for \"Arabidopsis thaliana\".",
        "Experiments showed that this type could not be reliably generated automatically from the \"scientific names\", as this name-class includes many names which do not follow the rules of Linnean binomial nomenclature, mostly virus names such as \"Human papillomavirus type me180\" where the first word is generally not a genus name, but a host name.",
        "So the problem of (potentially huge) ambiguity in this type of names was not even researched, instead the names of this type for the most frequent organisms were generated manually and those which improved the results were included into the termbase (Saccharomyces, Arabidopsis, Drosophila, Escherichia, Xenopus and Synechocystis).",
        "The addition of this generated nameclass did not add much to recall for the same reason as for the first group: in most cases the unabbreviated name appears in the paper as well.",
        "Together both groups improved recall by about 3.4%.",
        "As HUMAN is the most frequent organism in this context, it was obvious that a default HUMAN would take care of many cases where human readers disambiguate ambiguous protein names even without any explicit mentions of this species.",
        "As there are no cases (with the current termbase and sample) of articles with no organism mentions in the full text, we chose to have a default triggered by no findings in the abstract.",
        "Experiments showed that – contrary to intuition – a weight of the default proportional to the total number of mentions (just adding a percentage to HUMAN) would lead to worse results than an absolute value for the default.",
        "The simple approach of considering every mention of each organism (after excluding the misleading common names, as described above), leads to a precision of only 27.6%, therefore the list of organism identifiers obtained in this way has to be considered as a \"candidates list\" from which a selection has to be made.",
        "Candidates can be of course ranked according to number of mentions in each article.",
        "A ranking based on the mention counts, taking into account the correction factor of 25 for mentions in the abstract (as described in section 2.2), was still far from optimal, so we multiplied the mentions with the relative frequencies of the organisms in a micro-averaged frequency table (table 1) computed over all of IntAct (not just our sample, to avoid overfitting) and smoothed roughly by attributing 1% of the probability mass to all unseen organisms (over 11,000).",
        "This ranking did far better than expected and after normalizing the whole list to 1, a minimal threshold for the score could be set up to maximize the f-score by improving precision at the cost of recall.",
        "The actual value of the threshold (currently 0.04) is of course arbitrary, depending on what measure one wants to maximize.",

        "The advantage of our approach resides in its simplicity, since it does not require a specifically designed training set, being based only on publicly available standard databases.",

        "As long as only one organism is selected as the focus of a given research publication, this is a rather trivial task.",

        "In that case, organism mentions would need to be 'localized' within the article in order to serve for disambiguation purposes, as done in (Wang and Matthews, 2008).",

        "One important limitation of our approach is its reliance on explicit mentions of organisms by their names as stored in the termbase (or minor variants thereof).",
        "Using all the names available to us (including cell lines) and their variants we could so far achieve only a maximal value of 88% recall, which means that 12% of the organisms are not referred to by any name in our resources.",
        "This may be due to either missing names in the termbase (the organisms are mentioned, but by different names) or because they are identified by human readers through other contextual hints which may consist of any sort of in-formation, and may presuppose massive amounts of background knowledge.",
        "The first problem might be adressed by adding other sources of names to our termbase.",
        "The second problem might be adressed by using a machine learning approach, which however brings with it a whole set of new problems, such as selection and representation of the features relevant for training, as well as the fact that a sufficiently large training corpus needs to be available.",
        "Another limitation of our approach is the fact that its development and testing rests on its application to the identification of either organisms of protein interactors or host organisms.",
        "The original formulation of the goal that motivated this work was \"to identify automatically the organisms forming part of the subject matter of scientific papers\".",
        "This leaves open the question of the application of the results, and is deliberately vague in the wording \"part of the subject matter\", which includes but is not confined to the cases mentioned above.",
        "This formulation was motivated by a desire to keep the task as generic as possible, so that the resulting application could not only be used as a module for the protein disambiguation task, but also for other tasks of NE disambiguation with respect to organisms, as well as for organism identification as an independent task.",
        "Additionally, the ranked list of candidate organisms delivered by our program could also be presented to human users, who might want to use them in novel ways, for example in an assisted curation environment.",
        "However, the gold standard by which we test our results is tailored to its application as a protein disambiguation module, just as the frequency tables we use.",
        "Even apart from this, the appropriateness of the gold standard is partly questionable, as it does not only prefer organisms involved in protein interactions to those that are not, but also \"new\" knowledge to \"old\" knowledge, etc.",
        "Our approach, based on \"correcting\" simple counts of organism mentions using frequency tables, can only be successful as long as there is a gold standard for the specific application that is being pursued.",
        "We can derive from IntAct useful gold standards for organisms from which protein interactors are derived or host organisms, but we have no gold standard for \"organism identification\" as an independent task."

        "In this paper we discussed an approach to the problem of \"organism identification\" as an independent task, based only on standard resources.",

        "We have shown that a clear identification of the different functional roles played by organism mentions can lead to more accurate results.",
        "Although a fully automated disambiguation process based on organism mentions is not within immediate reach, the results described in this paper appear already potentially useful for protein name disambiguation in a curation environment.",
