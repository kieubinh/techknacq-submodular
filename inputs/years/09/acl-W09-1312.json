        "The summary field, when available, can help biologists to understand the target gene quickly by compressing a huge amount of knowledge from many papers to a small piece of text.",
        "At present, gene summaries are generated manually by the National Library of Medicine (NLM) curators, a time-and labor-intensive process.",

        "The goal of this work is to develop and evaluate computational techniques towards automatic generation of gene summaries.",

        "Finally, redundant sentences are removed and top ranked sentences are nominated for the target gene.",

        "In contrast, we evaluated our system intrinsically on a much larger dataset consisting of 7,294 human genes, each with a preexisting handwritten summary downloaded from the NCBI's FTP site.",
        "The handwritten summaries were used as reference summaries (i.e. a gold standard) to compare with the automatically generated summaries.",
        "Although the length of reference summaries varies, the majority of these summaries contain 80 to 120 words.",
        "To produce a summary of similar length, we decided to select five sentences consisting of about 100 words.",

        "It provides a set of evaluation metrics to measure the quality of a summary by counting overlapping units such as n-grams or word sequences between the generated summary and its reference summary.",
        "We computed three ROUGE measures for each summary, namely ROUGE-1 (unigram based), ROUGE-2 (bigram based) and ROUGE-SU4 (skip-bigram and unigram) (Lin and Hovy, 2003).",
        "Among them, ROUGE-1 has been shown to agree most with human judgments (Lin and Hovy, 2003).",
        "However, as biomedical concepts usually contain more than one word (e.g. transcription factor), ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-SU4 scores are also important for assessing gene summaries.",
        "The two important parameters in our system - the linear coefficient a for the combination of PageRank and GO scores and the diversity penalty degree factor CO in redundancy removal - are investigated in detail on a collection of 100 randomly selected genes.",
        "First, by setting a to values from 0 to 1 with an increment of 0.1 while holding CO steady at 0.7, we observed the highest ROUGE-1score when awas 0.8 (Figure 2).",
        "This suggests that the two scores (i.e. PageRank and GO score) complement to each other and that the PageRank score plays a more dominating role in the summed score.",

        "The statistics for low ROUGE-1 score are listed in Table 6.",

        "In this paper we have presented a system for generating gene summaries by automatically finding extract-worthy sentences from the biomedical literature.",
        "By using the state-of-the-art summarization techniques and incorporating gene specific annotations, our system is able to generate gene summaries more accurately than the baseline methods.",
        "Note that we only evaluated our system for human genes in this work.",
        "More summaries are available for human genes than other organisms, but our method is organism-independent and can be applied to any other species.",
        "This research has implications for real-world applications such as assisting manual database cu-ration or updating existing gene records.",
        "The ROUGE scores in our evaluation show comparable performance to those in the newswire summarization (Hickl et al., 2007).",
        "Nonetheless, there are further steps necessary before making our system output readily usable by human curators.",
        "For instance, human curators are generally in favor of sentences presented in a coherent order.",
        "Thus, information-ordering algorithms in multi-document summarization need to be investigated.",
        "We also plan to study the guidelines and scope of the curation process, which may provide additional important heuristics to further refine our system output."
