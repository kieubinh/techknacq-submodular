        "Identifying serious infectious disease outbreaks in their early stages is an important task, both for national governments and international organizations like the World Health Organization.",
        "Text mining and information extraction systems can provide an important, low cost and timely early warning system in these circumstances by identifying the first signs of an outbreak automatically from online textual news.",
        "One interesting characteristic of disease outbreak reports – which to the best of our knowledge has not been studied before – is their use of speculative language (hedging) to describe uncertain situations.",
        "This paper describes two uses of hedging to enhance the BioCaster disease outbreak report text mining system.",
        "Following a brief description of the BioCaster system and corpus (section 2), we discuss in section 3 previous uses of hedging in NLP and the methods used to identify hedges in the current work.",
        "In section 4 we describe some initial classification experiments using hedge features.",
        "Section 5 describes a \"speculative\" method of tagging disease outbreak reports with a metric designed to aid users of the BioCaster system in identifying articles of interest."

        "The BioCaster system scans online news reports for stories concerning infectious disease outbreaks (e.g. H5N1, Ebola) and makes its results available to registered users as email alerts (Collier et al., 2008).",
        "In addition to this email service, data that has been filtered through a topic classifier but which is still uninterpreted is used to populate a Google Map application called the Global Health Monitor.",
        "The BioCaster corpus consists of 1000 news articles downloaded from the WWW and then manually categorized and annotated with Named Entities by two PhD students.",
        "Articles were collected from various news sources (e.g. BBC, New York Times and ProMED-Mail).",
        "Each document is classified as either relevant (350) or reject (650).",
        "The corpus is designed to include difficult borderline cases where more advanced understanding of the context is required.",
        "For example, an article may be about, say, polio, but not centrally concerned with specific outbreaks of that disease.",
        "Instead, the article could report a vaccination campaign or research breakthrough."

        "Users of the BioCaster system would benefit from an indicator of how \"speculative\" each news article is, as breaking news regarding disease outbreaks is characterized by uncertainty, which is encoded using hedging.",
        "We use the Mercer list of 105 hedging words as described above, in conjunction with statistics derived from a 10,000 document section of the Reuters corpus to provide a \"speculative\" metric.",
        "We calculated total frequencies for all 105 hedge words in each of the 10,000 Reuters documents – that is, the total number of hedge words per document – then ranked these frequencies (after normalizing the frequencies to take account of document length).",
        "The bottom third of documents had hedge percentages in the range 0% - 0.2544% (Low).",
