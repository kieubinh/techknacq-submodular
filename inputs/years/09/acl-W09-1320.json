        "Clinicians wishing to practice evidence-based medicine need to keep up with a vast amount of ever changing research to be able to use the current best evidence in individual patient care (Sackett et al., 1996).",
        "This can be difficult for time-pressed clinicians, although methods such as systematic reviews, evidence summaries and clinical guidelines can help to translate research into practice.",
        "In a survey commissioned by Doctors.net.uk, 97% of doctors and nurses said that they would find a Question Answering (QA) Service useful, where they can ask questions in their own words (Bryant and Ringrose 2005).",
        "Studies have also shown that clinicians often want answers to particular questions, rather than getting information on broad topics (Chambliss & Conley, 1996; Ely et al., 1999, 2005).",
        "A type of question that clinicians commonly want answered are comparison questions.",
        "In a corpus of clinical questions collected from the National Library of Health (NLH) Question Answering Service (http://www.clinicalanswers.nhs.uk), approximately 16% of the 4580 questions concern comparisons of different drugs, different treatment methods or different interventions as in (1).",

        "In order to identify questions about comparisons that should trigger special purpose search and extraction mechanisms, as well as identifying explicit comparisons made in text, one needs to recognize constructions commonly used to express comparisons in English (i.e. similarities and/or differences between two or more entities).",
        "In this paper, the term \"entity\" refers to drugs, treatment methods or interventions, and the initial focus of the work is on comparative questions in which two or more drugs or interventions are compared with respect to a particular criterion such as efficacy in treating a certain disease.",
        "This reflects their common occurrence in the NLH corpus.",
        "Comparisons can appear in either a comparative form or a superlative form.",
        "The comparative form is used to compare two or more entities with respect to a certain attribute.",
        "The superlative form compares or contrasts one entity with a set of other entities and expresses the end of a spectrum.",
        "The following examples illustrate the difference:",
        "Comparative form:",
        "Is Ibuprofen better than Paracetamol for treating pain?",
        "Superlative form:",
        "Is Ibuprofen the best treatment for pain?",
        "Friedman (1989) developed one of the first computational treatments of comparative structures.",
        "Comparisons are challenging because they correspond to a diverse range of syntactic forms such as coordinate or subordinate conjunctions, adverbial constructions or wh-relative-like clauses.",
        "Comparisons are cross-categorical and encompass adjectives, quantifiers, and adverbs.",

        "Regular adjectives and adverbs:",

        "In two cases (2% of the abstracts), doses of a given drug were compared against other dosages instead of the drugs themselves, e.g. 30 mg lansoprazole versus 20mg omeprazole.",
        "A major factor for \"not relevant\" judgments was the time frame.",
        "This was relevant when retrieving abstracts about well-established drugs that have been in existence for a long time, such as ibuprofen or diclofenac.",
        "All but one of the 18 abstracts retrieved for the two questions about these two drugs were irrelevant, even though the two drugs were explicitly mentioned in the abstract.",
        "The problem is that they were grouped together as conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and compared to newer NSAIDs or different pain medication.",
        "Such abstracts could only be excluded by analyzing the abstracts themselves.",
        "Whether to proceed systematically back through the abstracts ordered by recency, or to retrieve abstracts from a random time interval, or from a window of n-years after the drug came on the market, will be a matter to be assessed empirically.",
        "The final source of \"non relevant\" judgments was a problem with the judges and not with the abstracts.",
        "In Question 2 regarding dyspepsia, two out of seven abstracts were judged irrelevant because the drugs were not explicitly compared regarding dyspepsia but only regarding H. pylori, which is one of the possible causes for dyspepsia.",
        "Also abstracts retrieved for Question 7 about the effect on lipid profiles were wrongly categorised by roughly a third of the judges as not being relevant to the liver.",
        "The experiment has shown that searching for the drugs, the basis of the comparison and studies of the publication type comparative study is a first step towards retrieving abstracts that can serve as answer candidates for clinical comparison questions, but it has been shown not to be sufficient to guarantee the relevance of the retrieved abstracts.",
        "The two main problems discovered during the experiment that need to be addressed in further processing steps for the retrieved abstracts concern abstracts lacking sentences in which the drugs are directly compared to each other and the retrieval of irrelevant abstracts for well-established drugs, which are used as a reference for comparing newer drugs to, instead of containing direct comparisons of the drugs in question."
