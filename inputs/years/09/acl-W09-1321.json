        "On the other hand, the extraction of linguistically-oriented semantics from text has long been studied in computational linguistics, and has recently been formalized as Semantic Role Labeling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), and semantic structure extraction (Baker et al., 2007)(Surdeanu et al., 2008).",

        "Our preliminary result illustrates the gap between the two type of semantics, and a relationship between them.",
        "We discuss development of a Text Mining (TM) system, in association with the extraction of linguistically-oriented semantics, which has been studied independently of TM.",
        "First, our result would show that TM involves at least two qualitatively different tasks.",
        "One task is related to our results; that is, recognizing equivalent events which are expressed from different perspectives, and hence expressed by using different linguistic frames, and at the same time distinguishing event mentions which share the same linguistic frame but belong to different domain classes.",
        "Our investigation indicates that this task is mainly dependent on domain knowledge and how a phenomenon can be conceptualized.",
        "Another task of TM is the extraction of linguistically-oriented semantics, which basically maps various syntactic realizations to the shared structures.",
        "In order to develop a TM system, we need to solve the two difficult tasks.",
        "Second, TM could benefit from linguistically-oriented frames by using them as an intermediating layer between text and domain-oriented information.",
        "The domain-oriented semantic structures, which is a target of TM, are inevitably dependent on the domain.",
        "On the other hand, the extraction of linguistically-oriented semantics from text is less dependent.",
        "Therefore, using the linguistically-oriented structure could be favorable to domain portability of a TM system.",
        "Our aim was explicitly linking linguistically-oriented and domain-oriented semantics of the bio-molecular articles, and the preliminary result show the possibility of the extraction of linguistically-oriented semantics contributing to TM.",
        "Further investigation of the relationship would be a important step forward for TM in the bio-molecular domain.",
        "Our investigation was preliminary.",
        "For example, conversions from FN structures to GENIA event structures, depicted in figures 4 and 5, were based on manual investigation.",
        "Further, they were attested by limited samples in the corpus.",
        "For our results to contribute to a TM system, evaluation of the conversions and automatic extraction of such conversions must be considered."
