        "The National Library of Medicine (NLM) has published a collection of 4,653 questions that can be freely downloaded from the Clinical Questions Collection website and includes the questions below:",
        "Question 1 : The maximum dose of estradiol valerate is 20 milligrams every 2 weeks.",
        "We use 25 milligrams every month which seems to control her hot flashes.",
        "But is that adequate for osteoporosis and cardiovascular n",
        "disease prevention?",
        "Question 2: \"Child has pectus carinatum.",
        "Radiologist told Dr. X sometimes there are associated congenital heart problems.",
        "Dr. X wants to study up on this.",
        "Does the patient",
        "have these associated problems?",
        "Such examples show that clinicians pose complex questions of a far greater sophistication than the simple term searches that typical information retrieval systems require as input.",
        "Ask-HERMES, however, has been designed to handle such complexity as it encounters it.",
        "In recent years, there has been an emergence of numerous search engines - both open domain and domain-specific - as well as question answering systems, and these systems have employed a variety of methods for presenting their results, including the use of metadata, sentences, snippets, and passages.",
        "PubMed (Anon 2009a) and EAGLi (Anon 2009b), for example, use article metadata to present their results, and the combination of title, author name and publication name that they use works like the citation at the end of a paper to provide users with a general idea of what the listed article is about.",
        "On the other hand, AnswerBus (Anon 2009c) and AnswerEngine (Anon 2009d) extract sentences from relevant articles, then rank and list them one by one to answer the questions that users have.",
        "In response to a query, Google and other general search engines provide the title of a work plus a snippet of text to provide metadata as well as multiple matching hints from articles.",
        "In response to user questions, Start (Anon 2009e), Powerset(Anon 2009f) and Ask (Anon 2009g) provide a single passage as output, making them ideal for answering simple questions because they do not require users to access and read extra articles in order to answer the questions they have.",
        "Each of these methods of presentation has strengths and weaknesses.",
        "First, a strength of using metadata is that it provides a way for discovering the general idea of an article, but it does not explain to a user why the article is relevant to the query or question, making it difficult to decide whether it is worth the time and effort to access the listed article to read more.",
        "An approach presenting a single sentence in response to a query can result in a good answer if the user is lucky but typically provides a limited idea of what the target article contains and demands that users access the source of the item to learn more.",
        "A snippet-based approach can provide a hint as to why the target article is relevant, but snippets are limited in that they are composed of segments and usually cannot be read at all; even presenting a snippet with metadata as Google does is not suitable for adequately answering many questions.",
        "We propose a passage-based approach in which each passage is constructed by coherent sentences.",
        "The approach we propose is similar to that used by Start and Ask, but these systems have limited knowledge bases and require queries to be written using very specific question types.",
        "On the other hand, our system will be able to answer ad hoc questions (that is, questions not limited to specific types).",
        "Furthermore, the system we propose will be oriented toward answering questions in the biomedical community, a field in which automated question answering and information retrieval and extraction are in strong demand."

        "We classify physician evaluations as being of the following four types and plot their distribution in Figure 5:",

        "â€¢ Passage Better: Passage-based approach presents more useful information for answering the question.",
        "â€¢ Sentence Better: Sentence-based approach provides the same amount of useful information while reducing the effort required by the passage-based approach.",
        "Sentence Hard Better Question 15% 20%",
        "The evaluation data is shown in Table 1.",
        "In our study, the score range is set from 0 to 5 with the value 0 referring to answers that are totally irrelevant to the question and the value 5 meaning there is enough information to fully answer the question.",
        "Our results show that the passage-based approach is better than the sentence-based approach (p-value < 0.05).",
        "Through further analysis of the results, we found that 70% of the sentences yielded by the sentence-based approach did not answer the question at all (the score is zero), while this was true for only 40% of the output of the passage-based approach.",
        "This indicates that the passage-based approach provides more evidence for answering questions by providing richer context and matching across sentences.",
        "On the other hand, if the question was too general and included a plethora of detail and little focus, both approaches failed.",
        "For example, in the question \"One year and 10-month-old boy removed from his home because of parental neglect.",
        "Caretaker says he often cries like he's in pain, possibly abdominal pain.",
        "Not eating, just drinking liquids, not sleeping.",

        "there is a great deal of description of the boy, and a variety of common symptoms are also provided.",

        "But since these words are so commonly used in a variety of scenarios, the output passage is off-topic.",
        "For very simple questions, the sentence-based approach works well for providing answers in a very concise form.",
        "For example, the question \"what is the dose of zyrtec for a 3-year-old?\"",
        "can be answered by the dosage amount for the target age group, and the query resulted in this answer: \"...children of both sexes aged between 2 to 6 years with allergy rhinitis (AR) were included in this study, who were randomly selected to be treated with Zyrtec (Cetirizine 2 HCL) drops 5 mg daily for 3 weeks.\"",
        "From a literal view, this looks like an answer to the question because it discusses the dosage of Zyrtec for the specific age group; however, it actually describes an experiment and does not necessarily provide the suggested dosage that the user is seeking.",
        "This leads to an interesting problem for clinical question answering: how should experimental data be distinguished from suggestion data for recommended daily usage?",
        "People tend to ask for the best answer instead of the possible answers.",
        "This is one of the main reasons why in Table 1, there is no perfect score (5).",

        "The results of both Lin's research and our own indicate the usefulness of context, but Lin's work focuses on how surrounding context helps users to understand and become confident in answers retrieved by simple open-domain queries, while our research reveals that adjacent sentences can improve the quality of answers retrieved using complex clinical questions.",

        "2003), our study addresses the usefulness of context for answering complex clinical questions and its ability to improve answer quality instead of just adding surrounding context to the specific answer.",
        "While conducting this investigation, we noticed that simple continuous sentence-based passage constructions have limitations in that they have no semantic boundary and will form too long a passage if the question contains many common words.",
        "Therefore, we will take advantage of recent advances we have made in HTML page analysis components to split documents into paragraphs and use the paragraph as the maximum passage, that is, a passage will only group sentences that appear in the same paragraph.",
        "Furthermore, by setting the boundary at a single paragraph, we can loosen the adjacency criterion of our current approach, which requires that the sentences in a passage be next to each other in the original source, and instead adopt a requirement that they only be in the same paragraph.",
        "This will enable us to build a model consisting of one or more core sentences as well as several satellite sentences that could be used to make the answer more complete or understandable."
