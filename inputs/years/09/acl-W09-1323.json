        "It is estimated that each year 800,000 die by suicide worldwide (World Health Organization, 2001).",
        "In the United States, suicide ranks second as the leading cause of death among 25-34 year-olds and the third leading cause of death among 15-25 year-olds (Kung et al., 2008).",
        "The challenge for those who care for suicide attempters, such as an Emergency Medicine clinicians, is to assess the likelihood ofan-other attempt, a more lethal one.",
        "We believe to fully asses this risk a tool must be developed that measures both the biological and cognitive state of the patient.",
        "Such a tool will include Biological Markers (Bm): measured by the concentration of certain biochemical markers, Thought Markers (Tm): measured by artifacts of thought that have been reduced to writing or transcribe speech, and Clinical Markers (Cm): measured by traditional clinical risk factors.",
        "In this study we focus on the Tm because of BioNLP's important role.",
        "Here, we employ machine-learning analysis to examine suicide notes and how these notes compare to newsgroups.",
        "This is one experiment in a series of experiments that are intended to provide insight into how best to apply linguistic tools when responding to suicidal patients.",
        "To gain insight into the suicidal mind, researchers have suggested empirically analyzing national mortality statistics, psychological autopsies, nonfatal suicide attempts and documents such as suicide notes (Shneidman and Farberow, 1957; Maris, 1981).",
        "Most suicide notes analysis has focused on classification and theoretical-conceptual analysis.",
        "Content analysis has been limited to extracting explicit information from a suicide note, e.g., length of the message, words, and parts of speech (Ogilvie et al., 1969).",
        "Classification analysis uses data such as age, sex, marital status, educational level, employment status and mental disorder (Ho et al., 1998; Girdhar et al., 2004; Chavez et al., 2006; Demirel et al., 2007).",
        "Only a very few studies have utilized theoretical-conceptual analysis , despite the assertion in the first formal study of suicide notes (Shnei-dman and Farberow, 1957) that such an analysis has much promise.",
        "So, the inconclusive nature of the methods of analysis has limited their application to patient care.",
        "Our own research has taken a different approach.",
        "In particular we first wanted to determine if modern machine learning methods could be applied to free-text from those who committed suicide.",
        "Our first experiment focused on the the ability of machine learning to distinguish between real suicide notes and elicited suicide notes as well as mental health professionals.",
        "This is an important question since all current care is based on a mental health profession's interpretation.",
        "Our findings showed that mental health professionals accurately selected genuine suicide notes 50% of the time and the supervised machine learning methods were accurate 78% (Pestian et al., 2008).",
        "In this study we shift from supervised to unsupervised machine learning methods.",
        "Even though these methods have rich history we know of no research that has applied them to suicide notes.",
        "Our rationale for this study, then, is that since our ultimate goal is to create a Suicide Risk Index that incorporates biological and thought markers it is important to determine if unsupervised methods can distinguish between suicidal and non-suicidal writings.",
        "To conduct this research we developed a corpus of over 800 suicide notes from individuals who had committed suicide, as opposed to those who attempted or ideated about suicide.",
        "This is an important contribution and, as far as we know, it is the largest ever developed.",
        "It spans 70 years of notes, and now includes multiple languages.",
        "Details of this corpus are described below.",
        "We also created a corpus of data from various newsgroups that acted as non-suicidal writings.",
        "These corpora were used to conduct the analysis.",
        "The sections below describe the cluster analysis process and results.",
        "Suicide Notes Corpus",
        "Data for the suicide note database were collected from around the United States.",
        "They were either in a hand written or typed written form.",
        "Once the note was acquired it was scanned into the database.",
        "Optical character recognition was attempted on the typed written notes, but not accurate, so the notes were read from the scanned version and type into the database exactly as seen.",
        "A second person reviewed what was typed.",
        "There were limitation in collecting deceased demographics.",
        "The table 1 provides various descriptive statistics.",
        "Newsgroup Corpus",
        "Newsgroup data was selected because it was convenient and as close to normal discourse as we could find.",
        "We understood that and ideal comparison group would be composed of Internet blogs or emails that were written by suicide ideators.",
        "True, a Google query of \"suicide blog\" yields millions of response, a review of many of these responses shows that the data are of little use for this analysis.",
        "In our opinion, the next suitable corpora was found in a 20 newsgroup collection from the University of California in Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository .",
        "Most of the newsgroups have no relevance to suicide notes.",
        "Since our hypothesis is that unsupervised learning methods can tell the difference between suicidal and non-suicidal writing we selected discussions that we believed may have some similarity to suicide writings.",
        "This selection was based on reviewing the newsgroups with experts.",
        "We had conjectured that if an unsupervised method could distinguish between similar clusters those methods could distinguish between dissimilar clusters.",
        "The newsgroups ultimately selected were talk.politics.guns, talk.politics.mideast, talk.politics.misc, talk.religion.misc.",
        "Each newsgroup contains 1000 articles (newsgroup postings).",
        "Headers and quotes from other postings were removed."
