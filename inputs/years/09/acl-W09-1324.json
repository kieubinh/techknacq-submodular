        "The use of electronic texts in hospitals is increasing rapidly everywhere.",
        "This study specifically examines discharge summaries, which are reports generated by medical personnel at the end of a patient's hospital stay.",
        "They include massive clinical information about a patient's health, such as the frequency of drug usage, related side-effects, and correlation between a disease and a patient's actions (e.g., smoking, drinking), which enables unprecedented large-scale research, engendering promising findings.",
        "Nevertheless, it is not easy to extract clinical information from the reports because these reports are written in natural language.",
        "An example of a discharge summary is presented in Table 1.",
        "The table shows records that are full of medical jargon, acronyms, shorthand notation, misspellings, and sentence fragments (Tawanda et al., 2006).",
        "To address this problem, this paper presents a proposal of a system that extracts medical events and date times from a text.",
        "It then converts them into a table structure.",
        "We designate this system TEXT2TABLE, which is available from a web site .",
        "The extraction method, which achieves a high accuracy extraction, is based on Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001).",
        "Another problem is posed by events that do not actually occur, i.e., future scheduled events, events that are merely intended to take place, or hypothetical events.",
        "As described herein, we call such non-actual events negative events.",
        "Negative events are frequently mentioned in medical records; actually, in our corpus, 12% of medical events are negative.",
        "Several examples of negative events (in italic letters) are presented below:",
        "(1) no headache (2) keep appointment of radiotherapy (3) .. will have intravenous fluids (4) .. came for radiotherapy (4') .. came for headache (5) Every week radiation therapy and chemical therapy are scheduled (6) Please call Dr. Smith with worsening headache or back pain, or any other concern.",
        "Negative events have two characteristics.",
        "First, various words and phrases indicate that an event is negative.",
        "For this study, such a word or phrase that makes an event negative is called a negative trigger.",
        "For instance, a negation word \"no\" is a negative trigger in (1).",
        "A noun \"appointment\" in (2) is a negative trigger.",
        "Similarly, the auxiliary \"will\" in (3) signals negation.",
        "More complex phenomena are presented in (4) and (4').",
        "For instance, \"radiotherapy\" in (4) is a negative event because the therapy will be held in the future.",
        "In contrast, \"headache\" in (4') is not negative because a patient actually has a \"headache\".",
        "These indicate that a simple rule-based approach (such as a list of triggers) can only imply classification of whether an event is negative or not, and that information of the event category (e.g., a therapy or symptom) is required.",
        "Another characteristic is a long scope of a negative trigger.",
        "Although negative triggers are near the descriptive words of events in (1)-(4), there could alternatively be a great distance of separation, as portrayed in (5) and (6).",
        "In (5), a noun coordination separates a negative trigger from the event.",
        "In (6), the trigger \"please\" renders all events in that sentence negative.",
        "These indicate that neighboring words are insufficient to determine whether an event is negative or not.",
        "To deal with (5), syntactic information is helpful because the trigger and the event are neighboring in the dependency structure, as portrayed in Fig. 2.",
        "To deal with (6), bag-of-word (BOW) information is desired.",
        "Because of the observation described above, this paper presents a proposal of a classifier: whether an event is negative or not.",
        "The proposed classifier uses various information, the event category, neighboring words, BOW, and dependent phrases.",
        "The point of this paper is two-fold: (1) We propose a new type of text-summarizing system (TEXT2TABLE) that requires a technique for a negative event identification.",
        "(2) We investigate what kind of information is helpful for negative event identification.",
        "The experiment results revealed that, in spite of the risk of parsing error, syntactic information can contribute to performance, demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed approach.",
        "Although experiments described in this paper are related to Japanese medical reports, the proposed method does not depend on specific languages or domains.",
