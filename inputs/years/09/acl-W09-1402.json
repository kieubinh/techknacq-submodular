        "The purpose of this shared task was to competitively evaluate information extraction systems targeting complex events in the biomedical domain.",
        "Such an evaluation helps to establish the relative merits of competing approaches, allowing direct comparability of results in a controlled setting.",
        "The shared task was the first competitive evaluation of its kind in the BioNLP field as the extraction of complex events became possible only recently with the introduction of corpora containing the necessary annotation: the GENIA event corpus (Kim et al., 2008a) and the Biolnfer corpus (Pyysalo et al., 2007).",
        "The objective of the primary task (Task 1) was to detect biologically relevant events such as protein binding and phosphorylation, given only annotation of named entities.",
        "For each event, its class, trigger expression in the text, and arguments need to be extracted.",
        "The task follows the recent movement in BioNLP towards the extraction of semantically typed, complex events the arguments of which can also be other events.",
        "This results in a nested structure that captures the underlying biological statements more accurately compared to the prevailing approach of merely detecting binary interactions of pairs of biological entities.",
        "Our system is characterized by heavy reliance on efficient, state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and a wide array of features derived from a full dependency analysis of each sentence.",
        "The system is a pipeline of three major processing steps: trigger recognition, argument detection and semantic post-processing.",
        "By separating trigger recognition from argument detection, we can use methods familiar from named entity recognition to tag words as event triggers.",
        "Event argument detection then becomes the task of predicting for each trigger-trigger or trigger-named entity pair whether it corresponds to an actual instantiation of an event argument.",
        "Both steps can thus be approached as classification tasks.",

        "The overall architecture of the system is shown in Figure 1.",
        "All steps in the system process one sentence at a time.",
        "Since 95% of all annotated events are fully contained within a single sentence, this does not incur a large performance penalty but greatly reduces the size and complexity of the machine learning problems.",
        "We represent the extraction target in terms of semantic networks, graphs where the nodes correspond to named entities and events, and the edges correspond to event arguments.",
        "The shared task can then be viewed as the problem of finding the nodes and edges of this graph.",
        "For instance, nested events are naturally represented through edges connecting two event nodes.",
        "The graph representation of an example sentence is illustrated in Figure 2D.",
        "We have previously used this graph representation for information extraction (Heimonen et al., 2008; Björne et al., 2009) as well as for establishing the connection between events and syntactic dependency parses in the Stanford scheme of de Marneffe and Manning (2008) (Björne et al., 2008).",
        "We cast trigger detection as a token labeling problem, that is, each token is assigned to an event class, or a negative class if it does not belong to a trigger.",
        "Triggers are then formed based on the predicted classes of the individual tokens.",
        "Since 92% of all triggers in the data consist of a single token, adjacent tokens with the same class prediction form a single trigger only in case that the resulting string occurs as a trigger in the training data.",
        "An event node is created for each detected trigger (Figure 2B).",
        "In rare cases, the triggers of events of different class share a token, thus the token belongs to several separate classes.",
        "To be able to approach trigger detection as a multi-class classification task where each token is given a single prediction, we introduce combined classes as needed.",
        "For instance the class gene expression/positive regulation denotes tokens that act as a trigger to two events of the two respective classes.",
        "Note that this implies that the trigger detection step produces at most one event node per class for any detected trigger.",
        "In the shared task, however, multiple events of the same class can share the same trigger.",
        "For instance, the trigger involves in Figure 2 corresponds to two separate regulation events.",
        "A separate post-processing step is introduced after event argument detection to duplicate event nodes as necessary (see Section 2.4).",
        "Due to the nature of the GENIA event annotation principles, trigger detection cannot be easily reduced to a simple dictionary lookup of trigger expressions for two main reasons.",
        "First, a number of common textual expressions act as event triggers in some cases, but not in other cases.",
        "For example, only 28% of the instances of the expression activates are triggers for a positive regulation event while the remaining 72% are not triggers for any event.",
        "Second, a single expression may be associated with various event classes.",

        "This is in contrast to sequence labeling problems such as named entity recognition, where a sequential model is typically employed.",
        "The classifier is trained on goldstandard triggers from the training data and incorporates a wide array of features capturing the properties of the token to be classified, both its linear and dependency context, and the named entities within the sentence.",
        "Token features include binary tests for capitalization, presence of punctuation or numeric characters, stem using the Porter stemmer (Porter, 1980), character bigrams and trigrams, and presence of the token in a gazetteer of known trigger expressions and their classes, extracted from the training data.",
        "Token features are generated not only for the token to be classified, but also for tokens in the immediate linear context and dependency context (tokens that govern or depend on the token to be classified).",

        "For each trigger detector and each token, the classifier confidence scores of the top five classes are renormalized into the [0,1] interval.",

        "Setting the correct precision-recall trade-off in trigger detection is very important.",
        "On one hand, any trigger left undetected directly implies a false negative event.",
        "On the other hand, the edge detector is trained on gold standard data where there are no event nodes without arguments, which creates a bias toward predicting edges for any event node the edge detector is presented with.",
        "On the development set, essentially all predicted event nodes are given at least one argument edge.",
        "We optimize the precision-recall trade-off explicitly by introducing a parameter //, 0 < //, that multiplies the classifier confidence score given to the negative class, that is, the \"no trigger\" class.",
        "When // < 1, the confidence of the negative class is decreased, thus increasing the possibility of a given token forming a trigger, and consequently increasing the recall of the trigger detector (naturally, at the expense of its precision).",
        "Both trigger detection parameters, the interpolation weight A and the precision-recall trade-off parameter / , are set experimentally using a grid search to find the globally optimal performance of the entire system on the development set, using the shared task performance metric.",
        "The parameters are thus not set to optimize the performance of trigger detection in isolation; they are rather set to optimize the performance of the whole system.",
        "After trigger detection, edge detection is used to predict the edges of the semantic graph, thus extracting event arguments.",
        "Like the trigger detector, the edge detector is based on a multi-class SVM classifier.",
        "We generate examples for all potential edges, which",
        "Figure 3: The distribution of event argument edge lengths measured as the number of dependencies on the shortest dependency path between the edge terminal nodes, contrasted with edge lengths measured as the linear token distance.",
        "are always directed from an event node to another event node (event nesting) or from an event node to a named entity node.",
        "Each example is then classified as theme, cause, or a negative denoting the absence of an edge between the two nodes in the given direction.",
        "It should be noted that even though event nodes often require multiple outgoing edges corresponding to multiple event arguments, all edges are predicted independently and are not affected by positive or negative classifications of other edges.",
        "The feature set makes extensive use of syntactic dependencies, in line with many recent studies in biomedical information extraction (see, e.g. (Kim et al., 2008b; Miwa et al., 2008; Airola et al., 2008; Van Landeghem et al., 2008; Katrenko and Adriaans, 2008)).",
        "The central concept in generating features of potential event argument edges is the shortest undirected path of syntactic dependencies in the Stanford scheme parse of the sentence which we assume to accurately capture the relationship expressed by the edge.",
        "In Figure 3, we show that the distances among event and named entity nodes in terms of shortest dependency path length are considerably shorter than in terms of their linear order in the sentence.",
        "The end points of the path are the syntactic head tokens of the two named entities or event triggers.",
        "The head tokens are identified using a simple heuristic.",
        "Where multiple shortest paths exist, all are considered.",
        "Most features are built by combining the attributes of multiple tokens (token text,",
        "POS tag and entity or event class, such as protein or binding) or dependencies (type such as subject and direction relative to surrounding tokens).",
        "N-grams are generated by merging the attributes of 2 – 4 consecutive tokens.",
        "N-grams are also built for consecutive dependencies.",
        "Additional tri-grams are built for each token and its two flanking dependencies, as well as for each dependency and its two flanking tokens.",
        "These N-grams are defined in the direction of the potential event argument edge.",
        "To take into account the varying directions of the dependencies, each pair of consecutive tokens forms an additional bigram defining their governor-dependent relationship.",
        "Individual component features are defined for each token and edge in a path based on their attributes which are also combined with the token/edge position at either the interior or the end of the path.",
        "Edge attributes are combined with their direction relative to the path.",
        "Semantic node features are built by directly combining the attributes of the two terminal event/entity nodes of the potential event argument edge.",
        "These features concatenate both the specific types of the nodes (e.g. protein or binding) as well as their categories (event or named entity).",
        "Finally, if the events/entities have the same head token, this self-loop is explicitly defined as a feature.",
        "Frequency features include the length of the shortest path as an integer-valued feature as well as an explicit binary feature for each length.",
        "The number of named entities and event nodes, per type, in the sentence are defined for each example.",
        "We have used this type of edge detector with a largely similar feature set previously (Bjorne et al., 2009).",
        "Also, many of these features are standard in relation extraction studies (see, e.g., Buyko et al.",
        "(2008)).",
        "The semantic graph produced by the trigger and edge detection steps is not final.",
        "In particular, it may contain event nodes with an improper combination of arguments, or no arguments whatsoever.",
        "Additionally, as discussed in Section 2.2, if there are events of the same class with the same trigger, they are represented by a single node.",
        "Therefore, we introduce a rule-based post-processing step to refine",

        "In Task 1, the allowed argument edges in the graph are 1) theme from an event to a named entity, 2) theme or cause from a regulation event (or its subclasses) to an event or a named entity.",
        "Edges corresponding to invalid arguments are removed.",
        "Also, directed cycles are broken by removing the edge with the weakest classification confidence score.",
        "After pruning invalid edges, event nodes are duplicated so that all events have a valid combination of arguments.",
        "For example, the regulation event involves in Figure 2C has two cause arguments and therefore represents two distinct events.",
        "We thus duplicate the event node, obtaining one regulation event for each of the cause arguments (Figure 2D).",
        "Events of type gene expression, transcription, translation, protein catabolism, localization, and phosphorylation must have exactly one theme argument, which makes the duplication process trivial: duplicate events are created, one for each of the arguments.",
        "Regulation events must have one theme and can additionally have one cause argument.",
        "For these classes we use a heuristic, generating a new event for each theme-cause combination of outgoing edges (Figure 4A).",
        "Binding is the only event class that can have multiple theme arguments.",
        "There is thus no simple way of determining how multiple outgoing theme edges should be grouped (Figure 4B).",
        "We apply a heuristic that first groups the arguments by their syntactic role, defined here as xthe first dependency in the shortest path from the event to the argument.",
        "It then generates an event for each pair of arguments that are in different groups.",
        "In the case of only one group, all single-argument events are generated.",
        "Finally, all events with no arguments as well as regulation events without a theme argument are iteratively removed until no such event remains.",
        "The resulting graph is the output of our event extraction system and can be losslessly converted into the shared task format (Figure 2D&E).",
        "We now briefly describe some of the alternative directions explored during the system development, which however did not result in increased performance, and were thus not included in the final system.",
        "Whether the reason was due to the considered approaches being inadequate for the extraction task, or simply a result of the tight time constraints enforced by the shared task is a question only further research can shed light on.",
        "For the purpose of dividing the extraction problem into manageable subproblems, we make strong independence assumptions.",
        "This is particularly the case in the edge detection phase where each edge is considered in isolation from other edges, some of which may actually be associated with the same event.",
        "Similar assumptions are made in the trigger detection phase, where the classifications of individual tokens are independent.",
        "A common way to relax independence assumptions is to use N-best re-ranking where N most-likely candidates are re-ranked using global features that model data dependencies that could not be modelled in the candidate generation step.",
        "The best candidate with respect to this re-ranked order is then the final prediction of the system.",
        "N-best re-ranking has been successfully applied for example in statistical parsing (Charniak and Johnson, 2005).",
        "We generated the ten most likely candidate graphs, as determined by the confidence scores of the individual edges given by the multi-class SVM.",
        "A perfect re-ranking of these ten candidates would lead to 11.5 percentage point improvement in the overall system F-score on the development set.",
        "While we were unable to produce a re-ranker sufficiently accurate to improve the system performance in the time given, the large potential gain warrants further research.",
        "In trigger word detection, we experimented with a structural SVM incorporating Hidden Markov Model type of sequential dependencies (Altun et al., 2003; Tsochantaridis et al., 2004), which allow conditioning classification decisions on decisions made for previous tokens as well as with a conditional random field (CRF) sequence classifier (Lafferty et al., 2001).",
        "Neither of these experiments led to a performance gain over the multiclass SVM classifier.",
        "As discussed previously, 4.8% of all annotated events cross sentence boundaries.",
        "This problem could be approached using coreference resolution techniques, however, the necessary explicit corefer-ence annotation to train a coreference resolution system is not present in the data.",
        "Instead, we attempted to build a machine-learning based system to detect cross-sentence event arguments directly, rather than via their referring expression, but were unable to improve the system performance."

        "The high rank achieved in the BioNLP'09 Shared Task competitive evaluation validates the approach taken in building the system.",
        "While the performance is currently the highest achieved on this data, the F-score of 51.95% indicates that there remains considerable room for further development and improvement.",
        "We use a unified graph representation of the data in which the individual processing steps can be formulated as simple graph transformations: adding or removing nodes and edges.",
        "It is our experience that such a representation makes handling the data fast, easy and consistent.",
        "The choice of graph representation is further motivated by the close correlation of these graphs with dependency parses.",
        "As we are going to explore the interpretation and applications of these graphs in the future, the graph representation will likely provide a flexible base to build on.",
        "Dividing the task of event extraction into multiple subtasks that can be approached by well-studied",
        "Table 3: Effect of the trigger detector (Trig), edge detector (Edge), and post-processing (PP) on performance on the development set (1789 events).",
        "The AF column indicates the effect of replacing the predictions (pred) of a component with the corresponding gold standard data (GS), i.e. the maximal possible performance gain obtainable from further development of that component.",
        "methods proved to be an effective approach in developing our system.",
        "We relied on state-of-the-art machine learning techniques that scale up to the task and allow the use of a considerable number of features.",
        "We also carefully optimized the various parameters, a vital step when using machine learning methods, to fine-tune the performance of the system.",
        "In Section 2.5, we discussed alternative directions pursued during the development of the current system, indicating possible future research directions.",
        "To support this future work as well as complement the description of the system in this paper we intend to publish our system under an open-source license.",
        "This shared task represents the first competitive evaluation of complex event extraction in the biomedical domain.",
        "The prior research has largely focused on binary interaction extraction, achieving after a substantial research effort F-scores ofslightly over 60% (see, e.g., Miwa et al.",
        "(2008)) on AIMed, the de facto standard corpus for this task.",
        "Even if a direct comparison of these results is difficult, they suggest that 52% F-score in complex event extraction is a non-trivial achievement, especially considering the more detailed semantics of the extracted events.",
        "Further, complex event extraction is still a new problem – relevant corpora having been available for only a few years."
