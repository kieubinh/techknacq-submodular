        "Case-based reasoning (CBR) (Aamodt & Plaza, 1994) is the machine learning method that was used for extracting the terms and events here proposed and consists of first learning cases from the training documents, by means of saving them in a base of case, and further retrieving a case the most similar to a given problem during the testing step, from which will be given the final solution, hereafter called \"case-solution\".",
        "One of the advantages of the CBR algorithm is the possibility of getting an explanation of why to a given token has been attributed a certain category, by means of checking the features that compose the case-solution.",
        "Additionally, and due to the complexity of the tasks, a rule-based post-processing step was built in order to map the previously extracted terms and events among themselves.",
        "In this first step, documents of the training dataset are tokenized according to spaces and punctuations.",
        "The resulting tokens are represented in the CBR approach as cases composed of some predefined features that take into account the morphology and grammatical function of the tokens in the text as well as specific features related to the problem under consideration.",

        "Regarding the features that compose a case, these were the ones that were considered during the training and development phases: the token itself (token); the token in lower case (lowercase); the stem of the token (stem); the shape of the token (shape); the part-of-speech tag (posTag); the chunk tag (chunkTag); a biomedical entity tag (entityTag); the type of the term (termType); the type of the event (eventType); and the part of the term in the event (eventPart).",
        "The stem of a token was extracted using an available Java implementation of the Porter algorithm (Porter, 1980), while the part-of-speech, chunk and bio-entity tags were taken from the GENIA Tagger (Tsuruoka et al., 2005).",
        "The shape of a token is given by a set of characters that represent its morphology: \"a\" for lower case letters, \"A\" for upper case letters, \"1\" for numbers, \"g\" for Greek letters, \"p\" for stopwords, \"$\" for identifying 3-letters prefixes or suffixes or any other symbol represented by itself.",

        "No repetition is allowed in the case of the \"a\" symbol for the lower case letters.",

        "False Negatives",
        "Decision for a case (3): this class of error is due to the selection of a wrong case-solution and we include in this class mistakes due to two situations: when the system fails to find any case-solution for an event token (false negative) or when a case-solution is found for a non-event token (false positive).",
        "The first situation is only dependent of the searching strategy and its two parameters (MMF and MFC) while the second one is also related to the post-processing step, if the latter succeeds to find a theme for the incorrectly extracted event.",
        "An example of a false negative that falls in this group is \"dysregulation [727-740]\" from document 10229231 that failed to be mapped to a case-solution.",
        "Regarding the false positives, this class of mistake is the majority of them and it is due to the low precision of the system that frequently is able to find cases-solution associated to tokens that are not events at all, such as the token \"transcript [392-402]\" of document 10229231.",
        "It should be noted that the incorrect association of a token to a case-solution does not result in a false positive a priori, but only if the post-processing step happen to find a valid theme to it, a mistake further described in group 5.",
        "Wrong type of the event (4): this class of mistake is also due to the wrong selection of a case-solution, but the difference here is that the token is really an event, but the case-solution is of the wrong type, i.e. it has a wrong value for the eventType feature.",
        "The causes of this mistake are many, such as, the selection of features (cf. Table 1) or the value of the MFC parameter that may lead to the selection of a wrong but more frequent case.",
        "We also include in this group the few false negatives mistakes in which a token is associated to more than one type of event in the gold-standard, such as the token \"Overexpression [475-489]\" from document 10229231 that is associated both to a Gene Expression and to a Positive Regulation event.",
        "One way of overcome it would be to allow the system to associated more than one case to a token, taking the risk of decreasing the precision.",
        "Theme detection (5): in this group falls more than half of the false negatives and we include here only those mistakes in which the token was correctly associated to a case-solution of the correct type.",
        "These mistakes may be due to a variety of situations related to the theme detection, such as: the association of the event to another event when it should have been done to a protein or vice-versa (for the regulation events); the mapping of a binding event to one theme only when it should have been two theme or vice-versa; the association of the event to the wrong protein theme, especially when there is more than one nearby; and even not being able to find any theme at all.",
        "Also, half of theses mistakes happen when an event is associated to more than one theme separately, not as a second theme.",
        "For example, the token \"associated [278-288]\", from document 10196286, is associated in the gold standard to three themes - \"tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 1 [294351]\", \"2 [353-354]\" and \"3 [359-360]\" - and we were only able to extract the first of them.",
        "This is due to the fact that we restrict the system to search only one \"first\" and one \"second\" theme for each event.",
        "Cause detection (6): similar to the previous class, these mistakes happens when associating a cause to an event (regulation events only) when there is no cause related to it or vice-versa.",
        "For example, in document 10092805, the system has correctly mapped the token \"decreases [12301239]\" to the theme \"4E-BP1 [1240-1246]\" but also associated to it an inexistent cause \"4E-BP2 [1315-1321]\".",
        "The evaluation of Task 2 does not allow the partial evaluation of an event and therefore a false positive and a false negative would be returned for the example above.",
        "Site/Location detection (7): this error is similar to the previous one but related only to binding, phosphorylation and localization events, when the system fails to associate a site or a location to an event or vice-versa.",
        "For example, in document 10395671, the token \"phos-phorylation [1091-1106]\" was correctly mapped to the theme \"Janus kinase 3 [1076-1090]\" but was also associated to an inexistent site \"DNA [1200-1203]\".",
        "Once again, the evaluation of Task 2 does not allow the partial evaluation of the event and a false positive and a false negative would be returned.",
        "We have also carried out an evaluation of our own in order to check the performance of our system only on the extraction the entities (event, site and location), not taking into account the association to the arguments.",
        "Table 5 resumes the values of precision, recall and f-measure for each type of term.",
        "The high recall confirm that most of the entities were successful extracted although the precision is not always satisfactory, proving that the tagging of the entities is not as hard a task as it is the mapping of the arguments.",
        "Additional results and more a detailed analysis of the errors may be found at Moara page."

        "Results show that our system has performed relatively well using a simple methodology of a machine learning based extraction of the entities and manual rules developed for the postprocessing step.",
        "The analysis of the mistakes presented here confirms the complexity of the tasks proposed but not the extraction of the event terms (cf. Table 5).",
        "We consider that the part of our system that requires most our attention is the retrieval of the case-solution and the theme detection of the post-processing step, in order to increase the precision and recall, respectively.",
        "The decision of searching for a second theme and of associating a single event separately to more than one theme is hard to be accomplished by manual rules and could better be learned automatically using a machine learning algorithm.",
        "Table 5: Evaluation of the extraction of the event and site/location entities for the development dataset.",
        "The automatic analysis of the false positive and false negative mistakes is a hard task since no hint is given for the reason of the mistake by the evaluation system, if due to the event type or to wrong theme, an incorrectly association to an event or even a missing cause or site."
