        "In the shared task, the organizers provide participants with raw biomedical text, tagged biomedical terms (proteins), and the analyzed data with various NLP techniques such as tokenization, POS-tagging, phrase structure and dependency parsing and so on.",

        "The proposed system consists of three phases; event trigger detection phase(TD phase), event type classification phase(TC phase), relation recognition and event composition phase(RE phase).",
        "It works in the following manner.",
        "Firstly, it identifies triggers of a given biomedical sentence.",
        "Then, it classifies triggers into nine predefined classes.",
        "Lastly, the system finds the relations between triggers and participant candidates by examining each trigger whether it has relations with participant candidates, and composites events with the extracted relations.",
        "In the last phase, multiple relations of the same trigger can be combined into an event for Binding event type.",
        "In addition, multiple relations can be combined and their participant types can be classified into not only theme but also cause for three Regulation event types.",
        "In this paper, we mainly use dependency parsing information of the analyzed data because several previous studies for SRL have improved their performance by using features extracted from this information (Hacioglu, 2004; Tsai et al., 2006).",
        "In the experimental results, the proposed system showed 68.46 f-score in TD phase, 85.20 accuracy in TC phase, 89.91 f-score in the initial step of RE phase and 81.24 f-score in the iterative step of RE phase, but officially achieved 61.65 precision, 9.40 recall and 16.31 f-score in approximate span matching.",

        "One of important characteristics of bio-event is that one event as well as a protein may participate in another event.",

        "In the iterative step, it repeatedly examines remained triggers in the same manner.",
        "This step allows the system to extract chain-style events, which means that one event participates in another one and the other participates in the former.",

        "This phase is simply defined as the task that classify whether each token is a trigger or not in a document.",
        "It is necessary to select targets to classify among all tokens, because a set of all tokens includes too many negative examples.",
