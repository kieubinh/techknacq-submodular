        "Most previous work on biomedical information extraction focuses on identifying relationships among biomedical entities (e.g. protein-protein interactions).",
        "Unlike relationships, which are in general characterized with a pair of entities, events can be characterized with event types and multiple entities in varying roles.",
        "The BioNLP'09 Shared Task addresses the extraction of bio-molecular events from the biomedical literature (Kim et al., 2009).",
        "We participated in the \"Event Detection and Characterization\" task (Task 1).",
        "The goal was to recognize the events concerning the given proteins by detecting the event triggers, determining the event types, and identifying the event participants.",
        "In this study, we approach the problem as a supervised classification task.",
        "We group the event types into three general classes based on the number and types of participants that they involve.",
        "The first class includes the event types that are described with a single theme participant.",
        "The second class includes the event types that are described with one or more theme participants.",
        "The third class includes the events that are described with a theme and/or a cause participant.",
        "We learn support vector machine (SVM) models for each class of events to classify each candidate event trigger/participant pair as a real trigger/participant pair or not.",
        "We use various types of linguistic features such as lexical, positional, and dependency relation features that represent the contexts of the candidate trigger/participant pairs.",
        "The results that we submitted to the shared task were based on using a linear kernel function.",
        "In this paper, we also report our results based on using an edit-distance based kernel defined on the shortest dependency relation type paths between a candidate trigger/participant pair."

        "We grouped the nine event types targeted at the BioNLP'09 Shared Task into three general event classes based on the number and types of participants that they involve.",
        "Class 1 Events: Events that involve a single theme participant (Gene expression, Transcription, Protein catabolism, Localization, and Phosphorylation event types).",
        "Class 2 Events: Events that can involve one or more theme participants (Binding event type).",
        "Class 3 Events: Events that can be described with a theme and/or a cause participant (Regulation, Positive regulation, and Negative regulation event types).",
        "Unlike Class 1 and Class 2 events, where the participants are proteins, the participants of Class 3 events can be proteins or events.",
        "Since the event types in each class are similar to each other based on the number and roles of participants that they involve and different from the event types in the other classes, we learned separate classification models for each class.",
        "We formulated the classification task as the classification of trigger/participant pairs.",
        "We extracted positive and negative training instances (trigger/participant pairs) from the training data for each class of events.",
        "We considered only the pairs that appear in the same sentence.",
        "We used the tokenized and sentence split abstracts provided by the shared task organizers.",
        "Consider the sentence \"The phosphorylation of TRAF2 inhibits binding to the CD40 cytoplasmic domain\".",
        "This sentence describes the following three events:",

        "Event3: Type: Negative regulation Trigger: inhibits Theme: Event2 Cause: Event1",
        "Event1 belongs to Class 1.",
        "The trigger/participant pair (phosphorylation, TRAF2) is a positive instance for Class 1.",
        "Event2 belongs to Class 2.",
        "It has two theme participants.",
        "The instances for Class 2 events are created by decomposing the events into trigger/theme pairs.",
        "The two positive instances extracted from the decomposition of Event2 are (binding, TRAF2) and (binding, CD40).",
        "Event3 belongs to Class 3.",
        "It consists of two semantically different participants, namely a theme and a cause.",
        "We trained two separate models for Class 3 events, i.e., one model to classify the themes and another model to classify the causes.",
        "Another distinguishing characteristic of Class 3 events is that a participant of an event can be a protein or an event.",
        "We represent the participants that are events with their corresponding event triggers.",
        "We decompose Event3 into its theme and cause and represent its cause Event1 with its trigger word \"phosphorylation\" and",
        "/SharedTask/tools.html",
        "its theme Event2 with its trigger word \"binding\".",
        "As a result, (inhibits, binding) and (inhibits, phosphory-lation) are included as positive instances to the Class 3 theme and Class 3 cause training sets, respectively.",
        "Negative instances for Class 1 and Class 2 are created by including all the trigger/protein pairs which are not among the positive instances of that class.",
        "Negative instances for Class 3 theme and Class 3 cause are created by including all the trigger/protein and trigger1/trigger2 pairs which are not among the positive instances of that class.",
        "For example, (phos-phorylation, CD40) is a negative instance for Class 1 and (inhibits, TRAF2) is a negative instance for Class 3 theme and Class 3 cause.",
        "We used the candidate trigger and its part-of-speech, which was obtained by using the Stanford Parser, as features, based on our observation that different candidate triggers might have different likelihoods of being a real trigger for a certain event.",
        "For example, \"transcription\" is a trigger for the Transcription event 277 times in the training set and has not been used as a trigger for other types of events.",
        "On the other hand, \"concentration\" is used only once as a trigger for a Transcription event and three times as a trigger for Regulation events.",
        "We used two features to represent the relative position of the participant with regard to the trigger in the sentence.",
        "The first feature has two values, namely \"before\" (the participant appears before the trigger) or \"after\" (the participant appears after the trigger).",
        "The second feature encodes the distance between the trigger and the participant.",
        "Distance is measured as the number of tokens between the trigger and the participant.",
        "Our intuition is that, if a candidate trigger and participant are far away from each other, it is less likely that they characterize an event.",
        "A dependency parse tree captures the semantic predicate-argument dependencies among the words of a sentence.",
        "Dependency tree paths between protein pairs have successfully been used to identify protein interactions (Bunescu and Mooney, 2007; Erkan et al., 2007).",
        "In this paper, we use the dependency paths to extract events.",
        "For a given trigger/participant pair, we extract the shortest path from the trigger to the participant, from the dependency parse of the sentence.",
        "We use the McClosky-Charniak parses which are converted to the Stanford Typed Dependencies format and provided to the participants by the shared task organizers.",
        "Previous approaches use both the words and the dependency relation types to represent the paths (Bunescu and Mooney, 2007; Erkan et al., 2007).",
        "Consider the dependency tree in Figure 1.",
        "The path from \"phosphorylation\" to \"CD40\" is \"nsubj inhibits acomp binding prep_to domain num\".",
        "Due to the large number of possible words, using the words on the paths might lead to data sparsity problems and to poor generalization.",
        "Suppose we have a sentence with similar semantics, where the synonym word \"prevents\" is used instead of \"inhibits\".",
        "If we use the words on the path to represent the path feature, we end up with two different paths for the two sentences that have similar semantics.",
        "Therefore, in this study we use only the dependency relation types among the words to represent the paths.",
        "For example, the path feature extracted for the (phospho-rylation, CD40) negative trigger/participant pair is \"nsubj acomp prep_to num\" and the path feature extracted for the (phosphorylation, TRAF2) positive trigger/participant pair is \"prep.of",

        "In this approach the path feature is used as a nominal feature.",
        "Our second approach is based on integrating to SVM a kernel function based on the word-based edit distance between the dependency relation paths, where each dependency relation type on the path is treated as a word.",
        "For example, the word-based edit distance between the paths \"prep_of' and \"prep_of prep_with\" is 1, since 1 insertion operation (i.e., inserting \"prep_with\" to the first path) is sufficient to transform the first path to the second one.",
