        "BioNLP recently emerged from the combined expertise of molecular biology and computational linguistics.",
        "At first, the community was mainly focused on named entity recognition (NER) and simple relation extraction, such as protein-protein interactions al., 2007; Saetre et al., 2008).",
        "However, the future of BioNLP lies in the ability to extract more complex events from text, in order to fully capture all available information (Altman et al., 2008).",
        "Two recent community-wide challenges, Biocre-ative I (Hirschman et al., 2005) and II (Krallinger et al., 2008) have shown their merits by providing common benchmarking data and a meaningful comparison of various techniques.",
        "In contrast to the monolithic Biocreative tasks, the BioNLP'09 Shared Task has a more modular nature (Kim et al., 2009).",
        "It is not concerned with named entity recognition or normalization, but focuses on the task of event extraction itself.",
        "This article is organized as follows: we first describe the Shared Task in a little more detail.",
        "Next, we present the methods used in our machine learning framework, carefully discussing our choices in design and their influence on performance.",
        "We then present the final results of our approach.",

        "The BioNLP'09 Shared Task was divided into three subtasks, of which only the first one was mandatory.",
        "We have participated in tasks 1 and 3, and will therefore only briefly discuss task 2.",
        "In accordance with the provided gold entity annotation, we will refer to all genes and gene products as proteins.",
        "Task 1 represents the core of the challenge: detection and characterization of bio-molecular events from text.",
        "There are 9 distinct event types.",
        "Six events influence proteins directly, and we will refer to them as 'Protein events'.",
        "Five of them are unary: Localization, Gene expression, Transcription, Protein catabolism and Phosphorylation.",
        "The Binding event can be related to one protein (e.g. proteinDNA binding), two proteins (e.g. protein-protein interaction) or more (e.g. a complex).",
        "On top of these event types, there are three Regulation events: Regulation, Positive regulation and Negative regulation.",
        "Each of them can be unary or binary.",
        "In the latter case, an extra argument specifying the cause of the regulation is added.",
        "Each argument of a Regulation event can be either a protein or any other event.",
        "Participants in task 2 had to recognise extra arguments for the events from task 1.",
        "For example, the cellular location should be added to a Localization event, and Site arguments had to be specified for Phosphorylation, Binding and Regulation.",
        "Finally, task 3 was about detecting negation and speculation in text.",
        "Suppose we are dealing with this sentence:",
        "\"MAD-3 masks the nuclear localization signal of p65 and inhibits p65 DNA binding.\"",
        "There are three proteins in this sentence:",

        "• T29 : Negative regulation : 'inhibits'",
        "In this example, we see there is one binding event which involves trigger T30 and protein T3.",
        "Furthermore, this binding event is being influenced by protein T1, using trigger T29 which implies a Negative regulation event.",
        "Similarly, T1 has a negative effect on protein T2, which is expressed by trigger T27.",
        "When participating in subtask 2, one should also find the extra Site argument T28 for this last event:",

        "Our machine learning framework is tailored towards specific properties of different events, but is still kept sufficiently general to deal with new event types.",
        "The nature of the event extraction task leads to unbalanced datasets, with much more negative examples than positive ones.",
        "This is due to the fact that proteins could be involved in all possible event types, and each of the words in the text could be a trigger for an event.",
        "Finding the right events thus seems like looking for a needle in a haystack, which is why it is crucial to start with a good definition of candidate instances.",
        "This problem has motivated us to try and filter out as many irrelevant negative instances as possible by introducing specific preprocessing methods and filters.",
        "This reduces un-balancedness of the datasets and will lead to better precision as there will be less false positives (FPs).",
        "High-precision systems produce less noise and can be considered to be more useful when a researcher is trying to extract reliable interaction networks from text.",
        "There is a considerable degree of information redundancy in the original PubMed articles, which makes up for low recall when using the system in a real-world application.",
        "We have also tested a few post-processing techniques in order to remove FPs after classification.",
        "Figure 1 shows a high-level overview of the different modules in our framework.",
        "More details are described in the next sections.",
        "For sentence segmentation, we made use of the provided tokenization files.",
        "Analysis of part-of-speech tags and dependency graphs was done using the Stanford parser (de Marneffe et al., 2006).",
        "From the training data, we automatically compiled dictionaries of triggers for each event type, applying the Porter stemming algorithm (Porter, 1980) to each trigger.",
        "This resulted in some entries in the dictionaries which were of limited use, such as 'through' for Binding, or 'are' for Localization.",
        "Such words are too general or too vague, and lead to many negative and irrelevant instances.",
        "For this reason, we manually cleaned the dictionaries, only keeping specific triggers for each event type (e.g. 'interaction' for Binding and 'secretion' for Localization).",
        "During development, we noticed a significant difference between the triggers for unary Binding events (e.g. 'homodimer', 'binding site') and those for Binding events with multiple arguments (e.g. 'heterodimer', 'complex').",
        "This motivated our choice to create two separate dictionaries and classifiers, thus discarding irrelevant candidate instances.",
        "Such an example would be a candidate binary Binding event with the trigger 'homodimer', while ho-modimerization is clearly a unary event.",
        "In the rest of this article, we will refer to these two event types as Single binding and Multiple binding events.",
        "The revision of the dictionaries resulted in a significant drop in the number of Binding instances in the training data, and improved the balancedness of the datasets: from a total of 34612 instances (of which 2% positives) to 4708 Single binding instances (11% positives) and 3861 Multiple binding instances (5% positives).",
        "Following the same reasoning, Regulation was also divided into unary and binary events.",
        "Furthermore, we have carefully analysed the nature of Binary regulation events, and noticed that a vast majority of these events had a protein in the 'cause' slot.",
        "We decided to split up the dictionaries of Binary regulations accordingly, differentiating between regulation events caused by proteins and those caused by other events.",
        "This keeps the more general words (e.g. 'causes') out of the dictionaries of events regulated by proteins (e.g. 'response'), again resulting in better balance of the datasets.",
        "In a machine learning framework, a classifier tries to distinguish between positive instances (true bio-molecular events) and negative instances (candidates which should be discarded).",
        "To run such a framework, one has to define candidate instances automatically by scanning the text.",
        "The first step towards instance creation consists of looking up triggers in text, using the constructed dictionaries for each event type.",
        "To this end, we have implemented a fast algorithm using Radix trees.",
        "Next, candidate arguments have to be found.",
        "Initially, we have selected all (combinations of) proteins that were mentioned in the same sentence.",
        "However, this may result in a lot of negative and irrelevant instances, mainly in long sentences.",
        "This is why we have implemented a Negative-instances (NI) filter, which checks whether the length of the sub-sentence spanned by a candidate event does not exceed a certain value.",
        "Figure 2 shows the distribution of positive and negative Multiple binding events, according to the length of the relevant sub-sentence.",

        "Furthermore, for each instance, a minimal subgraph of the dependency graph was extracted, containing the full trigger and all arguments.",
        "The size of this subgraph was also used as a parameter for the NI filter, as positive instances are usually expressed in a smaller subtree than negative examples.",
        "In Figure 3 we see how the subgraphs of positive Multiple binding instances are never larger than 10 edges, while negative instances can contain up to 18 edges.",
        "In this case, only keeping instances with subgraphs smaller than 8 edges will discard many irrelevant negatives, while keeping most of the positive instances.",
        "The NI filter further reduces noise in the data and unbalancedness.",

        "It should be noted that the number of positive instances in Table 1 is lower than the actual number of positive examples in the training set, due to limitations of our instance definition method.",

        "At first sight, FS did not seem to lead to gain in performance, although we were not able to test this hypothesis more thoroughly due to time limitations of the task.",
        "Finally, we have also tested the influence of assigning higher weights to positive training instances, in order to make up for the unbalanced nature of the data, but this had almost no effect on overall performance.",

        "However, a word in natural language can only have one meaning at a time.",
        "When two such triggers lead to events with different event types, this means that some of these events should be FPs.",
        "When testing on the development data, we found a few predictions where this problem occurred.",
        "For example, the trigger 'expression' can lead to both a Transcription and a Gene expression event, but not at the same time.",
        "In such a case, we only select the prediction with the highest SVM score.",
        "However, thanks to careful construction of the dictionaries (Section 3.2), their mutual overlap is rather small, and thus this post-processing module has almost no influence on performance.",
        "Events based on the same trigger",
        "One trigger might be involved in different events from the same event type.",
        "For example, the sentence 'it induces expression of STAT5-regulated genes in CTLL-2, i.e. beta-casein, and oncostatin M (OSM)' mentions two Gene expression events based on the trigger 'expression', one involving beta-casein, and one involving OSM.",
        "For these two events, the subgraphs will be very similar, resulting in similar features and SVM scores.",
        "However, often a trigger only leads to one true event, while all other candidates from the same event type are false positives.",

        "Table 3 shows that the highest possible recall of the Regulation events is never above 50%, greatly limiting the performance of our method.",
        "As regulation events can participate in new regulation events, one should run the regulation pipeline repeatedly until no more new events are found.",
        "In our experiments, we have found that even the first recursive run did not lead to much better performance, and only a few more Regulation events were found.",
        "Final results are shown in Table 4.",
        "With recall being rather low, between 21% and 30%, at least we achieve relatively good precision: around 40% for each of the three regulation types.",
        "On average, the F-score is almost 30% for the regulation events, which is significantly lower than the performance of Protein events.",
        "On average, we obtain an F-score of 46.44% on the development data for task 1.",

        "Again we have applied an all-true classifier to determine maximal recall (Table 3).",
        "Less than 30% of the events necessary for task 3 can be found with our setup; all of these FNs are due to FNs in task 1.",
        "Final results are shown in Table 4.",
        "Performance of around 23% F-score is achieved on the development data.",
        "We take into consideration that according to the maximal recall study, only 29% of the necessary events for Negation were extracted by task 1.",
        "In the final results, 16% of all the negation events were found.",
        "This means that our rule-based method by itself achieves about 55% recall for Negation.",
        "Similarly, the system has a recall of 80% for Speculation when only considering events found in task 1.",
        "We conclude that our simple rule-based system performs reasonably well.",
        "Finally, our system was applied to the test data.",
        "Achieving a global F-score of 40.54% for subtask 1, we obtain a 5th place out of 24 participating teams.",
        "For subtask 3 of finding negation and speculation, we obtain a second place with a 37.80% F-score.",
        "Final results for each of the event types are shown in Table 5.",
        "As on the development data, we see that the Binding event performs worst, and the same trend is found when analyzing results of other teams.",
        "In general however, we achieve a high precision: 67% for Protein events, 52% on average on subtask 1, and 50% on average on subtask 3.",
        "Another trend which is confirmed by other teams, is the fact that predicting Protein events achieves much higher performance than the prediction of Regulation events.",

        "In the future, we would like to investigate the use of feature selection to produce better models for the classification task.",
        "Another interesting topic would be how to combine coreference resolution with dependency graphs in order to process events which span multiple sentences in text.",
        "For the community as a whole, we think the next step would be to work on full articles instead of mere abstracts.",
        "Also, it might be interesting to investigate the use of text-bound annotation which is not necessarily contiguous, such as is the case in the Bioinfer corpus (Pyysalo et al., 2007), to be able to fully capture the semantics of a certain event."
