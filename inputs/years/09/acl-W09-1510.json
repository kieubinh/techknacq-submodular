        "Simple software tools suffice for small or simple analysis problems, or for building models of easily represented relations.",
        "However, as the size of data, the intricacy of relations to be analyzed, and the complexity of the representation grow, so too does the technical difficulty of conducting the analysis.",
        "Software is our given means of escape from this escalation of complexity.",
        "However, as \"computational linguists,\" we often find ourselves spending more time and attention building software to perform the required computations than we do on understanding the linguistics.",
        "Even once a suitable set of NLP tools (e.g. taggers, chunkers, parsers, etc.)",
        "has been chosen, analysis software, in the CL world, often consists of \"throw away\" scripts.",

        "By generalizing tools to fit the processing environment, and the nature of the problems at hand, we enable flexible processing which scales with the size of the platform and the data.",
        "The Oceanography software environment is designed to address two important needs in large corpus analysis.",
        "The first is to simplify the actual programming of analysis code to reduce development time and increase reliability, and the second is to use the available distributed computing resources to reduce running time and provide for rapid testing and experimental turnaraound.",
        "There are two separate kinds of analysis we want to support over this processed corpus.",
        "The first is linguistic modeling.",
        "In order to achieve the best semantic interpretation of each source document, we seek to understand the linguistic behavior within the corpus.",
        "Probabilistic parsing, entity extraction, sense disambiguation, and argument role assignment are all informed by structured, statistical models of word behavior within the corpus.",
        "Some models can be built from simple tokenized text, while other models need to incorporate parse dependencies or real-word knowledge of entities.",
        "Some of these tasks are exploratory and underspecified (e.g. selectional restrictions), while others, such as name tagging, have a well-developed literature and a number of almost standard methodologies.",
        "The second kind of analysis is aimed at characterizing and improving system behavior.",

        "These general steps apply to many corpus tasks, including building n-gram data, learning sentence breaks, identifying selectional preferences, or building role mappings for verb nominalizations.",
        "The Oceanography system generalizes these steps into a declarative language for stating the selection of data, and the form of output, in a way that avoids repetitive and error prone boilerplate code for file traversal, regular expression matching, and statistics programming.",
        "By matching a declarative syntax to the general analysis steps, these common functions can be relegated to library code, or wrapped into the executable in the compilation step.",
        "The less time spent in describing a task, or in coding and debugging the implementation, the more time and attention can be spent in understanding the results and modeling the linguistic processes that underly the data.",
        "This sort of abstraction away from the details of file representation, storage architecture, and processing model fits a general trend toward data mining, or text mining (Feldman and Dagan, 1995).",

        "Pattern matching in Oceanography for dependency parse structures is handled using a domain specific language (DSL) built explicitly for pattern-based manipulation of parse trees and semantic representations generated by the XLE linguistic components (Crouch et al., 2006).",

        "Transfer matches pattern rules to a current set of parse dependencies or semantic facts, and writes alternate expressions derived from the matched components.",
        "Variables in these expressions are bound via Prolog-style unification (Huet, 1975).",
        "For example, in figure 1, the first expression word(\"-) will match word forms in a parse that are 'verb's, and bind %VerbSk variable to a unique occurrence id and %VerbWord to the verb lemma.",
        "The second pattern finds the node in the dependency graph that fills the ob (object) role for that verb, and extracts its lemmas.",
        "(The %%'s are placeholder variables in the pattern, needed to match the arity of the expression.)",
        "Below, in the same figure, is a representation of the verb and object from a parse of the phrase \"determined the structure\".",
        "On matching these facts, the VerbWord and ObjLemma variables would be bound to the strings determine and structure.",
        "In a simpler environment, with more basic textual representations, this pattern matching step would be written with regular expressions, for example using the familiar grep command.",
        "The balance provided by grep between the simplicity of its operational model (a transform from stdin to stdout) and the expressiveness of the regular expressions allows grep to be a workhorse for data analysis over text.",
        "However, except for simple cases such as word cooccurrence models, the typical need in deep linguistic analysis is not well served by regular expressions over strings.",
        "Anyone in the NLP field who has written regular expressions to match, say, part-of-speech labeled text knows the difficulties of having a pattern language which differs from the logical structures being matched.",
        "Another typical solution is to write a short program in a scripting language (e.g. perl, python, SNOBOL) which combines regular expressions to provide a simple structure parser.",
        "Tgrep (Pito, 1993) is a one such program which extends this regular expression notion to patterns over trees, and can output subtrees matching those expressions, but only provided they are represented as text in the LDC TreeBank format.",
        "Once the items of the pattern have been identified in their original context, it is often necessary to isolate them from that context, and remove the extraneous, irrelevant information.",
        "For instance, if one is doing a simple word count, the tokenized words of text must be separated from any annotation and counted independently.",
        "For more complicated tasks, such as finding a verb's distribution of occurrence with direct objects, the verb and object need to be isolated from the remainder of the parse tree, perhaps as the simple tuple (verb, object), or in a more complex structure, with additional dependent information.",
        "In our case, we express the transformed output of each pattern match with an expression built from the unification variables bound to the match.",
        "In figure 2, we construct a vo.pair of (verb, object).",

        "(But see, e.g. Sawzall (Pike et al., 2005) for a scalable awk-like language.)",
        "The aggregation step collects the extracted instances and groups them by type and by key.",
        "Rather than have the matched, transformed results simply dumped out in some enormous file or database in their order of occurrence in the data set (as one would get e.g. from grep), it is quite useful even in the simplest of cases to aggregate all similar output items.",
        "This condenses the mass of data selected, and allows one to see the extent and diversity of the items that are found by the patterns.",
        "This simple counting is often enough for diagnostic tasks, and sometimes for exploratory tasks when a statistical judgement is not yet desired.",
        "The aggregation key might be, for various kinds of extraction: the head noun of an NN-compound, or the error type for parse errors, or the controlling verb of a relative clause.",
        "In Oceanography, we require a declaration of the data that will be aggregated, in order to separate it from the remainder which will be discarded.",
        "These declarations take the form of familiar static type declarations, in the style of C++ or Java.",

        "By translating the four steps of any analysis into corresponding map/reduce operations across the linguistic pipeline data, we can efficiently translate the corpus analytics to an arbitrarily large data setting.",
        "Further, because we can rely on the Coral process and data management infrastructure to handle the data movement and traversal, we allow the researcher or language engineer to concentrate on specifying the patterns and relations to be investigated, rather than burdening them with complex yet necessary details."
