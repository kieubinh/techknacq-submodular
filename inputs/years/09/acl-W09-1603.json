        "About a billion people in India use these languages as their first language.",
        "About 5% of the population (usually the educated class) can understand English as their second language.",
        "Hindi is spoken by about 30% (G. E. Burkhart, S. E. Goodman, A. Merta and L. Press, 1998) of the population, but it is concentrated in urban areas and north-central India, and is still not only foreign, but often unpopular in many other regions.",
        "Though considerable amount of Indic content is available on the World Wide Web (WWW), we can observe that search development is very less when compared to the official languages of the United Nations (UN).",
        "The primary reason for this can be attributed for much delayed standards and lack of support from operating systems and browsers in rendering Indic scripts.",
        "This caused web publishers to develop their own proprietory encodings/fonts, who are now hesitant to use available standards such as Unicode/ISCII.",
        "This creates a major hinderance in accessing Indian content through existing search engines.",
        "Most of the search engines support Indic search in Unicode data only.",
        "But, considerable amount of content is available in ASCII based font encodings which is much larger (more dynamic also) than Unicode (Unicode Consortium - Universal Code Standard, 1991) or ISCII (ISCII - Indian Standard Code for Information Interchange, 1983) formats.",
        "Apart from this, language independent information like loan words, transliterated words, pronouns etc., are also not accessible across Indian languages.",
        "Most users are familiar with English keyboard typing than any Indian language, and would be interested to query through English transliteration.",
        "So, a meta standard transliteration scheme (IT3 sec3.1) has to be commonly defined across all the Indian languages, and the web content has to be appropriately converted.",
        "Also, the web pages need to be indexed using phonetic features like (diphone/triphones/syllables), which will be convenient to retrieve and rank the pages.",
        "In this paper, we incorporate all these aspects to make search engine as the meaningful searching tool for Indian languages.",
        "The paper is organized into six sections.",
        "The first section explains the nature of Indic scripts.",
        "The second section details the various major encoding formats and transliteration scheme used to store and render Indic data.",
        "In section three, novel approaches for preprocessing Indic data like font-encoding identification and font-data conversion are explained.",
        "In section four, the experiments regarding stemming and grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) for Indian-English using Classification and Regression Tree (CART) are described and stop words identification is also explained.",

      "text": [
        "The scripts in Indian languages have originated from the ancient Brahmi script.",
        "The basic units of the writing system are referred to as Aksharas.",
        "The properties of Aksharas are as follows: (1) An Ak-shara is an orthographic representation of a speech sound (2) Aksharas are syllabic in nature (3) The typical forms of Akshara are V, CV, CCV and CCCV, thus have a generalized form of C*V. The shape of an Akshara depends on its composition of consonants and the vowel, and sequence of the consonants.",
        "In defining the shape of an Akshara, one of the consonant symbols acts as pivotal symbol (referred to as semi-full form).",
        "Depending on the context, an Akshara can have a complex shape with other consonant and vowel symbols being placed on top, below, before, after or sometimes surrounding the pivotal symbol (referred to as half-form).",
        "Thus to render an Akshara electronically, a set of semi-full or half-forms have to be rendered, which are in turn rendered using a set of basic shapes referred to as glyphs.",
        "Often a semi-full form or half-form is rendered using two or more glyphs, thus there is no one-to-one correspondence between glyphs of a font and semi-full or half-forms.",
        "All Indian languages except English and Urdu share a common phonetic base, i.e., they share a common set of speech sounds.",
        "While all of these languages share a common phonetic base, some of the languages such as Hindi, Marathi and Nepali also share a common script known as Devanagari.",
        "But languages such as Telugu, Kannada and Tamil have their own scripts.",
        "The property which distinguishes these languages can be attributed to the phonotactics in each of these languages rather than the scripts and speech sounds.",
        "Phonotactics is the permissible combination of phones that can co-occur in a language.",
        "This knowledge helps us in designing a common transliteration scheme, and also in identifying and converting different text encodings."

      "heading": "3. Indic Data Formats",
      "text": [
        "Another aspect involved in the diversity of electronic content of Indian languages is their format of digital storage.",
        "Storage formats like ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) based fonts, ISCII (Indian Standard code for Information Interchange), Unicode and phonetic based transliteration schemes are often used to store the digital text data in Indian languages.",
        "Most of the text is rendered using some fonts of these formats.",
        "Transliteration is a mapping from one system of writing into another, word by word, or ideally letter by letter.",
        "It is the practice of transcribing a word or text written in one writing system into another writing system.",
        "Transliterations in the narrow sense are used in situations where the original script is not available to write down a word in that script, while still high precision is required.",
        "One instance of transliteration is the use of an English computer keyboard to type in a language that uses a different alphabet, such as Russian, Hindi etc.",
        "Transliterated texts are often used in emails, blogs, and electronic correspondence where non-Latin keyboards are unavailable, is sometimes referred to by special composite terms that demonstrate the combination of English characters and the original non-Latin word pronunciation: Ruglish, Hebrish, Greeklish, Ara-bish or Hinlish.",
        "To handle diversified storage formats of scripts of Indian languages such as ASCII based fonts, ISCII and Unicode etc., it is useful and becomes essential to use a meta-storage format.",
        "ISO 15919 standards (Transliteration of Indic Scripts: How to use ISO 15919, ) describes development of transliteration for Indic scripts.",
        "A transliteration scheme maps the Aksharas of Indian languages onto English alphabets and it could serve as meta-storage format for text-data.",
        "Since Aksharas in Indian languages are orthographic representation of speech sound, and they have a common phonetic base, it is suggested to have a phonetic transliteration scheme such as IT3 (Ganapathiraju M., Balakrishnan M., Balakrishnan hallad Kishore and GanapathiRaju Madhavi, 2005).",
        "Thus, when the font-data is converted into IT3, it essentially turns the whole effort into font-to-Akshara conversion.",
        "Thus IT3 transliteration is used as common representation scheme for all Indic data formats.",
        "The same is used to get the input from the user also."

      "text": [
        "In search engine development, it is an absolute requirement that the content should be in an unique format to build a efficient index table.",
        "So, preprocessing the web content is unavoidable here.",
        "Most of the Indian language electronic data is either Unicode encoded or glyph based font encoded.",
        "Processing Unicode data is quite straight forward because it follows distinguished code ranges for each language and there is a one-to-one correspondence between glyphs (shapes) and characters.",
        "But this is not true in the case of glyph based font encoded data.",
        "Hence, it becomes necessary to identify the font encoding and convert the font-data into a phonetic transliteration sheme like IT3.",
        "The following subsections explain the stages in detail.",
        "The problem of font-identification could be defined as, given a set of words or sentences to identify the font-encoding by finding the minimum distance between the input glyph codes and the models representing font-encodings.",
        "Existing works (Anil Kumar Singh and Jagadeesh Gorla, 2007) addressed the same problem but with limited success.",
        "In this context, the proposed approach (A.",
        "A. Raj and K. Prahallad, 2007) use vector space model and Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) for font-encoding identification.",
        "This approach is used to weigh each term in the font-data according to its uniqueness.",
        "Thus it captures the relevancy among term and document.",
        "Here, Term: refers to a unit of glyph.",
        "In this work, experiments are performed with different units such as single glyph gi (uniglyph), two consecutive glyphs gi-1gi(biglyph) and three consecutive glyphs gi-1 gigi+1(triglyph).",
        "Document: It refers to the font-data (words and sentences) in a specific font-encoding.",
        "To build a model for each font-encoding scheme, we need sufficient data.",
        "So we have collected manually an average of 0.12 million unique words per type for nearly 37 different glyph based fonts.",
        "To create a vector space model for a font-encoding, primarily the term (uniglyph or biglyph or triglyph) is extracted out of the font-data.",
        "Then TF-IDF weights are calculated for all terms in the documents.",
        "Identification Results: The steps involved are as follows.",
        "Firstly, terms from the input word or sentence are extracted.",
        "Then a query vector using those terms is created.",
        "The distance between query vector and all the models of font-encoding is computed using TF-IDF weights.",
        "The input word is said to be originated from the model which gives a maximum TF-IDF value.",
        "It is typically observed that TF-IDF weights are more sensitive to the length of query.",
        "The accuracy increases with the increase in the length of test data.",
        "Thus, two different types of test data were prepared for testing.",
        "One is a set of unique words and the other is a set of sentences.",
        "It should also be noted that the accuracy depends on various factors: a) The number of font-encodings from which the identifier has to select one b) The inherent confusion of one font-encoding with another and c) The type of unit used in modeling.",
        "For 1000 different number of inputs (words and sentences) we have identified the closest models and calculated the accuracy.",
        "It is repeatedly done for various (uniglyph, biglyph and triglyph) categories.",
        "From Tables 1 and 2, it is clear that triglyph seems to be an appropriate unit for a term in the identification of font-encoding.",
