        "To show this we analyzed the length of Wikipedia entry descriptions for the people from the DUC 2004 set.",

        "It is interesting so see that the sorted order in Figure 2 does not correlate to the length distribution of English descriptions for our data set.",
        "Obviously, the descriptions in English are not always the longest ones.",
        "To be precise for 17 out of 43 people from the DUC 2004 set, the corresponding Wikipedia description in English was not the longest one.",
        "In several cases, the length of the description in English is several times shorter than the length of the longest (non-English) description.",
        "For example, the description of Giinter Grass in German has 251 sentences while his description in English has 74 sentences.",
        "It is safe to assume that longer descriptions have more information than shorter descriptions and 17 out of 43 English language descriptions of Wikipedia entries in our data set can be naturally extended with the information covered in the descriptions in other languages.",
        "Thus, multilingual Wikipedia gives a straightforward way of extending Wikipedia entry descriptions.",
        "It must be noted that the average length of Wikipedia descriptions (also presented on Figure 2) is very short.",
        "Thus, many descriptions for Wikipedia entries are quite short.",

        "Thus, the question arises whether our analysis can be used without loss of generality for the complete Wikipedia (i.e., all descriptions for all Wikipedia entries).",
        "To check this we analyzed the correspondence of how many Wikipedia entry descriptions are there for each language.",
        "For the Wikipedia subset corresponding to the people from the DUC 2004 set we simply counted how many Wikipedia entries have descriptions in each language.",

        "For example, the title for the Wikipedia entry about Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in English, German, Italian, and many other languages uses the term Republic of Macedonia or simply Macedonia.",
        "However, Greece does not recognize this name, and thus, the title of the corresponding description in Greek has a complete formal name of the country: Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.",

        "Studying information asymmetries in multilingual Wikipedia can boost research in new information and contradiction detection.",
