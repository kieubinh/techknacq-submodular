        "Fung and Yee (1998) point out that not only the number of common words in context gives some similarity clue to a word and its translation, but the actual ranking of the context word frequencies also provides important clue to the similarity between a bilingual word pair.",
        "This fact has motivated Fung and Yee (1998) to use tfidf weighting to compute the vectors.",

        "Most works in bilingual lexicon extraction use lists of high frequency words that are obtained from source and target language corpus to be their source and target word lists respectively.",

        "Ws and Wt are contextually relevant terms that highly co-occur with the cognate pairs in the same context.",

        "The cosine measure favors {Ws,Wt} pairs that share the most number of non-zero seed word values.",

        "Even though Ws and Wt might not closely correlated with the same set of seed words, the matching score could be high if Ws or Wt has high seed word values everywhere.",
        "Thus, we transform the context vectors from real value into binary vectors before the similarity is computed.",
        "Figure 4 outlines the algorithm using context similarity in more detail.",

        "Otherwise, one may have to rely on bilingual dictionaries.",
        "There may be some possible supporting strategies, which we could use to help improve further the precision score within the utilizing technique.",
        "For example, dimension reduction using canonical correlation analysis (CCA), resemblance detection, measure of dispersion, reference corpus and further noise reduction.",
        "However, we do not include a re-ranking method, as we are using collection of cognate pairs instead of a general bilingual dictionary.",
        "Since our corpus S and T is in similar domain, we might still not have seen the potential of this technique in its entirety.",
        "One may want to test the technique with different type of corpora for future works.",
        "Nevertheless, we are still concerned that many spurious translation equivalents were proposed because the words actually have higher correlation with the input source word compared to the real target word.",
        "Otherwise, the translation equivalents may not be in the boundaries or in the corpus from which translation equivalents are to be extracted.",
        "Haghighi et al. (2008) have reported that the most common errors detected in their analysis on top 100 errors were from semantically related words, which had strong context feature correlations.",

        "We present a bilingual lexicon extraction technique that utilizes contextually relevant terms that co-occur with cognate pairs to expand an initial bilingual lexicon.",

        "We demonstrate this technique using unan-notated resources that are freely available.",
        "Our model using this technique with spelling similarity obtains 85.4 percent precision at 50.0 percent recall.",
        "Precision of 79.0 percent at 50.0 percent recall is recorded when using this technique with context similarity approach.",
        "We also reveal that the latter model with context similarity is able to capture words efficiently compared to a baseline model.",
