        "Automatic summarization systems are typically extractive or abstractive.",
        "Since abstraction is quite hard, the most successful systems tested at the Text Analysis Conference (TAC) and Document Understanding Conference (DUC), for example, are extractive.",
        "In particular, sentence selection represents a reasonable trade-off between linguistic quality, guaranteed by longer textual units, and summary content, often improved with shorter units.",
        "Whereas the majority of approaches employ a greedy search to find a set of sentences that is both relevant and non-redundant (Goldstein et al., 2000; Nenkova and Vanderwende, 2005), some recent work focuses on improved search (McDonald, 2007; Yih et al., 2007).",
        "Among them, McDonald is the first to consider a non-approximated maximization of an objective function through Integer Linear Programming (ILP), which improves on a greedy search by 4-12%.",
        "His formulation assumes that the quality of a summary is proportional to the sum of the relevance scores of the selected sentences, penalized by the sum of the redundancy scores of all pairs of selected sentences.",
        "Under a maximum summary length constraint, this problem can be expressed as a quadratic knapsack (Gallo et al., 1980) and many methods are available to solve it (Pisinger et al., 2005).",
        "However, McDonald reports that the method is not scalable above 100 input sentences and discusses more practical approximations.",
        "Still, an ILP formulation is appealing because it gives exact solutions and lends itself well to extensions through additional constraints.",
        "Methods like McDonald's, including the well-known Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) algorithm (Goldstein et al., 2000), are subject to another problem: Summary-level redundancy is not always well modeled by pairwise sentence-level redundancy.",
        "Figure 1 shows an example where the combination of sentences (1) and (2) overlaps completely with sentence (3), a fact not captured by pairwise redundancy measures.",
        "Redundancy, like content selection, is a global problem.",
        "Here, we discuss a model for sentence selection with a globally optimal solution that also addresses redundancy globally.",

        "As an alternative, we consider information and redundancy at a sub-sentence, \"concept\" level, modeling the value of a summary as a function of the concepts it covers.",
        "While McDonald uses an explicit redundancy term, we model redundancy implicitly: a summary only benefits from including each concept once.",

        "We generate a summary by choosing a set ofsen-tences that maximizes this objective function, subject to the usual length constraint.",
        "In summing over concept weights, we assume that the value of including a concept is not effected by the presence of any other concept in the summary.",
        "That is, concepts are assumed to be independent.",
        "Choosing a suitable definition for concepts, and a mapping from the input documents to concept weights, is both important and difficult.",
        "Concepts could be words, named entities, syntactic subtrees or semantic relations, for example.",
        "While deeper semantics make more appealing concepts, their extraction and weighting are much more error-prone.",
        "Any error in concept extraction can result in a biased objective function, leading to poor sentence selection."

        "This is confirmed by the linguistic quality score drop for this system.",
        "The poor quality of the compressed sentences explains the reduction in Pyramid scores: Human judges tend to not give credit to ungrammatical sentences because they obscure the SCUs.",

        "We have synthesized a number of ideas from the field of automatic summarization, including concept-level weighting, a maximum coverage model to minimize redundancy globally, and sentence compression derived from parse trees.",
        "While an ILP formulation for summarization is not novel, ours provides reasonably scalable, efficient solutions for practical problems, including those in recent TAC and DUC evaluations.",
        "We have also shown how it can be extended to perform sentence compression and sentence selection jointly.",
        "In ROUGE and Pyramid evaluation, our system significantly outperformed McDonald's ILP system.",
        "However, we would note that better design of sentence-level scoring would likely yield better results as suggested by the success of greedy sentence-based methods at the DUC and TAC conferences (see for instance (Toutanova et al., 2007)).",
        "Still, the performance of our system, on par with the current state-of-the-art, is encouraging.",
        "There are three principal directions for future work.",
        "First, word bigram concepts are convenient, but semantically unappealing.",
        "We plan to explore concepts derived from parse trees, where weights may be a function of frequency as well as hierarchical relationships.",
        "Second, our current approach relies entirely on word frequency, a reasonable proxy for relevance, but likely inferior to learning weights from training data.",
        "A number of systems have shown improvements by learning word values, though preliminary attempts to improve on our frequency heuristic by learning bigram values have not produced significant gains.",
        "Better features may be necessary.",
        "However, since the ILP gives optimal solutions so quickly, we are more interested in discriminative training where we learn weights for features that push the resulting summaries in the right direction, as opposed to the individual concept values.",
        "Third, our rule-based sentence compression is more of a proof of concept, showing that joint compression and optimal selection is feasible.",
        "Better statistical methods have been developed for producing high quality compression candidates (McDonald, 2006), that maintain linguistic quality, some recent work even uses ILPs for exact inference (Clarke and Lapata, 2008).",
        "The addition of compressed sentences tends to yield less coherent summaries, making sentence ordering more important.",
        "We would like to add constraints on sentence ordering to the ILP formulation to address this issue."
