        "AL selects highly informative examples from a pool of unla-beled data and prompts a human annotator for the labels of these examples.",
        "The newly labeled examples are added to a training set used to build a statistical classifier.",
        "This classifier is in turn used to assess the informativeness of further examples.",
        "Thus, a select-label-retrain loop is formed that quickly selects hard to classify examples, honing in on the decision boundary (Cohn et al., 1996).",
        "A fundamental characteristic of AL is the fact that it constitutes a biased sampling process.",
        "This is so",
        "* Both authors contributed equally to this work.",
        "by design, but the bias can have an undesirable consequence: partial coverage of the instance space.",
        "As a result, classes or clusters within classes may be completely missed, resulting in low recall or slow learning progress.",
        "This has been called the missed cluster effect (Schütze et al., 2006).",
        "While AL has been studied for a range of NLP tasks, the missed cluster problem has hardly been addressed.",
        "This paper studies the missed class effect, a special case of the missed cluster effect where complete classes are overlooked by an active learner.",
        "The missed class effect is the result of insufficient exploration before or during a mainly exploitative AL process.",
        "In AL approaches where exploration is only addressed by an initial seed set, poor seed set construction gives rise to the missed class effect.",
        "We focus on the missed class effect in the context of a common NLP task: named entity recognition (NER).",
        "We show that for this task the missed class effect is avoided by increasing the sampling granularity from single-instance units (i.e., tokens) to multi-instance units (i.e., sentences).",
        "For AL approaches to NER, sentence selection recovers better from unfavorable seed sets than token selection due to what we call the co-selection effect.",
        "Under this effect, a non-targeted entity class co-occurs in sentences that were originally selected because of uncertainty on tokens of a different entity class.",
        "The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces the missed class effect in detail.",

        "This section first describes the missed class effect.",
        "Then, we discuss several factors influencing this effect, focusing on co-selection, a natural phenomenon in common NLP applications of AL.",
        "The distribution of the labeled data points obtained with an active learner deviates from the true data distribution.",
        "While this sampling bias is intended and accounts for the effectiveness of AL, it also poses challenges as it leads to classifiers that perform poorly in some regions, or clusters, of the example space.",
        "In the literature, this phenomenon has been described as the missed cluster effect (Schütze et al., 2006; Dasgupta and Hsu, 2008)",
        "In this context, we must distinguish between exploration and exploitation.",
        "By design, AL is a highly exploitative strategy: regions around decision boundaries are inspected thoroughly so that decision boundaries are learned well, but regions far from any of the initial decision boundaries remain unexplored.",
        "An exploitative sampling approach thus has to be combined with some kind of exploratory strategy to make sure the example space is adequately covered.",
        "A common approach is to start an AL process with an initial seed set that accounts for the exploration step.",
        "However, a seed set which is not representative of the example space may completely misguide AL – at least when no other explorative techniques are applied as a remedy.",
        "While approaches to balancing exploration and exploitation (Baram et al., 2003; Dasgupta and Hsu, 2008; Cebron and Berfhold, 2009) have been discussed, we here focus on a \"pure\" AL scenario where exploration takes only place in the beginning by a seed set.",
        "In summary, the missed clusters are the result of a scenario where poor exploration is combined with exclusively exploitative sampling.",
        "Why is AL an exploitative sampling strategy?",
        "AL selects data points based on the confidence of the active learner.",
        "Assume an initial seed set that does not contain examples of a specific cluster.",
        "This leads to an initial active learner that is mistakenly overconfident about the class membership of instances in this missed cluster.",
        "Far away from the decision boundary, the active learner assumes a high confidence for",
        "Figure 1: Illustration of the missed cluster effect in a 1-d scenario.",
        "Shaded points are contained in the seed set, vertical lines are final decision boundaries, and dashed rectangles mark the explored regions all instances in that cluster, even if they are in fact misclassified.",
        "Consequently, the active learner will fail to select these instances for long until some redirection impulse is received (if at all).",
        "To give an example, let us consider a simple 1-d toy scenario with examples from three clusters A, B, and C as shown in Figure 1.",
        "In scenario (a), AL is started from a seed set including one example of clusters A and B only.",
        "In subsequent rounds, AL will select examples in these clusters only (shown as the dashed box in the figure).",
        "Examples in cluster C are ignored as they are far from the initial decision boundary.",
        "Eventually, a decision boundary is fixed as shown by the vertical line which indicates that this AL process has completely overlooked examples from cluster C.",
        "Assuming that the examples fall in two classes Xi = {A U C} and X2 = {B} the learned classifier has low recall for class X\\ and relatively low precision for class X2 as it erroneously assigns examples of cluster C to class X2.",
        "In a related scenario with three classes X\\ = {A}, X2 = {£>}, and Xs = {C} this would even mean that the classifier is not at all aware about the third class resulting in the missed class problem.",
        "A more representative seed set circumvents this problem.",
        "Given a seed set including one example of each cluster, AL might find a second decision boundary between clusters B and C because it is now aware of examples from C. Figure 1(b) shows a possible result of AL on this seed set.",

        "In general, it has the same causes (insufficient exploration and misguided exploitation), but is easier to test.",
        "Often we know (at least the number of) all classes under scrutiny, while we usually cannot assume all clusters in the feature space to be known.",
        "In this paper, we focus on the missed class effect, i.e., scenarios where classes are overlooked by a misguided AL process resulting in a slow (active) learning progress.",
        "AL in a practical scenario is subject to several factors which mitigate or intensify the missed class effect described before.",
        "In the following, we describe three such factors, with a special focus on the co-selection effect, which we claim to significantly mitigate the missed class effect in a specific type of NLP tasks, sequence learning problems such as NER or POS tagging.",
        "Class imbalance Many studies on AL for NLP tasks assume that AL is started from a randomly drawn seed set.",
        "Such a seed set can be problematic when the class distribution in the data is highly skewed.",
        "In this case, \"rare\" classes might not be represented in the seed set, increasing the chance to completely miss out such a class using AL.",
        "When classes are relatively frequent, an active learner – even when started from an unfavorable seed set – might still mistake an example of one class for an uncertain example of a different class and consequently select it.",
        "Thereby, it can acquire information about the former class \"by accident\" leading to sudden and rapid discovery of the newly-found class.",
        "However, in the case of extreme class imbalance this is very unlikely.",
        "Severe class imbalance intensifies the missed cluster effect.",
        "Similarity of considered classes If, e.g., two of the classes to be learned, say Xj and Xj, are harder to discriminate than others, or if the data contains lots of noise, an active learner is more likely to select some instances of Xj if at least its \"similar\" counterpart Xj was represented in the seed set.",
        "Hence, it may mistake the instances of Xj and Xj before it has acquired enough information to discriminate between them.",
        "So, under certain situations similarity of classes can mitigate the missed class effect.",
        "The co-selection effect Many NLP tasks are sequence learning problems including, e.g., POS tagging, and named entity recognition.",
        "Sequences are consecutive text tokens constituting linguistically plausible chunks, e.g., sentences.",
        "Algorithms for sequence learning obviously work on sequence data, so respective AL approaches need to select complete sequences instead of single text tokens (Settles and Craven, 2008).",
        "Furthermore, sentence selection has been preferred over token selection in other works with the argument that the manual annotation of single, possibly isolated tokens is almost impossible or at least extremely time-consuming (Ringger et al., 2007; Tomanek et al., 2007).",
        "Within such sequences, instances of different classes often co-occur.",
        "Thus, an active learner that selects uncertain examples of one class gets examples of a second class as an unintended, yet positive side effect.",
        "We call this the co-selection effect.",
        "As a result, AL for sequence labeling is not \"pure\" exploitative AL, but implicitly comprises an exploratory aspect which can substantially reduce the missed class problem.",
        "In scenarios where we cannot hope for such a co-selection, we are much more likely to have decreased AL performance due to missed clusters or classes."

        "The experiments were run on synthetic and real data in the context of named entity recognition (NER).",

        "As PENNBIOIE makes fine-grained and subtle distinctions between various subtypes of classes irrelevant for this study, we combined several of the original classes into two entity classes: The majority class consists of the three original classes 'gene-protein', 'gene-generic', and 'gene-rna'.",
        "The minority class consists of the original and similar classes 'variation-type' and 'variation-event'.",

        "(ii) marked entity class imbalance between the majority and minority classes (iii) dissimilar surface patterns of entity mentions of the two entity classes with the rationale that class similarity will be low.",
        "Table 1 summarizes characteristics of the data sets.",
        "While Syn exhibits high imbalance (e.g., 1:9.4 on the token level), PBIO and ACE are moderately skewed.",
        "In PBIO, the number of sentences containing any entity mention is relatively high compared to ACE or SYN.",

        "Table 2 shows correlation statistics based on the X measure.",

        "Selection of an appropriate seed set for the start of an AL process is important to the success of AL.",
        "This is especially relevant in the case of imbalanced classes because a typically small random sample will possibly not contain any example of the rare class.",
        "We constructed different types of seed sets (whose naming intentionally reflects the use of the entity classes from Section 3.2) to simulate different scenarios of ill-managed initial exploration.",
        "All seed sets have a size of 20 sentences.",
        "The RANDOM set was randomly sampled, the MAJ set is made of sentences containing at least one majority class entity, but no minority class entity.",

        "The success of AL is usually measured as reduction of annotation effort according to some cost measure.",
        "Traditionally, the most common cost measure considers a unit cost per annotated token, which favors AL systems that select individual tokens.",
        "In a real annotation setting, however, it is unnatural, and therefore hard for humans to annotate single, possibly isolated tokens, leading to bad annotation quality (Hachey et al., 2005; Ringger et al., 2007).",
        "When providing context, the question arises whether the annotator can label several tokens present in the context (e.g., an entire multi-token entity or even the whole sentence) at little more cost than annotating a single token.",
        "Thus, assigning a linear cost of n to a sentence where n is the sentence's length in tokens seems to unfairly disadvantage sentence-selection AL setups.",
        "However, more work is needed to find a more realistic cost measure.",

        "Overall, the missed class effect is less pronounced on Ace compared to PBio.",
        "Still, co-selection avoids a good portion of the missed class effect on SAL – all seed sets yield results much better than random selection right from the beginning.",
        "On T-AL, the OUTSIDE seed set has a marked negative effect.",
        "However, while different seed sets still have visible differences in learning performance, the magnitude of the effect is smaller than on PBio.",
        "It is difficult to find the exact reasons in a non-synthetic, natural language corpus where a lot of different effects are intermingled.",
        "One might assume higher class similarity between the majority (\"persons\") and the minority (\"organizations\") classes on the Ace corpus than, e.g., on the PBio corpus.",
        "Moreover, there is hardly any imbalance in frequency between the two entity classes on the Ace corpus.",
        "We briefly discussed such influencing factors possibly mitigating the missed class effect in Section 2.2.",
        "To summarize, on a synthetic corpus (Syn) the missed class effect can be well studied in both",
        "AL scenarios, i.e., SAL and T-AL.",
        "Moving from a relatively controlled, synthetic corpus (extreme class imbalance, no inner-sentence co-occurrence between entity classes, quite different entity classes) to more realistic corpora, effects generally mix a bit due to different degrees of class imbalance and probably higher similarity between entity classes.",
        "Our experiments unveil that co-selection in SAL effectively helps avoid dysfunctional classifiers that insufficiently explore the instance space due to a disadvantageous seed set.",
        "In contrast, AL based on token-selection (T-AL) cannot recover from insufficient exploration as easy as AL with sentence-selection and is thus more sensitive to the missed class effect."

      "text": [
        "We have shown that insufficient exploration in the initial stages of active learning gives rise to regions of the sample space that contain missed classes that are incorrectly classified.",
        "This results in low classification performance and slow learning progress.",
        "Comparing two sampling granularities, tokens vs. sentences, we found that the missed class effect is more severe when isolated tokens instead of sentences are selected for labeling.",
        "The missed class problem in sequence classification tasks can be avoided using sentences as natural multi-instance units for selection and labeling.",
        "Using multi-instance units, co-selection of other tokens within sentences provides an implicit exploratory component.",
        "This solution is effective if classes co-occur sufficiently within sentences which is the case for many real-life entity recognition tasks.",
        "While other work has proposed sentence selection in AL for sequence labeling as a means to ease and speed up annotation, we have gathered here additional motivation from the perspective of robustness of learning.",
        "Future work will compare the beneficial effect introduced by co-selection with other forms of exploration-enabled active learning."
