        "Active Learning is the process of selectively querying the user to annotate examples with the goal of minimizing the total annotation cost.",
        "Annotation cost has been traditionally measured in terms of the number of examples annotated, but it has been widely acknowledged that different examples may require different annotation effort (Settles et al., 2008; Ringgeretal., 2008).",
        "Ideally, we would use actual human annotation cost for evaluating selective sampling strategies, but this will require conducting several user studies, one per strategy on the same dataset.",
        "Alternatively, we may be able to simulate the real user by an annotation cost estimator that can then be used to evaluate several selective sampling strategies without having to run a new user study each time.",
        "An annotation cost estimator models the characteristics that can differentiate the examples in terms of their annotation time.",
        "The characteristics that strongly correlate with the annotation time can be used as a criterion in selective sampling strategies to minimize the total annotation cost.",
        "In some domains, the annotation cost of an example is known or can be calculated exactly before querying the user.",
        "For example, in biological experiments it might be calculable from the cost of the equipment and the material used (King et al., 2004).",
        "In NLP, sometimes a simplifying assumption is made that the annotation cost for an example can be measured in terms of its length (e.g. seconds of voicemail annotated (Kapoor et al., 2007); number of tokens annotated (Tomanek et al., 2007)).",
        "Another assumption is that the number of user annotation actions can be used as a proxy for annotation cost of an example (e.g. number of brackets added for parsing a sentence (Hwa, 2000); number of clicks for correcting named entities (Kristjannson et al., 2004)).",
        "While these are important factors in determining the annotation cost, none of them alone can fully substitute for the actual annotation cost.",
        "For example, a short sentence with a lot of embedded clauses may be more costly to annotate than a longer sentence with simpler grammatical structure.",
        "Similarly, a short sentence with multiple verbs and discontinuous arguments may take more time to annotate with semantic roles than a longer sentence with a single verb and simple subject-verb-object structure (Carreras and Marquez, 2004).",
        "What further complicates the estimation of annotation cost is that even for the same example, annotation cost may vary across annotators (Settles et al., 2008).",
        "For example, non-native speakers of English were found to take longer time to annotate part of speech tags (Ringger et al., 2008).",
        "Often multiple annotators are used for creating an annotated corpus to avoid annotator bias, and we may not know all our annotators beforehand.",
        "Annotation cost also depends on the user interface used for annotation (Gweon et al., 2005), and the user interface may change during an annotation task.",
        "Thus, we need a general annotation cost estimator that can predict annotation cost for a given annotator and user interface.",
        "A general estimator can be built by using annotator and user interface characteristics in addition to the instance characteristics for learning an annotation cost model, and training on data from multiple annotators and multiple user interfaces.",
        "Such a general estimator is important for active learning research where the goal is to compare selective sampling strategies independent of the annotator and the user interface.",
        "In this work, we investigate the annotation cost estimation problem for a movie review classification task in a multi-annotator environment with a fixed user interface.",
        "We demonstrate that a combination of instance, annotation task and annotator characteristics is important for accurately estimating the annotation cost.",
        "In the remainder of the paper, we first present a survey of related work and an analysis of the data collected.",
        "We then describe the features used for our supervised learning approach to annotation cost estimation, followed by the experimental setup and results.",
        "Finally, we conclude with some future directions we would like to explore."

        "(2008).",

        "Results from Settles et al.",
        "(2008) are promising but leave much room for improvement.",
        "They used only instance level features such as number of entities, length, number of characters, percentage of non-alpha numeric characters, etc.",
        "for annotation cost estimation.",
        "For three of their tasks, the correlation between the estimated and actual annotation times was in the range (R = 0.587 to 0.852).",
        "Note that the percentage of variance accounted for by a model is obtained by squaring the R value from the correlation coefficient.",
        "Thus, an R value of 0.587 indicates that only about 34% (R) of the variance is accounted for, so the model will make incorrect predictions about ranking in the majority of cases.",
        "Nevertheless, we acknowledge that our results are not substantially better, although we argue that this work contributes to the pool of knowledge that will hopefully lead to better performance in the future.",
        "Settles et al.",
        "(2008) train and test their estimator on data from the same annotator.",
        "Thus, in order to use their model for a new annotator, we would need to first collect data for that annotator and train a model.",
        "In our work, a group of annotators annotate the same text, and we train and test on different annotators.",
        "We also show that using characteristics of the annotators and annotation task in addition to the instance characteristics improves performance.",
        "Ringger et al.",
        "(2008) use linear regression for annotation cost estimation for Part-Of-Speech (POS) tagging.",
        "About 30 annotators annotated 36 different instances each.",
        "The authors present about 13 descriptive statistics of the data, annotator and annotation task, but in their model they only used number of tokens in the sentence and the number of corrections needed as features.",
        "They report that the other variables didn't have a significant effect when evaluated using a Bayesian Information Criterion (from the R package).",
        "Ringger et al.",
        "(2008) noticed that nativeness of the annotator did have an effect on the annotation time, but they chose not to include that feature in their model as they expected to have a similar mix of skills and background in their target annotators.",
        "However, if annotation times differ substantially across annotators, then not accounting for this difference will reduce the performance of the model.",
        "Also, the low adjusted correlation value for their model (R = 0.",
        "181 ) indicates that there is only a weak correlation between the annotation time and a linear combination of the length of the example and the number of corrections."

        "As can be seen, all features have significant correlation with annotation time except stop words percentage and average sentence length.",
        "Note that number of rationales has higher correlation with annotation time (R = 0.529) than character length (R = 0.417).",
        "This suggests that number of rationales may have more influence than character length on annotation time, and a low correlation between number of rationales and character length (R = 0.238) indicates that it might not be the case that longer documents necessarily contain more rationales.",
        "Annotating rationales requires cognitive effort of identifying the right span and manual effort to highlight and add an annotation, and hence more rationales implies more annotation time.",
        "We also found some examples in our data where documents with substantially different lengths but same number of rationales took a similar time to annotate.",
        "One possible explanation for this observation is user's annotation strategy.",

        "We plan to investigate the effect of annotator's strategy on annotation time in the future.",
        "A negative correlation of nativeness with annotation time (R = – 0.219) is expected, since native speakers (AN = 3) are expected to take less annotation time than non-native speakers (AN = {2,1}), although this correlation is low.",
        "A low correlation between number of rationales and nativeness (R = 0.149) suggests that number of rationales a user adds may not be influenced much by their nativeness value.",

        "There is also a strong correlation between character length and polar word count (R = 0.89).",
        "Since reviews are essentially people's opinions, we can expect longer documents to have more polar words.",
        "This also explains why there is no significant difference in performance for polar word count and character length (Table 4).",
        "A more useful feature may be the information about the number of positive and negative polar words in a review, since a review with both positive and negative opinions can be difficult to classify as positive or negative.",

        "These differences suggest that features which correlate well with the annotation times (higher CR-Coef rank) can give an accurate ranking of examples based on their annotation cost, but they may not be as accurate in their absolute estimate for simulating annotators and thus might have a lower RMS rank.",

        "Our multi-annotator environment allows us to train and test on data from different annotators by using annotator characteristics as features in the annotation cost estimation.",
        "A model trained on data from a variety of annotators can be used for recommending examples to annotators not represented in our training data but with similar characteristics.",
        "This is important since we may not always know all our annotators before building the model, and training an estimator for each new annotator is costly.",
        "Also, in active learning research, the goal is to evaluate selective sampling approaches independently of the annotator.",
        "Choosing annotators for supervised annotation cost estimation such that the within group variance in annotator characteristics is high will give us a more generic estimator and a stricter evaluation criterion.",
        "Thus, we have a framework that has the potential to be used to build a user-independent annotation cost estimator for a given task.",
        "However, this framework is specific to the User Interface (UI) used.",
        "A change in the user interface might require recollecting the data from all the annotators and training a model on the new data.",
        "For example, if annotating rationales was made significantly faster in a new UI design, it would have a major impact on annotation cost.",
        "An alternative would be to incorporate UI features in our model and train it on several different Uls or modifications of the same UI, which will allow us to use our trained model with a new user interface or modifications of the existing UIs, without having to recollect the data and retrain the model.",
        "A few UI features that can be used in our context are: adding a rationale annotation, voting positive or negative, etc.",
        "The units for expressing these features will be the low-level user interface actions such as number of clicks, mouse drags, etc.",
        "For example, in our task, adding a rationale annotation requires one mouse drag and two clicks, and adding a vote requires one click.",
        "In a different user interface, adding a rationale annotation might require just one mouse drag.",
        "Using UI features raises a question of whether they can replace the annotation task features; e.g., whether the UI feature for adding rationale annotation can replace the number of rationales feature.",
        "Our hypothesis is that number of rationales has more influence on annotation time than just the manual effort of annotating them.",
        "It also requires the cognitive effort of finding the rationale, deciding its span, etc.",
