        "(2004): a crowd of 5,000 people playing an appropriately designed computer game 24 hours a day, could be made to label all images on Google (425,000,000 images in 2005) in a matter of just 31 days.",
        "Several recent papers have studied the use of annotations obtained from Amazon Mechanical Turk, a marketplace for recruiting online workers (Su et al., 2007; Kaisser et al., 2008; Kittur et al., 2008; Sheng et al., 2008; Snow et al., 2008; Sorokin and Forsyth, 2008).",
        "With efficiency and cost-effectiveness, online recruitment of anonymous annotators brings a new set of issues to the table.",
        "These workers are not usually specifically trained for annotation, and might not be highly invested in producing good-quality annotations.",
        "Consequently, the obtained annotations may be noisy by nature, and might require additional validation or scrutiny.",
        "Several interesting questions immediately arise in how to optimally utilize annotations in this setting: How does one handle differences among workers in terms of the quality of annotations they provide?",
        "How useful are noisy annotations for the end task of creating a model?",
        "Is it possible to identify genuinely ambiguous examples via annotator disagreements?",
        "How should these considerations be treated with respect to intrinsic informativeness of examples?",
        "These questions also hint at a strong connection to active learning, with annotation quality as a new dimension to the problem.",
        "As a challenging empirical testbed for these issues, we consider the problem of sentiment classification on political blogs.",
        "Given a snippet drawn from a political blog post, the desired output is a polarity score that indicates whether the sentiment expressed is positive or negative.",
        "Such an analysis provides a view of the opinion around a subject of interest, e.g., US Presidential candidates, aggregated across the blogsphere.",
        "Recently, sentiment analysis is emerging as a critical methodology for social media analytics.",
        "Previous research has focused on classifying subjective-versus-objective expressions (Wiebe et al., 2004), and also on accurate sentiment polarity assignment (Turney, 2002; Yi et al., 2003; Pang and Lee, 2004; Sindhwani and Melville, 2008;",
        "Melville et al., 2009).",
        "The success of most prior work relies on the quality of their knowledge bases; either lexicons defining the sentiment polarity of words around a topic (Yi et al., 2003), or quality annotation data for statistical training.",
        "While manual intervention for compiling lexicons has been significantly lessened by bootstrapping techniques (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Wiebe and Riloff, 2005), manual intervention in the annotation process is harder to avoid.",
        "Moreover, the task of annotating blog-post snippets is challenging, particularly in a charged political atmosphere with complex discourse spanning many issues, use of cynicism and sarcasm, and highly domain-specific and contextual cues.",
        "The downside is that high-performance models are generally difficult to construct, but the upside is that annotation and data-quality issues are more clearly exposed.",
        "In this paper we aim to provide an empirical basis for the use of data selection criteria in the context of sentiment analysis in political blogs.",
        "Specifically, we highlight the need for a set of criteria that can be applied to screen untrustworthy annotators and select informative yet unambiguous examples for the end goal of predictive modeling.",
        "In Section 2, we first examine annotation data obtained by both the expert and non-expert annotators to quantify the impact of including non-experts.",
        "Then, in Section 3, we quantify criteria that can be used to select annotators and examples for selective sampling.",
        "Next, in Section 4, we address the questions of whether the noisy annotations are still useful for this task and study the effect of the different selection criteria on the performance of this task.",

        "The annotation process consists of two steps:",
        "Sentiment-class annotation: In the first step, as we are only interested in detecting sentiments related to the named candidate, the annotators were first asked to mark up the snippets irrelevant to the named candidate's election campaign.",

        "Alignment annotation: In the second step, the annotators were instructed to mark up whether each snippet was written to support or oppose the target candidate therein named.",
        "The motivation of adding this tag comes from our interest in building a classification system to detect positive and negative mentions of each candidate.",
        "For the snippets that do not contain a clear political alignment, the annotators had the freedom to mark it as neutral or simply not alignment-revealing.",
        "In our pilot study many bloggers were observed to endorse a named candidate by using negative expressions to denounce his opponent.",

        "The alignment coding task has been shown to be reliable, with the annotators agreeing 76.8% of the time overall on the three-level codings: Support/Against/Neutral.",

        "Results show that the Pooling Multinomial classifier, which makes predictions based on both the prior lexical knowledge and the training data, can learn the most from the labeled data to classify sentiments of the political blog snippets.",
        "We observe that despite the significant level of noise and ambiguity in the training data, using majority-labeled data for training still results in classifiers with reasonable accuracy.",
        "We then evaluate the utility of the quality measures in a randomly split dataset (with 7.5% of the data in the test set).",
        "We applied each of the measures to rank the annotation examples and then divide them into 4 equal-sized training sets based on their rankings.",
        "For example, Noise-Ql contains only the least noisy quarter of annotations and Q4 the most noisy ones.",
        "Results in Table 4 demonstrate that the classification performance declines with the decrease of each quality measure in general, despite exceptions in the subset with the highest sentiment ambiguity (Ambiguity-Q4), the most noisy subset Q4 (Noise-Q4), and the subset yielding less overall confusion (Confusion-Q2).",
        "The results also reveal the benefits of annotation selection on efficiency: using the subset of annotations predicted in the top quality quarter achieves similar performance as using the whole training set.",
        "These preliminary results suggest that an active learning scheme which considers all three quality measures may indeed be effective in improving label quality and subsequent classification accuracy."

        "In this paper, we have analyzed the difference between expert and non-expert annotators in terms of annotation quality, and showed that having a single non-expert annotator is detrimental for annotating sentiment in political snippets.",
        "However, we confirmed that using multiple noisy annotations from different non-experts can still be very useful for modeling.",
        "This finding is consistent with the simulated results reported in (Sheng et al., 2008).",
        "Given the availability of many non-expert annotators on-demand, we studied three important dimensions to consider when acquiring annotations: (1) the noise level of an annotator compared to others, (2) the inherent ambiguity of an example's class label, and (3) the informativeness of an example to the current classification model.",
        "While the first measure has been studied with annotations obtained from experts (Dawid and Skene, 1979; Clemen and Reilly, 1999), the applicability of their findings on non-expert annotation selection has not been examined.",
        "We showed how quality of labels can be improved by eliminating noisy annotators and ambiguous examples.",
        "Furthermore, we demonstrated the quality measures are useful for selecting annotations that lead to more accurate classification models.",
        "Our results suggest that a good active learning or online learning scheme in this setting should really consider all three dimensions.",
        "The way we use to integrate the different dimensions now is still preliminary.",
        "Also, our empirical findings suggest that some of the dimensions may have to be considered separately.",
        "For example, due to the divisive tendency of the most informative examples, these examples may have to be disregarded in the initial stage of annotation selection.",
        "Also, the way we use to combine these measures is still preliminary.",
        "The design and testing of such schemes are avenues for future work.",
