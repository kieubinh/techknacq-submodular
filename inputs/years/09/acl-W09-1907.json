        "As a canonical running example for the theme of this paper, consider the problem of sentiment analysis (Pang and Lee, 2008).",
        "Given a piece of text as input, the desired output is a polarity score that indicates whether this text expresses a positive or negative opinion towards a topic of interest.",
        "From a machine learning viewpoint, this problem may be posed as a typical binary text classification task.",
        "Sentiment, however, is often conveyed with subtle linguistic mechanisms such as sarcasm, negation and the use of highly domain-specific and contextual cues.",
        "This brings a multidisciplinary flavor to the problem, drawing interest from both Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning communities.",
        "Many methodologies proposed in these disciplines share a common limitation that their performance is bounded by the amount and quality of labeled data.",
        "However, they differ conceptually in the type of human effort they require.",
        "On one hand, supervised machine learning techniques require human effort in acquiring labeled examples, which requires reading documents and annotating them with their aggregate sentiment.",
        "On the other hand, dictionary-based NLP systems require human effort in collecting labeled features: for example, in the domain of movie reviews, words that evoke positive sentiment (e.g., \"mesmerizing\", \"thrilling\" etc) may be labeled positive, while words that evoke negative sentiment (e.g., \"boring\",\"disappointing\") may be labeled negative.",
        "This kind of annotation requires a human to condense prior linguistic experience with a word into a sentiment label that reflects the net emotion that the word evokes.",
        "We refer to the general setting of learning from both labels on examples and features as dual supervision.",
        "This setting arises more broadly in tasks where in addition to labeled documents, it is frequently possible to provide domain knowledge in the form of words, or phrases (Zaidan and Eisner, 2008) or even more sophisticated linguistic features, that associate strongly with a class.",
        "Recent work (Druck et al., 2008; Sindhwani and Melville, 2008) has demonstrated that the presence of word supervision can greatly reduce the number of labeled documents required to build high quality text classifiers.",
        "In general, these two sources of supervision are not mutually redundant, and have different annotation costs, human response quality, and degrees of utility towards learning a dual supervision model.",
        "This leads naturally to the problem of active dual supervision, or, how to optimally query a human oracle to simultaneously collect document and feature annotations, with the objective of building the highest quality model with the lowest cost.",
        "Much of the machine learning literature on active learning has focused on one-sided example-only annotation for classification problems.",
        "Less attention has been devoted to simultaneously acquiring alternative forms of supervisory domain knowledge, such as the kind routinely encountered in NLP.",
        "Our contribution may be viewed as a step in this direction."

        "Most work in supervised learning has focused on learning from examples, each represented by a set of feature values and a class label.",
        "In dual supervision we consider an additional aspect, by way of labels of features, which convey prior knowledge on associations of features to particular classes.",
        "Since we deal only with text classification in this paper, all features represent term-frequencies of words, and as such we use feature and word interchangeably.",
        "The active learning schemes we explore in this paper are broadly applicable to any learner that can support dual supervision, but here we focus on active learning for the Pooling Multinomials classifier (Melville et al., 2009) described below.",
        "In concurrent related work, we propose active dual supervision schemes for a class of graph-based and kernel-based dual supervision methods (Sindhwani et al., 2009).",
        "The Pooling Multinomials classifier was introduced by Melville et al.",
        "(2009) as an approach to incorporate prior lexical knowledge into supervised learning for better sentiment detection.",
        "In the context of sentiment analysis, lexical knowledge is available in terms of the prior sentiment-polarity of words.",
        "From a dual supervision point of view, this knowledge can be seen as labeled features, since the lexicon effectively provides associations of a set of words with the positive or negative class.",
        "Pooling Multinomials classifies unlabeled examples just as in multinomial Naive Bayes classification (McCallum and Nigam, 1998), by predicting the class with the maximum likelihood, given by argmaxCj P (cj ) fj % P (wi\\cj); where P (cj) is the prior probability of class Cj, and P(w%\\cj) is the probability of word w% appearing in a document of class cj.",
        "In the absence of background knowledge about the class distribution, we estimate the class priors P(cj) solely from the training data.",
        "However, unlike regular Naive Bayes, the conditional probabilities P(w%\\cj) are computed using both the labeled examples and the labeled features.",
        "Pooling distributions is a general approach for combining information from multiple sources or experts; where experts are typically represented in terms of probability distributions (Clemen and Winkler, 1999).",
        "Here, we only consider the special case of combining multinomial distributions from two sources - namely, the labeled examples and labeled features.",
        "The multinomial parameters of such models can be easily combined using the linear opinion pool (Clemen and Winkler, 1999), in which the aggregate probability is given by P(w%\\cj) = aPe(w%\\cj) + (1 - a)Pf (w%\\cj); where Pe(w%\\cj) and Pf (w%\\cj) represent the probability assigned by using the example labels and feature labels respectively, and a is the weight for combining these distributions.",
        "The weight indicates a level of confidence in each source of information, and Melville et al.",
        "(2009) explore ways of automatically selecting this weight.",
        "However, in order to not confound our results with the choice of weight-selection mechanism, here we make the simplifying assumption that the two experts based on instance and feature labels are equally valuable, and as such set a to 0.5.",
        "To learn a model from the labeled examples we compute conditionals Pe(w%\\cj) based on observed term frequencies, as in standard Naive Bayes classification.",
        "In addition, for Pooling Multinomials we need to construct a multinomial model representing the labeled features in the background knowledge.",
        "For this, we assume that the feature-class associations provided by labeled features are implicitly arrived at by human experts by examining many positive and negative sentiment documents.",
        "So we attempt to select the parameters Pf (w%\\cj) of the multinomial distributions that would generate such documents.",
        "The exact values of these conditionals are presented below.",
        "Their derivation is not directly pertinent to the subject of this paper, but can be found in (Melville et al., 2009).",
        "V - the vocabulary, i.e., set of words in our domain",
        "P - set of words labeled as positive",
        "N - set of words labeled as negative p - number of positive words, i.e. \\P\\ n - number of negative words, i.e. \\N\\",
        "All words in the vocabulary can be divided into three categories - words with a positive label, negative label, and unknown label.",
        "We refer to the probability of any positive term appearing in a positive document simply as Pf (w+ \\+).",
        "Similarly, we refer to the probability of any negative term appearing in a negative document as Pf (w_\\ – ); and the probability of an unknown word in a positive or negative context as Pf(wu\\+) and Pf(wu\\ – ) respectively.",
        "The generative model for labeled features can then be defined by:",
        "where, the polarity level, r, is a measure of how much more likely it is for a positive term to occur in a positive document compared to a negative term.",
        "The value of r is set to 100 in our experiments, as done in (Melville et al., 2009).",
        "Dual supervision makes it possible to learn from labeled examples and labeled features simultaneously; and, as in most supervised learning tasks, one would expect more labeled data of either form to lead to more accurate models.",
        "In this section we explore the influence of increased number of instance labels and feature labels independently, and also in tandem.",
        "For these, and all subsequent experiments, we use 10-fold cross-validation on the publicly available data of movie reviews provided by Pang et al.",
        "(2002).",
        "This data consists of 1000 positive and 1000 negative reviews from the Internet Movie Database; where positive labels were assigned to reviews that had a rating above 3.5 stars and negative labels were assigned to ratings of 2 stars and below.",
        "We use a bag-of-words representation of reviews, where each review is represented by the term frequencies of the 5000 most frequent words across all reviews, excluding stop-words.",
        "In order to study the effect of increasing number of labels we need to simulate a human oracle labeling data.",
        "In the case of examples this is straightforward, since all examples in the Movies dataset have labels.",
        "However, in the case of features, we do not have a gold-standard set of feature labels.",
        "So in order to simulate human responses to queries for feature labels, we construct a feature oracle in the following manner.",
        "The information gain of words with respect to the known true class labels in the dataset is computed using binary feature representations.",
        "Next, out of the 5000 total words, the top 1000 as ranked by information gain are assigned a label.",
        "This label is the class in which the word appears more frequently.",
        "The oracle returns a \"dont know\" response for the remaining words.",
        "Thus, this oracle simulates a human domain expert who is able to recognize and label the most relevant task-specific words, and also reject a word that falls below the relevance threshold.",
        "For instance, in sentiment classification, we would expect a \"don't know\" response for non-polar words.",
        "We ran experiments beginning with a classifier provided with labels for 10 randomly selected instances and 10 randomly selected features.",
        "We then compare three schemes - Instances-then-features, Features-then-instances, and Passive Interleaving.",
        "As the name suggests, Instances-then-features, is provided labels for randomly selected instances until all instances have been labeled, and then switches to labeling features.",
        "Similarly, Features-then-instances acquires labels for randomly selected features first and then switches to getting instance labels.",
        "In Passive Interleaving we probabilistically switch between issuing queries for randomly chosen instance and feature labels.",
        "In particular, at each step we choose to query for an instance with probability 0.36, otherwise we query for a feature label.",
        "The instance-query rate of 0.36 is selected based on the ratio of available instances (1800) to available features (5000).",
        "The results of these learning curves are presented in Fig. 1.",
        "Note that the x-axis in the figure corresponds to the number of queries issued.",
        "As discussed earlier, in the case of features, the oracle may respond to a query with a class label or may issue a \"don't know\" response, indicating that no label is available.",
        "As such, the number of feature-queries on the x-axis does not correspond to the number of actual known feature labels.",
        "We would expect that on average 1 in 5 feature-label queries prompts a response from the feature oracle that results in a known feature label being provided.",
        "At the end of the learning curves, each method has labels for all available instances and features; and as such, the last points of all three curves are identical.",
        "The results show that fixing the number of labeled features, and increasing the number of labeled instances steadily improves classification accuracy.",
        "This is what one would expect from traditional supervised learning curves.",
        "More interestingly, the results also indicate that we can fix the number of instances, and improve accuracy by labeling more features.",
        "Finally, results on Passive Interleaving show that, though both feature labels and example labels are beneficial by themselves, dual supervision which exploits the interaction of examples and features does in fact benefit from acquiring both types of labels concurrently.",
        "For all results above, we are selecting instances and/or features to be labeled uniformly at random.",
        "Based on previous work in active learning one would expect that we can select instances to be labeled more efficiently, by having the learner decide which instances it is most likely to benefit from.",
        "The results in this section suggests that actively selecting features to be labeled may also be beneficial.",
        "Furthermore, the Passive Interleaving results suggest that an ideal active dual supervision scheme would actively select both instances and features for labeling.",

        "Traditional active learning has primarily focused on selecting unlabeled instances to be labeled.",
        "The dual-supervision setting now provides us with an additional dimension to active learning, where labels may also be acquired for features.",
        "In this section we look at the novel task of active learning applied only to feature-label acquisition.",
        "In Section 4 we study the more general task of active dual supervision, where both instance and feature labels may be acquired concurrently.",
        "A very common approach to active learning for instances is Uncertainty Sampling (Lewis and Catlett, 1994).",
        "In this approach we acquire labels for instances that the current model is most uncertain about.",
        "Uncertainty Sampling is founded on the heuristic that uncertain instances are close to the current classification boundary, and acquiring the correct labels for them are likely to help refine the location of this boundary.",
        "Despite its simplicity, Uncertainty Sampling is usually quite effective in practice; which raises the question of whether one can apply the same principle to feature-label acquisition.",
        "In this case, we want to select unlabeled features that the current model is most uncertain about.",
        "Much like instance uncertainty, feature uncertainty can be measured in different ways, depending on the underlying method used for dual supervision.",
        "For instance, if the learner produces a linear classifier as in (Sindhwani and Melville, 2008), we could use the magnitude of the weights on the features as a measure of uncertainty - where lower weights indicate less certainty.",
        "Since Pooling Multinomials builds a multinomial Naive Bayes model, we can directly use the model's conditional probabilities of each word (feature) given a class.",
        "For ease of exposition we refer to the two classes in binary classification as postive (+) and negative (-), without loss of generality.",
        "Given the probabilities of word f belonging to the positive and negative class, P(f |+) and P(f | – ), we can determine the uncertainty of a feature using the absolute value of the log-odds ratio, i.e.,",
        "The smaller this value, the more uncertain the model is about the feature's class association.",
        "In every iteration of active learning we can select the features with the lowest certainty scores.",
        "We refer to this approach as Feature Uncertainty.",
        "Though Uncertainty Sampling for features seems like an appealing notion, it may not lead to better models.",
        "If a classiier is uncertain about a feature, it may have insuficient information about this feature and may indeed beneit from learning its label.",
        "However, it is also quite likely that a feature has a low certainty score because it does not carry much discriminative information about the classes.",
        "In the context of sentiment detection, one would expect that neutral/non-polar words will appear to be uncertain words.",
        "For example, words such as \"the\" which are unlikely to help in discriminating between classes, are also likely to be considered the most uncertain.",
        "As we shortly report, on the movies dataset, Feature Uncertainty ends up wasting queries on such words ending up with performance inferior to random feature queries.",
        "What works signiicantly better is an alternative strategy which acquires labels for features in the descending order of the score in Eq 1.",
        "We refer to this approach as Feature Certainty.",
        "The intuition underlying the feature certainty heuristic is that it serves to conirm or correct the orientation of model probabilities on different words during the active learning process.",
        "One can argue that feature certainty is also suboptimal in that queries may be wasted simply conirming conident predictions, which is of limited utility to the model.",
        "An alternative to using a certainty-based heuristic, is to directly estimate the expected value of acquiring each feature label.",
        "Such Expected Utility (Estimated Risk Minimization) approaches have been applied successfully to traditional active learning (Roy and Mc-Callum, 2001), and to active feature-value acquisition (Melville et al., 2005).",
        "In this section we describe how this Expected Utility framework can be adapted for feature-label acquisition.",
        "At every step of active learning for features, the next best feature to label is one that will result in the highest improvement in classiier performance.",
        "Since the true label of the unlabeled features are unknown prior to acquisition, it is necessary to estimate the potential impact of every feature query for all possible outcomes.",
        "Hence, the decision-theoretic optimal policy is to ask for feature labels which, once incorporated into the data, will result in the highest increase in classiication performance in expectation.",
        "If fj is the label of the j-th feature, and qj is the query for this feature's label, then the Expected Utility of a feature query qj can be computed as:",
        "Where P(fj = ck) is the probability that fj will be labeled with class ck, and U(fj = ck) is the utility to the model of knowing that fj has the label ck.",
        "In practice, the true values of these two quantities are unknown, and the main challenge of any Expected Utility approach is to accurately estimate these quantities from the data currently available.",
        "A direct way to estimate the utility of a feature label to classiication, is to measure classiication accuracy on the training set of a model built using this feature label.",
        "However, small changes in the model that may result from a acquiring a single additional feature label may not be reflected by a change in accuracy.",
        "As such, we use a more ine-grained measure of classifier performance, Log Gain, which is computed as follows.",
        "For a model induced from a training set T, let P(ck |xj) be the probability estimated by the model that instance x% belongs to class ck; and I is an indicator function such that I(ck,Xi) = 1 if ck is the correct class for x% and I(ck, Xj) = 0, otherwise.",
        "Log Gain is then defined as:",
        "Then the utility of a classiier, U, can be measured by summing the Log Gain for all instances in the training set T. A lower value of Log Gain indicates a better classiier performance.",
        "For a deeper discussion of this measure see (Saar-Tsechansky et al., 2008).",
        "In Eq.",
        "2, apart from the measure of utility, we also do not know the true probability distribution of labels for the feature under consideration.",
        "This too can be estimated from the training data, by seeing how frequently the word appears in documents of each class.",
        "In a multinomial Naive Bayes model we already collect these statistics in order to determine the conditional probability of a class given a word, i.e. P(fj|ck).",
        "We can use these probabilities to get an estimate of the feature label distribution, t>(f- = c) = P (fj lcfe)",
        "Given the estimated values of the feature-label distribution and the utility of a particular feature query outcome, we can now estimate the Expected Utility of each unknown feature, and select the features with the highest Expected Utility to modeling.",
        "Though theoretically appealing, this approach is quite computationally intensive if applied to evaluate all unknown features.",
        "In the worst case it requires building and evaluating models for each possible outcome of each unlabeled feature query.",
        "If you have m features and K classes, this approach requires training O(mK) classifiers.",
        "However, the complexity of the approach can be signiicantly alleviated by only applying Expected Utility evaluation to a sub-sample ofall unlabeled features.",
        "Given the large number of features with no true class labels, selecting a sample of available features uniformly at random may be sub-optimal.",
        "Instead we select a sample of features based on Feature Certainty.",
        "In particular we select the top 100 unknown features that the current model is most certain about, and identify the features in this pool with the highest Expected Utility.",
        "We refer to this approach as Expected Feature Utility.",
        "We use Feature Certainty to sub-sample the available feature queries, since this approach is more likely to select features for which the label is known by the Oracle.",
        "We ran experiments comparing the three different active learning approaches described above.",
        "In these, and all subsequent experiments, we begin with a model trained on 10 labeled features and 100 labeled instances, which were randomly selected.",
        "From our prior efforts of manually labeling such data, we ind this to be a reasonable initial setting.",
        "The experiments in this section focus only on the selection offeatures to be labeled.",
        "So, in each iteration of active learning we select the next 10 featurelabel queries, based on Feature Uncertainty, Feature Certainty, or Expected Feature Utility.",
        "As a baseline, we also compare to the performance of a model that selects features uniformly at random.",
        "Our results are presented in Fig. 2.",
        "The results show that Feature Uncertainty, which is a direct analog of Uncertainty Sampling, actually performs worse than random sampling.",
        "Many uncertain features may actually not be very useful in discriminating between the classes, and selecting them can be systematically worse than selecting uniformly at random.",
        "However, the converse approach of Feature Certainty does remarkably well.",
        "This may be because polarized words are better for learning, but it is also likely that querying for such words increases the likelihood of selecting one whose label is known to the oracle.",
        "The results on Expected Feature Utility show that estimating the expected impact of potential labels for features does in fact perform much better than feature certainty.",
        "The results confirm that despite our crude estimations in Eq.",
        "2, Expected Feature Utility is an effective approach to active learning of feature labels.",
        "Furthermore, we demonstrate that by applying the approach to only a small sub-sample of certain features, we are able to make this method computationally feasible to use in practice.",

        "Though Active Interleaving is a very effective approach to active dual supervision, there is still a lot of room for improvement.",
        "Firstly, Active Interleaving relies on Uncertainty Sampling for the selection of instances.",
        "Though Uncertainty Sampling has the advantage of being fast and effective, there exist approaches that lead to better models with fewer examples - usually at the cost of computation time.",
        "One such method, estimating error reduction (Roy and McCallum, 2001), is a direct analog of Expected Feature Utility applied to instance selection.",
        "One would expect that an improvement in instance selection, should directly improve any method that combines instance and feature label selection.",
        "Secondly, Active Interleaving uses the simple approach of probabilistically choosing to select an instance or feature for each subsequent query.",
        "However, a more intelligent active scheme should be able to assess if an instance or feature would be more beneficial at each step.",
        "Furthermore, we do not currently consider the cost of acquiring labels.",
        "Presumably labeling a feature versus labeling an instance could incur very different costs - which could be monetary costs or time taken for each annotation.",
        "Fortunately, the Expected Utility method is very flexible, and allows us to address all these issues within a single framework.",
        "We can specifically estimate the expected utility of different forms of annotation, per unit cost.",
        "For instance, Provost et al.",
        "(2007) use such an approach to estimate the utility of acquiring class labels and feature values (not labels) per unit cost, within one unified framework.",
        "A similar method can be applied for a holistic approach to active dual supervision, where the Expected Utility of an instance or feature label query q, can be computed as EU(q) = £f=i P(q = ck) ; where uoq is cost of the query q, and utility U can be computed as in Eq.",
        "3.",
        "By evaluating instances and features on the same scale, and by measuring utility per unit cost of acquisition, such a framework should enable us to handle the trade-off between the costs and benefits of the different types of acquisitions.",
        "The primary challenge in the success of this approach is to accurately and efficiently estimate the different quantities in the equation above, using only the training data currently available.",
        "These are directions for future exploration."

        "This paper is a preliminary foray into active dual supervision.",
        "We have demonstrated that not only is combining example and feature labels beneficial for modeling, but that actively selecting the most informative examples and features for labeling can significantly reduce the burden of annotating such data.",
        "In future work, we would like to explore more effective solutions to the problem, and also to corroborate our results on a larger number of datasets and under different experimental settings."
