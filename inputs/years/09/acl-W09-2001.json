        "Using metaphor-annotated material that is sufficiently representative of the topical composition of a similar-length document in a large background corpus, we show that words expressing a discourse-wide topic of discussion are less likely to be metaphorical than other words in a document.",
        "Our results suggest that to harvest metaphors more effectively, one is advised to consider words that do not represent a discourse topic.",
        "Traditionally, metaphor detectors use the observation that a metaphorically used item creates a local incongruity because there is a violation of a selectional restriction, such as providing a non-vehicle object to the verb derail in Protesters derailed the conference.",
        "Current state of art in metaphor detection therefore tends to be \"localistic\" - the distributional profile of the target word in its immediate grammatical or collocational context in a background corpus or a database like WordNet is used to determine metaphoricity (Mason, 2004; Krishnakumaran and Zhu, 2007; Birke and Sarkar, 2006; Gedigian et al., 2006; Fass, 1991).",
        "However, some theories of metaphor postulate certain features of metaphors that connect it to the surrounding text beyond the small grammatical or proximal locality.",
        "For example, for Kittay (1987) metaphor is a discourse phenomenon; although the minimal metaphoric unit is a clause, often much larger chunks of text constitute a metaphor.",
        "Consider, for example, the TRAIN metaphor in the following excerpt from a Sunday Times article on 20 September 1992:",
        "Thatcher warned EC leaders to stop their endless round of summits and take notice of their own people.",
        "\"There is a fear that the European train will thunder forward, laden with its customary cargo of gravy, towards a destination neither wished for nor understood by electorates.",
        "But the train can be stopped,\" she said.",
        "In the example above, the quotation is not in itself a metaphor, as there is no indication that something other than the actual train is being discussed (and so no local incongruities exist).",
        "Only when situated in the context prepared by the first sentence (and indeed the rest of the article), the train imagery becomes a metaphor.",
        "According to Kittay, a metaphor occurs when a semantic field is used to discuss a different content domain.",
        "The theory therefore predicts that a metaphorically used semantic domain would be off-topic in the given document.",
        "Although a single document can have singular, idiosyncratic topics, it is likelier to discuss a mix of topics that are typical of the discourse of which it is part.",
        "We therefore derive the following hypothesis: Words in a given document that represent a common topic of discussion in a corpus of relevant documents would be predominantly non-metaphorical.",
        "That is, a smaller share of metaphorically used words in a document would fall in such topical words than the share of topical words in the document.",
        "We test this hypothesis in the current article.",
        "Using a large background corpus, we estimate the topical composition of the target documents (section 1) that were annotated for metaphors (section 2).",
        "We then report the results of the experiment (section 3) that strongly support the hypothesis, and discuss the findings (section 4).",
        "The concluding section provides a summary and outlines the significance of the results for the practice of metaphor detection."

        "Ideally, we should have sampled a small sub-corpus from the EUI corpus for metaphor annotation; however, the choice of the data for annotation predated the construction of the EUI corpus.",
        "Our interest being in the way metaphors used in public discourse help shape attitudes towards a complex, ongoing and fateful political reality, we came across Musolff's (2000) work on the British discourse on the European integration process throughout the 1990s.",
        "Working in the corpus linguistics tradition, Musolff (2000) studied a number of metaphors recurrent in this discourse, making available a selection of materials he used, marked with the metaphors.",
        "One caveat to directly using the database is the lack of clarity regarding the metaphor annotation procedure.",
        "In particular, the author does not report how many people participated, or any inter-annotator agreement figures.",
        "We therefore chose 4 out of Musolff's list of source domains, took all articles corresponding to them (128 documents), along with 23 articles from other source domains, and submitted them to a group of 8 undergraduate annotators, on top of Musolff's original markup that is treated as another annotator.",
        "Annotators received the following instructions, reflecting our focus on the persuasive use of metaphor, as part of an argument:",
        "Generally speaking, a metaphor is a linguistic expression whereby something is compared to something else that it is clearly literally not, in order to make a point.",
        "Thus, in Tony Blair's famous \"I haven't got a reverse gear\", Tony Blair is compared to a car in order to stress his unwillingness/inability to retract his statements or actions.",
        "We would say in this case that a metaphor from a vehicle domain is used.",
        "In this study we will consider metaphors from 4 domains.",
        "For the 4 chosen domains we provided the following descriptions, along with 2 examples for each:",
        "authority Metaphors that have to do with discipline and authority, like school, religion, royalty, asylum, prison, etc.",
        "love Metaphors from love/romance and family.",

        "People were instructed to mark every paragraph where a metaphor from a given domain occurs.",
        "they were also asked to provide a comment that briefly summarizes the ground for their decision, saying what is being compared to what.",
        "love and vehicle are close to acceptable reliability, with the other two types scoring low.",
        "in order to understand the nature of disagreements, we submitted the annotated materials plus some random annotations to 7 out of the original 8 people for validation, 4-8 weeks after they completed the annotations, asking them to accept or reject metaphor markups.",
        "We found that metaphors initially marked by at least 4 people (out of 9) were accepted as valid by people who did not initially mark them in 91% of the cases, on average across the metaphor types.",
        "These are thus uncontroversial cases, with the missing annotations likely due to attention slips rather than to genuine differences of opinion.",
        "Metaphors initially marked by 1-3 people were more controversial, with the average validation rate of 41% (Beigman Klebanov et al., 2008).",
        "Evidently, some of the metaphors are clearer-cut than others, yet even the more difficult cases got non-negligible support at validation time from people who did not initially mark them.",
        "We therefore decided to regard the whole of the annotated data as valid for the purpose of the current research.",
        "Our focus is on finding metaphors (recall), and less on making sure all candidate metaphors are acceptable to all annotators; it suffices to know that even the minority opinion often finds support.",
        "in the second stage of the research, we expanded the repertoire of the metaphor types to include additional source domains, mainly from Musolff's list.",
        "The dataset has so far been subjected to non-expert annotations by a group of the total of 15 undergraduate students.",
        "Metaphors from the source domains of vehicle, love, building, authority, war, show, school, religion, medicine were annotated by different subsets of the students.",
        "The outcome of the second stage of the project is not sufficient for addressing the issue of discourse topics vs metaphors, however, as there are instances of metaphors in the text that do not fall into any of the source domains singled out by Musolff as recurrent ones in the discourse under consideration.",

        "according to the Presence Theory in rhetoric (Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca, 1969; Gross and Dearin, 2003; Atkinson et al., 2008), elements afforded high presence are key to the rhetorical design of the argument.",
        "These are not so much metaphors we live by without even noticing, such as those often studied in conceptual Metaphor literature, like value as size or time as space; these are metaphors that are clearly a matter of the author's conscious choice, closest in the current theorizing to Steen's (2008) notion of deliberate metaphors.",

        "Shorter texts tend to be less elaborate and more \"to the point\", with a higher percentage of topical words.",
