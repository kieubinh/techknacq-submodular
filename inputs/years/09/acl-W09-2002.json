        "Psycholinguistic studies of metaphor try to understand metaphorical language comprehension by presenting subjects with linguistic stimuli and observing their responses.",
        "Recent work has observed such responses at the electrophysiological level, measuring brain electrical activity as the stimuli are read (Coulson and Petten, 2002; Tartter et al., 2002; Iaki-mova et al., 2005; Arzouan et al., 2007; Lai et al., 2007).",
        "All these studies have attempted to make comparisons across different types of stimuli (e.g. literal vs. metaphorical) by holding the frequencies of the target words constant across experimental conditions.",
        "For example, Tartter et al.",
        "(2002) compared the metaphorical and literal sentences his face was contorted by an angry cloud and his face was contorted by an angry frown, where the two sentences end in different words, but where the final words cloud and frown had similar word frequencies.",
        "As another example, Lai et al.",
        "(2007) compared the metaphorical and literal sentences Their theories have collapsed and The old building has collapsed, where the two sentences end in exactly the same words, so the target word frequencies across conditions were perfectly matched.",
        "In both designs, controlling for word frequency allowed the researchers to attribute the differences in experimental conditions to interesting factors, like figurativity, rather than simple word frequency.",
        "However, word frequency is not the only type of frequency relevant to such experiments.",
        "In particular, metaphorical frequency, that is, how inherently metaphorical one word is as compared to another, may also play an important role in explaining the psycholinguistic results.",
        "For example, if collapsed is usually used literally, a greater processing effort may be observed when a metaphorical instance of collapsed is presented.",
        "Likewise, if collapsed is usually used metaphorically, greater effort may be observed when a literal instance is presented.",
        "Psycholinguistic studies of metaphor have not, to date, controlled for such metaphorical frequency because there were no corpora or algorithms which could provide the needed metaphorical frequencies.",
        "The present study aims to address this deficiency by producing models which can automatically estimate how often a word is used metaphorically.",
        "We build these models using only 50 examples each of a small number of target words (< 10), rather than requiring 50 or more examples of every target word (100+) in the stimuli, as would be required by standard corpus linguistics methods.",
        "Our approach is also novel in that it combines metaphor classification with statistical topic models.",
        "Topic models are intuitively promising for our task because they produce topics that seem to translate well to the theory of conceptual domains, which suggests that, for example, conceptual domains such as Theories and Buildings are used to understand Their theories have collapsed.",
        "These topic models also show some promise for distinguishing conventional metaphors from novel metaphors."

        "Researchers have manually estimated several different kinds of metaphor frequency.",
        "Pollio et al.",
        "(1990) looked at overall metaphorical frequency, performing an exhaustive analysis of a variety of texts, and concluding that there were about five metaphors for every 100 words of text.",
        "Martin (1994) looked at the frequency of different types of metaphor, using a sample of 600 sentences from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), and concluded among other things that the most frequent type of WSJ metaphor was Value is Location, e.g. Spain Fund tumbled 23%.",
        "Martin (2006) looked at conditional probabilities of metaphor, for example noting that in 2400 WSJ sentences, the probability of seeing an instance of a metaphor was greatly increased after a first instance had already been observed.",
        "However, none of these studies provided the metaphorical frequencies of individual words needed for our research.",
        "Sardinha (2008) performed what is probably closest to the type of analysis we are interested in.",
        "Using a corpus of Portuguese conference calls, Berber Sardinha identified 432 terms that were used metaphorically.",
        "He then took 100 instances of each of these terms in a general Brazilian corpus and manually annotated them as being either literal or metaphorical.",
        "Berber Sardinha found that on average these terms were used metaphorically 70% of the time, and provided analysis of the metaphorical frequencies of a number of individual terms.",
        "While it is exactly these kinds of individual term frequencies that we are after, we cannot use Berber Sardinha's data because his corpus was in Portuguese while we are interested in English.",
        "This brings out one of the main drawbacks of the corpus annotation approach: moving to a new language (or even a new genre) requires an extensive manual annotation project.",
        "our goal is to avoid such costs by taking advantage of machine learning techniques for automatically identifying metaphorical text.",
        "Recent years have seen a rising interest in metaphor classification systems.",
        "Birke and Sarkar (2006) took a semi-supervised approach, collecting noisy examples of literal and non-literal sentences from both WordNet and metaphor dictionaries, and using a word-based measure of sentence similarity to group sentences into literal and non-literal clusters.",
        "They evaluated on hand-annotated sentences for 25 target words and reported an F-score of 0.538, a substantial improvement over the 0.294 majority class baseline.",
        "Gedigian et al.",
        "(2006) approached metaphor identification as supervised classification, annotating around 4000 WSJ motion words as literal or metaphorical, and training a maximum entropy classifier using as features based on named entities, WordNet and semantic roles.",
        "They achieved an accuracy of 95.1%, a decent improvement over the very high majority class baseline of 93.8%.",
        "Krishnakumaran and Zhu (2007) focused on three syntactically constrained subtypes of metaphors: nouns joined by be, nouns following verbs, and nouns following adjectives.",
        "They combined WordNet hypernym information with bigram statistics and a threshold, and evaluated their algorithm on the Berkeley Master Metaphor List (Lakoff, 1994), achieving an accuracy of around 46%.",
        "All of these approaches produced models which could be applied to new text to identify metaphors, but each has some drawbacks for our task.",

        "ent number from the 49% for our target words (see Section 3).",
        "Krishnakumaran and Zhu (2007) considered only a few different syntactic constructions, but we need to consider all the ways a metaphor may be expressed to evaulate overall metaphor frequency.",
        "Birke and Sarkar (2006) did consider a variety of target words in unrestricted text, but relied on large scale language resources like WordNet and metaphor dictionaries, while we are interested in approaches that are less resource intensive.",
        "Thus, rather than basing our models on these prior systems, we develop a novel approach to metaphor frequency estimation based on using topic models to operationalize metaphorical domains.",
        "The first step in building models of metaphorical frequency is obtaining data for training and evaluation.",
        "In one of the post-hoc analyses of the Lai et al.",
        "(2007) experiment, 50 sentences from the British National Corpus (BNC, 2007) were gathered for each of nine of their target words.",
        "They annotated each instance as either literal or metaphorical, and then used these annotations to calculate metaphorical frequencies for analysis.",
        "This data served as our starting point for exploring computational approaches to estimating metaphorical frequency.",

        "Table 2 shows some examples.",

        "If LDA topics are a good operationalization of such domains, then it should be possible use LDA topics to distinguish between conventional and novel metaphors.",
        "To explore this area, we employed the stimuli from the Lai experiment, and looked in particular at the conventional and novel conditions.",
        "The Lai experiment used 104 different target words, so these data included 104 conventional metaphors and 104 novel metaphors.",
        "Novel metaphors were generated for the Lai experiment by considering a conventional source-target mapping and selecting a new target domain.",
        "For example, the conventional metaphor Every point in my argument was attacked maps the source domain war to the target domain argument, while the novel metaphor Every second of our time was attacked maps the source domain war to the target domain time.",
        "Table 8 shows example stimulus sentences from the Lai experiment.",
        "Though these experimental stimuli have the drawback of being manually constructed, not collected from a corpus, they have the advantage of being already annotated with a definition of novelty that clearly distinguishes the two types of metaphors.",
        "We performed a simple correlational analysis using the conventional and novel metaphors from the Lai experiment.",
        "We produced topic distributions for each stimulus, using our topic models trained on the BNC.",
        "We then labeled conventional metaphors as 1 and novel metaphors as +1, and identified the top-",

        "Conventional metaphors seem to correspond more to concrete terms, like house, club, play and sale.",
        "Novel metaphors have less of a coherent theme, including terms like freud and sexual as well as names like Rory, Kirov and Britain.",
        "This may reflect a real distinction in the use of conventional and novel metaphors, or it may be an artifact of how the experimental stimuli were created.",
        "A deeper investigation into the relations between LDA topics and metaphor novelty will probably require annotating sentences from some naturally occuring data."

        "We presented a novel two-phase approach to the task of metaphorical frequency estimation.",
        "First, examples of a target word were automatically classified as literal or metaphorical, and then these classifications were aggregated to estimate how often the target word was used metaphorically.",
        "Our classifiers operationalized metaphorical source and target domains using topics derived from Latent Dirichlet Allocation.",
        "Support vector machine classifiers took these topic probability distributions and learned to classify sentences as literal or metaphorical.",
        "These models achieved 61.3% accuracy on the classifiation task, and their aggregated classifications produced an accuracy of 77.8% on the task of distinguishing between target words with high and low metaphorical frequencies.",
        "Future work will perform a larger scale evaluation, and will use our model's metaphorical frequency estimates to analyze psycholinguistic data.",
        "In particular, we will split the conventional metaphorical sentences of Lai et al.",
        "(2007) into low and high-frequency items.",
        "If the low and high frequency items display significantly different brainwave patterns, then this could suggest that metaphorical frequency of a given word plays a critical role in metaphor comprehension.",
        "Future work will also explore frequency effects that consider the sentential context in the stimulus items.",
        "For example, a context like \"Their theories have_\" probably gives a higher expectation of a metaphorical word filling in the blank than a context like \"The old building has_\".",
        "Having a measure of how much the words in the preceding context predict an upcoming metaphor would provide another useful stimulus control."
