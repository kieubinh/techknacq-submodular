        "The term \"eggcorn\" was coined in 2003 by Geoffrey Pullum (Liberman, 2003) to refer to a certain type of linguistic error where a word or phrase is replaced with one that is phonetically similar and semantically justifiable.",
        "The eponymous example is acorn – eggcorn, the meaning of the latter form being derived from the acorn's egg-like shape and the fact that it is a seed (giving rise to corn).",
        "These errors are distinct from mere misspellings or mispronunciations in that the changed form is an alternate interpretation of the original.",
        "The reinterpretation may be related to either the word's perceived meaning or etymology (as in the case of acorn), or some context in which the word is commonly used.",
        "In this sense, eggcorns are similar to folk etymologies - errors arising from the misinterpretation of borrowed or archaic words - with the difference being that the latter are adopted by an entire culture or linguistic community, while eggcorns are errors made by one or more individual speakers.",
        "The formation of eggcorns and folk etymologies, mistakes though they are, involves a creative leap within phonetic and semantic constraints (much like what is required for puns or certain classes of jokes).",
        "Eggcorns range from simple reshapings of foreign words (paprika – pepperika) and substitutions from similar domains (marshal – martial), to the subtly clever (integrate – intergrade), the technological (sound bite – sound byte), or the funny (stark-raving mad – star-craving mad).",
        "The source of reinterpretation may be a weak imagined link (wind turbine – wind turban), or an invented myth (give up the ghost – give up the goat).",
        "And often, it is not clear what the exact link is between the derived and the original forms, although it is usually obvious (to the human eye) that there is a connection.",
        "This paper explores some ways of automatically tracing the link between a word and its eggcorn.",
        "In reality, we are chiefly concerned with computing the connections between a word and its reinterpreted form.",
        "Such pairs may also occur as folk etymologies, puns, riddles, or get used as a poetic device.",
        "However, we use eggcorns as a testbed for three main reasons: there are a number of documented examples, the reanalyses are accidental (meaning the semantic links are more unpredictable and tenuous than in the cases of deliberate reshap-ings), and the errors are idiosyncratic and relatively modern - and hence have not been fossilized in the lexicon - making them transparent to analysis (as opposed to many folk etymologies and other historical errors).",
        "That said, much of the work described here can be potentially applied to other instances of semantic reinterpretation as well.",
        "The first part of the paper describes an algorithm (the \"Cornalyzer\") for finding a semantic path between the original and reinterpreted forms of an eggcorn pair.",
        "We then proceed to use the results of this algorithm to cluster the eggcorn examples into 5 classes, with a view to learning a typology of eggcorns."

        "Folk etymologies, the closest cousin to eggcorns, have been studied from a linguistic point of view, including some of the same questions we tackle here (only, not from a computational side) - how is an new word derived from the original, and what are the different categories of folk etymologies?",
