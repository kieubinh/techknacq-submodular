        "This paper is concerned with the possibility of quantifying and comparing the productivity of similar yet distinct syntactic constructions, predicting the likelihood of encountering unseen lexemes in their unfilled slots.",
        "Two examples are explored: variants of comparative correlative constructions (CCs, e.g. the faster the better), which are potentially very productive but in practice lexically restricted; and ambiguously attached prepositional phrases with the preposition with, which can host both large and restricted inventories of arguments under different conditions.",
        "It will be shown that different slots in different constructions are not equally likely to be occupied productively by unseen lexemes, and suggested that in some cases this can help disambiguate the underlying syntactic and semantic structure."

        "Some syntactic constructions are more productive than others.",
        "Innovative coinages like the CC: The bubblier the Mac-ier (i.e. the more bubbly a program looks, the more it feels at home on a Macintosh computer) are possible, but arguably more surprising and marked than: I have a bubblier operating system with a Mac-ier look in their respective construction, despite the same novel lexemes.",
        "The aim of this paper is to measure differences in the productivity of slots in such partially-filled constructions and also to find out if this productivity can be used to disambiguate constructions.",
        "As one of the defining properties of language, productivity has received much attention in debates about the nature of derivational processes, the structure of the mental lexicon and the interpretation of key terms such as compositionality, grammaticality judgments or well-formedness.",
        "However in computational linguistics it is probably fair to say that it can be regarded most of all as a problem.",
        "Familiar items present in training data can be listed in lexical resources, the probabilities of their different realizations can be estimated from corpus frequency distributions etc.",
        "Thus using lexical information (statistically extracted or handcrafted resources) is the most successful strategy in resolving syntactic ambiguities such as PP-attachment (Hindle and Rooth, 1993; Ratnaparkhi, 1998; Stetina and Nagao, 1997; Pantel and Lin, 2000; Kawa-hara and Kurohashi, 2005), basing decisions on previous cases with identical lexemes or additional information about those lexemes.",
        "Yet because of productivity, even very large training data will never cover examples for all inputs being analyzed.",
        "In morphological theory (and corresponding computational linguistic practice), the situation has been somewhat different: a much larger part of the word formations encountered in data can be listed in a lexicon, with neologisms being the exception, whereas in syntax most sentences are novel, with recurring combinations being the exception.",
        "The focus in morphology has therefore often been on which word formation processes are productive and to what extent, with the computational counterpart being whether or not corresponding rules should be built into a morphological analyzer.",
        "Syn-tacticians, conversely, may ask which apparently regular constructions are actually lexicalized or have at least partly non-compositional properties (e.g. collocations, see Choueka, 1988, Evert, 2005,",
        "Compounding represents an exception to this generalization, standing, at least for some languages, between syntax and word formation and often generating an unusually large amount of items unlisted in lexica (cf. Bauer, 2001:36-7).",
        "2009; multiword expressions, Sag et al., 2002; lexical bundles, Salem, 1987, Altenberg and Eeg-Olofsson, 1990, Biber et al., 1999, 2004).",
        "In morphology, the realization that productivity is a matter of degree, rather than a binary trait of word formation processes (see e.g. Bauer, 2001:125-162), has lead to the exploration of quantitative measures to assess and compare different aspects of the fertility of various patterns (esp.",
        "the work of Baayen, 2001, 2009).",
        "Yet syntactic applications of these measures have only very recently been proposed, dealing with one slot of a pattern much like the stem operated on by a morphological process (cf. Barddal, 2006; Kiss, 2007).",
        "In this paper I will examine the application of measures based on Baayen's work on morphology to different variants of syntactic constructions with more or less variable slots.",
        "The goal will be to show that different constructions have inherently different productivity rates, i.e. they are more or less liable to produce new members in their free slots.",
        "If this view is accepted, it may have consequences both theoretically (novelty in certain positions will be more surprising or marked) and practically, e.g. for parsing ambiguous structures with novel arguments, since one parse may imply a construction more apt to novelty than another.",
        "The remainder of this article is structured as follows: the next section introduces concepts underlying morphological productivity and related corpus-based measures following Baayen (2009).",
        "The following two sections adapt and apply these measures to different types of CCs (such as the faster the better) and NP/VP-attached PPs, respectively, using the BNC as a database.",
        "The final section discusses the results of these studies and their implications for the study of syntactic productivity."

        "Productivity has probably received more attention as a topic in morphology than in syntax, if for no other reason than that novel words are comparatively rare and draw attention, whereas novel phrases or sentences are ubiquitous.",
        "The exact definition of a novel word or 'neologism' is however less than straightforward.",
        "For the present purpose we may use Bauer's (2001:97-98) working definition as a starting point:",
        "[Productivity] is a feature of morphological processes which allow for new coinages, [...] coining must be repetitive in the speech community [...] Various factors appear to aid productivity: type frequency of appropriate bases, phonological and semantic transparency, naturalness, etc., but these are aids to productivity, not productivity itself.",
        "For Bauer, productivity is defined for a morphological process, which is ideally frequently and consistently found and coins ideally transparent novel forms.",
        "The word 'coining' in this context implies that speakers use the process to construct the transparent novel forms in question, which in turn means the process has a regular output.",
        "Yet novelty, transparency and regularity are difficult to judge intuitively, and the definitions of \"new\" vs. \"existing\" words cannot be judged reliably for any one speaker, nor with any adequacy for a speaker community (cf. Bauer, 2001:34-35).",
        "This problem has led researchers to turn to corpus data as a sort of 'objective' model of language experience, in which the output of a process can be searched for, categorized and tagged for evaluation.",
        "Baayen (e.g. 2001, 2009) proposes three corpus-based measures for the productivity of word formation processes.",
        "The first measure, which he terms extent of use, is written V(C,N) and is simply the proportion of types produced by a process C in a corpus of size N, e.g. the count of different nouns in -ness out of all the types in N. According to this measure, -ness would have a much higher realized productivity than the -th in warmth since it is found in many more words.",
        "However, this measure indiscriminately deals with all existing material - all words that have already been generated - and hence it cannot assess how likely it is that novel words will be created using a certain process.",
        "Baayen's other two measures address different aspects of this problem and rely on the use of hapax legomena, words appearing only once in a corpus.",
        "The intuitive idea behind looking at such words is that productively created items are one-off unique occurrences, and therefore they must form a subset of the hapax legomena in a corpus.",
        "Baayen uses V(1,C,N), the number of types from category C occurring once in a corpus of N words and V(1,N), the number of all types occurring once in a corpus of N words.",
        "The second measure, termed hapax-conditioned degree of productivity is said to measure expanding productivity, the rate at which a process is currently creating neologisms.",
        "It is computed as V(1,C,N)/V(1,N), the proportion of hapax legomena from the examined category C within the hapax legomena from all categories in the corpus.",
        "Intuitively, if the amount of hapax le-gomena could be replaced by 'true' neologisms only, this would be the relative contribution of a process to productivity in the corpus, which could then be compared between different processes.",
        "The third measure, category-conditioned degree of productivity measures the potential productivity of a process, meaning how likely it is to produce new members, or how saturated a process is.",
        "This measure is the proportion of hapax legomena from category C divided by N(C), the total token count from this category: V(1,C,N)/N(C).",
        "It intuitively represents the probability of the next item from category C, found in further corpus data of the same type, to be a hapax legomenon.",
        "Baayen's measures (hence p1, p2 and p3 respectively) are appealing since they are rigorously defined, easily extractable from a corpus (provided the process can be identified reliably in the data) and offer an essential reduction of the corpus wide behavior of a process to a number between 1 and 0, that is, an item producing no hapax legomena would score 0 on p2 and p3, and an item with 100% hapax legomena would score 1 on p3, even if it is overall rather insignificant for productivity in the corpus as a whole (as reflected in a low score for p2).",
        "The measure p3 is the most important one in the present context, since it allows us to reason conversely that, given that an item is novel and could belong to one of two processes, it is more likely to have come from whichever process is more productive, i.e. has a higher p3 score.",
        "Indeed the assumptions made in these measures do not necessarily fit syntactic productivity at a first glance: that the process in question has a clearly defined form (e.g. a suffix such as -ness) that it accommodates one variable slot (the stem, e.g. good-in goodness), and that each different stem forms a distinct type.",
        "Applying these measures to syntactic constructions requires conceptual and mathematical adaptation, which will be discussed in the next section using the example of comparative correlative constructions."

        "However like many CFG rules, these rules may be too general, since it is clearly the case that not all comparatives, nouns and verbs fit in this construction, if only because of semantic limitations, i.e. they must be plausibly capable of forming a pair of monotonously correlated properties.",
        "Corpus data shows that comparatives in CC clauses select quite different lexemes than comparatives at large, that the first and second slots (hence cc1 and cc2) have different preferences, and that the presence or absence of a VP and possibly a subject NP also interact with these choices.",
        "Table 1 shows comparatives in the BNC sorted by frequency in general, along with their frequencies in cc1 and cc2.",

        "The last columns show CCs with only NPs and no verb, either in one clause or both.",

        "Although the results imply varying degrees of preference and lexicalization in different constructions, they do not yet tell us whether or not, or better how likely, we can expect to see new lexemes in each slot.",

        "To illustrate this, we may consider the output of a PCFG parser (in this case the Stanford Parser, Klein and Manning, 2003) for an ambiguous example.",

        "The problem of attaching prepositional phrases as sister nodes of VP or as adjuncts to its object nouns is a classic case of syntactic ambiguity that causes trouble for parsers (see Hindle and Rooth, 1993; Manning and Schütze, 1999:278-287; Atterer and Schütze, 2007), e.g. the difference between I ate a fish with a fork and I ate a fish with bones, i.e. denoting the instrument or an attribute of the fish.",
        "There are also two further common readings of the preposition with in this context, namely attached either high or low in the VP in a comitative sense: I ate a fish with Mary and I ate a fish with potatoes respectively, though most approaches do not distinguish these, rather aiming at getting the attachment site right.",
        "Already in early work on PP attachment (Hindle and Rooth, 1993) it was realized that the lexical identity of the verb, its object, the preposition and in later approaches also the prepositional object noun (Ratnaparkhi et al., 1994) are useful for predicting the attachment site, casting the task as a classification of tuples <v, n1, p, n2> into the classes V (VP attachment) and N (NP attachment).",
        "Classifiers are commonly either supervised, with disambiguated training data, or more recently unsupervised (Ratnaparkhi, 1998) using data from unambiguous cases where no n1 or v appears.",
        "Other approaches supplement this information with hand-built or automatically acquired lexical resources and collocation databases to determine the relationship between the lexemes, or, for lexemes unattested in the tuples, for semantically similar ones (Stetina and Nagao, 1997; Pantel and Lin, 2000).",
        "Although the state of the art in lexically based systems actually approaches human performance, they lose their power when confronted with unfamiliar items.",
        "For example, what is the likeliest attachment for the following BNC example: I can always eat dim-sum with my dybbuk?",
        "It is safe to assume that the (originally Hebrew) loanword dybbuk '(demonic) possession' does not appear in most training datasets, though dim-sum is attested more than once as an object of eat in the BNC.",
        "Crucially, the triple (eat, dim-sum, with) alone cannot reliably resolve the attachment site (consider soy-sauce vs. chopsticks as n2).",
        "It is thus worth examining how likely a novel item is in the relevant slot of each reading's construction.",
        "The rest of this section therefore examines productivity scores for the slots in eat NP with NP and their correlation with different readings as an example.",
        "Since these cases cannot be identified automatically in an unparsed text with any reliability, and since there is not enough hand-parsed data containing these constructions, a conservative proximity assumption was made (cf. Ratnaparkhi, 1998) and all occurrences of eat and related forms within ten words of with and with no intervening punctuation in the BNC were evaluated and tagged manually for this study.",
        "This also allowed for head-noun and anaphor resolution to identify the referent of a slot in the case of pronominal realization; thus all slot types in the data including pronouns are evaluated in terms of a single head noun.",
        "Results show that out of 131 hits, the largest group of PPs (59 tokens) were object noun modifiers, almost all comitatives, justifying the prevalent heuristic to prefer low attachment.",
        "However verbal instrumentals and high comitatives (25 and 23 respectively) come at a very close second.",
        "The remaining 24 cases were adverbial modifications (e.g. with enthusiasm).",

        "The scores show that the verbal instrumental reading is the least likely to exhibit a novel head at the n2 slot, which is semantically plausible - the repertoire of eating instruments is rather conventionalized and slow to expand.",
        "The comitative reading is very likely to innovate in n2, but much less so in n1, fitting e.g. the \"dim-sum with dybbuk\"-scenario.",

        "If the decision is only between high and low attachment, then grouping all variants together may be sensible in any case.",
        "Depending on the argument and verb, it is possible to make fine distinctions, provided enough cases are found.",
        "For dim-sum, for example, no cases of NP modifying with (novel or otherwise) are found, making the (correct) high comitative reading likely.",
        "By contrast, for the head noun fish, which is a common object of eat, 37 hits with with-PPs are found in the BNC, forming 32 prepositional object noun types of which 28 are hapax le-gomena in this slot.",
        "All high readings of with-PPs with eat (including intransitive eat) form 92 tokens, 68 noun types and 44 hapax legomena.",
        "Thus fish + PP scores p3=0.756 while eat + PP scores 0.478, corresponding to less productivity.",
        "This means novel prepositional objects are substantially less probable for the high attachment given that the direct object is fish."

        "The above results show that similar yet distinct constructions, which vary slightly in either constituent structure (high vs. low attachment), semantics (comitative or instrumental PPs), number of arguments (more and less bare CCs) or position (cc1 vs. cc2), show very different lexical behavior, exhibiting more or less variety in different slots and differing proportions of hapax legomena.",
        "The inference which should become apparent from the sharp contrasts in slot scores (especially in p3) given the size of the data, is that these differences are not coincidental but are indicative of inherently different productivity rates for each slot in each construction.",
        "These properties need not be attributed to system internal, linguistic reasons alone, but may also very well reflect world knowledge and pragmatic considerations.",
        "However, from a construction grammar point of view, the entrenchment of these constructions in speakers and therefore in data is inextricably connected with interaction in the world, thus making syntactic productivity a plausible and relevant quantity both theoretically and potentially for NLP practice.",
        "It remains to be seen whether or not productivity scores can help automatically disambiguate structures with unseen arguments (e.g. PP attachment with unencountered n2), or even distinguish semantic classes such as comitatives, instrumentals etc.",
        "for novel nouns, for which a classification into helpful semantic categories (animate, human and so forth) is not available.",
        "A large-scale evaluation of this question will depend on how easily and reliably productivity scores can be extracted automatically from data for the relevant constructions."
