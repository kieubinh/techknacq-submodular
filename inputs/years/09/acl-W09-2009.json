        "Several researchers have developed story generators capable of generating stories that closely resemble human-made stories.",
        "Some of these include TALE-SPIN (Meehan, 1977) that generates stories through problem solving, MINSTREL (Turner, 1992) that uses an episodic memory scheme for storing past problem-solving cases, and MAKEBELIEVE (Liu and Singh, 2002) that constructs stories with the use of logical reasoning.",
        "Callaway and Lester (2002) observed that most story generators (SG), such as TALE-SPIN and MAKEBELIEVE, concentrated on the generation of plots and the characters, with less emphasis on linguistic phenomena, resulting in stories that have good narrative quality but lacking in linguistic structures.",
        "Their STORYBOOK system addresses this by applying full-scale linguistic approaches to the narrative prose generation architecture of AUTHOR (Callaway, 2000).",
        "Loenneker (2005) made a similar observation regarding SG whose implicit goal is to generate a coherent narrative in a given genre with less emphasis on discourse structure, and skipping document structuring and microplanning (Reiter and Dale, 2000) stages.",
        "In this paper, we present our story generator, Picture Books, which generates stories for children aged four to six.",
        "Picture Books derives the story elements from a given input set of picture elements (backgrounds, characters, and objects).",
        "The genre (fables) and story goal (moral lessons) are applied as separate parts of the system's planning library, which contains story planning goals to convert abstract story specifications to coherent stories suitable for the target age group.",
        "The rest of this paper is subdivided as follows.",
        "Section 2 presents some background information on the specifications of a children's story as well as the semantic ontology used by the planners of Picture Books.",
        "Section 3 discusses the design of the plan library and the planning process involved in story generation, followed by the evaluation results on the content and grammar of the stories generated by the system in Section 4.",
        "The paper ends with a summary of future work that can be done to improve the generated stories."

        "The motivation behind Picture Books is twofold.",
        "First is the realization that stories are combinations of various genres to produce a differing effect.",
        "The genres can be considered as templates that dictate the plot of the story.",
        "It is therefore possible to create a story by indicating the story elements (i.e., characters, events, and settings), the genres, and the goal of the story to automatically produce a narrative text.",
        "The second motivation is that stories serve as rich sources of information that help develop a child's knowledge.",
        "However, young children recognize images of objects easily compared to words (Fields et al., 2003), accounting for the popularity of picture-based story books that allow readers to relate stories by using not only words, but pictures depicting the story.",
        "Climactic scene",
        "Quick, satisfying conclusion",
        "Beginning",
        "Insightful answer or solution",
        "Rising action and plot development",
        "Introduction of problem or dilemma",
        "Introduction of setting and characters",
        "Interviews with child educators revealed that most of the published storybooks for children focus on themes to teach them lessons about proper behavior.",
        "These themes revolve around everyday activities like eating on time and brushing your teeth with lessons on being careful, being honest, and the value of sharing.",
        "Themes also dictate the objects that can be used in the story, for example, in the eating healthy foods theme, possible positive objects supporting good behavior are apples and bananas, while cakes and candies are considered negative objects in cases of misbehavior (i.e., unhealthy foods).",
        "Another common characteristic of children's stories is the use of the fable form, wherein the story characters are portrayed by animals that can capture the imagination and attention of the target readers.",
        "The animals have simple traits that children can relate with, such as loyalty for dogs, playfulness for cats, kindness for rabbits, and bravery for tigers.",
        "They are also given names, such as Ellen the elephant, Rizzy the rabbit, and Leo the lion, to give the impression that the characters are friends that the children are getting to know better through reading the story.",
        "In the linguistic aspect, stories for four year olds have simple sentence structures and contain line redundancy.",
        "This is lessened as the child grows older.",
        "The words used in the stories are not only simple and easy to understand, but also vary depending on the child's age in order to introduce new words to his vocabulary.",
        "Lessons and rules are emphasized by positive praises while improper behaviors are emphasized by revealing their consequences.",
        "Another aspect to consider in storytelling is the story's title.",
        "Story titles are short and often contain the story's theme as a hint to what the story is about.",
        "The main character's name should also be included in the title, such as \"Leo the Lion Learns to Eat on Time\".",
        "In general, Machado (2003) showed that stories follow a common and classic story pattern depicted in Figure 0, which flows from negative to positive and has the following outline:",

        "ii.",

        "iv.",
        "The main character is either caught or experiences natural consequences of disobedience (e.g. a tooth ache from eating too much candy).",
        "v. The main character learns a lesson.",
        "The knowledge resource dictates the amount of information that an SG system can output, thus highlighting its importance.",
        "Picture Books uses an ontology to have a flexible knowledge resource that provides relevant concepts familiar to the target age group as well as applicable to the story being planned.",
        "Its design was adapted from ConceptNet (Liu and Singh, 2004a), a semantic resource with structure closely resembling that of WordNet (2006).",
        "The nodes used by ConceptNet are of three general classes representing noun phrases, attributes, and activity phrases.",
        "A semantic relationship connects two concepts while a semantic category classifies them.",
        "The semantic relationships are binary relation types defined by Open Mind Commonsense project (Liu and Singh, 2004b).",
        "Table 1 lists some of these relationships defined in Picture Books following the form <relationship> (<concept!",
        ">, <concept2>).",

        "Picture Books has three major components - a picture editor, a story planner, and a sentence planner.",
        "The Picture Editor is provided for users to specify the background or setting of the story (kitchen), and to select and \"stick\" into the background the set of characters (little sheep and mama sheep) and objects (cake, bread).",
        "An example picture is shown in Figure 2.",
        "The first child character placed in the picture will be the protagonist of the story, while the first adult sticker placed in the picture will be the parent of the protagonist.",
        "If there is no adult character, the protagonist's biological parent will be chosen as the adult character needed in the story.",
        "The first object sticker placed in the picture will assume the %object% variable used in planning the story - especially in ontology accesses.",
        "The rest are discarded.",
        "All elements in the picture, namely the background, the characters and the objects (including sequence of placement), and the name and age of the user, are stored in an input content representation (ICR) and passed on to the story planner.",
        "The Story Planner takes in the abstract ICR then performs three planning steps - i) theme planning to select an appropriate theme for the story, ii) plot planning to instantiate the story plots depicting the theme, and iii) presentation planning to handle the planning of the story's title, introduction and appropriate ending.",
        "A Story Organizer arranges these resulting story events as it is supposed to be presented to the user in an abstract story tree.",
        "The Sentence Planner then converts the abstract story tree representation to sentence specifications by performing referring expression generation, lexicalization, and phrase specification mapping.",
        "The Surface Realizer uses the sim-plenlg realiser (Venour and Reiter, 2008) to convert the sentence specifications to actual sentences that comprise the story.",
        "The plan library contains the set of instructions and information on creating the plot of a story, and has three parts: (1) the story elements containing information regarding the characters, objects and settings of a story; (2) a set of story patterns to direct the story goal towards attainment of the moral lesson; and (3) a semantic ontology containing concepts applicable to the target domain, in this case, fables.",
        "Picture Books uses a set of predefined characters, objects and backgrounds, as inputs.",
        "These story elements are used to determine the actors, the setting and the theme of a story.",
        "Information on characters, such as the parents, is useful for identifying other characters in the story.",
        "The background serves as the main setting of the story, and combined with the selected objects, is used to determine the theme.",
        "Given a bedroom background, the set of available themes include being brave, being neat, being careful, being honest, and sleeping early.",
        "Objects that are available for this background include an alarm clock, a lamp, a pillow, and toys.",
        "The story pattern is used to direct the goal of the story and is composed of the theme, story plot, author goal and character goal.",
        "Each component is designed to subsume the next (i.e., theme subsumes story plot, and story plot subsumes author goal) to support different granularity of story details and to lessen the redundancy as common story details are subsumed by a higher-level component.",

        "A theme dictates the plot of a story and is composed of four story plots (see Figure 3) namely, the problem, rising action, solution and climax which, according to Machado (2003), are the four fundamental stages of the main plot of any story.",

        "A story plot represents the major events in the theme and contains at least two author goals (shown in Figure 4) that represent the scenes comprising the event.",
        "An author goal (Figure 5) is composed of a goal of the scene and the corresponding consequence of the goal to ensure consistency in the scene.",
        "Each goal and consequence component of an author goal is in turn filled up by at least one character goal.A character goal (Figure 6) represents the unit of action a character or two characters do in order to depict the goal/consequence of the scene.",
        "This design of the character goal is based from the action operators of Uijlings (2006) and can be directly converted to simple declarative sentences.",
        "A character goal has five fields - the action, the agens or doer of the action, the patiens or receiver of the action, the target, and the instrument.",
        "One character goal generates one sentence in the story with the agens as the subject, the action as the verb, the patiens as the character or object that undergoes the action verb, the target as the location or object of the action verb, and the instrument as the object used to perform the verb.",

        "The design of Picture Books' plan library, combined with planning operators in the form of story plots and character goals, demonstrated that grammatically correct and coherent stories for children aged 4 to 6 can be generated from a given set of predefined pictures, provided that the appropriate domain knowledge is present.",
        "The semantic ontology whose design was adapted from ConceptNet provided the domain knowledge that supplies factual information to the story.",
        "The theme structure and its components model the way humans perform storytelling and also ensured that the generated stories will contain the four basic elements of problem, rising action, solution, and climax.",
        "The separation of the plan library which dictates the story patterns from the semantic ontology gives flexibility to Picture Books such that it could easily be adapted to generate other story domain.",
        "Currently, Picture Books generates stories with simple declarative sentences.",
        "A future improvement of the system is to extend the design of the character goal to generate stories with dialogues.",
        "Although common animals that young children can relate with have been used as the main characters of the story, their traits, such as loyalty, bravery, and kindness, have not been considered in determining the flow of the story.",
        "A similar claim can be made for describing the objects used in the story, such that a story promoting the value of \"being thrifty\" can use the \"expensive lamp\" as an object, while the value of \"being careful\" can use the \"breakable lamp\" instead.",
        "These are aspects of storytelling that can be investigated in a future work.",
        "From a linguistic perspective, the current implementation of Picture Books can generate pronouns and articles, as well as a transitional device at the last sentence in the story.",
        "However, possessive pronouns, the consistent use of articles, and the generation of appropriate transitional devices in several parts of the story should be further explored.",
        "The design of the character goals can be extended by adding an attribute indicating a connection or the passage of time between sentences.",
        "Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and Thompson, 1988) can also be applied to author goals and character goals for an effective discourse structure that would provide a smoother story flow."
