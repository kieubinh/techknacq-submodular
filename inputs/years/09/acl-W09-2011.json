        "Adjectives as a syntactic category have received relatively scarce attention in theoretical and computational linguistics, at least when compared to noun and verbs.",
        "Within the class of adjectives there is a particular group that has not received much specific attention.",
        "These are the adjectives that can be operationally defined by the fact that in the orthography they are constituted by at least two tokens separated by a hyphen.",
        "Examples include: left-wing politician, best-selling book, part-time job, large-scale experiment.",
        "In this paper we will focus the analysis on 2-item adjectives; however the class includes several examples with more than two items: day-to-day, tongue-in-cheek, up-and-coming, state-of-the-art, pay-as-you-go, all-you-can-eat, etc.",
        "We refer to these adjectives as 'complex adjectives'.",
        "They allow several mechanisms for the generation of new linguistic expressions which are spread along a continuum that goes from full productivity to lexicalized forms.",
        "Treating complex adjective formation as a morphological process allows us to characterize them in the light of the notion of morphological productivity.",
        "Morphological productivity falls within the domain of how the broad notion of creativity is realized in language, by providing mechanisms for generating new words that are unintentional, unlimited and regular (Evert and Ludeling 2001).",
        "Previous work has typically considered complex adjectives only in the context of tokenization and generally low-level text processing, without specific focus on the class per se.",
        "Moilanen and Pulman (2008) identify polarity markers in certain complex adjectives for the purpose for assigning sentiment polarities to unknown words (well-built is positive, rat-infested is negative).",
        "Highly productive classes like complex adjectives are problematic for computational lexicons in that they bring about a large number of unknown words.",
        "A typology of complex adjectives is important to support computational lexicons and the NLP applications based on them, for example by listing out the patterns (as defined in section 3) that complex adjectives are based on.",
        "The analysis presented here is based on two large text collections.",
        "The first is a portion of Wikipedia, consisting of about 250 million tokens.",
        "The second collection is a Web corpus specifically built for NLP applications targeted at adjectives, consisting of about 290 million tokens (after some reasonable clean-up process).",
        "The list of all adjectives in WordNet was used as a seed list.",
        "Each seed adjective was sent as a query to the Yahoo search engine",
        "BOSS API.",
        "For all the 1000 (the maximum allowed by the API) returned web results, each URL was used to fetch the corresponding web page, and the full text of the web page was processed for addition to the corpus.",
        "Both corpora were POS-tagged using the Stanford POS tagger (reported accuracy is about 97%).",
        "Using such tagger that was trained on the Penn Treebank makes it easy to identify complex adjectives, since the Penn Treebank tagging guidelines explicitly prescribe that hyphenated compounds used as modifiers should be tagged as adjectives (JJ).",
        "The two corpora give a slightly different view on the linguistic behavior of adjectives.",
        "The Wikipedia corpus is intended to provide a picture of adjective distribution in a large and relatively homogenous collection of current English text.",
        "The Web corpus is intended to bias the collection in the direction of making sure that at least for the WordNet seed adjectives a large number of instances are present even for adjectives that would have otherwise a very low frequency in a properly balanced corpus.",
        "Throughout the paper we will use the Wikipedia corpus as the main data collection for the presentation of the analysis, and we will use the Web corpus as a validation set, to assess the stability and reliability of the results obtained on the Wikipedia corpus."

        "We partition the orthographically defined class of complex adjectives in morphological categories defined by a variable part and a base generator.",
        "For example 'X-free' is a morphological category that specifies that the base generator free can be combined with other words to form complex adjectives such as risk-free, toll-free, gluten-free, etc.",
        "The two corpora are used to analyze and quantify how different degrees of linguistic creativity are exhibited by different classes of complex adjectives.",
        "We will show that this yields a ranking of complex adjective types along a continuum going from high productivity to lexicalized forms.",
        "Specifically, we characterize the linguistic creativity of complex adjectives through three distinct and complementary measures of morphological productivity, following Baayen (1993, 2006) and his notation:",
        "realized productivity, expanding productivity, and potential productivity.",
        "Now, Evert and Ludeling (2001) show that, in the general case, automatic preprocessing of text corpora with current morphological analyzers yields results that are too noisy for Baayen's measure of productivity to be reliable.",
        "The fact that complex adjectives are orthographically defined by the presence of the hyphen and the components are easy to separate eliminates some of those text-processing problems.",
        "By choice, we take at face value the morphological parse provided by the hyphen, and therefore we do not run into situations where the phonotactics obscures the morphological analysis (e.g., lady vs. ladies), affix ordering (undoable), accidental string identity (restaurant does not instantiate the prefix re-), and words generated by creative rather then morphological productive processes (youtube).",
        "Relying on the orthographical hyphen eases the problems of automatic morphological preprocessing and makes this a particularly good domain for using Baayen's measures.",
        "Realized productivity is defined as V=V(C,N), the number of word types (as opposed to word tokens) of morphological category C in a corpus of N tokens.",
        "The intuition behind this measure is that it expresses the sheer size of a morphological category within a particular corpus.",
        "Expanding productivity is defined as P* = V(1,C,N)/V(1,N), where V(1,C,N) is the number of words of category C that occur only once in a corpus of N tokens, and V(1,N) is the number of words of any category that occur only once in a corpus of N tokens.",
        "This measure expresses the contribution of the morphological category C to the growth rate of the total vocabulary.",
        "The underlying intuition is that a morphologically productive category contributes to the growth rate of the vocabulary of a language, and vocabulary growth rate can be estimated by the number of hapax legomena (words with frequency 1) in a sufficiently large corpus.",
        "Hapax legomena in turn are taken to be good estimators of novel linguistic forms.",
        "Potential productivity is defined as P = V(1,C,N)/N(C), where N(C) is the total number of tokens in the corpus for a given category C. This measure expresses the growth rate of the vocabulary of the category C itself.",
        "In other words, it expresses the ease with which a category can be applied to new words.",
        "These three measures are complementary, in that they capture different aspects of morphological productivity that can possibly be at odds with each other (Baayen 2006)."

        "At the highest level the two POS-tagged corpora allow us to compare the distribution of complex adjectives with respect to other major syntactic categories.",
        "In the context of morphological productivity, the vocabulary of a morphological process is the number of types that the process can potentially generate.",
        "If we understand complex adjective formation as a morphological process, we can obtain their general vocabulary growth curve by plotting the number of types against the number of tokens in a corpus.",
        "Figure 1 shows vocabulary growth curves for nouns, verbs, adjectives and their hyphenated counterparts for the Wikipedia corpus.",
        "Complex adjectives exhibit a surprisingly high growth rate, which at 250M tokens still doesn't tend to converge.",
        "The number of types corresponding to the final corpus size can be interpreted as an estimate of the realized productivity of complex adjectives as a whole class.",
        "We focus the analysis on two-item adjectives, i.e., those of the form 'A-B' such as cat-like.",
        "We describe first the data collection process.",
        "We process each POS-tagged corpus from beginning to end, and for each complex adjective (defined by the tag JJ and the presence of a hyphen), we generate all the possible categories by replacing in turn each item with a variable.",
        "So catlike yields the two possible categories 'cat-X' and 'X-like'; day-to-day yields 'X-to-day', 'day-X-day', 'day-to-X' and the special case 'X-to-X', where the two side items are identical.",
        "Then for each category we count the number of types in that category and the number of tokens for each type, including hapax legomena.",
        "So the category 'X-like' includes the types dog-like, cat-like, mouse-like, etc., and each type is instantiated by a certain number of tokens (including types instantiated by exactly 1 token).",
        "In this way we obtain the basic counts that are needed to compute the three measures of productivity introduced above.",
        "Once these measures are obtained, all morphological categories (such as 'X-like') can be sorted into three productivity rankings corresponding to the three measures.",
        "Of the three measures, realized and expanding productivity are by design directly dependent on corpus size, whereas potential productivity is dependent on the relative ratio of morphological categories but not directly on corpus size.",
        "This entails that, especially for the first two measures, productivity rankings obtained on a corpus of a particular size are not necessarily significant, in that productivity rankings obtained on corpora of different sizes could be different.",
        "Realized and expanding productivity are affected in different ways by corpus size.",
        "Everything else being equal, realized productivity estimates will be more reliable with larger corpora.",
        "Expanding productivity is based on the assumption that hapax legomena (i.e., rare words with the lowest frequency in a corpus) are good estimators of morphological productivity.",
        "Rare words include various subtypes: misspellings, proper names, foreign words, words from different registers or genres than those represented in the corpus, new words generated by non-regular creative processes, and new words generated by morphologically productive processes.",
        "In a 'small' corpus, hapax le-gomena will include many words that do not fall in any of categories above, but just happen to be relatively uncommon words.",
        "As corpus size increases, uncommon words have a chance to occur more often, and the proportion of true morphological neologisms among hapaxes increases.",
        "Given the dependency on corpus size, the question arises of how reliable productivity rankings are that haven been obtained for a specific corpus.",
        "In order to assess rankings reliability, we divided both the Wikipedia and Web corpus into 20 chunks of the same size, and then we added them up one after the other, essentially obtaining 20 corpora of increasing size for each of the two original text collections.",
        "Finally for each intermediate corpus we recomputed the productivity measures and rankings based on them.",
        "At this point we can measure the stability of the final productivity ranking for a given corpus by comparing it with each of the intermediate rankings using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.",
        "Realized Productivity, Wikipedia",
        "Tokens (millions)",
        "Plotting corpus size against Spearman's p coefficient reveals that rankings for realized and expanding productivity in both the Wikipedia corpus and the Web corpus are very stable.",
        "For example, for expanding productivity in the Wikipedia corpus the ranking of the top 20 complex adjectives does not change any more after the first 5M corpus chunk.",
        "Figures 2 and 3 show how Spearman's coefficient between the full Wikipedia corpus and each of the 19 sub-corpora varies as a function of corpus size for the top 25, 50 and 100 adjectives.",
        "Curves for the Web corpus are similar.",
        "As corpus size continues to increase, a larger and larger portion of the rankings stabilizes, suggesting that realized and expanding productivity capture substantial properties of the language of which the Wikipedia corpus and the Web corpus are respectively representative.",
        "The dependency of productivity rankings on a specific corpus is a reminder that another important factor that has been observed to affect linguistic creativity as expressed by morphological productivity is register and genre variation.",
        "In this context we are using two corpora that are representative of different types of language, and could therefore have substantially different rankings.",
        "However, it turns out that Spearman's rank correlation between the full size of the Wikipedia and Web corpus for both realized and expanding productivity rankings is quite strong (see Table 1).",
        "The high Spearman's correlation values confirm the stability of reliability of realized and expanding productivity rankings across different corpora.",
        "The next question is to what extent productivity rankings based on different measures correlate with each other.",
        "We consider first the relationship between realized and expanding productivity.",
        "The two notions focus by design on different aspects of morphological productivity: realized productivity is oriented towards the 'present': a morphological process may be common to many existing word types, but might have no ability to be applied to generate new words.",
        "Baayen (1993) also refers to it as 'extent of use'.",
        "Expanding productivity is intended to assess the rate at which a morphological process is expanding in the language.",

        "In order to quantify the degree of agreement between realized and expanding productivity for complex adjectives we computed Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between pairs of productivity rankings (for the top 100 adjectives) at each of the intermediate corpus sizes described above, for both the Wikipedia and Web corpus.",

        "The occurrence of single orthographic word variant can be construed as a signal of lexicalization for complex adjectives, but not in the general case, as demonstrated by the the orthographic integrity of words within idioms.",
        "Indeed, the values of p at the rightmost edge of the respective curves in Figures 4 and 6 are the same, since they corresponds to the rank correlation among productivity rankings for the full Wikipedia corpus with minimum threshold value set to 100.",
        "We can interpret this slight upward trend as a consequence of the mitigation of frequency effects (which typically affect potential productivity rankings, as discussed above) brought about by the raising of the minimum threshold level.",

        "Figure 6.",
        "Potential productivity rankings correlation as a function of minimum threshold level in Wikipedia",
        "This behavior highlights the fact that, compared to the other two measures, potential productivity focuses by design on a significantly different facet of the notion of morphological productivity.",
        "Potential productivity attempts to capture in a simple formula the ability of a morphological category to continue to enable speakers to generate new words.",
        "It is intended to characterize a morphological category in terms of the number of potential words that can still be created in that category.",
        "Thus it could be the case that a morphological category is well established in the language (realized productivity) and is expanding (expanding productivity), but does not have much potential for further expansion (potential productivity).",
        "In order to explore these scenarios, we compare the three measures for the specific morphological pattern 'non-X', which has both the highest realized and expanding productivity for all the 19 intermediate corpus slices, and for the full corpus size (both for the Wikipedia corpus and for the Web corpus).",
        "On the Wikipedia full corpus this category yields 6444 distinct types for a total of 47489 tokens (including 4496 hapax legomena), ranging from very frequent types such as nonprofit (2268 tokens), non-existent (619 tokens), non-standard (501 tokens) to hapax legomena such as non-ratified (1 token), non-amphibious (1 token), etc.",
        "Specifically, the fact that 'non-X' has the highest expanding productivity means that it has more hapax legomena than any other morphological pattern.",
        "This notwithstanding, the fact that its different types yield a very large number of tokens results in a very low potential productivity value of 'non-X' (on the full corpus).",
        "Setting the minimum threshold value at 50, the average potential productivity rank for 'non-X' steadily gets worse as corpus size increases from rank 24 for the first intermediate corpus to rank 2404 for the full size corpus, in stark contrast to the rank position 1 it has for realized and expanding productivity (we use ranks since absolute productivity values for different measures cannot be compared to each other).",

        "On the Wikipedia corpus this category yields 99 distinct types for a total of only 112 tokens, but including 87 hapax legomena.",
        "The most productive types are cartoon-ish and blueish (with 3 tokens each) and 40-ish, blues-ish, vanity-ish, place-ish, bully-ish, punk-ish, tree-ish, white-ish, noir-ish (with 2 tokens each).",
        "All other types have 1 token each.",

        "As is expected, the realized and expanding productivity ranks are much lower.",
        "However, they do increase steadily from rank 5204 and 3990 respectively for the first intermediate corpus to rank 403 and 242 for the full size corpus.",
        "We can interpret this trend as a consequence of the fact that for the category 'X-ish' almost every new token is also both a new type and a new hapax legomena.",
        "The effect of this is that it slows down the rate of decrease of the realized and expanding productivity measures (which always decrease inversely to corpus size), thus lifting the rank of 'X-ish' above that of competitors as corpus size increases.",
        "Note that from a linguistic point of view, the hyphen in potential productivity patterns seems to signal the awareness of the writer/speaker regarding the 'novelty' of the complex adjective, along a continuum from compounding ('almost-X', 'X-capable') to more established derivational morphemes ('X-ish', 'un-X').",
        "5 Conclusions and future work.",
        "A general trend has consistently emerged throughout the analysis, as illustrated by the opposite properties of the categories 'non-X' and 'X-ish'.",
        "We have shown from a variety of angles how realized and expanding productivity measures tend to capture closely related aspects of morphological productivity, both in terms of the specific words and global correlation between productivity rankings.",
        "On the other hand, potential productivity consistently exhibits clearly different and indeed opposite properties compared to the other two, again both in terms of the specific words that score the highest values and in terms of productivity ranking correlation patterns.",
        "The most significant question to be addressed next is the extent to which the above-mentioned conclusions about the relationships among different types of morphological productivity carry over to other segments of language.",
        "Regarding complex adjectives, future work will focus in more detail on their internal typology, specifically considering the extent to which they impose selectional restrictions (whether morpho-syntactic or semantic in nature) on the component associated with the base generator of a category, and the correlation patterns between such constraints and the three types of morphological productivity."
