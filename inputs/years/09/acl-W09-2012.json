        "This simple task is a first step towards automatically measuring creativity in more complex natural language text.",
        "To further simplify the task, we will focus on the first aspect of creativity, i.e., quantifying how novel the sentence is.",
        "The second aspect, how meaningful the sentence is, requires the full power ofNat-ural Language Processing, and is beyond the scope of this initial work.",
        "This, of course, raises the concern that we may regard a nonsense sentence as highly creative.",
        "This is a valid concern.",
        "However, in many applications where a creativity measure is needed, the input sentences are indeed well-formed.",
        "In such applications, our approach will be useful.",
        "We will leave this issue to future work.",
        "The present paper uses a data set (see the next section) in which all sentences are well-formed.",
        "A major difficulty in studying creativity is the lack of an objective definition of creativity.",
        "Because creative writing is highly subjective (\"I don't know what is creativity, but I recognize it when I see one\"), we circumvent this problem by using human judgment as the ground truth.",
        "Our experiment procedure is the following.",
        "First, we give a keyword z to a human writer, and ask her to compose a sentence x about z.",
        "Then, the sentence x is evaluated by a group of human judges who assign it a subjective \"creativity score\" y.",
        "Finally, given a dataset consisting of many such keyword-sentence-score triples (z, x, y), we develop a statistical predictor f (x, z) that predicts the score y from the sentence x and keyword z.",

        "Pease et al., 2001).",
