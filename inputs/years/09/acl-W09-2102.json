        "It has long been noted that a substantial number of U.S. students in the 10-14 years age group have deficiencies in their reading competence (National Center of Educational Statistics, 2006).",
        "With the enactment of the No Child Left Behind Act (2002), interest and focus on objectively assessing and improving this unsatisfactory situation has come to the forefront.",
        "While assessment of reading is usually done post-hoc with measures of reading comprehension, direct reading assessment is also often performed using a different method, oral (read-aloud) reading.",
        "In this paradigm, students read texts aloud and their proficiency in terms of speed, fluency, pronunciation, intonation etc.",
        "can be monitored directly while reading is in progress.",
        "In the reading research literature, oral reading has been one of the best diagnostic and predictive measures of foundational reading weaknesses and of overall reading ability (e.g., Deno et al., 2001; Wayman et al., 2007).",
        "An association between low reading comprehension and slow, inaccurate reading rate has been confirmed repeatedly in middle school populations (e.g., Deno & Marsten, 2006).",
        "Correlations consistently fall in the 0.65-0.7 range for predicting untimed passage reading comprehension test outcomes (Wayman et al., 2007).",
        "In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of large-scale, automatic assessment of read-aloud speech of middle school students with a reasonable degree of accuracy (these students typically attend grades 6-8 and their age is in the 10-14 years range).",
        "If possible, this would improve the utility of oral reading as a large-scale, school-based assessment technique, making it more efficient by saving costs and time of human annotations and grading of reading errors.",
        "The most widely used measure of oral reading proficiency is \"correctly read words per minute\" (cwpm) (Wayman et al., 2007).",
        "To obtain this measure, students' read speech samples are first recorded, then the reading time is determined, and finally a human rater has to listen to the recording and note all reading errors and sum them up.",
        "Reading errors are categorized into word substitutions, deletions etc.",
        "We have several sets of digitally recorded read-aloud samples from middle school students available which were not collected for use with automatic speech recognition (ASR) but which were scored by hand.",
        "Our approach here is to pass the children's speech samples through an automatic speech recognizer and then to align its output word hypotheses with the original text that was read by the student.",
        "From this alignment and from the reading time, an estimate for the above mentioned measure of cwpm can then be computed.",
        "If the automatically computed cwpm measures are close enough to those obtained by human hand-scoring, this process may be employed in real world settings eventually to save much time and money.",
        "Recognizing children's speech, however, has been shown to be substantially harder than adult speech (Lee et al., 1999; Li and Russell, 2002), which is partly due to children's higher degree of variability in different dimensions of language such as pronunciation or grammar.",
        "In our data, there was also a substantial number of non-native speakers of English, presenting additional challenges.",
        "We used targeted training and adaptation of our ASR systems to achieve reasonable word accuracies.",
        "While for text passages, the word accuracy on unseen speakers was about 72%, it was only about 50% for word lists, which was due in part to a higher percentage of non-native speakers in this data set, to the fact that various sources of noise often prevented the recognizer from correctly locating the spoken words in the signal, and also due to our choice of a uniform language model since conventional n-gram models did not work on this data with many silences and noises between words.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we review related work, followed by a description of our data in Section 3.",
        "Section 4 provides a brief description of our speech recognizer as well as the experimental setup.",
        "Section 5 provides the results of our experiments, followed by a discussion in Section 6 and conclusions and future work in Section 7."

        "Following the seminal paper about the LISTEN project (Mostow et al.",
        "1994), a number of studies have been conducted on using automatic speech recognition technology to score children's read speech.",
        "Similar to automated assessment of adults' speech (Neumeyer, Franco et al.",
        "2000; Witt, 1999), the likelihood computed in the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) decoding and some measurements of fluency, e.g., speaking rate, are widely used as features for predicting children's speaking proficiency.",
        "Children's speech is different than adults'.",
        "For example, children's speech exhibits higher fundamental frequencies (F0) than adults on average.",
        "Also, children's more limited knowledge of vocabulary and grammar results in more errors when reading printed text.",
        "Therefore, to achieve high-quality recognition on children's speech, modifications have to be made on recognizers that otherwise work well for adults.",
        "In the LISTEN project (Mostow et al., 1994), the basic technology is to use speech recognition to classify each word of text as correctly read or not.",
        "Such a classification task is hard in that the children's speaking deviations from the text may include arbitrary words and non-words.",
        "In a study, they modeled variations by the modification of the lexicon and the language model of the Sphinxspeech recognizer.",
        "Recently, the Technology Based Assessment of Language and Literacy project (TBALL, (Alwan, 2007)) has been attempting to assess and evaluate the language and literacy skills of young children automatically.",
        "In the TBALL project, a variety of tests including word verification, syllable blending, letter naming, and reading comprehension, are jointly used.",
        "Word verification is an assessment that measures the child's pronunciation of read-aloud target words.",
        "A traditional pronunciation verification method based on log-likelihoods from HMM models is used initially (Tepperman et al., 2006).",
        "Then an improvement based on a Bayesian network classifier (Tepperman et al., 2007) is employed to handle complicated errors such as pronunciation variations and other reading mistakes.",
        "Many other approaches have been developed to further improve recognition performance on children's speech.",
        "For example, one highly accurate recognizer of children's speech has been developed by Hagen et al.",
        "(2007).",
        "Vocal tract length normalization (VTLN) has been utilized to cope with the children's different acoustic properties.",
        "Some special processing techniques, e.g., using a general garbage model to model all miscues in speaking, have been devised to improve the language model used in the recognition of children's speech (Li et al., 2007).",
        "For both system training and evaluation, we use a data set containing 3 passages read by the same 265 speakers (Setl) and a fourth passage (a longer version of Passage 1), read by a different set of 55 speakers (Set2).",
        "Further, we have word lists read by about 500 different speakers (Set3).",
        "All speakers from Setl and most (84%) from the third set were U. S. middle school students in grades 6-8 (age l0-l4).",
        "A smaller number of older students in grades 10-12 (age 15-18) was also included in the third set (16%).",
        "In terms of native language, about 15% of Set1 and about 76% of Set3 are non-native speakers of English or list a language different from English as their preferred language.",
        "Table 1 provides the details of these data sets.",
        "In the word lists data set, there are 178 different word lists containing 212 different word types in total (some word lists were read by several different students).",
        "All data was manually transcribed using a spreadsheet where each word is presented in one line and the annotator, who listens to the audio file, has to mark-up any insertions, substitutions or deletions by the student.",
        "For ASR system training only, we additionally used parts of the OGI (Oregon Graduate Institute) and CMU (Carnegie Mellon University) Kids data sets as well (CSLU, 2008; LDC, 1997)."

        "There was no speaker overlap between training and test sets.",
        "For the language model (LM), two different models were created: for passages, we built an interpolated trigram LM where 90% of the weight is assigned to a LM trained only on the 4 passages from the training set (Set1, Set2) and 10% to a generic LM using the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) Broadcast News corpus (LDC, 1997).",

        "This model with uniform priors, however, has the disadvantage of not including any words not present in the word list training set, such as common mispronunciations and is therefore more restrictive than the LM for text passages.",

        "For the in-context reading (text passages) we trained a trigram model focused mostly on transcriptions of the passages.",
        "For the out-of-context isolated word reading, we used a grammar language model where every possible word of the word lists in the training set can follow any other word at any time, with silence and/or noise between words.",
        "(While this was not our preferred choice, standard n-gram language models performed very poorly given the difficulty of removing inter-word silences or noise automatically.)",
        "Given how hard ASR for children's speech is and given our small matched data sets, the word accuracy of 72% for text passages was not unreasonable and was acceptable, particularly in a first development cycle.",
        "The word accuracy of only about 50% for word lists, however, is more problematic and we conjecture that the two main reasons for the worse performance were (a) the absence of time stamps for the location of words which made it sometimes hard for the recognizer to locate the correct segment in the signal for word decoding (given noises in between), and (b) the sometimes poor recording conditions where volumes were set too high or too low, too much background or speaker noise was present etc.",
        "Further, the high relative number of non-native speakers in that data set may also have contributed to the lower word accuracy of the word lists.",
        "While the current data collection had not been done with speech recognition in mind, in future data collection efforts, we will make sure that the sound quality of recordings is better monitored, with some initial calibration, and that we store time stamps when words are presented on the screen to facilitate the recognition task and to allow the recognizer to expect one particular word at one particular point in time.",

        "Despite imperfect word accuracies, however, for both passages and word lists we found encouragingly high correlations between human and automatic cwpm measures (cw measures for word lists).",
        "Obviously, the absolute values of cwpm differ greatly as the ASR system generates many more errors on average than the readers, but both Pearson correlation as well as Spearman rank correlation measures are all above 0.7.",
        "This means that if we would use our automatic scoring results to rank students' reading proficiency, the ranking order would be overall quite similar to an order produced by human annotators.",
        "This observation about the rank, rather than the absolute value of cwpm, is important in so far as it is often the case that educators are interested in separating \"cohorts\" of readers with similar proficiency and in particular to identify the lowest performing cohort for additional reading practice and tutoring.",
        "An experiment testing the ability of the system to place students into three reading proficiency cohorts based on cwpm was very encouraging in that all 27 students of the test set were placed in the correct cohort by the system.",
        "When we compare frequent student errors with those made by the machine (Table 6), we see that often times, students just substitute slight morphological variants (e.g., \"ask\" for \"asks\"), whereas in the ASR system, errors are typically more complex than just simple substitutions of morphological variants.",
        "However, in the case of word lists, we do find substitutions with related phonological content in the ASR output (e.g., \"example\" for \"simple\").",
        "Finally, we observed that, only for the text passages, the ASR system could correctly identify a substantial percentage of readers' substitutions and deletions (about 48%, see Table 7).",
        "This is also encouraging as it is a first step towards meaningful feedback in a potential interactive setting.",
        "However, we here only look at recall - because of the much larger number of ASR substitutions, precision is much lower and therefore the risk of overcorrection (false alarms) is still quite high.",
        "Despite all of the current shortcomings, we feel that we were able to demonstrate a \"proof-of-concept\" with our initial system in that we can use our trained ASR system to make reliable estimates on students' reading proficiency as measured with \"correct words per minute\", where correlations between human and machine scores are in the 0.80-0.86 range for text passages and word lists."

        "This paper demonstrates the feasibility of building an automatic scoring system for middle school students' reading proficiency, using a targeted trained speech recognition system and the widely used measure of \"correctly read words per minute\" (cwpm).",
        "The speech recognizer was trained both on external data (OGI and CMU kids' corpora) and internal data (text passages and word lists), yielding two different modes for text passages (trigram language model) and word lists (grammar language model).",
        "Automatically estimated cwpm measures agreed closely with human cwpm measures, achieving 0.8 and higher correlation with Pearson and 0.7 and higher correlation with Spearman rank correlation measures.",
        "Future work includes an improved set-up for recordings such as initial calibration and on-line sound quality monitoring, adding time stamps to recordings of word lists, adding more data for training/adaptation of the ASR system, and exploring other features (such as fluency features) and their potential role in cwpm prediction."
