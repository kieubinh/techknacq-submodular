        "Collaboration in dialogue has long been researched in computational linguistics (Chu-Carroll and Car-berry, 1998; Constantino-Gonzalez and Suthers, 2000; Jordan and Di Eugenio, 1997; Lochbaum and Sidner, 1990; Soller, 2004; Vizcaino, 2005), however, the study of peer learning from a computational perspective is still in the early stages.",
        "This is an important area of study because peer learning has been shown to be an effective mode of learning, potentially for all of the participants (Cohen et al., 1982; Brown and Palincsar, 1989; Birtz et al., 1989; Rekrut, 1992).",
        "Additionally, while there has been a focus on using natural language for intelligent tutoring systems (Evens et al., 1997; Graesser et al., 2004; VanLehn et al., 2002), peer to peer interactions are notably different from those of expert-novice pairings, especially with respect to the richness of the problem-solving deliberations and negotiations.",
        "Using natural language in collaborative",
        "*This work is funded by NSF grants 0536968 and 0536959.",
        "learning could have a profound impact on the way in which educational applications engage students in learning.",
        "Previous research has suggested several mechanisms that explain why peer learning is effective for all participants.",
        "Among them are: self-directed ex-plaining(Chi et al., 1994), other-directed explaining (Ploetzner et al., 1999; Roscoe and Chi, 2007) and Knowledge Co-construction - KCC for short (Hausmann et al., 2004).",
        "KCC episodes are defined as portions of the dialogue in which students are jointly constructing a shared meaning of a concept required for problem solving.",
        "This last mechanism is the most interesting from a peer learning perspective because it is a truly collaborative construct and also because it is consistent with the widely accepted constructivist view of learning.",
        "Since KCC is a high-level concept that is not easily recognized by an artificial agent we collected peer learning interactions from students and studied them to identify features that might be useful in identifying KCC.",
        "We found that linguistically based initiative shifts seem to capture the notion of collaborative construction.",
        "A more thorough analysis found a strong relationship between KCC and initiative shifts and moderate correlations between initiative shifts and learning.",
        "The results of this analysis are being incorporated into KSC-PaL, an artificial agent that can collaborate with a human student via natural-language dialogue and actions within a graphical workspace.",
        "KSC-PaL has been developed in the last two years.",
        "Dialogue-wise, its core is TuTalk (Jordan et al., 2007), a dialogue management system that supports natural language dialogue in educational applications.",
        "As we will describe, we have already developed its user interface and its student model and have extended TuTalk's planner to provide KSC-PaL with the ability to induce initiative shifts.",
        "For the version of KSCPal we will present in this paper, we wanted to focus on the question of whether this style of interaction helps learning; and we were concerned that its limitations in disambiguating the student's input could impact this interaction.",
        "Hence, this round of experiments employs a human \"helper\" that is given a list of concepts the input may match, and chooses the most appropriate one.",
        "The work presented in this paper is part of a larger research program: we analyze different paradigms tutoring dialogues and peer-learning dialogues-in the same basic domain, devise computational models for both, and implement them in two separate SW systems, an ITS and the peer-learning system we present here.",
        "For our work on the tutoring dialogue corpus and the ITS please see (Fossati et al., accepted for publication 2009).",
        "Our domain in both cases is problem solving in basic data structure and algorithms, which is part of foundations of Computer Science.",
        "While in recent years, interest in CS in the US has dropped dramatically, CS is of enormous strategic interest, and is projected to foster vast job growth in the next few years (AA.",
        "VV., 2006).",
        "We believe that by supporting CS education in its core we can have the largest impact on reversing the trend of students' disinterest.",
        "Our belief is grounded in the observation that the rate of attrition is highest at the earliest phases of undergraduate CS curricula.",
        "This is due in part to students' difficulty with mastering basic concepts (Katz et al., 2003), which require a deep understanding of static structures and the dynamic procedures used to manipulate them (AA.",
        "VV., 2001).",
        "These concepts also require the ability to move seamlessly among multiple representations, such as text, pictures, pseudo-code, and real code in a specific programming language.",
        "Surprisingly, few educational SW systems address CS topics, e.g. teaching a specific programming language like LISP (Corbett and Anderson, 1990) or database concepts (Mitrovic et al., 2004).",
        "Additionally, basically they are all ITSs, where the relationship between the system and the student is one of \"subordination\".",
        "Only two or three of these ITSs address foundations, including: Autotu-tor (Graesser et al., 2004) addresses basic literacy, but not data structures or algorithms; ADIS (Warendorf and Tan, 1997) tutors on basic data structures, but its emphasis is on visualization, and it appears to have been more of a proof of concept than a working system; ProPL (Lane and VanLehn, 2003) helps novices design their programs, by stressing problem solving and design skills.",
        "In this paper, we will first discuss the collection and analysis of peer learning interactions.",
        "Then, we discuss the design of our peer agent, and how it is guided by the results of our analysis.",
        "We conclude by briefly describing the user experiments we are about to undertake, and whose preliminary results will be available at the time of the workshop."

        "We have collected peer learning interactions from 15 pairs of students solving problems in the domain of computer science data structures.",
        "Students were recruited from introductory courses on data structures and algorithms.",
        "Each problem involved one of three types of data structures: linked-lists, stacks and binary search trees.",
        "Each problem was either a debugging problem where the students were asked to work together to identify errors in the code or an explanation problems in which the students jointly created an explanation of a segment of code.",
        "The students interacted using a computer mediated interface where they could communicate via text-based chat, drawing and making changes to code (see Figure 1).",
        "The graphical workspace (drawing and coding areas) was shared such that changes made by one student were propagated to his/her partner's workspace.",
        "Access to this graphical workspace was controlled so that only one student was allowed to draw or make changes to code at any point in time.",
        "Each pair was presented with a total of 5 problems, although not all pairs completed all problems due to time limitations.",
        "The interactions for each pair were subdivided into separate dialogues for each problem.",
        "Thus, we collected a corpus consisting of a total of 73 dialogues.",
        "In addition to collecting problem solving data, we also presented each student with a pretest prior to problem solving and an identical post-test at the conclusion of problem solving in order to measure learning gains.",
        "A paired t-test of pre-and post-test scores showed that students did learn during collaborative problem solving (t(30)=2.83; p=0.007).",
        "The interactions produced an average normalized learning gain of 17.5 (possible total points are 50)."

      "heading": "3. Analysis of Peer Learning Interactions",
      "text": [
        "Next, we undertook an extensive analysis of the corpus of peer learning interactions in order to determine the behaviors with which to endow KSC-PaL.",
        "Given the definition of KCC, it appeared to us that the concept of initiative from discourse and dialogue processing should play a role: intuitively, if the students are jointly contructing a concept, the initiative cannot reside only with one, otherwise the partner would just be passive.",
        "Hence, we annotated the dialogues for both KCC and initiative.",
        "The KCC annotation involved coding the dialogues for KCC episodes.",
        "These are defined as a series of utterances and graphical actions in which students are jointly constructing a shared meaning of a concept required for problem solving (Hausmann et al., 2004).",
        "Using this definition, an outside annotator and one of the authors coded 30 dialogues (approximately 46% of the corpus) for KCC episodes.",
        "This entailed marking the beginning utterance and the end utterance of such episodes, under the assumption that all intervening utterances do belong to the same KCC episode (otherwise the coder would mark an earlier end for the episode).",
        "The resulting intercoder reliability, measured with the Kappa statistic(Carletta, 1996), is considered excellent (k = 0.80).",
        "Our annotation of initiative was two fold.",
        "Since there is disagreement in the computational linguistics community as to the precise definition of initiative(Chu-Carroll and Carberry, 1998; Jordan and Di Eugenio, 1997), we annotated the dialogues for both dialogue initiative, which tracks who is leading the conversation and determining the current conversational focus, and task initiative, which tracks the lead in problem solving.",
        "For dialogue initiative annotation, we used the well-known utterance-based rules for allocation of control from (Walker and Whittaker, 1990).",
        "In this scheme, each utterance is tagged with one of four dialogue acts (assertion, command, question or prompt) and control is then allocated based on a set of rules.",
        "The dialogue act annotation was done automatically, by marking turns that end in a question mark as questions, those that start with a verb as commands, prompts from a list of commonly used prompts (e.g. ok, yeah) and the remaining turns as assertions.",
        "To verify that the automatic annotation was good, we manually annotated a sizable portion of the dialogues with those four dialogue acts.",
        "We then compared the automatic annotation against the human gold standard, and we found an excellent accuracy: it ranged from 86% for assertions and questions, to 97% for prompts, to 100% for commands.",
        "Once the dialogue acts had been automatically annotated, two coders, one of the authors and an outside annotator, coded 24 dialogues (1449 utterances, approximately 45% of the corpus) for dialogue initiative, by using the four control rules from (Walker",
        "1.",
        "Assertion: Control is allocated to the speaker unless it is a response to a question.",
        "2.",
        "Command: Control is allocated to the speaker.",
        "3.",
        "Question: Control is allocated to the speaker, unless it is a response to a question or a command.",
        "4.",
        "Prompt: Control is allocated to the hearer.",
        "The resulting intercoder reliability on dialogue initiative was 0.77, a quite acceptable level of agreement.",
        "We then experimented with automatically annotating dialogue initiative according to those control rules.",
        "Since the accuracy against the gold standard was 82%, the remaining 55% of the corpus was also automatically annotated for dialogue initiative, using those four control rules.",
        "As concerns task initiative, we define it as any action by a participant to either achieve a goal directly, decompose a goal or reformulate a goal (Guinn, 1998; Chu-Carroll and Brown, 1998).",
        "Actions in our domain that show task initiative include:",
        "• Explaining what a section of code does.",
        "• Identifying that a section of code as correct or incorrect.",
        "• Suggesting a correction to a section of code",
        "• Making a correction to a section of code prior to discussion with the other participant.",
        "The same two coders annotated for task initiative the same portion of the corpus already annotated for dialogue initiative.",
        "The resulting intercoder reliability for task initiative is 0.68, which is high enough to support tentative conclusions.",
        "The outside coder then manually coded the remaining 55% of the corpus for task initiative.",
        "In analyzing the annotated dialogues, we used multiple linear regression to identify correlations of the annotated features and post-test score.",
        "We used pretest score as a covariate because of its significant positive correlations with post-test score.",
        "Due to variations in student ability in the different problem types, our analysis focused only on a portion of the collected interactions.",
        "In the tree problem there was a wide variation in experience level of the students which would inhibit KCC.",
        "In the stack problem, the students had a better understanding of stacks prior to problem solving and spent less time in discussion and problem solving.",
        "Thus, our analysis focused only on the linked-list problems.",
        "We started by analyzing the relationship between KCC and learning.",
        "As a measurement of KCC we used KCC actions which is the number of utterances and graphical actions that occur during KCC episodes.",
        "This analysis showed that KCC does have a positive correlation with learning in our corpus.",
        "In Table 1, the first row shows the benefit for the dyad overall by correlating the mean post-test score with the mean pretest score and the dyad's KCC actions.",
        "The second row shows the benefit for individuals by correlating individual post-test scores with individual pretest scores and the dyad's KCC actions.",
        "The difference in the strength of these correlations suggests that members of the dyads are not benefitting equally from KCC.",
        "If the subjects are divided into two groups, those with a pretest score below the mean score ( n=14) and those with a pretest score above the mean score ( n=16) , it can be seen that those with a low pretest score benefit more from the KCC episodes than do those with a high pretest score (rows 3 and 4 in Table 1).",
        "Next, we explored the relationship between learning and the number of times initiative shifted between the students.",
        "Intuitively, we assumed that frequent shifts of initiative would reflect students working together to solve the problem.",
        "We found there was a significant correlation between post-test score (after removing the effects of pretest scores) and the number of shifts in dialogue initiative and the number of shifts in task initiative (see Table 2).",
        "This analysis excluded two dyads whose problem solving collaboration had gone awry.",
        "We then computed a second measure ofKCC that is meant to reflect the density of the KCC episodes.",
        "KCC initiative shifts is the number of task initiative shifts that occur during KCC episodes.",
        "Many task initiative shifts reflect more active KCC.",
        "Table 3 uses KCC initiative shifts as the measure of co-construction.",
        "It shows similar results to table 1, where KCC actions was used.",
        "Note that when the outlier dyads were removed the correlation with learning is much stronger for the low pretest score subjects when KCC initiative shifts are used as the measure of KCC (R = 0.45, p = 0.02) than when KCC actions are used.",
        "Lastly we investigated the hypothesis that KCC episodes involve frequent shifts in initiative, as both participants are actively participating in problem solving.",
        "To test this hypothesis, we calculated the average initiative shifts per line during KCC episodes and the average initiative shifts per line during problem solving outside ofKCC episodes for each dyad.",
        "A paired t-test was then used to verify that there is a difference between the two groups.",
        "The t-test showed no significant difference in average dialogue initiative shifts in KCC episodes compared with non-KCC problem solving.",
        "However, there is a significant difference between average task initiative shifts in KCC episodes compared with the rest of the dialogue (t(57) = 3.32, p = 0.0016).",
        "The effect difference between the two groups (effect size = 0.65 ) shows that there is a meaningful increase in the number of task initiative shifts in KCC episodes compared with problem solving activity outside of the KCC episodes.",
        "Since our results show that task initiative shifts are conducive to learning, we want to endow our software agent with the ability to encourage a shift in initiative from the agent to the student, when the student is overly passive.",
        "The question is, what are natural indicators in dialogue that the partner should take the initiative?",
        "We explored two different methods for encouraging initiative shifts.",
        "One is that student uncertainty may lead to a shift in initiative.",

        "Using these categories we were unable to reliably annotate for hedging.",
        "But, after collapsing the categories into a single binary value of hedging/not hedging we arrived at an acceptable agreement (k = 0.71).",

        "(Chu-Carroll and Brown, 1998) identifies cues that may contribute to the shift of task and dialogue initiative.",
        "Since task initiative shifts appear to identify KCC episodes, we chose to explore the following cues that potentially result in the shift of task initiative.",
        "• Give up task.",
        "These are utterances where the student explicitly gives up the task using phrases like \"Any other ideas?",
        "\".",

        "Using hedging, request for feedback and initiative cues, we were able to identify 283 shifts in task initiative or approximately 67% of all task initiative shifts in the corpus.",
        "The remaining shifts were likely an explicit take over of initiative without a preceding predictor.",
        "Since we found several possible ways to predict and encourage initiative shifts, the next step was to identify which of these predictors more often resulted in an initiative shift; and, for which predictors the resulting initiative shift more often led to an increase in the student's knowledge level.",
        "Table 4 shows the percentage of instances of each predictor that resulted in an initiative shift.",
        "Along with the likelihood of a predictor leading to an initiative shift, we also examined the impact of a shift of task initiative on a student's level of knowledge, measured using knowledge score, calculated on the basis of the student model (see Section 4).",
        "This is an important characteristic since we want to encourage initiative shifts in an effort to increase learning.",
        "First, we analyzed initiative shifts to determine if they resulted in an increase in knowledge score.",

        "This required three enhancements: first, the ability to recognize the initiative holder in each utterance or action; second, the ability to encourage the shift of initiative from the agent to the student; and three, extending the TuTalk planner so that it can process task initiative shifts.",
        "As concerns the first step, that the agent recognize the initiative holder in each utterance or action, we resorted to machine learning.",
        "Using the Weka Toolkit(Witten and Frank, 2005), we explored various machine learning algorithms and feature sets that could reliably identify the holder of task initiative.",
        "We found that the relevant features of an action in the graphical workspace were substantially different from those of a natural language utterance.",
        "Therefore, we trained and tested separate classifiers for each type of student action.",
        "After examining a wide variety of machine learning algorithms we selected the following two classifiers: (1) K* (Cleary and Trigg, 1995), a clustering algorithm, for classifying natural language utterances which correctly classified 71.7699% of utterance and (2) JRip (Cohen, 1995), a rule-based algorithm, for classifying drawing and coding actions which correctly classified 86.971% of the instances.",
        "As concerns the second step, encouraging initiative shifts so that the student assumes the task initiative, we use the results of our analysis of the indicators of task initiative shifts from Section 3.3.",
        "KSC-PaL will use prompts, request feedback and make invalid statements in order to encourage initiative shifts and promote learning.",
        "Finally, we augmented the TuTalk planner so that it selects scripts to manage task initiative shifts.",
        "Two factors will determine whether a script that encourages initiative shifts will be selected: the current level of initiative shifts and the change in the student's knowledge score.",
        "Task initiative shifts will be tracked using the classifier described above.",
        "Scripts will be selected to encourage initiative shifts when the average level of initiative shifts is less than the mean initiative shifts in KCC episodes (calculated from the corpus data) and the student's knowledge level has not increased since the last time a script selection was requested.",
        "The scripts are based on the analysis of methods for encouraging initiative shifts described above.",
        "Specifically, KSC-PaL will encourage initiative shifts by responding to student input using prompts, requesting feedback from the student and encouraging student criticism by intentionally making errors in problem solving.",
        "We are now poised to run user experiments.",
        "We will run subjects in two conditions with KSC-PaL: in the first condition (control), KSC-PaL will not encourage task initiative shifts and act more as a tutor; in the second condition, KSC-PaL will encourage task initiative shifts as we just discussed.",
        "One final note: because we do not want our experiments to be affected by the inability of the agent to interpret an utterance, given current NLU technology, the interface will \"incorporate\" a human interpreter.",
        "The interpreter will receive student utterances along with a list of possible matching concepts from TuTalk.",
        "The interpreter will select the most likely matching concept, thus assisting TuTalk in natural language interpretation.",
        "Note that the interpreter has a limited, predetermined sets of choices, corresponding to the concepts TuTalk knows about.",
        "In this way, his / her intervention is circumscribed."
