        "It has the advantage of being able to model linguistic interference phenomena, that is, errors which are produced through literal translation from the author's first language.",
        "Although we apply this method in the context of French-as-a-Second-Lan-guage, its principles are largely independent of language, and could also be extended to other classes of errors.",
        "Note that this is preliminary work which, in a first step, focuses on error correction, and ignores for now the preliminary step of error detection which is left for future research.",
        "This work is of interest to applications in Comput-er-Assisted-Language-Learning (CALL) and Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), where tutoring material often consists of drills such as fill-in-the-blanks or multiple-choice-questions.",

        "Prepositions constitute 14% of all tokens produced in most languages (Fort & Guillaume 2007).",
        "They are reported as yielding among the highest error class rates across various languages (Izumi, 2004, for Japanese, Granger et al., 2001, for French).",
        "In their analysis of a small corpus of advanced-intermediate French as a Second Language (FSL) learners, Hermet et al.",
        "(2008) found that preposition choice accounted for 17.2 % of all errors.",
        "Prepositions can be seen as a special class of cognates, in the sense that the same L1 preposition used in different L1 sentences, could translate to several different L2 prepositions.",
        "Automatic error detection/correction methods often process prepositions and determiners in the same way because they both fall in the class of functionwords.",
        "However, one can make the argument that preposition errors deserve a different and deeper kind of treatment, because they tend to be more semantically motivated (event hough some prepositions governed by verbs draw a purely functional relation).",
        "In contrast, determiners are not semantically motivated and only vary on the register of quantity (or genre in some languages).",
        "For example, there are 37 determiners in French, most of which can be used interchangeably without significantly affecting the syntax of a sentence, and often, not even its meaning (\"I'll have one coffee'V'Tll have a coffee'V'Tll have some coffee'V'Tll have my coffee'V'Tll have coffee\" are all rather alike).",
        "Comparatively, there are 85 simple prepositions and 222 compounds ones and they cannot be used interchangeably without significantly modifying the sense of an utterance, except for cases of synonymy.",
        "In this paper, we focus our attention on preposition correction only, as it seems to be a more complex problem than determiners.",
        "While in principle the methods described here could handle determiner errors, we feel that our framework, which involves parsing in combination with a very large language model and Machine Translation, constitutes heavier machinery than is warranted for that simpler problem.",
        "There are two major causes of preposition errors in a SLL context.",
        "The first kind is caused by lexical confusion within the second language itself.",
        "For example, a L2 author writing in English may erroneously use a location preposition like \"at\" where another location preposition like \"in\" would have been more appropriate.",
        "The second kind involves linguistic interference between prepositions in L1 and prepositions in L2 (Granger et al., 2001).",
        "For example, a Second Language Learner who wants to render the following two English sentences in French \"I go to Montreal\" and \"I go to Argentina\", might use the same French preposition \"à\" for \"to\", when in fact, French usage dictates that you write \"àMontréal\", and \"en Argentine\".",
        "Note that the situation varies greatly from language to language.",
        "The same two English sentences rendered in Italian and German would in fact employ a same preposition, whereas in Spanish, different prepositions would also be required as in French.",
        "Studies have found that the majority of errors made by L2 authors (especially intermediate to advanced ones) are caused by such linguistic interference (Wang and Garigliano, 1992, Cowan, 1983, p 109).",
        "Note that this kind of linguistic interference can often lead to much more severe and hard to repair errors, as illustrated by the following example, taken from an actual SLL corpus.",
        "Say a native English author wants to render \"Police arrived at the scene of the crime\" into French (her L2).",
        "Because she is not fluent in French, she translates the last part of the sentence to \"à la scène de la crime \".",
        "This literal translation turns out to be highly unidiomatic in French, and should instead be written as \"sur les lieux du crime \" (which in English, would translate literally to \"on the location of the crime\").",
        "One might suspect that preposition errors of the first type would be solvable using unilingual L2 language models, but that the second type might benefit from a language model which also takes L1 into account.",

        "The contexts retrieved are in turn analyzed for correspondence with the original input.",
        "The detection and correction methods differ according to the class of the error.",
        "Determiner errors call for distinct detection and correction procedures while collocation errors use the same procedure for both.",
        "Determiner errors are discovered by thresholds ratios on search hits statistics, taking into account probable ambiguities, since multiple forms of determiners can be valid in a single context.",
        "Collocation errors on the other hand, are assessed only by a threshold on absolute counts, that is, a form different from the input automatically signals an error and provides its correction.",

        "As discussed in section 2, L2 authoring errors can be caused by confusions within the L2 itself, or by linguistic interference between L1 and L2.",
        "In order to account for this duality, we investigate the use of two correction strategies, one which is based on unilingual models of L2, and one which is based on translation models between L1 and L2.",
        "The first approach, called the Unilingual strategy, is illustrated by the example in Figure 1.",
        "It uses a web search engine (Yahoo) as a simple, unilingual language model, where the probability of a L2 phrase is estimated simply by counting its number of occurrences in Web pages of that language.",
        "A severe limitation of this kind of model is that it can only estimate the probability of phrases that appear at least once on the Web.",
        "In contrast, an N-gram model (for example) is able to estimate the probability of phrases that it has never seen in the training corpus.",
        "In order to deal with this limitation, syntactic pruning is therefore applied to the phrase before it is sent to the search engine, in order to eliminate parts which are not core to the context of use of the preposition, thus increasing the odds that the pruned sentence will have at least one occurrence on the Web.",
        "This pruning and generalization is done by carrying out syntactic analysis with the Xerox Incremental Parser for the syntactic analysis (Ref XIP).",
        "XIP is an error robust, symbolic, dependency parser, which outputs syntactic information at the constituency and dependency levels.",
        "Its ability to produce syntactic analyses in the presence of errors is",
        "Table 1.",
        "Categories of prepositions - the list is given in English, and non exhaustive for space reasons.",
        "particularly interesting in the context of second language authoring where the sentences produced by the authors can be quite far from grammatical correctness.",
        "The input sentence is fed to the parser as two segments split at error point (in this case, at the location of the erroneous preposition).",
        "This ensures that the parses are correct and not affected at dependency level by the presence of error.",
        "The syntactic analyses are needed to perform syntactic pruning, which is a crucial step in our framework, following Hermet et.",
        "al (2008).",
        "Pruning is performed by way of chunking heuristics, which are controlled by grammatical features, provided by XlP's morphological analysis (PoS tagger).",
        "The heuristics are designed to suppress syntactically extraneous material in the sentence, such as adverbs, some adjectives and some NPs.",
        "Adverbs are removed in all cases, while adjectives are only removed when they are not in a position to govern a Prepositional Phrase.",
        "NPs are suppressed in controlled cases, based on the verb sub-categorization frame, when a PP can be attached directly to the preceding verb.",
        "In case of ambiguity in the attachment of the PP, two versions of the pruned sentence can be produced reflecting two different PP attachments.",
        "Lemmatization of verbs is also carried out in the pruning step.",
        "After pruning, the right and left sides of the sentences are reassembled with alternate prepositions.",
        "The replacement of prepositions is controlled by way of semantics.",
        "Since prepositions are richer in sense than strict function words, they can therefore be categorized according to semantics.",
        "Saint-Dizier (2007) proposes such a taxonomy, and in our framework, prepositions have been grouped in 7 non-exclusive categories.",
        "Table 1 provides details of this categorization.",
        "The input preposition is mapped to all the sets it belongs to, and corresponding alternates are retrieved as correction candidates.",
        "The 6 most frequent French preposition are also added automatically to the candidates list.",
        "The resulting sentences are then sent to the Yahoo Search Engine and hits are counted.",
        "The number of hits returned by each of the queries is used as decision criteria, and the preposition contained in the query with the most hits is selected as the correction candidate.",
        "While the above Unilingual strategy might work for simple cases of L1 interference, one would not expect it to work as well in more complex cases where both the preposition and its governing parts have been translated too literally.",
        "For example, in the case of the example from section 2, while the Unilingual strategy might be able to effect correction \"sur la scène du crime \" which is marginally better than the original \"à la scène du crime \" (12K hits versus 1K), it cannot address the root of the problem, that is, the unidiomatic expression \"scène du crime\" which should instead be rendered as \"lieux du crime \" (38K hits).",
        "In this particular case, it is not really an issue because it so happens that \"sur\" is the correct preposition to use for both \"lieux du crime\" and \"scène du crime\" , but in our experience, that is not always the case.",
        "Note also that the Unilingual approach can only deal with preposition errors (although it would be easy enough to extend it to other kinds of function words), and cannot deal with more semantically deep L1 interference.",
        "To address these issues, we experimented with a second strategy which we will refer to as the Roundtrip Machine Translation approach (or Roundtrip MT for short).",
        "Note that our approach is different from that of Brockett et al.",
        "(2006), as we do make use of a truly multilingual translation model.",
        "In contrast, Brockett's translation model was trained on texts that were written in the same language, with the sources being ill-written text in the same language as the properly-formed target texts.",

        "There are many ways in which error-correction could be carried out using MT techniques.",
        "Several of these have been described in a patent by Dymet-man and Isabelle (2005), but to our knowledge, none of them have yet been implemented and evaluated.",
        "In this paper, we use the simplest possible implementation of this concept, namely, we carry out a single round-trip translation.",
        "Given a potentially erroneous L2 sentence written by a second language author, we translate it to the author's L1 language, and then back to L2.",
        "Even with this simple approach, we often find that errors which were present in the original L2 sentence have been repaired in the roundtrip version.",
        "This may sound surprising, since one would expect the roundtrip sentence to be worse than the original, on account of the \"Chinese Whisper\" effect.",
        "Our current theory for why this is not the case in practice goes as follows.",
        "In the course of translating the original L2 sentence to L1, when the MT system encounters a part that is ill-formed, it will tend to use single word entries from its phrase table, because longer phrases will not have been represented in the well-formed L2 training data.",
        "In other words, the system tends to generate a word for word translation of ill-formed parts, which mirrors exactly what L2 authors do when they write poorly formed L2 sentences by translating too literally from their L1 thought.",
        "As a result, the L1 sentence produced by the MT system is often well formed for that language.",
        "Subsequently, when the MT system tries to translate that well-formed L1 sentence back to L2, it is therefore able to use longer entries from its phrase table, and hence produce a better L2 translation of that part than what the author originally produced.",
        "We use Google Translate as a translation engine for matter of simplicity.",
        "A drawback of using such an online service is that it is essentially a closed box, and we therefore have little control over the translation process, and no access to lower level data generated by the system in the course of translation (e.g. phrase alignments between source and target sentences).",
        "In particular, this means that we can only generate one alternative L2 sentence, and have no way of assessing which parts of this single alternative have a high probability of being better than their corresponding parts in the original L2 sentence written by the author.",
        "In other words, we have no way of telling which changes are likely to be false positives, and which changes are likely to be true positives.",
        "This is the main reason why we focus only on error repair in this preliminary work.",
        "The roundtrip sentences generated with Google Translate often differ significantly from the original L2 sentence, and in more ways than just the erroneous preposition used by the author.",
        "For example, the (pruned) clause \"avoir du succès en le recrutement\" (\"to be successful in recruiting'\") might come back as as \"réussir à recruter\" (\"to succeed in recruiting\").",
        "Here, the translation is acceptable, but the preposition used by the MT system is not appropriate for use in the original sentence as written by the L2 author.",
        "Conversely, a roundtrip translation can be ill-formed, yet use a preposition which would be correct in the original L2 sentence.",
        "For example, \"regarder à des films\" (\"look at some movies\") might come back as \"inspecter des films\" (\"inspect some films\").",
        "Here, the original meaning is somewhat lost, but the system correctly suggested that there should be no preposition before \"des films\" .",
        "Hence, in the context of the Roundtrip MT approach, we need two ways of measuring appropriateness of the suggested corrections for given clauses.",
        "The first approach, which we call the Clause criteria, looks at whether or not the whole clause has been restored to a correct idiomatic form (including correct use of preposition) which also preserves the meaning intended by the author of the original sentence.",
        "Hence, according to this approach, an MT alternative may be deemed correct, even if it chooses a preposition which would have been incorrect if substituted in the original L2 sentence as is.",
        "In the second approach, called the Prep criteria, we only look at whether the preposition used by the MT system in the roundtrip translation, corresponds to the correct preposition to be used in the original L2 clause.",
        "Hence, with this approach, an MT alternative may be deemed correct, even if the preposition chosen by the MT system is actually inappropriate in the context of the generated roundtrip translation, or, even worse, if the roundtrip modified the clause to a point where it actually means something different than what the author actually intended.",
        "Of course, in the case of the Prep evaluation criteria, having the MT system return a sentence which employs the proper preposition to use in the context of the original L2 sentence is not the end of the process.",
        "In an error correction context, one must also isolate the correct preposition and insert it in the appropriate place in the original L2 sentence.",
        "This part of the processing chain is not currently implemented, but would be easy to do, if we used an MT system that provided us with the alignment information between the source sentence and the target sentence generated.",
        "The accuracy figures which we present in this paper assume that this mapping has been implemented and that this particular part of the process can be done with 100% accuracy (a claim which, while plausible, still needs to be demonstrated in future work).",
        "We also investigate a third strategy called Hybrid, which uses the Roundtrip MT approach as a backup for cases where the Unilingual approach is unable to distinguish between different choices of preposition.",
        "The latter typically occurs when the system is not able to sufficiently prune and generalize the phrase, resulting in a situation where all pruned variants yield zero hits on the Web, no matter what preposition is used.",
        "One could of course also use the Unilingual approach as a backup for the Roundtrip MT approach, but this would be harder to implement since the MT system always returns an answer, and our use of the online Google Translate system precludes any attempt to estimate the confidence level of that answer.",
        "In conclusion to this section, we use three preposition correction strategies: Unilingual, Roundtrip MT and Hybrid, and in the case of the Roundtrip MT approach, appropriateness of the corrections can be evaluated using two criteria: Prep and Clause."

        "Indeed, flawed as they are, these distorted roundtrip segments corrected prepositions errors in 66.4% of the cases.",
        "However, for a full picture, the approach should be tried on more data, and on other classes of errors.",

        "In this paper, we have demonstrated for the first time that a bilingual Machine Translation approach can be used to good effect to correct errors in texts written by Second Language Authors or Learners.",
        "In the case of preposition error correction we found that, while the MT approach on its own did not perform significantly better than a unilingual approach, a hybrid combination of both performed much better than the unilingual approach alone.",
        "More work needs to be carried out in order to fully evaluate the potential of the MT approach.",
        "In particular, we plan to experiment with this kind of approach to deal with more complex cases of L1 interference which result in severely damaged L2 sentences.",
        "In this paper, we compared the bilingual MT approach to a unilingual baseline which used a relatively simple Web as a corpus algorithm, whose accuracy is comparable to that reported in the literature for a similar preposition correction algorithm (Yi et al., 2008).",
        "Notwithstanding the fact that such simple Web as a corpus approaches have often been shown to be competitive with (if not better than) more complex algorithms which cannot leverage the full extent of the web (Halevy et al., 2009), it would be interesting to compare the bilingual MT approach to more sophisticated unilingual algorithms for preposition correction, many of which are referenced in section 3.",
        "Error detection is another area for future research.",
        "In this paper, we limited ourselves to error correction, since it could be solved through a very simple round-trip translation, without requiring a detailed control of the MT system, or access to lower level information generated by the system in the course of translation (for example, intermediate hypotheses with probabilities and alignment information between source and target sentences).",
        "In contrast, we believe that error detection with an MT approach will require this kind of finer control and access to the guts of the MT system.",
        "We plan to investigate this using the PORTAGE MT system (Ueffing et al., 2007).",
        "Essentially, we plan to use the MT system's internal information to assign confidence scores to various segments of the roundtrip translation, and label them as corrections if this confidence is above a certain threshold.",
        "In doing this, we will be following in the footsteps of Yi et al.",
        "(2008) who use the same algorithm for error detection and error correction.",
        "The process of detecting an error is simply one of determining whether the system's topmost alternative is different from what appeared in the original sentence, and whether the system's confidence in that alternative is sufficiently high to take the risk of presenting it to the user as a suggested correction."
