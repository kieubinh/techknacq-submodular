        "With respect to prepositions and articles, the ESL Assistant's classifiers achieve state-of-the-art performance when compared to results reported in the literature (Ga-mon et al., 2008), inasmuch as comparison is possible when the systems are evaluated on different samples of native text.",

        "In this context, performance measurement inevitably entails manual evaluation, a process that is notoriously time consuming, costly and potentially error-prone.",
        "Human inter-rater agreement is known to be problematic on this task: it is likely to be high in the case of certain user error types, such as over-regularized verb inflection (where the system suggests replacing \"writed\" with \"wrote\"), but other error types are difficult to evaluate, and much may hinge upon who is performing the evaluation: Tetreault and Chodorow (2008b) report that for the annotation of preposition errors \"using a single rater as a gold standard, there is the potential to over-or underestimate precision by as much as 10%.\"",
        "With these caveats in mind, we employed a single annotator to evaluate system performance on native data from the 1-million-word Chinese Learner's of English corpus (Gui and Yang, 2001; 2003).",

        "To accept a suggestion, the user clicks on the suggested rewrite, and the text is emended.",
        "Each of these actions, by both system and user, are logged on the server.",
        "Since being launched in June, 2008, ESL Assistant has been visited over 100,000 times.",
        "Currently, the web page is being viewed between one to two thousand times every day.",
        "From these numbers alone it seems safe to conclude that there is much public interest in an ESL proofreading tool.",

        "Brazil, Canada, Germany, and the United Kingdom each account for about 2% of the site's visitors.",
        "Other countries represented in the database each account for 1% or less of all those who visit the site.",
        "User data are collected so that system performance can be evaluated on actual user input - as opposed to running pre-existing learner corpora through the system.",
        "User data provide invaluable insight into which rewrite suggestions users spend time viewing, and what action they subsequently take on the basis of those suggestions.",
        "These data must be screened, since not all of the textual material entered by users in the web site is valid learner English language data.",
        "As with any publicly deployed web service, we find that numerous users will play with the system, entering nonsense strings or copying text from elsewhere on the website and pasting it into the text box.",
        "To filter out the more obvious non-English data, we eliminate input that contains, for example, no alphabetic characters, no vowels/consonants in a sentence, or no white space.",
        "\"Sentences\" consisting of email subject lines are also removed, as are all the data entered by the ESL Assistant developers themselves.",
        "Since people often enter the same sentence many times within a session, we also remove repetitions of identical sentences within a single session.",
        "Approximately 90% of the people who have visited the web site visit it once and never return.",
        "This behavior is far from unusual on the web, where site visits may have no clear purpose beyond idle curiosity.",
        "In addition, some proportion of visitors may in reality be automated \"bots\" that can be nearly indistinguishable from human visitors.",
        "Nevertheless, we observe a significant number of repeat visitors who return several times to use the system to proofread email or other writing, and these are the users that we are intrinsically interested in.",
        "To measure performance, we therefore decided to evaluate on data collected from users who logged on and entered plausibly English-like text on at least four occasions.",
        "As of 2/10/2009, the frequent user database contained 39,944 session-unique sentences from 578 frequent users in 5,305 sessions.",
        "Data from these users were manually annotated to identify writing domains as shown in Table 2.",
        "Fifty-three percent of the data consists of people proofreading email.",
        "The dominance of email data is presumably due to an Outlook plug-in that is available on the web site, and automates copying email content into the tool.",
        "The non-technical domain consists of student essays, material posted on a personal web site, or employees writing about their company - for example, its history or processes.",
        "The technical writing is largely conference papers or dissertations in the fields of, for example, medicine and computer science.",
        "The \"other\" category includes lists and resumes (a writing style that deliberately omits articles and grammatical subjects), as well as text copied from online newspapers or other media and pasted in.",
        "Sessions categorized as \"unrelated sentences\" typically consist of a series of short, unrelated sentences that each contain one or more errors.",
        "These users are testing the system to see what it does.",
        "While this is a legitimate use of any grammar checker, the user is unlikely to be proofreading his or her writing, so these data are excluded from evaluation."

        "In 51% of the 39,944 frequent user sentences, the system generated at least one grammatical error flag, for a total of 17,832 flags.",

        "Users consistently accept a greater proportion of good suggestions than they do bad ones across all error categories.",
        "This is most pronounced for the adjective-related modules, where the overall rate of good suggestions improved 17.6% after the user made the decision to accept a suggestion, while the system's false positive rate dropped 14.1% after the decision.",

        "All differences in false positive rates are statistically significant in Wilcoxon's signed-ranks test.",
        "When all of the modules are evaluated across the three major writing domains, shown in figure 3, the same pattern of user discrimination between good and bad flags holds.",
        "This is most evident in the technical writing domain, where the overall rate of good suggestions improved 13.2% after accepting the suggestion and the false positive rate dropped 15.1% after the decision.",
        "It is least marked for the essay/nontechnical writing domain.",
        "Here the overall good flag rate increased by only .3% while the false positive rate dropped 1.6%.",

        "These findings are consistent with those for the machine learned articles and prepositions modules in the email domain (Chodorow et al., under review).",
        "A probable explanation for the differences seen across the domains is that those users who are proofreading non-technical writing are, as a whole, less proficient in English than the users who are writing in the other domains.",
        "Users who are proofreading technical writing are typically writing a dissertation or paper in English and therefore tend to relatively fluent in the language.",
        "The email domain comprises people who are confident enough in their English language skills to communicate with colleagues and friends by email in English.",

        "If there is any indication of audience, it is often an instructor.",
        "Users in this domain appear to be the least Englishlanguage proficient of the ESL Assistant users, so it is unsurprising that they are less effective in discriminating between good and bad flags than their more proficient counterparts.",
        "Thus it appears that those users who are most in need of the system are being helped by it least - an important direction for future work.",
        "Finally, we look at whether the neutral flags, which account for 29% of the total flags, have any effect.",
        "The two neutral categories highlighted in Table 3, flags that either misdiagnose the error or that diagnose it but do not correct it, account for 74% of ESL Assistant's neutral flags.",
        "Although these suggested rewrites do not improve the sentence, they do highlight an environment that contains an error.",
        "The question is: What is the effect of identifying an error when the rewrite doesn't improve the sentence?",
        "To estimate this, we searched for cases where ESL Assistant produced a neutral flag and, though the user did not accept the suggestion, a revised sentence that generated no flag was subsequently submitted for analysis.",
        "For example, one user entered: \"This early morning i got a from head office ESL Assistant suggested deleting from, which does not improve the sentence.",
        "Subsequently, in the same session, the user submitted, \"This early morning I heard from the head office .\"",
        "In this instance, the system correctly identified the location of an error.",
        "Moreover, even though the suggested rewrite was not a good solution, the information was sufficient to enable the user to fix the error on his or her own.",
        "Out of 1,349 sentences with neutral suggestions that were not accepted, we identified (using a fuzzy match) 215 cases where the user voluntarily modified the sentence so that it contained no flag, without accepting the suggestion.",
        "In 44% of these cases, the user had simply typed in the suggested correction instead of accepting it - indicating that true acceptance rates might be higher than we originally estimated.",
        "Sixteen percent of the time, the sentence was revised but there remained an error that the system failed to detect.",
        "In the other 40% of cases, the voluntary revision improved the sentence.",
        "It appears that merely pointing out the possible location of an error to the user is often sufficient to be helpful."
