        "Semi-supervised approaches using a small number of labeled examples together with many un-labeled examples are often unreliable as they frequently produce an internally consistent, but nevertheless incorrect set of extractions.",
        "We propose that this problem can be overcome by simultaneously learning classifiers for many different categories and relations in the presence of an ontology defining constraints that couple the training of these classifiers.",
        "Experimental results show that simultaneously learning a coupled collection of classifiers for 30 categories and relations results in much more accurate extractions than training classifiers individually."

        "Although fully supervised methods for learning to extract such facts from text work well, the cost of collecting many labeled examples of each type of knowledge to be extracted is impractical.",

        "but these approaches tend to suffer from the fact that they face an under-constrained learning task, resulting in extractions that are often inaccurate.",
        "We present an approach to semi-supervised learning that yields more accurate results by coupling the training of many information extractors.",
        "The intuition behind our approach (summarized in Figure 1) is that semi-supervised training of a single type of extractor such as 'coach' is much more difficult than simultaneously training many extractors that cover a variety of interrelated entity and relation types.",
        "In particular, prior knowledge about the relationships between these different entities and relations (e.g., that 'coach(x)' implies 'person(x)' and 'not sport(x)') allows unlabeled data to become a much more useful constraint during training.",
        "Although previous work has coupled the learning of multiple categories, or used static category recognizers to check arguments for learned relation extractors, our work is the first we know of to couple the simultaneous semi-supervised training of multiple categories and relations.",
        "Our experiments show that this coupling results in more accurate extractions.",
        "Based on our results reported here, we hypothesize that significant accuracy improvements in information extraction will be possible by coupling the training of hundreds or thousands of extractors."

      "text": [
        "It will be helpful to first explain our use of common terms.",
        "An ontology is a collection of unary and binary predicates, also called categories and relations, respectively.",
        "An instance of a category, or a category instance, is a noun phrase; an instance of a relation, or a relation instance, is a pair of noun phrases.",
        "Instances can be positive or negative with respect to a specific predicate, meaning that the predicate holds or does not hold for that particular instance.",
        "A promoted instance is an instance which our algorithm believes to be a positive instance of some predicate.",
        "Also associated with both categories and relations are patterns: strings of tokens with placeholders (e.g., 'game against argl' and 'argl, head coach of arg2').",
        "A promoted pattern is a pattern believed to be a high-probability indicator for some predicate.",
        "The challenge addressed by this work is to learn extractors to automatically populate the categories and relations of a specified ontology with high-confidence instances, starting from a few seed positive instances and patterns for each predicate and a large corpus of sentences annotated with part-of-speech (POS) tags.",
        "We focus on extracting facts that are stated multiple times in the corpus, which we can assess probabilistically using corpus statistics.",
        "We do not resolve strings to real-world entities – the problems of synonym resolution and disambiguation of strings that can refer to multiple entities are left for future work."

        "Work on multitask learning has demonstrated that supervised learning of multiple \"related\" functions together can yield higher accuracy than learning the functions separately (Thrun, 1996; Caruana, 1997).",
        "Semi-supervised multitask learning has been shown to increase accuracy when tasks are related, allowing one to use a prior that encourages similar parameters (Liu et al., 2008).",
        "Our work also involves semi-supervised training of multiple coupled functions, but differs in that we assume explicit prior knowledge of the precise way in which our multiple functions are related (e.g., that the values of the functions applied to the same input are mutually exclusive, or that one implies the other).",
        "In this paper, we focus on a 'bootstrapping' method for semi-supervised learning.",
        "Bootstrapping approaches start with a small number of labeled seed' examples, use those seed examples to train an initial model, then use this model to label some of the unlabeled data.",
        "The model is then retrained, using the original seed examples plus the self-labeled examples.",
        "This process iterates, gradually expanding the amount of labeled data.",
        "Such approaches have shown promise in applications such as web page classification (Blum and Mitchell, 1998), named entity classification (Collins and Singer, 1999), parsing (McClosky et al., 2006), and machine translation (Ueffing, 2006).",
        "Bootstrapping approaches to information extraction can yield impressive results with little initial human effort (Brin, 1998; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Paşca et al., 2006).",
        "However, after many iterations, they usually suffer from semantic drift, where errors in labeling accumulate and the learned concept drifts' from what was intended (Curran et al., 2007).",
        "Coupling the learning of predicates by using positive examples of one predicate as negative examples for others has been shown to help limit this drift (Riloffand Jones, 1999; Yangarber, 2003).",
        "Additionally, ensuring that relation arguments are of certain, expected types can help mitigate the promotion of incorrect instances (Pa§ca et al., 2006; Rosenfeld and Feldman, 2007).",
        "Our work builds on these ideas to couple the simultaneous bootstrapped training of multiple categories and multiple relations.",
        "Our approach to information extraction is based on using high precision contextual patterns (e.g., is mayor of argl ' suggests that argl is a city).",
        "An early pattern-based approach to information extraction acquired 'is a' relations from text using generic contextual patterns (Hearst, 1992).",
        "This approach was later scaled up to the web by Etzioni et al.",
        "(2005).",
        "Other research explores the task of 'open information extraction', where the predicates to be learned are not specified in advance (Shinyama and Sekine, 2006; Banko et al., 2007), but emerge instead from analysis of the data.",
        "In contrast, our approach relies strongly on knowledge in the ontology about the predicates to be learned, and relationships among them, in order to achieve high accuracy.",
        "Chang et al.",
        "(2007) present a framework for learning that optimizes the data likelihood plus constraint-based penalty terms than capture prior knowledge, and demonstrate it with semi-supervised learning of segmentation models.",
        "Constraints that capture domain knowledge guide bootstrap learning of a structured model by penalizing or disallowing violations of those constraints.",
        "While similar in spirit, our work differs in that we consider learning many models, rather than one structured model, and that we are consider a much larger scale application in a different domain."

        "The learning of these functions is coupled in two ways:",
        "1.",
        "Sharing among same-arity predicates according to logical relations",
        "Each predicate P in the ontology has a list of other same-arity predicates with which P is mutually exclusive, where mutuallyExclusive(P, P') = (P(arg1) == – P'(argl)) A (P'(argl) => – P(arg1)), and similarly for relations.",
        "These mutually exclusive relationships are used to carry out the following simple but crucial coupling: if predicate A is mutually exclusive with predicate B, A's positive instances and patterns become negative instances and negative patterns for B.",
        "For example, if city', having an instance Boston' and a pattern mayor of argl', is mutually exclusive with scientist', then 'Boston' and 'mayor of argV will become a negative instance and a negative pattern respectively for scientist.'",
        "Such negative instances and patterns provide negative evidence to constrain the bootstrapping process and forestall divergence.",
        "Some categories are declared to be a subset of one of the other categories being populated, where subset(P,P') = P(arg1) == P'(arg1), (e.g., 'athlete' is a subset of person').",
        "This prior knowledge is used to share instances and patterns of the subcategory (e.g., athlete') as positive instances and patterns for the super-category (e.g., person').",
        "The last type of prior knowledge we use to couple the learning of functions is type checking information which couples the learning of relations with categories.",
        "For example, the arguments of the ceoOf' relation are declared to be of the categories person' and company'.",
        "Our approach does not promote a pair of noun phrases as an instance of a relation unless the two noun phrases are classified as belonging to the correct argument types.",

        "Candidate extraction is performed for all predicates in a single pass through the corpus using the MapRe-duce framework.",

        "CBL extracts the words following the instance as a candidate pattern if they are verbs followed optionally by a noun phrase (e.g., 'arg1 broke the home run record'), or verbs followed by a preposition (e.g., arg1 said that').",
        "Relation Instances If a promoted relation pattern (e.g., 'arg1 is mayor of arg2') is found, a candidate relation instance is extracted if both placeholders are valid noun phrases, and if they obey the proper/common specifications for their categories.",

        "The seed instances were specified by a human, and the seed patterns were derived from the generic patterns of Hearst for each predicate (Hearst, 1992).",
        "Relations were started with similar numbers of seed instances, and no seed patterns (it is less obvious how to generate good seed patterns from relation names).",
        "Most predicates were declared as mutually exclusive with most others, except for special cases (e.g., hobby' and sport'; university' and sports team'; and has offices in' and 'headquartered in').",
        "Our text corpus was from a 200-million page web crawl.",
        "We parsed the HTML, filtered out non-English pages using a stop word ratio threshold, then filtered out web spam and adult content using a 'bad word' list.",
        "The pages were then segmented into sentences, tokenized, and tagged with parts-of-speech using the OpenNLP package.",
        "Finally, we filtered the sentences to eliminate those that were likely to be noisy and not useful for learning (e.g., sentences without a verb, without any lowercase words, with too many words that were all capital letters).",
        "This yielded a corpus of roughly 514-million sentences.",
        "We ran each configuration for 15 iterations.",
        "To evaluate the precision of promoted instances, we sampled 30 instances from the promoted set for each predicate in each configuration after 5,10, and 15 iterations, pooled together the samples for each predicate, and then judged their correctness.",
        "The judge did not know which run an instance was sampled from.",
        "We estimated the precision of the promoted instances from each run after 5, 10, and 15 iterations as the number of correct promoted instances divided by the number sampled.",
        "While samples of 30 instances do not produce tight confidence intervals around individual estimates, they are sufficient for testing for the effects in which we are interested.",
        "Table 1 shows the precision of each of the three algorithm configurations for each category and relation after 5, 10, and 15 iterations.",
        "As is apparent in this table, fully coupled training (Full) outperforms training when coupling is removed between categories and relations (NCR), and also when coupling is removed among predicates of the same ar-ity (NS).",
        "The net effect is substantial, as is apparent from the bottom row of Table 1, which shows that the precision of Full outperforms NS by 6% and NCR by 18% after the first 5 iterations, and by an even larger 20% and 22% after 15 iterations.",
        "This increasing gap in precision as iterations increase reflects the ability of coupled learning to constrain the system to reduce the otherwise common drift associated with self-trained classifiers.",
        "Using Student's paired t-test, we found that for categories, the difference in performance between Full and NS is statistically significant after 5, 10, and 15 iterations (p-value < 0.05).",
        "No significant difference was found between Full and NCR for categories, but this is not a surprise, because NCR still uses mutually exclusive and subset constraints.",
        "The same test finds that the differences between Full and NS are significant for relations after 15 iterations, and the differences between Full and NCR are significant after 5,10, and 15 iterations for relations.",
        "The worst-performing categories after 15 iterations of Full are 'country,' 'economic sector,' and 'hobby.'",
        "The Full configuration of CBL promoted 1637 instances for 'country,' far more than the number of correct answers.",
        "Many of these are general geographic regions like 'Bayfield Peninsula' and Baltic Republics.'",
        "In the hobby' case, promoting patterns like the types of arg1' led to the category drifting into a general list of plural common nouns.",
        "'Economic sector' drifted into academic fields like Behavioral Science' and Political Sciences.'",
        "We expect that the learning of these categories would be significantly better if there were even more categories being learned to provide additional negative evidence during the filtering and assessment steps of the algorithm.",
        "At this stage of development, obtaining high recall is not a priority because our intent is to create a continuously running and continuously improving system; it is our hope that high recall will come with time.",
        "However, to very roughly convey the completeness of the current results we show in Table 2 the average number of instances promoted for cate-",
        "Table 2: Average numbers of promoted category and relation instances and estimates of their precision for each configuration of CBL after 15 iterations.",
        "Figure 2: Extracted facts for two companies discovered by CBL Full.",
        "These two companies were extracted by the learned 'company' extractor, and the relations shown were extracted by learned relation extractors.",
        "gories and relations for each of the three configurations of CBL after 15 iterations.",
        "For categories, not sharing examples results in fewer negative examples during the filtering and assessment steps.",
        "This yields more promoted instances on average.",
        "For relations, not using type checking yields higher relative recall, but at a much lower level of precision.",
        "Figure 2 gives one view of the type of information extracted by the collection of learned category and relation classifiers.",
        "Note the initial seed examples provided to CBL did not include information about either company or any of these relation instances.",
        "To estimate the capacity of our algorithm to contribute additional facts to publicly available semantic resources, we compared the complete lists of instances promoted during the Full 15 iteration run for certain categories to corresponding lists in the Freebase database (Metaweb Technologies, 2009).",
        "Excluding the categories that did not have a directly corresponding Freebase list, we computed for each category: Precision x \\CBLInstances\\ – \\Matches\\, where Precision is the estimated precision from our random sample of 30 instances, \\CBLInstances\\ is the total number of instances promoted for that category, and \\Matches\\ is the",

        "number of promoted instances that had an exact match in Freebase.",
        "While exact matches may underestimate the number of matches, it should be noted that rather than make definitive claims, our intent here is simply to give rough estimates, which are shown in Table 3.",
        "These approximate numbers indicate a potential to use CBL to extend existing semantic resources like Freebase."
