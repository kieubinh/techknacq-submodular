        "Or could it actually hurt performance, in which case you might be better off with supervised learning (SL)?",
        "A large number of SSL algorithms have been developed in recent years that allow one to improve performance with unlabeled data, in tasks such as text classification, sequence labeling, and parsing (Zhu, 2005; Chapelle et al., 2006; Brefeld and Scheffer, 2006).",
        "However, many of them are tested on \"SSL-friendly\" datasets, such as \"two moons,\" USPS, and MNIST.",
        "Furthermore, the algorithms' parameters are often chosen based on test set performance or manually set based on heuristics and researcher experience.",
        "These issues create practical concerns for deploying SSL in the real world.",
        "We note that (Chapelle et al., 2006)'s benchmark chapter explores these issues to some extent by comparing several SSL methods on several real and artificial datasets.",
        "The authors reach the conclusions that parameter tuning is difficult with little labeled data and that no method is universally superior.",
        "We reexamine these issues in the context of NLP tasks and offer a simple attempt at overcoming these roadblocks to practical application of SSL.",
        "The contributions of this paper include:",
        "• We present a medium-scale empirical study comparing SL to two popular SSL algorithms on eight less-familiar tasks using three performance metrics.",
        "Importantly, we tune parameters realistically based on cross validation (CV), as a practitioner would do in reality.",
        "• We show that, under such realistic conditions, each of the SSL algorithms can be worse than SL on some datasets.",
        "• However, this can be prevented.",
        "We show that CV can be used to select SL/SSL to achieve agnostic SSL, whose performance is almost always no worse than SL.",
        "Traditionally, CV is",
        "often dismissed as unreliable for SSL because of the small labeled dataset size.",
        "But we show that CV is effective when using accuracy as an optimization criterion, even when the labeled dataset size is as small as 10.",

        "We ran many trials per algorithm (using different datasets, l, and metrics).",
        "Each trial involved training hundreds of models using different parameter configurations repeated across five folds, and then training once more using the selected parameters.",
        "In the end, we trained a grand total of 794,880 individual models to produce the results in Table 2.",
        "Through distributed computing on approximately 50 machines in parallel, we were able to run all these experiments in less than a week, while using roughly three months worth of CPU time."

        "We have explored \"realistic SSL,\" where all parameters are tuned via 5-fold cross validation, to simulate a real-world experience of trying to use unlabeled data in a novel NLP task.",
        "Our medium-scale empirical study of SVM, S3VM, and MR revealed that no algorithm is always superior, and furthermore that there are cases in which each SSL algorithm we examined can perform worse than SVM (in some cases significantly worse across 10 trials).",
        "To mitigate such risks, we proposed a simple meta-level procedure that selects one of the three models based on tuning performance.",
        "While cross validation is often dismissed for model selection in SSL due to a lack of labeled data, this Best Tuning approach proves effective in helping to ensure that incorporating unla-beled data does not hurt performance.",
        "Interestingly, this works well only when optimizing accuracy during tuning.",
        "For future work, we plan to extend this study to include additional datasets, algorithms, and tuning criteria.",
        "We also plan to develop more sophisticated techniques for choosing which SL/SSL algorithm to use in practice."
