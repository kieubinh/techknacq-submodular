        "Named entity recognition (NER) or tagging is the task of finding names such as organizations, persons, locations, etc.",
        "in text.",
        "Since whether or not a word is a name and the entity type of a name are determined mostly by the context of the word as well as by the entity type of its neighbors, NER is often posed as a sequence classification problem and solved by methods such as hidden Markov models (HMM) and conditional random fields (CRF).",
        "Automatically tagging named entities (NE) with high precision and recall requires a large amount of hand-annotated data, which is expensive to obtain.",
        "This problem presents itself time and again because tagging the same NEs in different domains usually requires different labeled data.",
        "However, in most domains one often has access to large amounts of unlabeled text.",
        "This fact motivates semi-supervised approaches for NER.",
        "Semi-supervised learning involves the utilization of unlabeled data to mitigate the effect of insufficient labeled data on classifier accuracy.",
        "One variety of semi-supervised learning essentially attempts to automatically generate high-quality training data from an unlabeled corpus.",
        "Algorithms such as co-training (Blum and Mitchell, 1998)(Collins and Singer, 1999)(Pierce and Cardie, 2001) and the Yarowsky algorithm (Yarowsky, 1995) make assumptions about the data that permit such an approach.",
        "The main requirement for the automatically generated training data in addition to high accuracy, is that it covers regions in the feature space with low probability density.",
        "Furthermore, it is necessary that all the classes are represented according to their prior probabilities in every region in the feature space.",
        "One approach to achieve these goals is to select unlabeled data that has been classified with low confidence by the classifier trained on the original training data, but whose labels are known with high precision from independent evidence.",
        "Here independence means that the high-precision decision rule that classifies these low confidence instances uses information that is independent of the features used by the classifier.",
        "We propose two ways of obtaining such independent evidence for NER.",
        "The first is based on the fact that multiple mentions of capitalized tokens are likely to have the same label and occur in independently chosen contexts.",
        "We call this the multi-mention property.",
        "The second is based on the fact that entities such as organizations, persons, etc., have context that is highly indicative of the class, yet is independent of the other context (e.g. company suffixes like Inc., Co., etc., person titles like Mr., CEO, etc.).",
        "We call such context high precision independent context.",
        "Let us first look at two examples.",
        "Example 1:",
        "1) said Harry You, CEO of HearingPoint....",
        "2) For this year's second quarter, You said the company's...",
        "The classifier tags \"Harry You\" as person (PER) correctly since its context (said, CEO) makes it an obvious name.",
        "However, in the second sentence, the classifier fails to tag \"You\" as a person since \"You\" is usually a stopword.",
        "The second sentence is exactly the type of data needed in the training set.",
        "Example 2:",
        "(1) Medtronic Inc 4Qprofits rise 10percent...",
        "(2) Medtronic 4Q profits rise 10percent...",
        "The classifier tags \"Medtronic\" correctly in the first sentence because of the company suffix \"Inc\" while it fails to tag \"Medtronic\" in the second sentence since \"4Q profits\" is a new pattern and \"Medtronic\" is unseen in the training data.",
        "Thus the second sentence is what we need in the training set.",
        "The two examples have one thing in common.",
        "In both cases, the second sentence has a new pattern and incorrect labels, which can be fixed by using either multi-mention or high-precision context from the first sentence.",
        "We actually artificially construct the second sentence to be added to the training set in Example 2 although only the first sentence exists in the unlabeled corpus.",
        "By leveraging such independent evidence, our algorithm can automatically extract high-accuracy and non-redundant data for training, and thus obtain an improved model for NER.",
        "Specifically, our algorithm starts with a model trained with a small amount of gold data (manually tagged data).",
        "This model is then used to extract high-confidence data, which is then used to discover low-confidence data by using other independent features.",
        "These low-confidence data are then added to the training data to retrain the model.",
        "The whole process repeats until no significant improvement can be achieved.",
        "Our experiments show that the algorithm is not only much better than the initial model, but also better than the supervised learning when a large amount of gold data are available.",
        "Especially, even when the domain from which the original training data is sampled is different from the domain of the testing data, our algorithm still provides significant gains in classification accuracy."

        "This process is iterated by interchanging the views.",
        "The main reason that co-training works is that, because of the class-conditional independence assumptions, the high-confidence data from one view, in addition to being highly precise, is unbiased when added to the training set for the other view.",

        "Comparing Table 7 to Table 6, we can see that with the same training data, using multi-mention property helps improve classification results.",
        "However, this improvement is less than that obtained by using this property to extract training data thus improve the model itself.",
        "(For a fair comparison, the model used in the semi-supervised algorithm in Table 6 only uses multi-mention property to extract data.)",
        "Our last experiment is to test how this method can be used when the initial gold data and the testing data are from different domains.",
        "We use the CoNLL 2003 English NER (Sang and Meulder, 2003) training set as the initial training data, and automatically extract training data from the TF financial news corpus.",
        "The CoNLL data is a collection of news wire documents from the Reuters Corpus, while TF data includes financial-related news only.",
        "Table 8 illustrates the results.",

        "This indicates that data from different domains can adversely affect NER accuracy for supervised learning.",
        "However, the semi-supervised algorithm achieves reasonably high accuracy.",
        "For LOC, ORG, and PER, the recall increases 16, 20.3, and 4.7 respectively, and the precision increases 4.5, 5.5, and 4.7 respectively.",
