        "an initial acoustic model using a limited amount of manually transcribed data (normally in a scale from 30 minutes to several hours), and then the initial model is used to transcribe a relatively large amount of untranscribed data.",
        "Only the transcriptions with high confidence measures (Wessel and Ney, 2005; L. Wang and Woodland, 2007) or high agreement with closed captions (Lamel et al., 2002) are selected to augment the manually transcribed data, and new acoustic models are trained on the augmented data set.",
        "The general procedure described above exactly lies in the context of semi-supervised learning problems and can be categorized as a self-training algorithm.",
        "Self-training is probably the simplest semi-supervised learning method, but it is also flexible to be applied to complex classifiers such as speech recognition systems.",
        "This may be the reason why little work has been done on exploiting other semi-supervised learning methods in speech recognition.",
        "Though not incorporated to speech recognizers yet, there has been some work on semi-supervised learning of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) for sequential classification.",
        "Inoue and Ueda (2003) treated the unknown class labels of the unlabeled data as hidden variables and used the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to optimize the joint likelihood of labeled and unlabeled data.",
        "Recently Ji et al.",
        "(2009) applied a homotopy method to select the optimal weight to balance between the log likelihood of labeled and unlabeled data when training HMMs.",
        "Besides generative training of acoustic models, discriminative training is another popular paradigm in the area of speech recognition, but only when the transcriptions are available.",
        "Wang and Woodland (2007) used the self-training method to augment the training set for discriminative training.",
        "Huang and Hasegawa-Johnson (2008) investigated another use of discriminative information from labeled data by replacing the likelihood of labeled data with the class posterior probability of labeled data in the semi-supervised training objective for Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), resulting in a hybrid discriminative/generative objective function.",
        "Their experimental results in binary phonetic classification showed significant improvement in classification accuracy when labeled data are scarce.",
        "A similar strategy called \"'multi-conditional learning\"' was presented in (Druck et al., 2007) applied to Markov Random Field models for text classification tasks, with the difference that the likelihood of labeled data is also included in the objective.",
        "The hybrid discriminative/generative objective function can be interpreted as having an extra regularization term, the likelihood of unlabeled data, in the discriminative training criterion for labeled data.",
        "However, both methods in (Huang and Hasegawa-Johnson, 2008) and (Druck et al., 2007) encountered the same issue about determining the weights for labeled and un-labeled part in the objective function and chose to use a development set to select the optimal weight.",
        "This paper provides an experimental analysis on the effect of the weight.",
        "With the ultimate goal of applying semi-supervised learning in speech recognition, this paper investigates the learning capability of algorithms within Gaussian Mixture Models because GMM is the basic model inside a HMM, therefore 1) the update equations derived for the parameters of GMM can be conveniently extended to HMM for speech recognition.",
        "2) GMM can serve as an initial point to help us understand more details about the semi-supervised learning process of spectral features.",
        "This paper makes the following contribution:",

        "More specifically, we divided the frames for each phone into three regions with 3-4-3 proportion and calculated the PLP average over each region.",
        "Three averages plus the log duration of that phone gave a 40-dimensional (13 x 3 + 1) measurement vector.",

        "There are three classes of data.",
        "Each token is described by 40 real attributes, and the class distribution is even.",
        "For waveform, because the class labels are equally distributed, we simply assigned equal number of mixtures for each class.",
        "For TIMIT, the phone classes are unevenly distributed, so we assigned variable number of Gaussian mixtures for each class by controlling the averaged data counts per mixture.",
        "For all experiments, the initial model is an MLE model trained with labeled data only.",
        "To construct a mixed labeled/unlabeled data set, the original training set were randomly divided into the labeled and unlabeled sets with desired ratio, and the class labels in the unlabeled set are assumed to be unknown.",
        "To avoid that the classifier performance may vary with particular portions of data, we ran five folds for every experiment, each fold corresponding to different division of training data into labeled and unlabeled set, and took the averaged performance.",
        "This section analyzes the learning capability of semi-supervised learning algorithms for different model complexities, that is, the number of mixtures for Gaussian mixture model.",
        "In this experiment, the sizes of labeled and unlabeled set are fixed (|DlI : |DU| = 1 : 10 and the averaged token counts per class is around 140 for both data sets), as we varied the total number of mixtures and evaluated the updated model by its classification accuracy.",
        "For waveform, number of mixtures was set from 2 to 7; for TIMIT, because the number of mixtures per class is determined by the averaged data counts per mixture c, we set c to 25, 20 and 15 as the higher c gives less number of mixtures in total.",

        "Regardless of the dataset and the training objective type on labeled data, there are some general properties about the semi-supervised learning algorithms studied in this work.",
        "First, while limited amount of labeled data can at most train models of lower complexity well, the addition of unlabeled data makes the updated models of higher complexity much improved and sometimes perform better than less complex models.",
        "Second, the amount of unlabeled data in our semi-supervised framework generally follows 'the-more-the-better' principle; there is a trend that more unlabeled data results in more improvement in classification accuracy over the supervised model.",
        "We also found that the objective type on labeled data has little impact on the updated model, in the sense that hybrid and purely generative objectives behave similarly in learning capability.",
        "The observation that the best a occurs after the MMI criterion begins to decrease supports the fact that the criterion on labeled data contributes less than the criterion on unlabeled data.",
        "This observation is also helpful in determining the search range for the best a on the development set by locating the critical value of the objective as a start point to perform search.",
        "The unified training objective method has a nice convergence property which self-training methods can not guarantee.",
        "The next step is to extend the similar framework to speech recognition task where HMMs are trained and phone boundaries are segmented.",
        "It would be interesting to compare it with self-training methods in different aspects (e.g. performance, reliability, stability and computational efficiency)."
