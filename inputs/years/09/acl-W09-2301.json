        "The dominance of traditional phrase-based statistical machine translation (PBSMT) models (Koehn et al., 2003) has recently been challenged by the development and improvement of a number of new models that explicity take into account the syntax of the sentences being translated.",
        "One simple approach is to limit the phrases learned by a standard",
        "PBSMT translation model to only those contiguous sequences of words that additionally correspond to constituents in a syntactic parse tree.",
        "However, a total reliance on such syntax-based phrases has been shown to be detrimental to translation quality, as the space of phrase segmentation of a parallel sentence is heavily constrained by both the source-side and target-side tree structures.",
        "Noting that the number of phrase pairs extracted from a corpus is reduced by around 80% when they are required to correspond to syntactic constituents, Koehn et al.",
        "(2003) observed that many non-constituent phrase pairs that would not be included in a syntax-only model are in fact extremely important to system performance.",
        "Since then, researchers have explored effective ways for combining phrase pairs derived from syntax-aware methods with those extracted from more traditional PBSMT.",
        "Briefly stated, the goal is to retain the high level of coverage provided by non-syntactic PBSMT phrases while simultaneously incorporating and exploiting specific syntactic knowledge.",
        "Zollmann and Venugopal (2006) overcome the restrictiveness of the syntax-only model by starting with a complete set of phrases as produced by traditional PBSMT heuristics, then annotating the target side of each phrasal entry with the label of the constituent node in the target-side parse tree that subsumes the span.",
        "They then introduce new constituent labels to handle the cases where the phrasal entries do not exactly correspond to the syntactic constituents.",
        "Liu et al.",
        "(2006) also add non-syntactic PBSMT phrases into their tree-to-string translation system.",
        "Working from the other direction, Marton and Resnik (2008) extend a hierarchical PBSMT system with a number of features to prefer or dis-prefer certain types of syntactic phrases in different contexts.",
        "Restructuring the parse trees to ease their restrictiveness is another recent approach: in particular, Wang et al.",
        "(2007) binarize source-side parse trees in order to provide phrase pair coverage for phrases that are partially syntactic.",
        "Tinsley et al.",
        "(2007) showed an improvement over a PBSMT baseline on four tasks in bidirectional German-English and Spanish-English translation by incorporating syntactic phrases derived from parallel trees into the PBSMT translation model.",
        "They first word align and extract phrases from a parallel corpus using the open-source Moses PBSMT toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007), which provides a baseline SMT system.",
        "Then, both sides of the parallel corpus are parsed with independent automatic parsers, subtrees from the resulting parallel treebank are aligned, and an additional set of phrases (with each phrase corresponding to a syntactic constituent in the parse tree) is extracted.",
        "The authors report statistically significant improvements in translation quality, as measured by a variety of automatic metrics, when the two types of phrases are combined in the Moses decoder.",
        "Our approach in this paper is structurally similar to that of Tinsley et al.",
        "(2007), but we extend or modify it in a number of key ways.",
        "First, we extract both non-syntactic PBSMT and syntax-driven phrases from a parallel corpus that is two orders of magnitude larger, making our system competitive in size to state-of-the-art SMT systems elsewhere.",
        "Second, we apply a different algorithm for subtree alignment, proposed by Lavie et al.",
        "(2008), which proceeds bottom-up from existing statistical word alignments, rather than inducing them top-down from lexical alignment probabilities.",
        "Third, in addition to straightforwardly combining syntax-derived phrases with traditional PBSMT phrases, we demonstrate a new combination technique that removes PBSMT phrases whose source-language strings are already covered by a syntax-derived phrase.",
        "This new syntax-prioritized technique results in a 61% reduction in the size of the combined phrase table with only a minimal decrease in automatic translation metric scores.",
        "Finally, and crucially, we carry out the joint decoding over both syntactic and non-syntactic phrase pairs in a syntax-aware MT system, which allows a syntactic grammar to be put in place on top of the phrase pairs to carry out linguistically motivated reordering, hierarchical decoding, and other operations.",
        "After this introduction, we first describe the base MT system we used, its formalism for specifying translation rules, and the method for extracting syntax-derived phrase pairs from a parallel corpus (Section 2).",
        "Section 3 gives the two methods for combining PBSMT phrases with our syntactic phrases, and introduces our first steps with including a grammar in the syntax-based translation framework.",
        "The results of our experiments are described in Section 4 and are further discussed in Section 5.",
        "Finally, Section 6 offers some conclusions and directions for future work."

        "The base MT system used for our experiments is the statistical transfer (\"Stat-XFER\") framework (Lavie, 2008).",
        "The core of the framework is a transfer engine using two language-pair-dependent resources: a grammar of weighted synchronous context-free rules, and a probabilistic bilingual lexicon.",
        "Once the resources have been provided, the Stat-XFER framework carries out translation in a two-stage process, first applying the lexicon and grammar to synchronously parse an input sentence, then running a monotonic decoder over the resulting lattice of scored translation pieces assembled during parsing to produce a final string output.",
        "Reordering is applied only in the first stage, driven by the syntactic grammar; the second-stage monotonic decoder only assembles translation fragments into complete hypotheses.",
        "Each Stat-XFER bilingual lexicon entry has a synchronous context-free grammar (SCFG) expression of the source-and target-language production rules, shown in abbreviated format below, where cs and ctrepresent source-and target-side syntactic category labels and ws and wt represent source-and targetside word or phrase strings.",
        "Each entry in the lexicon is assigned a pair of rule scores (rt\\s and rs\\t) based on cs, ws, ct, and wtl.",
        "The rt|s score is a maximum-likelihood estimate of the distribution of target-language translations and source-and target-language syntactic categories given the source string (Equation 1); this is similar to the usual \"target-given-source\" phrasal probability in standard SMT systems.",
        "The rs|t score is similar, but calculated in the reverse direction to give a source-given-target probability (Equation 2).",
        "The add-one smoothing in the denominators counteracts overestimation of the rule scores of lexical entries with very infrequent source or target sides.",
        "Stat-XFER grammar rules have a similar form, shown below via an example.",
        "The SCFG backbone may include lexicalized items, as above, as well as non-terminals and pre-terminals from the grammar.",
        "Constituent alignment information, shown here as co-indexes on the nonterminals, specifies one-to-one correspondences between source-language and target-language constituents on the right-hand side of the SCFG rule.",
        "Rule scores rt|s and rs|t for grammar rules, if they are learned from data, are calculated in the same way as the scores for lexical entries.",
        "In this section, we briefly summarize the automatic resource extraction approach described by Lavie et al.",
        "(2008) and recently extended by Ambati and Lavie (2008), which we use here, specifically as applied to the extraction of syntax-based phrase pairs for the bilingual lexicon.",
        "The grammar and lexicon are extracted from a large parallel corpus that has been statistically word-aligned and independently parsed on both sides with automatic parsers.",
        "Word-level entries for the bilingual lexicon are directly taken from the word alignments; corresponding syntactic categories for the left-hand side of the SCFG rules are obtained from the preterminal nodes of the parse trees.",
        "Phraselevel entries for the lexicon are based on node-to-node alignments in the parallel parse trees.",
        "In the straightforward \"tree-to-tree\" scenario, a given node ns in one parse tree S will be aligned to a node ntin the other parse tree T if the words in the yield of ns are all either aligned to words within the yield of nt or have no alignment at all.",
        "If there are multiple nodes nt satisfying this constraint, the node in the tree closest to the leaves is selected.",
        "Each aligned node pair (ns,nt) produces a phrase-level entry in the lexicon, where the left-hand sides of the SCFG rule are the labels of ns and nt, and the right-hand sides are the yields of those two nodes in their respective trees.",
        "In the expanded \"tree-to-tree-string\" configuration, if no suitable node nt exists, a new node n's is introduced into T as a projection of ns, spanning the yield of the words in T aligned to the yield of ns.",
        "At the end of the extraction process in either case, the entry counts are collected and scored in the manner described in Section 2.1."

        "PBSMT phrases whose source-side strings are already covered by an entry from the syntactic phrase table are removed; the remaining PBSMT phrases are combined as in the direct combination method above.",
        "The effect on the overall system is to trust the syntactic phrase pairs in the cases where they exist, supplementing with PBSMT phrase pairs for non-constituents.",

        "In the second variant (\"frag\"), the phrase labels in the large nonterminal sets used by our source-and target-side parsers are mapped down to a smaller set of 19 labels that we use for both sides.",

        "The translation pieces be informed and I am talking about, though they exist in the baseline PBSMT phrase table, do not make it into the top-best translation in the PBSMT-only scenario because of its high ambiguity factor.",
        "Although our current experiments do not show a significant increase in automatic metric scores with the addition of a small grammar, we can see the potential power of grammar in examining further sentences from the output.",
        "For example, in Figure 4, standard PBSMT phrase extraction is able to pick up the adjective-noun reordering when translating from intervention forte to decisive intervention.",
        "However, in this sentence we have an adjective phrase following the noun, and there is no pre-extracted phrase pair for the entire constituent, so our system built from only PBSMT phrases produces the incorrect noun phrase translation the decisive intervention and substantial.",
        "Our nine-rule grammar, specifically targeted for this scenario, is able to correct the structure of the sentence by applying two rules to produce the strong and substantial speech.",
        "Analysis of the entire test set further suggests that even our small grammar produces correct and precise output across all phrase table configurations, although the total number of applications of the nine rules remains low.",
        "There are 590 rule applications in the one-best output on the test set in the syntax-only configuration, 472 applications in the syntax-prioritized configuration, and 216 applications in the direct combination.",
        "In each configuration, we manually inspected all rule applications in the first 200 sentences and classified them as correctly reordering words in the English output (\"good\"), incorrectly reordering (\"bad\"), or \"null.\"",
        "This last category denotes applications of monotonic structure-building rules that did not feed into a higher-level reordering rule.",
        "The results of this analysis are shown in Figure 5.",
        "Overall, we find that the grammar is 97% accurate in its applications, making helpful reordering changes 88% of the time.",
        "Given the preceding analysis – and the fact that our inclusion of a lexicalized reordering model in",
        "Moses resulted in automatic metric gains of only 0.0051 BLEU, 0.0029 METEOR, and 0.29 TER – we believe that further experiments with a much larger syntactic grammar will lead to a more significant improvement in automatic metric scores and translation quality."

        "We have extended and applied an algorithm for combining syntax-based phrases from a parallel parsed corpus with non-syntactic phrases from phrase-based SMT within the context of a statistical syntax-based translation framework.",
        "Using a much larger corpus than has previously been employed for this approach, we produce jointly decoded output statistically equivalent to a monotonic decoding using standard PBSMT phrase-extraction heuristics, retaining syntactic information and setting the stage for further improvements by incorporating a syntactic grammar into the translation framework.",
        "Our preliminary nine-rule grammar, targeted for two specific English-French linguistic phenomena, already shows promise in performing linguistically motivated reordering that cannot be captured formally by a standard PBSMT model.",
        "We present a syntax-prioritized method of combining phrase types into a single phrase table by always selecting a syntax-based phrase pair when one is available for a given source string.",
        "This new combination style reduces the size ofthe resulting phrase table and total decoding time by 61%, with only a minor degradation in MT performance.",
        "We suggest that this is because the syntax-derived phrases, when they can be extracted, are a much more precise method of describing correct translational equivalences.",
        "As yet, we have made only minimal use of the Stat-XFER framework's grammar capabilities.",
        "In our experiments, the full tree-to-tree-string ruleextraction process of Ambati and Lavie (2008) produces more than 2 million unique SCFG rules when applied to a corpus the size of the Europarl.",
        "Not only is translating with such a large set computationally intractable, but empirically nearly 90% of the rules were observed only once in the parallel parsed corpus, making it difficult to separate rare but correct rules from those due to noise in the parses and word alignments.",
        "With the view of moving beyond our manually written nine-rule grammar, but wanting to get only the most useful rules from the entire automatically extracted set, we are currently investigating methods for automatic scoring or selection of a reasonable number of grammar rules for a particular language pair.",
        "Given that the majority of our phrase pairs, even in the syntax-prioritized combination, are non-syntactic, we have also conducted preliminary experiments with \"syntactifying\" them so that they may also be used by grammar rules to produce larger translation fragments.",
        "The experiments in this paper used the grow-diag-final heuristic for word alignment combination because it has been shown to provide the highest precision on the subtree node alignment method by which we extract syntax-based phrase pairs (Lavie et al., 2008).",
        "However, this is a trade-off that sacrifices some amount of recall.",
        "Experimenting with different symmetric alignment heuristics may lead to a more optimal configuration for phrase-pair extraction or combination with PBSMT phrases.",
        "We also suspect that the choice of source-and target-side parsers plays a significant role in the number and nature of phrase pairs we extract; to address this, we are in the process of retrying our line of experiments using the Berkeley parser (Petrov and Klein, 2007) for English, French, or both."
