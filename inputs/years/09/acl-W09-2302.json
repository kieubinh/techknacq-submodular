        "We consider that there are two important needs in aligning parallel sentences written in very different languages such as Japanese and English.",
        "One is to adopt structural or dependency analysis into the alignment process to overcome the difference in word order.",
        "The other is that the method needs to have the capability of generating phrase correspondences, that is, one-to-many or many-to-many word correspondences.",
        "Most existing alignment methods simply consider a sentence as a sequence of words (Brown et al., 1993), and generate phrase correspondences using heuristic rules (Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "Some studies incorporate structural information into the alignment process after this simple word alignment (Quirk et al., 2005; Cowan et al., 2006).",
        "However, this is not sufficient because the basic word alignment itself is not good.",
        "On the other hand, a few models have been proposed which use structural information from the beginning of the alignment process.",

        "These methods reorder, insert or delete sub-trees on one side to reproduce the other side, but the constraints of using syntactic information is often too rigid.",
        "Yamada and Knight flattened the trees by collapsing nodes.",
        "Gildea cloned sub-trees to deal with the problem.",
        "Cherry and Lin (2003) proposed a model which uses a source side dependency tree structure and constructs a discriminative model.",
        "However, there is the defect that its alignment unit is a word, so it can only find one-to-one alignments.",
        "Nakazawa and Kurohashi (2008) also proposed a model focusing on the dependency relations.",
        "Their model has the constraint that content words can only correspond to content words on the other side, and the same applies for function words.",
        "This sometimes leads to an incorrect alignment.",
        "We have removed this constraint to make more flexible alignments possible.",
        "Moreover, in their model, some function words are brought together, and thus they cannot handle the situation where each function word corresponds to a different part.",
        "The smallest unit of our model is a single word, which should solve this problem.",
        "In this paper, we propose a novel phrase alignment method which models word or phrase dependency relations in dependency tree structures of source and target languages.",
        "For a pair of correspondences which has a parent-child relation on one side, the dependency relation on the other side is defined as the relation between the two correspondences.",
        "It is a kind of tree-based reordering model, and can capture non-local reorderings which sequential word-based models often cannot handle properly.",
        "The model is also capable of estimating phrase correspondences automatically without heuristic rules.",

        "The root of a tree is placed at the extreme left and words are placed from top to bottom.",
        "This section outlines our proposed model in comparison to the IBM models, which are the conventional statistical alignment models.",
        "In the IBM models (Brown et al., 1993), the best alignment a between a given source sentence f and its target sentence e is acquired by the following equation:",
        "where p(f |e, a) is called lexicon probability and p(a|e) is called alignment probability.",
        "Suppose f consists of n words /i, /2,/n, and e consists of m words ei, e2,em and a NULL word (eo).",
        "The alignment mapping a consists of associations j – i = a,j from source position j to target position i = aj.",

        "where Aj is a relative position of words in the source side which corresponds to ej.",
        "Equation 2 is the product of the word translation probabilities, and Equation 3 is the product of relative position probabilities.",
        "In the proposed model, we refine the IBM models in three ways.",
        "First, as for Equation 2, we consider phrases instead of words.",
        "Second, as for Equation 3, we consider dependencies of words instead of their positions in a sentence.",
        "Finally, the proposed model can find the best alignment a by not using f-to-e alone, but simultaneously with e-to-f. That is, Equation 1 is modified as follows:",
        "Since our model regards a phrase as a basic unit, the above formula is calculated in a straightforward way.",
        "In contrast, the IBM models can consider a many-to-one alignment by combining one-to-one alignments, but they cannot consider a one-to-many or many-to-many alignment.",
        "The models are estimated by EM-like algorithm which is very similar to (Liang et al., 2006).",
        "The important difference is that we are using tree structures.",
        "We maximize the data likelihood:",
        "In the E-step, we compute the posterior distribution of the alignments with the current parameter 6:",
        "Note that p(e) and p(f) have no effect on maximization, and pe/(a, f |e; 6e/) and p/e(a, e|f; 6/e) appeared in Equation 1 or Equation 4.",

        "We call this probability for the link between Fj and Ej phrase alignment probability.",
        "The upper part of Table 1 shows phrase alignment probabilities for the alignment in Figure 1.",
        "The reordering model in the IBM Models is defined on the relative position between an alignment and its previous alignment, as shown in Equation 3.",
        "Our model, on the other hand, considers dependencies of words instead of positional relations.",
        "this tendency into consideration.",

        "There are some special cases for rel.",
        "When Fs(c) and Fs(p) are the same, that is, fc and fp belong to the same phrase, rel is represented as 'SAME'.",
        "When fp is aligned to NULL, fc is aligned to NULL, and both of them are aligned to NULL, rel is represented as 'NULL_p', 'NULL.c', and 'NULL.b', respectively.",
        "The lower part of Table 1 shows dependency relation probabilities corresponding to Figure 1.",
        "Actually, we extend the dependency relation probability to consider a wider relation, i.e, the grandparent-child relation, as follows:",
        "where Ds-gc denotes a set of grandparent-child word pairs in the source sentence.",
        "We first create an initial alignment based on the phrase translation probability without considering the dependency relation probabilities.",
        "For all the combinations of possible phrases (including NULL), phrase alignment probabilities are calculated (equation 9).",
        "Correspondences are adopted one by one in descending order of geometric mean of the phrase alignment probabilities.",
        "All the words should be aligned only once, that is, the correspondences are adopted exclusively.",
        "Generation of possible phrases is explained in Section 3.2.3.",
        "To find better alignments, the initial alignment is gradually revised with a hill-climbing algorithm.",
        "We use four kinds of revising operations:",
        "Swap: Focusing on any two correspondences, the partners are swapped.",
        "In the first step in Figure2, the correspondences \"77 <-> photo-gate\" and \"y ^ h h <-> photodetector\" are swapped to \"77 <-> photodetector\" and h h <-> photogate\".",
        "Extend: Focusing on one correspondence, the source or target phrase is extended to include its neighboring (parent or child) NULL-aligned word.",
        "Add: A new correspondence is added between a source word and a target word both of which are aligned to NULL.",
        "Reject: A correspondence is rejected and the source and target phrase are aligned to NULL.",
        "Figure 2 shows an illustrative example of hill climbing.",
        "The alignment is revised only if the alignment probability gets increased.",

        "As a by-product of hill-climbing, pseudo n-best alignment can be acquired.",
        "It is used in collecting fractional counts.",
        "If there is a word which is aligned to NULL in the best approximate alignment, a new possible phrase is generated by merging the word into a neighboring phrase which is not aligned to NULL.",

        "is treated as being included in the correspondence between \"§ 77\" and \"photodetector\" and the correspondence between \"K \" and \"for\".",

        "However, if we use this in our model, the phrase translation probability of the new possible phrase can become extremely high (often it becomes 1).",

        "In this paper, we have proposed a linguistically-motivated probabilistic phrase alignment model based on dependency tree structures.",

        "Experimental results show that the word sequential model does not work well for linguistically different language pairs, and this can be resolved by using syntactic information.",
        "We have conducted the experiments only on Japanese-English corpora.",
        "To firmly support our claim that syntactic information is important, it is necessary to do more investigation on other language pairs.",
        "Most frequent alignment errors are derived from parsing errors.",
        "Because our method depends heavily on structural information, parsing errors easily make the alignment accuracy worse.",
        "Although the parsing accuracy is high in general for both Japanese and English, it sometimes outputs incorrect dependency structures because technical or unknown words often appears in scientific papers.",
        "This problem could be resolved by introducing parsing probabilities into our model using parsing tools which can output n-best parsing with their parsing probabilities.",
        "This will not only improve the alignment accuracy, it will allow revision of the parsing result.",
