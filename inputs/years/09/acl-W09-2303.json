        "It is for all three reasons, i.e. translation, induction from alignment structures and induction of alignment structures, important that the synchronous grammars are expressive enough to induce all the alignment structures found in hand-aligned gold standard parallel corpora (Wellington et al., 2006).",
        "Such alignments are supposed to reflect the structure of translations, typically contain fewer errors and are used to evaluate automatically induced alignments.",

        "(2006) and Chiang (2007) are not expressive enough to do that.",
        "The synchronous grammars used in these systems are, formally, synchronous context-free grammars of rank two (2-SCFGs), or equivalently (normal form) inversion transduction grammars (ITGs).The notion of rank is defined as the maximum number of constituents aligned by a production rule, i.e. the maximum number of distinct indeces.",

        "(2004), alignment structures with this property are said to be closed under transitivity.",
        "An alignment structure is simply written as a sequence of alignments, e.g. {wi\\w'k,wi\\w[,wj\\w'k,wj\\w'k), or, alternatively, as sequences of (possibly discontinuous) translation units, e.g. (wiwj-\\w'kw[).",
        "A translation unit induced by a synchronous grammar is a set of terminals that are recognized or generated simultaneously.",

        "Since no such distinction is assumed below, the classical definition is used.",
        "We introduce also the notion of translation unit error rate (TUER), which is defined as where Gjj are the translation units in the gold standard, and Sj the translation units produced by the system.",
        "In other words, what is measured is a system's ability to predict translation units relative to the Gold standard, not just its ability to predict alignments.",

        "This idea has to the best of our knowledge not been explored in the context of syntax-based machine translation.",
        "• It is also possible to design formalisms for syntax-based machine translation that induce all possible alignment structures and maintain a reasonable parsing complexity (O(\\G\\n)), e.g. Sogaard (2008b); but as noted by Sogaard (2008a) the gain in expressivity is at the expense of the complexity of learning.",
