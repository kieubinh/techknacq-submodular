        "While human evaluation of machine translation output remains the most reliable method to assess translation quality, it is a costly and time consuming process.",
        "The development of automatic machine translation evaluation metrics enables the rapid assessment of system output.",
        "By providing immediate feedback on the effectiveness of various techniques, these metrics have guided machine translation research and have facilitated rapid advances in the state of the art.",
        "In addition, automatic evaluation metrics are useful in comparing the performance of multiple machine translation systems on a given translation task.",
        "Since automatic evaluation metrics are meant to serve as a surrogate for human judgments, their quality is determined by how well they correlate with assessors' preferences and how accurately they predicts human judgments.",
        "Although current methods for automatically evaluating machine translation output do not require humans to assess individual system output, humans are nevertheless needed to generate a number of reference translations.",
        "The quality of machine-generated translations is determined by automatically comparing system output with these references.",
        "All current automatic evaluation metrics are based on the various measures of the general similarity between the system translation and manual references.",
        "This kind of method has an obvious drawback: it does not account for combinations of lexical and syntactic differences that might occur between a perfectly fluent and accurately-translated machine output and a human reference translation (beyond variations already captured by the different reference translations themselves).",
        "Moreover, the set of human reference translations is unlikely to be an exhaustive inventory of \"good translations\" for any given foreign language sentence.",
        "Therefore, it would be highly desirable to extend the coverage of the references for the similarity based evaluation methods.",
        "To match the system translation with various presentation of the same meaning, many work haven been proposed to extend the references by generating lexical variations.",
        "The first strategy focuses on the extension based on paraphrase identification (Lepage and Denoual, 2005; Lassner et al.",
        "2005; Zhou et al.",
        "2006; Kauchak and Barzilay, 2006; Owczarzak et al.",
        "2006; Owczarzak et al.",
        "2007).",
        "In this kind of method, the quality of system translations can be viewed as the extent to which the conveyed meaning matches the semantics of the reference translations, independent of substrings they may share.",
        "In short, all paraphrases of human-generated references should be considered \"good\" translations.",
        "The second strategy extends the references with the synonymy (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005; Lassner et al.",
        "2005).",
        "This is an alternation to obtain lexical variations with synonymy dictionaries instead of the paraphrase.",
        "In this kind of method, the reference is matched against to the system translation with the pack of the synonymies of the reference words instead of the exact matching.",
        "Both two strategies can successfully capture the lexical variations and greatly extend the coverage of the references.",
        "But they still have two common deficiencies.",
        "The first is the demand of the external knowledge.",
        "Paraphrase based method need a mass of external corpus to extract paraphrases and synonymy based method need manually constructed semantic dictionaries.",
        "These demands seriously limit the application on various languages for which the external knowledge is absent.",
        "Another deficiency is that the two strategies cannot capture the equivalents of long subsegments such as a clause.",
        "Synonymy based method can only capture the equivalents of single words.",
        "Paraphrase based method can capture the equivalents of longer units but the length is still very narrow.",
        "In many cases, some long subsegments can be varied with an entirely different presentation which cannot be decomposed into the variations of words or phrases.",
        "To address these problems we propose a novel strategy to generate variations presentation only using existing multiple manual references without any external knowledge.",
        "We identify the syntactic components on different level as the replaceable units and determine the syntactic equivalents of the components in the corresponding references.",
        "Then the equivalents of the syntactic components are hybridized into new references.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 introduces the concept and identification of the syntactic equivalents.",
        "Section 3 proposes a process to hybridize the syntactic equivalents efficiently.",
        "Experimental results are illustrated in section 4.",

        "And then generate new reference sentences by hybridizing the equivalents of the segments which play the same syntactic role in corresponding references.",
        "In this way the new method can not only capture the equivalents of words and phrases like the other methods but also capture the equivalents of long sub-segments which are out of the capability of the other methods.",
        "Another important advantage of the new method is the no use of the external knowledge which greatly facilitates the application.",
        "Experimental results show that with the extended reference set the state-of-the-arts automatic evaluation metrics achieve better correlation with the human assessments.",
        "In the future work, we will relax the restriction of the equivalent definition and try to recognize more equivalents.",
        "We will also introduce the paraphrase and synonyms into our method to see further improvement.",
        "Another interesting challenge is to hybridize the equivalents in the different order and present the structural variations directly."
