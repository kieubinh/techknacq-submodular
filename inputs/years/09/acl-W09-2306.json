        "Phrase-based statistical machine translation models (Marcu and Wong, 2002; Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn, 2004; Koehn et al., 2007) have achieved significant improvements in translation accuracy over the original IBM word-based model.",
        "However, there are still many limitations in phrase based models.",
        "The most frequently pointed limitation is its inefficacy to modeling the structure reordering and the discontiguous corresponding.",
        "To overcome these limitations, many syntax-based SMT models have been proposed (Wu, 1997; Chiang, 2007; Ding etal., 2005; Eisner, 2003; Quirk",
        "Zhang et al., 2008a; Zhang et al., 2008b; Gildea, 2003; Galley et al., 2004; Marcu et al., 2006; Bod, 2007).",
        "The basic motivation behind syntax-based model is that the syntax information has the potential to model the structure reordering and discontiguous corresponding by the intrinsic structural generalization ability.",
        "Although remarkable progresses have been reported, the strict syntactic constraint (the both sides of the rules should strictly be a subtree of the whole syntax parse) greatly hinders the utilization of the non-syntactic translation equivalents.",
        "To alleviate this constraint, a few works have attempted to make full use of the non-syntactic rules by extending their syntax-based models to more general frameworks.",
        "For example, forest-to-string transformation rules have been integrated into the tree-to-string translation framework by (Liu et al., it possible to utilize the non-syntactic rules and even the phrases which are used in phrase based model by advancing a general tree sequence to tree sequence framework based on the tree-to-tree model presented in (Zhang et al., 2007).",
        "In these models, various kinds of rules can be employed.",
        "For example, as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2, Figure 1 shows a Chinese-to-English sentence pair with syntax parses on both sides and the word alignments (dotted lines).",
        "Figure 2 lists some of the rules which can be extracted from the sentence pair in Figure 1 by the system used in (Zhang et al., 2008a).",
        "These rules includes not only conventional syntax rules but also the tree sequence rules (the multi-headed syntax rules ).",
        "Even the phrase rules are adopted by the system.",
        "Although the better performances are reported over the conventional phrase-based model and syntax-based model, the mixture of diversified rules still leaves much room for study.",
        "Given such a hybrid rule set, we must want to know what kinds of rules can make more important contributions to the overall system performance and what kinds of rules are redundant compared with the others.",
        "From engineering point of view, the developers may concern about which kinds of rules should be preferred and which kinds of rules could be discard without too much decline in translation quality.",
        "However, one of the precondition for the investigations of these issues is what are the \"rule categories\"?",
        "In other words, some comprehensive rule classifications are necessary to make the rule analyses feasible.",
        "The motivation of this paper is to present such a rule classification."

        "A few researches have made some exploratory investigations towards the effects of different rules by classifying the translation rules into different subcategories (Liu et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2008a; DeNeefe et al., 2007).",
        "Liu et al.",
        "(2007) differentiated the rules in their tree-to-string model which integrated with forest-to-string into fully lexicalized rules, non-lexicalized rules and partial lexicalized rules according to the lexicalization levels.",

        "(2008a) proposed two more categories: Structure Reordering Rules (SRR) and Discontiguous Phrase Rules (DPR).",
        "The SRR stands for the rules which have at least two non-terminal leaf nodes with inverted order in the source and target side.",
        "And DPR refers to the rules having at least one non-terminal leaf node between two terminal leaf nodes.",
        "(DeNeefe et al., 2007) made an illuminating breakdown of the different kinds of rules.",
        "Firstly, they classify all the GHKM rules (Galley et al., 2004; Galley et al., 2006) into two categories: lexical rules and non-lexical rules.",
        "The former are the rules whose source side has no source words.",

        "The latter is the complementary set of the former.",
        "And then lexical rules are classified further into phrasal rules and non-phrasal rules.",
        "The phrasal rules refer to the rules whose source side and the yield of the target side contain exactly one contiguous phrase each.",
        "And the one or more nonterminals can be placed on either side of the phrase.",
        "In other words, each phrasal rule can be simulated by the conjunction of two more phrase rules.",
        "(DeNeefe et al., 2007) classifies non-phrasal rules further into structural rules, reordering rules, and noncontiguous phrase rules.",
        "However, these categories are not explicitly defined in (DeNeefe et al., 2007) since out of its focus.",
        "Our proposed rule classification is inspired by these works."

      "text": [
        "Currently, there have been several classifications in SMT research community.",
        "Generally, the rules can be classified into two main groups according to whether syntax information is involved: bilingual phrases (Phrase) and syntax rules (Syntax).",
        "Further, the syntax rules can be divided into three categories according to the lexicalization levels (Liu et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2008a):",
        "1) Fully lexicalized (FLex): all leaf nodes in both the source and target sides are lexicons (terminals)",
        "2) Unlexicalized (ULex): all leaf nodes in both the",
        "Figure 2: Some rules can be extracted by the system used in (Zhang et al., 2008a) from the sentence pair in Figure 1.",
        "source and target sides are non-lexicons (nonterminals)3) Partially lexicalized (PLex): otherwise.",
        "In Figure 2, R1-R3 are FLex rules, and R5-R8 are PLex rules.",
        "Following (Zhang et al., 2008b), a syntax rule r can be formalized into a tuple , where (s and Â£t are tree sequences of source side and target side respectively, AT is a many-to-many correspondence set which includes the alignments between the terminal leaf nodes from source and target side, and ANT is a one-to-one correspondence set which includes the synchronizing relations between the non-terminal leaf nodes from source and target side.",
        "Then, the syntax rules can also fall into two categories according to whether equipping with generalization capability (Chiang, 2007; Zhang et al.,",
        "1) Initial rules (Initial): all leaf nodes of this rule are terminals.",
        "2) Abstract rules (Abstract): otherwise, i.e. at least one leaf node is a non-terminal.",
        "A non-terminal leaf node in a rule is named an abstract node since it has the generalization capability.",
        "Comparing these two classifications for syntax rules, we can find that a FLex rule is a initial rule when ULex rules and PLex rules belong to abstract rules.",
        "These classifications are clear and easy for understanding.",
        "However, we argue that they need further refinement for in-depth study.",
        "Specially, more refined differentiations are needed for the abstract rules (ULex rules and PLex rules) since they play important roles for the characteristic capabilities which are deemed to be the advantages over the phrase-based model.",
        "For instance, the potentials to model the structure reordering and the discontiguous correspondence.",
        "The Structure Reordering Rules (SRR) and Discontiguous Phrase Rules (DPR) mentioned by (Zhang et al., 2008a) can be regarded as more in-depth classification of the syntax rules.",
        "In (Zhang et al., 2008a), they are described as follows:",
        "Definition 1: The Structure Reordering Rule (SRR) refers to the structure reordering rule that has at least two non-terminal leaf nodes with inverted order in the source and target side.",
        "Deinition 2: The Discontiguous Phrase Rule (DPR) refers to the rule having at least one nonterminal leaf node between two lexicalized leaf nodes.",
        "Based on these descriptions, R7, Rg in Figure 2 belong to the category of SRR and R6, R7 fall into the category of DPR.",
        "Although these two definitions are easy implemented in practice, we argue that the definition of SRR is not complete.",
        "The reordering rules involving the reordering between content word terminals and non-terminal (such as R5 in Figure 2) also can model the useful structure reorderings.",
        "Moreover, it is not uncommon that a rule demonstrates the reorderings between two non-terminals as well as the reorderings between one non-terminal and one content word terminal.",
        "The reason for our emphasis of content word terminal is that the re-orderings between the non-terminals and function word are less meaningful.",
        "One of the theoretical problems with phrase based SMT models is that they can not effectively model the discontiguous translations and numerous attempts have been made on this issue (Simard et al., 2005; Quirk and Menezes, 2006; Wellington et al., 2006; Bod, 2007; Zhang et al., 2007).",
        "What seems to be lacking, however, is a explicit definition to the discontiguous translation.",
        "The definition of DPR in (Zhang et al., 2008a) is explicit but somewhat rough and not very accurate.",
        "For example, in Figure 3(a), non-terminal node pair ([0,'fi'], [0,'love'] ) is surrounded by lexical terminals.",
        "According to Definition 2, it is a DPR.",
        "However, obviously it is not a discontiguous phrase actually.",
        "This rule can be simulated by conjunctions of three phrases ('8,', 'I'; 'ft', 'love'; '#','you').",
        "In contrast, the translation rule in Figure 3(b) is an actual discontiguous phrase rule.",
        "The English correspondences of the Chinese word is dispersed in the English side in which the correspondence of Chinese word 'iT' is inserted.",
        "This rule can not be simulated by any conjunctions of the sub phrases.",
        "It must be noted that the discontiguous phrase ('^'-\"switch ... off\") can not be abstracted under the existing synchronous grammar frameworks.",
        "The fundamental reason is that the corresponding parts should be abstracted in the same time and lexicalized in the same time.",
        "In other words, the discontiguous phrase can not be modeled by the permutation between non-terminals (abstract nodes).",
        "Another point to notice is that our focus in this paper is the ability demonstrated by the abstract rules.",
        "Thus, we do not pay much attentions to the re-orderings and discontiguous phrases involved in the",
