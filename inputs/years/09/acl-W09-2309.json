        "In phrase-based statistical machine translation, errors in word reordering, especially global reordering, are one of the most serious problems.",
        "To resolve this problem, many word-reordering constraint techniques have been proposed.",
        "These techniques are categorized into two types.",
        "The first type is linguistically syntax-based.",
        "In this approach, tree structures for the source (Quirk et al., 2005; Huang et al., 2006), target (Ya-mada and Knight, 2000; Marcu et al., 2006), or both (Melamed, 2004) are used for model training.",
        "The second type is formal constraints on word permutations.",
        "IBM constraints (Berger et al., 1996), the lexical word reordering model (Tillmann, 2004), and inversion transduction grammar (ITG) constraints (Wu, 1995; Wu, 1997) belong to this type of approach.",
        "For ITG constraints, the target-side word order is obtained by rotating nodes of the source-side binary tree.",
        "In these node rotations, the source binary tree instance is not considered.",
        "Imposing a source tree on ITG (IST-ITG) constraints (Ya-mamoto et al., 2008) is an extension of ITG constraints and a hybrid of the first and second type of approach.",
        "IST-ITG constraints directly introduce a source sentence tree structure.",
        "Therefore, IST-ITG can obtain stronger constraints for word reordering than the original ITG constraints.",
        "For example, IST-ITG constraints allows only eight word orderings for a four-word sentence, even though twenty-two word orderings are possible with respect to the original ITG constraints.",
        "Although IST-ITG constraints efficiently suppress erroneous target word orderings, the method cannot assign the probability to the target word orderings.",
        "This paper presents a reordering model using syntactic information of a source tree for phrase-based statistical machine translation.",

        "In ITG constraints, the source-side binary tree instance is not considered.",

        "• A source sentence tree structure is generated from the source sentence.",
        "• The target sentence is obtained by rotating any node of the source sentence tree structure.",
        "By parsing the source sentence, the parse-tree is obtained.",
        "After parsing the source sentence, a bracketed sentence is obtained by removing the node syntactic labels; this bracketed sentence can then be converted into a tree structure.",
        "For example, the parse-tree \"(S1 (S (NP (DT This)) (VP (AUX is) (NP (DT a) (NN pen)))))\" is obtained from the source sentence \"This is a pen,\" which consists of four words.",
        "By removing the node syntactic labels, the bracketed sentence \"((This) ((is) ((a) (pen))))\" is obtained.",
        "Such a bracketed sentence can be used to produce constraints.",
        "If IST-ITG constraints is applied, the number of word orderings in N = 4 is reduced to 8, down from 22 with ITG cn-straints.",

        "In phrase-based statistical machine translation, a source \"phrase\" is translated into a target \"phrase\".",
        "However, with IST-ITG constraints, \"word\" must be used for the constraint unit since the parse unit is a \"word\".",
