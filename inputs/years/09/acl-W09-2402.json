        "Our goal is to grapple seriously with the natural sense variation arising from individual differences in word usage.",
        "It has been widely observed that usage features such as vocabulary and syntax vary across corpora of different genres and registers (Biber, 1995), and that serve different functions (Kittredge et al., 1991).",
        "Still, we are far from able to predict specific morphosyntactic and lexical variations across corpora (Kilgarriff, 2001), much less quantify them in a way that makes it possible to apply the same analysis tools (taggers, parsers) without retraining.",
        "In comparison to morphosyntactic properties of language, word and phrasal meaning is fluid, and to some degree, generative (Pustejovsky, 1991;",
        "Nunberg, 1979).",
        "Based on our initial observations from a word sense annotation task for relatively pol-ysemous words, carried out by multiple annotators on a heterogeneous corpus, we hypothesize that different words lead to greater or lesser interannota-tor agreement (IA) for reasons that in the long run should be explicitly modelled in order for Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications to handle usage differences more robustly.",
        "This pilot study is a step in that direction.",
        "We present related work in the next section, then describe the annotation task in the following one.",
        "In Section 4, we present examples of variation in agreement on a matched subset of words.",
        "In Section 5 we discuss why we believe the observed variation depends on the words and present three lexical use factors we hypothesize to lead to greater or lesser IA.",
        "In Section 6, we use association rules to mine our data for systematic differences among annotators, thus to explain the variations in IA.",
        "We conclude with a summary of our findings goals."

        "The types of association rules to mine can include any attributes in either the left hand side or the right hand side of rules.",
        "In our data, the attributes consist of the word sense assigned by annotators, the annotators, and the instances (words).",
        "In order to find rules that relate annotators to each other, the dataset must be preprocessed to produce flat (two-dimensional) tables.",
        "Here we focus on annotators to get a flat table in which each line corresponds to an annotator/sense combination: AnnotatorSense.",
        "We denote the six annotators as A1 through A6, and word senses by WordNet sense number.",
        "Here are 15 unique pairs of annotators, so one way to look at where agreements occur is to determine how many of these pairs choose the same sense with non-negligible support and confidence.",
        "Tell has much better IA than show, but less than long and work.",
        "We would expect association rules among many pairs of annotators for some but not all of its senses.",
        "We find 11 pairs of rules of the form A^Tell:Sensel – AjJTelkSensel, Aj-Tell:Sensel – A^IT ell:S ensel, indicating a bidirectional relationship between pairs of annotators choosing the same sense, with support ranging from 14% to 44% and confidence ranging from 37% to 96%.",
        "This indicates good support and confidence for many possible pairs",
        "Our interest here is primarily in mining for systematic disagreements thus we now turn to pairs of rules where in one rule, an attribute AnnotatorJSensei occurs in the left hand side, and a distinct attribute AnnotatorSensej occurs in the right.",
        "Again, we are especially interested in bidirectional cases where there is a corresponding rule with the left and right hand clauses reversed.",

        "We have performed a sense assignment experiment among multiple annotators for word occurrences drawn from a broad range of genres, rather than the domain-specific data utilized in many studies.",
        "The selected words were all moderately polysemous.",
        "Based on the results, we identify several factors that distinguish words with high vs. low interannotator agreement scores.",
        "We also show the use of association rules to mine the data for systematic annotator differences.",
        "Where relevant, the results can be used to merge senses, as done in much previous work, or to identify internal structure within a set of senses, such as a word-based sense-hierarchy.",
        "In our future work, we want to develop the use of association rules in several ways.",
        "First, we hope to fully automated the process of finding systematic patterns of difference across annotators.",
        "Second, we hope to extend their use to mining associations among the representations of instances in order to further investigate the lexical use factors discussed here."
