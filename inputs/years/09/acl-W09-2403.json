        "The difficulty of outperforming the most frequent sense baseline, the assignment of the sense which appears most often in a given annotated corpus, in word sense disambiguation (WSD) has been brought to light by the recent Senseval WSD system evaluation exercises.",
        "In this work, we present a combination system, which, rather than designing a single approach to all words, enriches the most frequent sense baseline when there is high confidence for an alternative sense to be chosen.",
        "WSD, the task of assigning a sense to a given word from a sense inventory is clearly necessary for other natural language processing tasks.",
        "For example, when performing machine translation, it is necessary to distinguish between word senses in the original language if the different senses have different possible translations in the target language (Yn-gve, 1955).",
        "A number of different approaches to WSD have been explored in recent years, with two",
        "Jon Dehdari",
        "Dennis Mehay",
        "distinct approaches: techniques which require annotated training data (supervised techniques) and techniques which do not (unsupervised methods).",
        "It has long been believed that supervised systems, which can be tuned to a word's context, greatly outperform unsupervised systems.",
        "This theory was supported in the Senseval WSD system evaluation exercises, where the performance gap between the best supervised system and the best unsupervised system is large.",
        "Unsupervised systems were found to never outperform the most frequent sense (MFS) baseline (a sense assignment made on the basis of the most frequent sense in an annotated corpus), while supervised systems occasionally perform better than the MFS baseline, though rarely by more than 5%.",
        "However, recent work by McCarthy et al.",
        "(2007) shows that acquiring a predominant sense from an unannotated corpus can outperform many supervised systems, and under certain conditions will also outperform the MFS baseline.",
        "Rather than proposing a new algorithm which will tackle all words, we focus on improving upon the MFS baseline system when an alternative system proposes a high confidence answer.",
        "An MFS refining system can therefore benefit from answers suggested by a very low recall (but high precision) WSD system.",
        "We propose a number of novel approaches to WSD, but also demonstrate the importance of a highly accurate lemmatizer and part of speech tagger to the English all words task of Senseval-3.We present our enriched most frequent sense baseline in Section 2, which motivates the lemma-tizer and part of speech tagger refinements presented in Section 3.",
        "Our novel high precision WSD algorithms include a reranking algorithm (Section 4), and a Wikipedia-based similarity measure (Section 5).",

      "text": [
        "The most frequent sense (MFS) baseline assumes a sense annotated corpus from which the frequencies of individual senses are learnt.",
        "For each target word, a part of speech tagger is used to determine the word's part of speech, and the MFS for that part of speech is selected.",
        "Although this is a fairly naive baseline, it has been shown to be difficult to beat, with only 5 systems of the 26 submitted to the Senseval-3 English all words task outperforming the reported 62.5% MFS baseline.",
        "The success of the MFS baseline is mainly due to the frequency distribution of senses, with the shape of the sense rank versus frequency graph being a Zipfian curve (i.e., the top-ranked sense being much more likely than any other sense).",
        "However, two different MFS baseline performance results are reported in Snyder and Palmer (2004), with further implementations being different still.",
        "The differences in performance of the MFS baseline can be attributed to a number of factors: the English all words task is run on natural text and therefore performance greatly depends on the accuracy of the lemmatizer and the part of speech tagger employed.",
        "If the lemmatizer incorrectly identifies the stem of the word, the MFS will be looked up for the wrong word and the resulting sense assignment will be incorrect.",
        "The performance of the MFS given the correct lemma and part of speech information is 66%, while the performance of the MFS with a Port Stemmer without any POS information is 32%.",
        "With a TreeTagger (Schmidt, 1994), and a sophisticated lemma back-off strategy, the performance increases to 56%.",
        "It is this difference in performance which motivates refining the most frequent sense baseline, and our work on improving the underlying lemmatizer and part of speech tagger presented in Section 3.",
        "Our initial investigation refines the SemCor based MFS baseline using the automatic method of determining the predominant sense presented in McCarthy et al.",
        "(2007).",
        "1.",
        "For nouns and adjectives which appear in Sem-Cor fewer than 5 times, we employ the automatically determined predominant sense.",
        "2.",
        "For verbs which appear in SemCor fewer than 5 times, we employ subcategorization frame similarity rather than Lesk similarity to give us a verb's predominant sense.",
        "McCarthy et al.",
        "(2007) demonstrate that it is possible to acquire the predominant sense for a word in a corpus without having access to annotated data.",
        "They employ an automatically created thesaurus (Lin, 1998), and a sense-word similarity metric to assign to each sense si of a word w a score corresponding to sss(si, nj)",
        "where dss(w, nj) reflects the distributional similarity of word w to n , w's thesaural neighbour, and sss(si, nj) = maxSx&Senses(nj) sss'(si, sx) is the maximum similarity between w's sense si and a sense sx of w's thesaural neighbour nj.",
        "The authors show that although this method does not always outperform the MFS baseline based on SemCor, it does outperform it when the word's SemCor frequency is below 5.",
        "We therefore switch our MFS baseline to this value for such words.",
        "This result is represented as 'McCarthy' in Table 1, which contains the results of the techniques presented in this Section evaluated on the Senseval-3 English all words task.",
        "McCarthy et al.",
        "(2007) observe that their predominant sense method is not performing as well for verbs as it does for nouns and adjectives.",
        "We hypothesize that this is due to the thesaural neighbours obtained from Lin's thesaurus, and we group verbs according to the subcategorization frame (SCF) distributions they present in the valex (Korhonen et al., 2006) lexicon.",
        "A word w1 is grouped with word w2if the Bhattacharyya coefficient",
        "where p(x) and q(x) represent the probability values for subcategorization class x, is above a certain threshold.",
        "The BC coefficient then replaces the dss value in the original formula and the predominant senses are obtained.",
        "Again, this system is only used for words with frequency lower than 5 in Sem-Cor.",
        "The great advantage of the Bhattacharyya coefficient over various entropy based similarity measures which are usually used to compare SCF distributions (Korhonen and Krymolowski, 2002), is that it is guaranteed to lie between 0 and 1, unlike the entropy based measures which are not easily comparable between different word pairs.",
        "This result is represented by 'Verbs' in Table 1.",

        "MC08's methods for restricting and pruning the number of feature-to-class associations are useful for finding and retaining only strong predictive features.",
        "Moreover, this allowed us to use a rich feature set (more than 1.6 million features) without an unwieldy explosion in the number of parameters, as feature-class associations that are not strong enough are simply dropped.",

        "Very few decisions are changed with the voting method of combination, and the overall result does not outperform the best MFS baseline (presented in the table as \"All MFS\").",
        "This combination method may be more useful with a greater number of systems being combined - our system only combines three systems (thus only one non-MFS system has to suggest the MFS for this to be selected), and backs off to the MFS sense in case all three disagree.",

        "We would also argue that examining the absolute performance in a task where the baseline is so exceedingly variable (ourselves, we have found the baseline to be as low as 56% with restricted lemma backoff, 58.4% with a fairly sophisticated lemma / PoS module, against published baselines of 61.5% in McCarthy et al., 62.5% reported in Snyder, or the upper bound baseline of 66% using correct lemmas and parts of speech), the performance difference between the baseline used and the resulting system is interesting in itself."
