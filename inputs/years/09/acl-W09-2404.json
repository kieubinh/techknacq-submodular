        "(2) the supervised strategy picks, among the baseline SMT translations, the one that matches the reference.",
        "Note that the supervised strategy does not predict perfect translations, but an approximation of the golden translations: in addition to noise in word alignments due to phrasal translations, the translations selected are lemmas that might not be in the correctly inflected form for use in the full sentence translation.",
        "Third, we integrate the selected translation candidates by (1) postprocessing the baseline SMT output - the translations of the French target word are simply replaced by the recommended translation, and (2) encouraging the SMT system to choose the recommended translations by annotating SMT input using the xml input markup scheme - again, this approach is not optimal as it introduces additional translation candidates without probability scores and forces single word translation to compete with phrasal translation even if they are consistent.",
        "As reported in Table 3, small increases in METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and NIST scores (Doddington, 2002) suggest that SMT output matches the references better after postprocessing or decoding with the suggested lemma translations.",
        "Examples of both improved and degraded lexical choice are given in Table 4.",
        "Since we are modifying translations for a limited set of single-words only, only 10% to 30% of the test set sentences are translated differently.",
        "We manually inspected a random sample of 100 of those sentence pairs for two different systems: postprocess (bestmatch) and decode (bestmatch).",
        "For each sentence pair, we determined whether the \"one sense per discourse\" processing improved, degraded or made no difference in translation quality compared to the baseline Moses output.",
        "Among the sentence pairs where a real change in translation quality was observed, the postprocessing heuristic yielded improvements in 62.5% (decode) and 64.5% (postpro-cess) of sentences considered.",
        "For 41% (decode) and 57% (postprocess) of the sentences in the sample, changes only consisted ofsynonymsubstitution, morphological variations or local reorderings which did not impact translation quality.",

        "We investigated the one sense per discourse hypothesis (Gale et al., 1992b) in the context of machine translation.",
        "Analysis of manual translations showed that the hypothesis still holds when using translations in parallel text as sense annotation, thus confirming that translational differences represent useful sense distinctions.",
        "Analysis of SMT output showed that despite ignoring document structure, the one translation per discourse hypothesis is strongly supported in part because of the low variability in SMT lexical choice.",
        "More interestingly, cases where the hypothesis does not hold can reveal lexical choice errors in an unsupervised fashion.",
        "A preliminary study showed that enforcing the one translation per discourse constraint in SMT can potentially improve translation quality, and that SMT systems might benefit from translating sentences within their entire document context.",
        "In future work, we will (1) evaluate whether one translation per discourse holds for other language pairs such as Arabic-English and Chinese-English, which are not as closely related as French-English and for which multiple reference corpora are available, and (2) directly implement the one translation per discourse constraint within SMT."
