        "The great amount of text on the Web has emerged as an unprecedented electronic source of natural language.",
        "Recently, word sense disambiguation systems have fostered the size of the Web in order to supplant the issue of limited annotated data availability for supervised systems (Mihalcea, 2002; Agirre and Martinez, 2004).",
        "Some unsupervised or minimally supervised methods use the Web more directly in disambiguation algorithms that do not use a training set for the specific target words.",
        "One such minimally supervised method uses selectors acquired from the Web for noun sense disambiguation by comparing the selectors of a given sentence to a target noun within the sentence (Schwartz and Gomez, 2008).",
        "Although this work found strong results, many aspects of the use of selectors was left unexplored.",
        "For one, the method was only applied to noun sense disambiguation, focusing on the well-developed noun hypernym hierarchy within WordNet (Miller et al., 1993).",
        "Additionally, the role of different types of selectors was not extensively explored, and adverb selectors were not used at all.",
        "We seek to address those issues.",
        "In this paper, we extend our method of using selectors from the Web for noun sense disambiguation into a more robust method of disambiguating words of all parts of speech.",
        "After a brief background on selectors and related work, we explain the acquisition and empirical application of selectors from nouns, verbs, adjectives, pronouns/proper nouns, and adverbs.",
        "Finally, results are presented from the SemEval-2007 coarse grained all-words task (Navigli et al., 2007), and we explore the influence of various types of selectors on the algorithm in order to draw insight for future improvement of Web-based methods."

      "heading": "2. Background",
      "text": [
        "In this section we describe related research in selectors and solving the problem of word sense disambiguation (WSD).",
        "Specifically, two types of WSD research are examined: works that used the Web in direct manner, and works which applied a similarity or relatedness measure.",
        "The term selector comes from (Lin, 1997), and refers to a word which can take the place of another given word within the same local context.",
        "Although",
        "Lin searched a dependency relationship database in order to match local context, it is not yet possible to parse dependency relationships of the entire Web.",
        "In turn, one must search for text as local context.",
        "For example, in the sentence below, the local context for 'strikers' would be composed of \"he addressed the\" and \"at the rally.",
        "\".",
        "He addressed the strikers at the rally.",
        "Previously, we introduced the idea of using selectors of other words in a sentence in addition to selectors of the target, the word being disambiguated (Schwartz and Gomez, 2008).",
        "Words taking the place of a target word are referred to as target selectors and words which take the place of other words in a sentence are referred to as context selectors.",
        "Context selectors can be classified further based on their part of speech.",
        "In our example, if 'striker' was the target word, the verb context selectors would be verbs replacing 'addressed' and the noun context selectors would be nouns replacing 'rally'.",
        "Similarity is used to measure the relationship between a target word and its target selectors, while relatedness measures the relationship between a target word and context selectors from other parts of the sentence.",
        "Thus, the use of selectors in disambiguating words relies on a couple assumptions:",
        "1.",
        "Concepts which appear in matching syntactic constructions are similar.",
        "2.",
        "Concepts which appear in the context of a given target word are related to the correct sense of the target word.",
        "Note that 'concept' and 'word sense' are used interchangeably throughout this paper.",
        "This idea of distinguishing similarity and relatedness has an extensive history (Rada et al., 1989; Resnik, 1999; Pat-wardhan et al., 2003; Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006), but most algorithms only find a use for one or the other.",
        "A key aspect of using selectors for disambiguation is the inclusion of context in the Web search queries.",
        "This was done in works by (Martinez et al., 2006) and (Yuret, 2007), which substituted relatives or similar words in place of the target word within a given context.",
        "The context, restricted with a window size, helped to limit the results from the Web.",
        "These works followed (Mihalcea and Moldovan, 1999; Agirre et al., 2001) in that queries were constructed through the use of a knowledge-base, filling the queries with pre-chosen words.",
        "We also use context in the web search, but we acquire words matching a wildcard in the search rather than incorporate a knowledge-base to construct queries with pre-chosen relatives.",
        "Consequently, the later half of our algorithm uses a knowledge-base through similarity and relatedness measures.",
        "Some recent works have used similarity or relatedness measures to assist with WSD.",
        "Particuarly, (Patwardhan et al., 2003) provide evaluations of various relatedness measures for word sense disambiguation based on words in context.",
        "These evaluations helped us choose the similarity and relatedness measures to use in this work.",
        "Other works, such as (Sinha and Mihalcea, 2007), use similarity or relatedness measures over graphs connecting words within a sentence.",
        "Likewise, (Navigli and Ve-lardi, 2005) analyze the connectivity of concepts in a sentence among Structured Semantic Interconnections (SSI), graphs of relationships based on many knowledge sources.",
        "These works do not use selectors or the Web.",
        "Additionally, target selectors and context selectors provide an application for the distinction between similarity and relatedness not used in these other methods.",
        "Several ideas distinguish this current work from our research described in (Schwartz and Gomez, 2008).",
        "The most notable aspect is that we have generalized the overall method of using Web selectors into disambiguating verbs, adverbs, and adjectives in addition to nouns.",
        "Another difference is the inclusion of selectors for adverbs.",
        "Finally, we also explore the actual impact that each type of selector has on the performance of the disambiguation algorithm."

      "heading": "3. Approach",
      "text": [
        "In this section we describe the Web Selector algorithm such that verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are disambiguated in addition to nouns.",
        "The algorithm essentially runs in two steps: acquisition of selectors and application of selectors.",
        "Selectors are acquired for all appropriate parts of speech.",
        "Whether the selectors are used as target selectors or context selectors depends on the target word with which they are being applied.",
        "Thus, one process can be used to acquire all noun, verb, adjective, and adverb selectors.",
        "Additionally, noun selectors can be acquired for pronouns and proper nouns (referred to as \"pro\" selectors).",
        "These are regular nouns found to replace a pronoun or proper noun within their local context.",
        "The first step in acquisition is to construct a query with a wildcard in place of the target.",
        "In our example, with 'address' as the target, the query is \"he * the strikers at the rally.\"",
        "Yahoo!",
        "Web Servicesprovides the functionality for searching the web for phrases with wildcards.",
        "Selectors are extracted from the samples returned from the web search by matching the words which take the place of the wildcard.",
        "All words not found in WordNet under the same part of speech as the target are thrown out as well as phrases longer than 4 words or those containing punctuation.",
        "The system enters a loop where it:",
        "• searches the web with a given query, and",
        "• extracts selectors from the web samples.",
        "The query is truncated and the search is repeated until a goal for the number of selectors was reached or the query becomes too short.",
        "This approach, detailed in (Schwartz and Gomez, 2008), removes select punctuation, determiners, and gradually shortens the query one word at a time.",
        "Selectors retrieved from a larger query are removed from the results of smaller queries as the smaller queries should subsume the larger query results.",
        "Some selectors retrieved for the example, with their corresponding web query are listed in Table 1.",
        "To apply selectors in disambiguation, similarity and relatedness measures are used to compare the selectors with the target word.",
        "We incorporate the use of a few previously defined measures over WordNet (Miller etal., 1993).",
        "The WordNet::Similarity package provides a flexible implementation of many of these measures (Pedersen et al., 2004).",
        "We configured WordNet::Similarity for WordNet version 2.1,",
        "He addressed the * at the rally crowd:1",
        "He addressed * at the rally student:1, supporter:2 He addressed * at the",
        "He * the strikers at the treat:2 He * the strikers at",
        "Table 1: Lists of selectors for the target words 'striker' and 'address' returned by corresponding web queries.",
        "the same version used to annotate our chosen experimental corpus.",
        "A relatedness measure was used with context selectors, and we chose the adapted Lesk algorithm (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2002).",
        "An important characteristic of this measure is that it can handle multiple parts of speech.",
        "For target selectors we sought to use measures over the WordNet ontology in order to most closely measure similarity.",
        "An informationcontent (IC) measure (Resnik, 1999) was used for target selectors of nouns and verbs.",
        "However, because IC measures do not work with all parts of speech, we used the adapted Lesk algorithm as an approximation of similarity for adjectives and adverbs.",
        "Note that finding the best relatedness or similarity measure was outside the scope of this paper.",
        "The following function, based on Resnik's word similarity (Resnik, 1999), is used to find the max similarity or relatedness between a concept and a word (specifically between a sense of the target word, ct and a selector, ws).",
        "where cs is a sense of the selector and meas is a similarity or relatedness measure.",
        "Figure 1: General flow in applying selectors to word sense disambiguation.",
        "Note that the target selectors may be any part of speech.",
        "Next, we briefly describe the empirical basis for scoring senses of the target word.",
        "This step is outlined in Figure 1.",
        "The occurrences of selectors can be converted to a probability of a selector, ws appearing in a web query, q:",
        "The senses of the target word are compared with each selector.",
        "For a given sense of the target word, ct, the similarity or relatedness from a selector and query is computed as:",
        "senses(ws) where senses(ws) is the number of senses of the selector.",
        "As the queries get shorter, the accuracy of the selectors becomes weaker.",
        "In turn, the SR value from selectors is scaled by a ratio of the web query length, wql, to the original sentence length, si.",
        "This scaling is applied when the SR values for one target word sense are summed:",
        "where qs(T) represents the set of queries for a selector type, T, and ws ranges over all selectors found with q, denoted sels(q).",
        "The general approach of disambiguation is to find the sense of a target word which is most similar to all target selectors and most related to all context selectors.",
        "This follows our assumptions about selectors given in the background section.",
        "Thus, similarity and relatedness values from different selector types (represented as Types) must be combined.",
        "By aggregating the normalized sums from all types of selectors, we get a combined similarity/relatedness for a given target word sense:",
        "where wt represents the setofallsenses belonging to the target word, and scale(T) is a coefficient used to weight each type of selector.",
        "This term is important in this work, because our experiments explore the impact of various selector types.",
        "The top sense is then chosen by looking at the CSR of all senses.",
        "For some situations, specifically when other senses have a score within 5% of the top CSR, the difference between concepts is very small.",
        "In these cases, the concept with the lowest sense number in WordNet is chosen from among the top scoring senses."
