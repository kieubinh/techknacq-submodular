        "In this paper we propose an annotation framework which integrates the MultiNet semantic network formalism (Helbig, 2006) and the syntactico-semantic formalism of the Prague Dependency Treebank (Hajic et al., 2006) (PDT).",
        "The primary goal of this task is to increase the interoperability of these two frameworks in order to facilitate efforts to annotate at the semantic level while preserving intra-sentential semantic and syntactic annotations as are found in the PDT.",
        "The task of annotating text with global semantic interactions (e.g., semantic interactions within some discourse) presents a cognitively demanding problem.",
        "As with many other annotation formalisms,",
        "*Part of this work was completed while at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Language and Speech Processing in Baltimore, MD USA.",
        "we propose a technique that builds from cognitively simpler tasks such as syntactic and semantic annotations at the sentence level including rich morphological analysis.",
        "Rather than constraining the semantic representations to those compatible with the sentential annotations, our procedure provides the syntacitco-semantic tree as a reference; the annotators are free to select nodes from this tree to create nodes in the network.",
        "We do not attempt to measure the influence this procedure has on the types of semantic networks generated.",
        "We believe that using a soft-constraint such as the syntactico-semantic tree, allows us to better generate human labeled semantic networks with links to the interpretations of the individual sentence analyses.",
        "In this paper, we present a procedure for computing the annotator agreement rate for MultiNet graphs.",
        "Note that a MultiNet graph does not represent the same semantics as a syntactico-semantic dependency tree.",
        "The nodes of the MultiNet graph are connected based on a corpus-wide interpretation of the entities referred to in the corpus.",
        "These global connections are determined by the intra-sentential interpretation but are not restricted to that interpretation.",
        "Therefore, the procedure for computing annotator agreement differs from the standard approaches to evaluating syntactic and semantic dependency treebanks (e.g., dependency link agreement, label agreement, predicate-argument structure agreement).",
        "As noted in (Bos, 2008), \"Even though the design of annotation schemes has been initiated for single semantic phenomena, there exists no annotation scheme (as far as I know) that aims to inte- grate a wide range ofsemantic phenomena all at once.",
        "It would be welcome to have such a resource at ones disposal, and ideally a semantic annotation scheme should be multi-layered, where certain semantic phenomena can be properly analysed or left simply unanalysed.\"",
        "In Section 1 we introduce the theoretical background of the frameworks on which our annotation tool is based: MultiNet and the Tectogrammatical Representation (TR) of the PDT.",
        "Section 2 describes the annotation process in detail, including an introduction to the encyclopedic tools available to the annotators.",
        "In Section 3 we present an evaluation metric for MultiNet/TR labeled data.",
        "We also present an evaluation of the data we have had annotated using the proposed procedure.",
        "Finally, we conclude with a short discussion of the problems observed during the annotation process and suggest improvements as future work.",
        "The representation of the Multilayered Extended Semantic Networks (MultiNet), which is described in (Helbig, 2006), provides a universal formalism for the treatment of semantic phenomena of natural language.",
        "To this end, they offer distinct advantages over the use of the classical predicate calculus and its derivatives.",
        "For example, Multi-Net provides a rich ontology of semantic-concept types.",
        "This ontology has been constructed to be language independent.",
        "Due to the graphical interpretation of MultiNets, we believe manual annotation and interpretation is simpler and thus more cognitively compatible.",
        "Figure 1 shows the Multi-Net annotation of a sentence from the WSJ corpus: \"Stephen Akerfeldt, currently vice president finance, will succeed Mr.",
        "McAlpine.\"",
        "In this example, there are a few relationships that illustrate the representational power of MultiNet.",
        "The main predicate succeed is a ANTE dependent of the node now, which indicates that the outcome of the event described by the predicate occurs at some time later than the time of the statement (i.e., the succession is taking place after the current time as captured by the future tense in the sentence).",
        "Intra-sentential coreference is indicated by the EQU relationship.",
        "From the previous context, we know that the vice president is related to a particular company, Magna",
        "International Inc.",
        "The pragmatically defined relationship between Magna International Inc. and vice president finance is captured by the ATTCH (conceptual attachment) relationship.",
        "This indicates that there is some relationship between these entities for which one is a member of the other (as indicated by the directed edge).",
        "Stephen Akerfeldt is the agent of the predicate described by this sub-network.",
        "The semantic representation of natural language expressions by means of MultiNet is generally independent of the considered language.",
        "In contrast, the syntactic constructs used in different languages to express the same content are obviously not identical.",
        "To bridge the gap between different languages we employ the deep syntactico-semantic representation available in the Functional Generative Description framework (Sgall et al., 1986).",

        "Morphological A rich morphological annotation is provided when such information is available in the language.",
        "This includes lemmatization and detailed morphological tagging.",
        "Analytical The analytical layer is a dependency analysis based purely on the syntactic interpretation.",
        "Tectogrammatical The tectogrammatical annotation provides a deep-syntactic (syntactico-semantic) analysis of the text.",
        "The formalism abstracts away from word-order, function words (syn-semantic words), and morphological variation.",
        "The units of each annotation level are linked with corresponding units on the preceding level.",
        "The morphological units are linked directly with the original tokenized text.",
        "Linking is possible as most of these interpretations are directly tied to the words in the original sentence.",
        "In MultiNet graphs, additional nodes are added and nodes are removed.",

        "Each cell represents two different pairs of annotators; cells with graphs show scatter-plots of F-scores for the annotator pairs along with the optimal linear fit; cells with values show the correlation coefficient (each point in the plot corresponds to a sentence).",
        "For example, the top row, rightmost column, we are comparing the F-score agreement of annotators CB and CW with that of the F-score agreement of annotators SM and CB.",
        "This should help identify an outlier in the consistency of the annotations.",
