        "The task of recognizing temporal expressions (sometimes also referred as time expressions or simply TIMEX) was first introduced in the Message Understanding Conference (MUC) in 1995.",
        "Temporal expressions were treated as a part of the Named Entity Recognition (NER) task, in which capitalized tokens in text were labeled with one of the predefined semantic labels, such as Date, Time, Person, Organization, Location, Percentage, and Money.",
        "As the types of temporal entities identified in this way were too restricted and provided little further information, the Automated Content Extraction (ACE) launched a competition campaign for Temporal Expression Recognition and Normalization (TERN 2004).",
        "The tasks were to identify temporal expressions in free text and normalize them providing an ISO-based date-time value.",
        "Later evaluations of ACE in 2005, 2006 and 2007 unfortunately did not set new challenges for temporal expression recognition and thus the participation interest in this particular task decreased.",
        "TempEval-2 is a successor of TempEval-2007 and will take place in 2010.",
        "The new evaluation initiative sets new challenges for temporal text analysis.",
        "While TempEval-2007 was solely focused on recognition of temporal links, the TempEval-2 tasks aim at an all-around temporal processing with separate evaluations for recognition of temporal expressions and events, for the estimation of temporal relations between events and times in the same sentence, between events and document creation time, between two events in consecutive sentences and between two events, where one of them syntactically dominates the other (Pustejovsky et al., 2009).",
        "These evaluations became possible with a new freely available corpus with annotated temporal information, TimeBank (Pustejovsky et al., 2003a), and an annotation schema, called TimeML (Pustejovsky et al., 2003b).",
        "For us all the tasks of TempEval-2 seem to be interesting.",
        "In this paper we make the first step towards a comprehensive temporal analysis and address the problem of temporal expression recognition as it is set in TempEval-2.",
        "Despite a number of previous implementations mainly done in the context of the ACE TERN competition, very few, and exclusively rule-based methods were reported for temporal taggers on TimeBank developed by using the TimeML annotation scheme.",
        "As a main result of the deep analysis of relevant work (Section 2), we decided to employ a machine learning approach for constituent-based classifications with generic syntactic and lexical features.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we provide the details of relevant work done in this field along with corpora and annotations schemes used; Section 3 describes the approach; experimental setup, results and error analysis are provided in Section 4.",
        "Finally, Section 5 gives an outlook for further improvements and research."

        "For better understanding of the performance levels provided in the paper we first describe evaluation metrics defined for the temporal expression recognition task and then the methods and datasets used in previous research.",
        "With the start of the ACE TERN competition in 2004, two major evaluation conditions were proposed: Recognition+Normalization (full task) and",
        "Recognition only (TERN, 2004).",
        "Detection (Recognition): Detection is a preliminary task towards the full TERN task, in which temporally relevant expressions have to be found.",
        "The scoring is very generous and implies a minimal overlap in the extent of the reference and the system output tags.",
        "As long as there is at least one overlapping character, the tags will be aligned.",
        "Any alignment of the system output tags are scored as a correct detection.",
        "Sloopy span: Spans usually refer to strict match of both boundaries (the extent) of a temporal expression (see Exact Match).",
        "\"Sloopy\" admits recognized temporal expressions as long as their right boundary is the same as in the corresponding TimeBank's extents (Boguraev and Ando, 2005).",
        "The motivation was to assess the correctness of temporal expressions recognized in TimeBank, which was reported as inconsistent with respect to some left boundary items, such as determiners and pre-determiners.",
        "Exact Match (Bracketing or Extent Recognition): Exact match measures the ability to correctly identify the extent of the TIMEX.",
        "The extent of the reference and the system output tags must match exactly the system output tag to be scored as correct.",
        "To date, there are two annotated corpora used for temporal evaluations, the ACE TERN corpus and TimeBank (Pustejovsky et al., 2003a).",
        "In this section we provide a brief description of the temporal corpora and annotation standards, which can substantially influence recognition results.",
        "Most of the implementations referred as the state-of-the-art were developed in the scope of the ACE TERN 2004.",
        "For evaluations, a training corpus of 862 documents with about 306 thousand words was provided.",
        "Each document represents a news article formatted in XML, in which TIMEX2 tags denote temporal expressions.",
        "The total number of temporal expressions for training is 8047 TIMEX2 tags with an average of 10.5 per document.",
        "The test set comprises 192 documents with 1828 TIMEX2 tags (Ferro, 2004).",
        "The annotation of temporal expressions in the ACE corpus was done with respect to the TIDES annotation guidelines (Ferro et al., 2003).",
        "The TIDES standard specifies so-called markable expressions, whose syntactic head must be an appropriate lexical trigger, e.g. \"minute\", \"afternoon\", \"Monday\", \"8:00\", \"future\" etc.",
        "When tagged, the full extent of the tag must correspond to one of the grammatical categories: nouns (NN, NNP), noun phrases (NP), adjectives (JJ), adjective phrases (ADJP), adverbs (RB) and adverb phrases (ADVP).",
        "According to this, all pre-and postmo-difiers as well as dependent clauses are also included to the TIMEX2 extent, e.g. \"five days after he came back\", \"nearly four decades of experience\".",
        "Such a broad extent for annotations is of course necessary for correct normalization, but on the other hand, introduces difficulties for exact match.",
        "Another important characteristic of the TIDES standard are the nested temporal expressions as for example:",
        "The most recent annotation language for temporal expressions, TimeML (Pustejovsky et al., 2003b), with an underlying corpus TimeBank (Pustejovsky et al., 2003a), opens up new possibilities for processing temporal information in text.",
        "Besides the specification for temporal expressions, i.e. TIMEX3, which is to a large extent inherited from TIDES, TimeML provides a means to capture temporal semantics by annotations with suitably defined attributes for fine-grained specification of analytical detail (Boguraev et al., 2007).",
        "The annotation schema establishes new entity and relation marking tags along with numerous attributes for them.",
        "This advancement influenced the extent for event-based temporal expression, in which dependent clauses are no longer included into TIMEX3 tags.",
        "The TimeBank corpus includes 186 documents with 68.5 thousand words and 1423",
        "TIMEX3 tags.",
        "As for any recognition problem, there are two major ways to solve it.",
        "Historically, rule-based systems were first implemented.",
        "Such systems are characterized by a great human effort in data analysis and rule writing.",
        "With a high precision such systems can be successfully employed for recognition of temporal expressions, whereas the recall reflects the effort put into the rule development.",
        "By contrast, machine learning methods require an annotated training set, and with a decent feature design and a minimal human effort can provide comparable or even better results than rule-based implementations.",
        "As the temporal expression recognition is not only about to detect them but also to provide an exact match, machine learning approaches can be divided into token-by-token classification following B(egin)-I(nside)-O(utside) encoding and binary constituent-based classification, in which an entire chunk-phrase is under consideration to be classified as a temporal expression or not.",
        "In this case, exact segmentation is the responsibility of the chunker or the parser used.",
        "Rule-based systems: One of the first well-known implementations of temporal taggers was presented in (Many and Wilson, 2000).",
        "The approach relies on a set of hand-crafted and machine-discovered rules, which are based upon shallow lexical features.",
        "On average the system achieved a value of 83.2% for Fl-measure against hand-annotated data.",
        "The dataset used comprised a set of 22 New York Times articles and 199 transcripts of Voice of America taken from the TDT2 collection (Graff et al., 1999).",
        "It should be noted that the reported performance was provided in terms of an exact match.",
        "Another example of rule-based temporal taggers is Chronos described in (Negri and Marseglia, 2004), which achieved the highest scores (F1-measure) in and exact match.",
        "Recognition of temporal expressions using TimeBank as an annotated corpus, is reported in (Boguraev and Ando, 2005) based on a cascaded finite-state grammar (500 stages and 16000 transitions).",
        "A complex approach achieved an F1-measure value of 0.817 for exact match and 0.896 for detecting \"sloopy\" spans.",
        "Another known implementation for TimeBank is an adaptation of",
        "TIMEX3 with no reported performance level.",
        "Machine learning recognition systems: Successful machine learning TIMEX recognition systems are described in (Ahn et al., 2005; Hacioglu et al., 2005; Poveda et al., 2007).",
        "Proposed approaches made use of a token-by-token classification for temporal expressions represented by B-I-O encoding with a set of lexical and syntactic features, e.g., token itself, part-of-speech tag, label in the chunk phrase and the same features for each token in the context window.",
        "The performance levels are presented in Table 1.",
        "All the results were obtained on the ACE TERN dataset.",
        "Constituent-based classification approach for temporal expression recognition was presented in (Ahn et al., 2007).",
        "By comparing to the previous dataset, the method demonstrates a slight decrease in detection with Fl-measure of 0.844 and a nearly equivalent Fl-measure value for exact match of 0.787.",

        "We restrict the classification for the following phrase types and grammatical categories: NN, NNP, CD, NP, JJ, ADJP, RB, ADVP and PP.",
        "In order to make it possible, for each sentence we parse the initial input line with a Maximum Entropy parser (Ratnaparkhi, 1998) and extract all phrase candidates with respect the types defined above.",
        "Each phrase candidate is examined against the manual annotations for temporal expressions found in the sentence.",
        "Those phrases, which correspond to the temporal expressions in the sentence are taken as positive examples, while the rest are considered as negative ones.",
        "Only one sub-tree from a parse is marked as positive for a distinct TIMEX at once.",
        "After that, for each candidate we produce a feature vector, which includes the following features: head phrase, head word, part-of-speech for head word, character type and character type pattern for head word as well as for the entire phrase.",
        "Character type and character type pattern features are implemented following Ahn et al.",

        "A pattern consists of the same symbols as character types, and contains no sequential redundant occurrences of the same symbol.",
        "For example, the constituent \"January 30th\" has character type \"Xxxxxxx 99xx\" and pattern \"X(x) (9)(x)\".",

        "A comparative performance summary is presented in Table 2.",
        "Sometimes it is very hard even for humans to identify the use of obvious temporal triggers in a specific context.",
        "As a result, many occurrences of such triggers remained unannotated for which TIMEX3 identification could not be properly carried out.",

        "While the recognition systems in the TERN 2004 reported a substantial drop of F1-measure between detection and exact match results (6.5 - 11.6%), our phrase-based detector demonstrates a light decrease in Fl-measure (2.4%), whereas the precision declines only by 0.6%.",
        "This important finding leads us to the conclusion that most of TIMEX3s in TimeBank can be detected at a phrase-based level with a reasonably high performance.",
        "Despite a good recognition performance level there is, of course, room for improvement.",
        "Many implementations in the TERN 2004 employ a set of apparent temporal tokens as one of the features.",
        "In our implementation, the classifier has difficulties with very simple temporal expressions such as \"now\", \"future\", \"current\", \"currently\", \"recent\", \"recently\".",
        "A direct employment of vocabularies with temporal tokens may substantially increase the Fl-measure of the method, however, it yet has to be proven.",
        "As reported in (Ahn et al., 2007) a precise recognition of temporal expressions is a prerequisite for accurate normalization.",
        "With our detector and a future normalizer we are able make the first step towards solving the TempEval-2 tasks, which introduce new challenges in temporal information processing: identification of events, identification of temporal expressions and identification of temporal relations (Puste-jovsky et al., 2009).",
        "Our future work will be focused on improving current results by a new feature design, finalizing the normalization task and identification of temporal relations.",
