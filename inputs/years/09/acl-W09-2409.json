        "Noun-noun combinations occur frequently in many languages, and the problem of semantic disambiguation of these phrases has many potential applications in natural language processing and other areas.",
        "Search engines which can identify the relations between nouns may be able to return more accurate results.",
        "Hand-built ontologies such as WordNet at present only contain a few basic semantic relations between nouns, such as hyper-nymy and meronymy.",
        "If the process of discovering semantic relations from text were automated, more links could quickly be built up.",
        "Machine translation and question-answering are other potential applications.",
        "Noun compounds are very common in English, especially in technical documentation and neologisms.",
        "Latin languages tend to favour prepositional paraphrases instead of direct compound translation, and to select the correct preposition it is often necessary to know the semantic relation.",
        "One very common approach to this problem is to define a set of semantic relations which capture the interaction between the modifier and the head noun, and then attempt to assign one of these semantic relations to each noun-modifier pair.",
        "For example, the phrase flu virus could be assigned the semantic relation causal (the virus causes the flu); the relation for desert wind could be location (the storm is located in the desert).",
        "There is no consensus as to which set of semantic relations best captures the differences in meaning of various noun phrases.",
        "Work in theoretical linguistics has suggested that noun-noun compounds may be formed by the deletion of a predicate verb or preposition (Levi 1978).",
        "However, whether the set of possible predicates numbers 5 or 50, there are likely to be some examples of noun phrases that fit into none of the categories and some that fit in multiple categories."

        "The idea of searching a large corpus for specific lexicosyntactic phrases to indicate a semantic relation of interest was first described by Hearst (1992).",
        "Lauer (1995) tackled the problem of semantically disambiguating noun phrases by trying to find the preposition which best describes the relation between the modifier and head noun.",
        "His method involves searching a corpus for occurrences paraphrases of the form \"noun preposition modifier\".",
        "Whichever preposition is most frequent in this context is chosen to represent the predicate of the nominal, which poses the same problem of vagueness as Levi's approach.",
        "Lapata and Keller (2005) improved on Lauer's results on the same task by using the web as a corpus.",
        "Turney and Littman (2005) used queries to the AltaVista search engine as the basis for their learning algorithm.",
        "Using the dataset of Nastase and Szpakowicz (2003), they experimented with a set of 64 short prepositional and conjunctive phrases they call \"joining terms\" to generate exact queries for AltaVista of the form \"noun joining term modifier\", and \"modifier joining term nouri\\ These hit counts were used with a nearest neighbour algorithm to assign the noun phrases semantic relations.",
        "Nakov and Hearst (2006) present a system that discovers verbs that characterize the relation between two nouns in a compound.",
        "By writing structured queries to a web search engine and syntactically parsing the returned 'snippet', they were able to identify verbs that were suitable predicates.",
        "For example, for the compound neck vein, they retrieved verbs and verb-preposition such as predicates emerge from, pass through, terminate in, and others.",
        "However, their evaluation is qualitative; they do not attempt to use the verbs directly to categorize a compound as a particular semantic relation.",
        "Turney (2006) examines similarity measures for semantic relations.",
        "He notes that there are at least two kinds of similarity: attributional similarity, which applies between words, and relational similarity, which holds between pairs of words.",
        "Words that have a high attributional similarity are known as synonyms; e.g. chair and stool.",
        "When the relations in each of two pairs of words are similar, it is said that there is an analogy between the two pairs of words, e.g. stone:mason, carpenter:wood.",
        "Turney points out that word pairs with high relational similarity do not necessarily contain words with high attributional similarity.",
        "For example, although the relations are similar in traffic:street and water:riverbed, water is not similar to traffic, nor street similar to riverbed.",
        "Therefore, a measure of similarity of semantic relations allows a more reliable judgment of analogy than the first-order similarity of the nouns"

      "text": [
        "When looking for lexical patterns between two nouns, as is required with vector-space approaches, data sparseness is a common problem.",
        "To overcome this, many of the best-performing systems in this area rely on automated queries to web search-engines (Lapata and Keller (2005), Turney and most apparent advantage of using search-engine queries is simply the greater volume of data available.",
        "Keller and Lapata (2003) demonstrated the usefulness of this extra data on a type of word-sense disambiguation test and also found that web frequencies of bigrams correlated well with frequencies in a standard corpus.",
        "Kilgarriff (2007) argues against the use of commercial search engines for research, and outlines some of the major drawbacks.",
        "Search engine crawlers do not lemmatize or part-of-speech tag their text.",
        "This means that to obtain frequencies for may different inflectional forms, researchers must perform a separate query for each possible form and sum the results.",
        "If part-of-speech tagging is required, the 'snippet' of text that is returned with each result may be tagged after the query has been executed, however the APIs for the major search engines have limitations on how many snippets may be retrieved for a given query (100 -1000).",
        "Another problem is that search engine query syntax is limited, and sometimes mysterious.",
        "In the case of Google, only basic boolean operators are supported (AND, OR, NOT), and the function of the wildcard symbol (*) is limited, difficult to decipher and may have changed over time.",
        "Kilgarriff also points out that the search API services to the major search engines have constraints on the number of searches that are allowed per user per day.",
        "Because of the multiple searches that are needed to cover inflectional variants and recover snippets for tagging, a limit of 1000 queries per day, as with the Google API, makes experimentation slow.",
        "This paper will describe the use of the Web 1T corpus, made available by Google in 2006 (Brants and Franz 2006).",
        "This corpus consists of n-grams collected from web data, and is available to researchers in its entirety, rather than through a web search interface.",
        "This means that there is no limit to the amount of searches that may be performed, and an arbitrarily complex query syntax is possible.",
        "Despite being available since 2006, few researchers have made use of the Web 1T corpus.",
        "Hawker (2006) provides an example of using the corpus for word sense documentation, and describes a method for efficient searching.",
        "We will outline the performance of the corpus on the task of identifying the semantic relation between two nouns.",
        "Another motivation behind this paper is to examine the usefulness of different lexical patterns for the task of deducing semantic relations.",
        "In this paper, we are interested in whether the frequency with which a joining term occurs between two nouns is related to how it indicates a semantic interaction.",
        "This is in part motivated by Zipf s theory which states that the more frequently a word occurs in a corpus the more meanings or senses it is likely to have (Zipf 1929).",
        "If this is true, we would expect that very frequent prepositions, such as \"of\", would have many possible meanings and therefore not reliably predict a semantic relation.",
        "However, less frequent prepositions, such as \"during\" would have a more limited set of senses and therefore accurately predict a semantic relation.",
        "Zipf also showed that the frequency of a term is related to its length.",
        "We will investigate whether longer lexical patterns are more useful at identifying semantic relations than shorter patterns, and whether less frequent patterns perform better than more frequent ones."

        "In these experiments we use only the set of 5 relations.",
        "The reason for this is that splitting a set of 600 examples into 30 classes results in few training examples per class.",
