        "Despite the advances in natural language processing (NLP), Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is still considered one of the most challenging problems in the field.",
        "Ever since the field's inception, WSD has been perceived as one of the central problems in NLP as an enabling technology that could potentially have far reaching impact on NLP applications in general.",
        "We are starting to see the beginnings of a positive effect of WSD in NLP applications such as Machine Translation (Carpuat and Wu, 2007; Chan et al., 2007).",
        "Advances in research on WSD in the current millennium can be attributed to several key factors: the availability of large scale computational lexical resources such as",
        "*The second author has been partially funded by DARPA GALE project.",
        "We would also like to thank the useful comments rendered by three anonymous reviewers.",
        "WordNets (Fellbaum, 1998; Miller, 1990), the availability of large scale corpora, the existence and dissemination of standardized data sets over the past 10 years through the different test beds of SENSEVAL and SEMEVAL competitions, devising more robust computing algorithms to handle large scale data sets, and simply advancement in hardware machinery.",
        "In this paper, we address the problem of WSD of all the content words in a sentence.",
        "In this framework, the task is to associate all tokens with their contextually relevant meaning definitions from some computational lexical resource.",
        "We present an enhancement on an existing graph based algorithm, In-Degree, as described in (Sinha and Mihalcea, 2007).",
        "Like the previous work, our algorithm is unsupervised.",

        "The definition of WSD has taken on several different meanings in recent years.",
        "In the latest SEMEVAL (2007) workshop, there were 18 tasks defined, several of which were on different languages, however we notably recognize the widening of the definition of the task of WSD.",
        "In addition to the traditional all words and lexical sample tasks, we note new tasks on word sense discrimination (no sense inventory is needed, the different senses are merely distinguished), lexical substitution using synonyms of words as substitutes, as well as meaning definitions obtained from different languages namely using words in translation.",
        "Our paper is about the classical all words task of WSD.",
        "In this task, all the content bearing words in a running text are disambiguated from a static lexical resource.",
        "For example a sentence such as I walked by the bank and saw many beautiful plants there.",
        "will have the verbs walked, saw, the nouns bank, plants, the adjectives many, beautiful, and the adverb there, be disambiguated from a standard lexical resource.",
        "Hence using WordNet, walked will be assigned the meaning to use one's feet to advance; advance by steps, saw will be assigned the meaning to perceive by sight or have the power to perceive by sight, the noun bank will be assigned the meaning sloping land especially the slope beside a body of water and so on."

        "A thorough review of the current state of the art is in (Navigli, 2009).",
        "Several techniques have been used to tackle the problem ranging from rule based/knowledge based approaches to unsupervised and supervised machine learning approaches.",
        "To date, the best approaches that solve the all words WSD task are supervised as illustrated in the different SenseEval and SEMEVAL All Words tasks (M. Palmer and Dang, 2001; Snyder and Palmer, 2004; Pradhanetal.,2007).",

        "We will review only three of the most relevant related research due to space limitations.",
        "We acknowledge the existence of many research papers that tackled the problem using unsupervised approaches.",
        "Firstly, in work by (Pedersen and Patwardhan, 2005), the authors investigate different word similarity measures as a means of disambiguating words in context.",
        "They compare among different similarity measures.",
        "They show that using an extension on the Lesk similarity measure (Lesk, 1986) between the target words and their contexts and the contexts of those of the WordNet synset entries (Gloss Overlap), outperforms all the other similarity measures.",
        "Their approach is unsupervised.",
        "They exploit the different relations in WordNet.",
        "They also go beyond the single word overlap, they calculate the overlap in n-grams.",
        "They report results on the English Lexical sample task from Senseval 2 which comprised nouns, verbs and adjectives.",
        "The majority of the words in this set is polysemous.",
        "They achieve an F-measure of 41.2% on nouns, 21.2% on verbs, and 25.1% on adjectives.",
        "The second related work to ours is the work by graph based unsupervised technique for all word sense disambiguation.",
        "Similar to the previous study, the author relied on the similarity of the WordNet entry glosses using the Lesk similarity measure.",
        "The study introduces a graph based sequence model of the problem.",
        "All the open class words in a sentence are linked via an undirected graph where all the possible senses are listed.",
        "Then dependency links are drawn between all the sense pairs.",
        "Weights on the arcs are determined based on the semantic similarity using the Lesk measure.",
        "The algorithm is basically to walk the graph and find the links with the highest possible weights deciding on the appropriate sense for the target words in question.",
        "This algorithm yields an overall F-score of 54.2% on the Sen-seval 2 all words data set and an F-score of 64.2% on nouns alone.",
        "Finally, the closest study relevant to the current paper yields state of the art performance is an unsupervised approach described in (Sinha and Mihal-cea, 2007).",
        "In this work, the authors combine different semantic similarity measures with different graph based algorithms as an extension to work in (Mihalcea, 2005).",
        "The authors proposed a graph-based WSD algorithm.",
        "Given a sequence of words W = {wi,W2...wn}, each word Wj with several senses {sn, si2• ••siTO}.",
        "A graph G = (V,E) is defined such that there exists a vertex v for each sense.",
        "Two senses of two different words may be connected by an edge e, depending on their distance.",
        "That two senses are connected suggests they should have influence on each other, so normally a maximum allowable distance is set.",
        "They explore 4 different graph based algorithms.",
        "The highest yielding algorithm in their work is the In-Degree algorithm combining different WordNet similarity measures depending on POS.",
        "They used the Jiang and Conrath (JCN) (Jiang and Conrath., 1997) similarity measure within nouns, the Leacock & Chodorow (LCH) (Leacock and Chodorow, 1998) similarity measure within verbs, and the Lesk (Lesk, 1986) similarity measure within adjectives and within adverbs and across different POS tags.",
        "They evaluate their work against the Senseval 2 all words task.",
        "They tune the parameters of their algorithm - specifically the normalization ratio for some of these measures – based on the Senseval 3 data set.",
        "They report a state of the art unsupervised system that yields an overall performance of 57.2%."

        "In this paper, we extend the (Sinha and Mihalcea, 2007) work (hence forth SM07) in some interesting ways.",
        "We focus on the In-Degree graph based algorithm as it was the best performer in the SM07 work.",
        "The In-Degree algorithm presents the problem as a weighted graph with senses as nodes and similarity between senses as weights on edges.",
        "The In-Degree of a vertex refers to the number of edges incident on that vertex.",
        "In the weighted graph, the In-Degree for each vertex is calculated by summing the weights on the edges that are incident on it.",
        "After all the In-Degree values for each sense is computed, the sense with maximum value is chosen as the final sense for that word.",
        "SM07 combine different similarity measures.",
        "They show that best combination is JCN for noun pairs and LCH for verb pairs, and Lesk for within adjectives and within adverbs and also across different POS, for example comparing senses of verbs and nouns.",
        "Since different similarity measures use different similarity scales, SM07 did not directly use the value returned from the similarity metrics.",
        "Instead, the values were normalized.",
        "Lesk value is observed in a range from 0 to an arbitrary value, so values larger than 240 were set to 1, and the rest is mapped to an interval [0,1].",
        "Similarily JCN and LCH were normalized to the interval from [0,1].",
        "In this paper, we use the basic In-Degree algorithm while applying some modifications to the basic similarity measures exploited and the WordNet lexical resource.",
        "Similar to the original In-Degree algorithm, we produce a probabilistic ranked list of senses.",
        "Our modifications are described as follows:",
        "JCN for Verb-Verb Similarity In our implementation of the In-Degree algorithm, we use the JCN similarity measure for both Noun-Noun similarity calculation similar to SM07.",
        "In addition, instead of using LCH for Verb-Verb similarity, we use JCN for Verb Verb similarity based on our empirical observation on SENSEVAL 3 data, JCN yields better performance than when employing LCH among verbs.",
        "Expand Lesk Following the intuition in (Peder-sen and Patwardhan, 2005) - henceforth (PEA05) - we expand the basic Lesk similarity measure to take into account the glosses for all the relations for the synsets on the contextual words and compare them with the glosses of the target word senses, hence going beyond the is-a relation.",
        "The idea is based on the observation that WordNet senses are too fine-grained, therefore the neighbors share a lot of semantic meanings.",
        "To find similar senses, we use the relations: hypernym, hyponym, similar attributes, similar verb group, pertinym, holonym, and meronyms.",
        "The algorithm assumes that the words in the input are POS tagged.",
        "It is worth noting the differences between our algorithm and the PEA05 algorithm, though we take our cue from it.",
        "In PEA05, the authors retrieve all the relevant neighbors to form a large bag of words for both the target sense and the surrounding sense and they specifically focus on the Lesk similarity measure.",
        "In our current work, we employ the neighbors in a disambiguation strategy using different similarity measures one pair at a time.",
        "This algorithm takes as input a target sense and a sense pertaining to a word in the surrounding context, and returns a sense similarity score.",
        "It is worth noting that we do not apply the WN relations expansion to the target sense.",
        "It is only applied to the contextual word.",
        "We experimented with expanding both the contextual sense and the target sense and we found that the unreliability of some of the relations is detrimental to the algorithm's performance.",
        "Hence we decided empirically to expand only the contextual word.",
        "We employ the same normalization values used in SM07 for the different similarity measures.",
        "Namely for the Lesk and Expand-Lesk we use the same cut off value of 240, accordingly, if the Lesk or Expand-Lesk similarity value returns 0 <= 240 it is converted to a real number in the interval [0,1], any similarity over 240 is by default mapped to a 1.",
        "For JCN, similar to SM07, the values are from 0.04 to 0.2, we mapped them to the interval [0,1].",
        "It is worth noting that we did not run any calibration studies beyond the what was reported in SM07.",
        "SemCor Expansion of WordNet A basic part of our approach relies on using the Lesk algorithm.",
        "Accordingly, the availability of glosses associated with the WordNet entries is extremely beneficial.",
        "Therefore, we expand the number of glosses available in WordNet by using the SemCor data set, thereby adding more examples to compare.",
        "The SemCor corpus is a corpus that is manually sense tagged (Miller, 1990).",
        "In this expansion, depending on the version of WordNet, we use the sense-index file in the WordNet Database to convert the SemCor data to the appropriate version sense annotations.",
        "We augment the sense entries for the different POS WordNet databases with example usages from SemCor.",
        "The augmentation is done as a look up table external to WordNet proper since we did not want to dabble with the WordNet offsets.",
        "We set a cap of 30 additional examples per synset.",
        "Many of the synsets had no additional examples.",
        "A total of 26875 synsets in WordNet 1.7.1 and a total of 25940 synsets are augmented with SemCor examples."

        "Our implementation of SM07 is slightly higher than those reported in (Sinha and Mihalcea, 2007), 57.12% is probably due to the fact that we do not consider the items tagged as \"U\" and also we resolve some of the POS tag mismatches between the gold set and the test data.",
        "We note that for the SV2 data set our coverage is not 100% due to some POS tag mismatches that could not have been resolved automatically.",
        "These POS tag problems have to do mainly with multiword expressions and the like.",
        "In observing the performance of the overall system, we note that using JCN for verbs clearly outperforms using the LCH similarity measure across the board on all data sets as illustrated in Table 1.",
        "Using SemCor to augment WordNet examples seems to have the biggest impact on SV3 and SM compared to ExpandL.",
        "This may be attributed to the fact that the percentage of polysemous words in the latter two sets is much higher than it is for SV2.",
        "Combining SemCor with ExpandL yields the best results for the SV2 data sets.",
        "There seems to be no huge notable difference between the three versions ofWN, though WN3.0 seems to yield slightly higher results maybe due to higher consistency in the overall structure when comparing WN1.7.1, WN2.1, and WN3.0.",
        "We do recognize that we can't directly compare the various WordNets except to draw conclusions on structural differences remotely.",
        "It is also worth noting that less words in WN3.0 used SemCor expansions.",
        "Observing the results yielded per POS in Table 2, ExpandL seems to have the biggest impact on the Nouns only.",
        "This is understandable since the nouns hierachy has the most dense relations and the most consistent ones.",
        "SemCor augmentation of WN seemed to benefit all POS significantly except for nouns.",
        "In fact the performance on the nouns deteriorated from the base condition JCN-V from 68.7 to 68.3%.",
        "This maybe due to inconsistencies in the annotations of nouns in SemCor or the very fine granularity of the nouns in WN.",
        "We know that 72% of the nouns, 74% of the verbs, 68.9% of the adjectives, and 81.9% of the adverbs directly exploited the use of SemCor augmented examples.",
        "Combining Sem-Cor and ExpandL seems to have a positive impact on the verbs and adverbs, but not on the nouns and adjectives.",
        "These trends are not held consistently across data sets.",
        "For example, we see that SemCor augmentation helps both all POS tag sets over using ExpandL alone or when combined with SemCor.",
        "In order to analyze this further, we explore the performance on the polysemous POS only in all the data sets.",
        "We note that the same trend persists, SemCor augmentation has a negative impact on the SV2 data set in both WN 1.7.1. and WN 3.0. yet it benefits all POS in the other data sets, namely SV3 WN1.7.1 and SV3 WN3.0, SM WN2.1 and SM WN3.0.",
