        "Coreference information has been shown to be beneficial in many NLP applications such as Information Extraction (McCarthy and Lehnert, 1995), Text Summarization (Steinberger et al., 2007), Question Answering (Morton, 2000), and Machine Translation.",
        "In these systems, there is a need to identify the different pieces of information that refer to the same discourse entity in order to produce coherent and fluent summaries, disambiguate the references to an entity, and solve anaphoric pronouns.",
        "Coreference is an inherently complex phenomenon.",
        "Some of the limitations of the traditional rule-based approaches (Mitkov, 1998) could be overcome by machine learning techniques, which allow automating the acquisition of knowledge from annotated corpora.",
        "This task will promote the development of linguistic resources annotated corpora-and machine-learning techniques oriented to coreference resolution.",
        "In particular, we aim to evaluate and compare coreference resolution systems in a multilingual context, including Catalan, English, and Spanish languages, and by means of two different evaluation metrics.",
        "By setting up a multilingual scenario, we can explore to what extent it is possible to implement a general system that is portable to the three languages, how much language-specific tuning is necessary, and the significant differences between Romance languages and English, as well as those between two closely related languages such as Spanish and Catalan.",
        "Besides, we expect to gain some useful insight into the development of multilingual NLP applications.",
        "As far as the evaluation is concerned, by employing B-cubed (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998) and CEAF (Luo, 2005) algorithms we can consider both the advantages and drawbacks of using one or the other scoring metric.",
        "For comparison purposes, the MUC score will also be reported.",
        "Among others, we are interested in the following questions: Which evaluation metric provides a more accurate picture of the accuracy of the system performance?",
        "Is there a strong correlation between them?",
        "Can statistical systems be optimized under both metrics at the same time?",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes the overall task.",
        "The corpora and the annotation scheme are presented in Section 3.",

        "The SemEval-2010 task 'Coreference Resolution in Multiple Languages' is concerned with automatic coreference resolution for three different languages: Catalan, English, and Spanish.",
        "Given the complexity of the coreference phenomena, we will concentrate only in two tractable aspects, which lead to the two following subtasks for each of the languages:",
        "i) Detection of full coreference chains, composed by named entities, pronouns, and full noun phrases (NPs).",
        "ii) Pronominal resolution, i.e. finding the antecedents of the pronouns in the text.",
        "[Els beneficiaris de [pensions de [viudetat]3]2]1 po-dran conservar [la paga]4 encara_que [0]5 es tornin a casar si [0]6 compleixen [una série de [conditions]^ , segons [el reial decret aprovat ahir pel [Consell_de_Ministres]10]9 .",
        "[La nova norma]11 afecta [els perceptors d' [una pensiô de [viudetat]13]12 [que]14 contreguin [matrimonii a_partir_de [l' 1_de_gener_del_2002]16]17 .",
        "[La primera de [les condicions]18]19 és tenir [més de 61 anys]20 o tenir reconeguda [una incapacitat permanent [que]22 inhabiliti per a [tota [professiô]24 [La segona]26 és que [la pensiô]27 sigui [la principal o ûnica font d' [ingressos del [pensionista]30]29]28 , i sempre_que [l' import anual de [la mateixa pen-siô]32]31 representi , com_a_minim , [el 75% del [total dels [ingressos anuals del [pensionis-ta]36] 35]34]33.",
        "The example in Figure 1 illustrates the two sub-tasks.",
        "Given a text in which NPs are identified and indexed (including elliptical subjects, represented as 0), the goal of (i) is to extract all coreference chains: 1-5-6-30-36, 9-11, and 7-18; while the goal of (ii) is to identify the antecedents of pronouns 5 and 6, which are 1 and 5 (or 1), respectively.",
        "Note that (b) is a simpler subtask of (a) and that for a given pronoun there can be multiple antecedents (e.g. both 1 and 5 are correct antecedents for 6).",
        "We restrict the task to solving 'identity' relations between NPs (coreference chains), and between pronouns and antecedents.",
        "Nominal predicates and appositions as well as NPs with a non-nominal antecedent (discourse deixis) will not been taken into consideration in the recognition of coreference chains (see Section 3.1 for more information about decisions concerning the annotation scheme).",
        "Although we target at general systems addressing the full multilingual task, we will allow taking part on any subtask of any language in order to promote participation.",
        "[The beneficiaries of [[spouse's]3 pensions]2]1 will be able to keep [the payment]4 even if [they]5 remarry provided that [they]6 fulfill [a series of [conditions]^, according to [the royal decree approved yesterday by [the Council of Ministers]10]9.",

        "[The second one]26 requires that [the pension]27 be [the main or only source of [the [pensioner's]30 in-come]29]28, and provided that [the annual amount of [the pension]32]31 represents, at least, [75% of [the total [yearly income of [the pen-sioner]36]35]34]33.",
        "Figure 1.",
        "NPs in a sample from the Catalan training data (left) and the English translation (right).",
        "The input information for the task will consist of: word forms, lemmas, POS, full syntax, and semantic role labeling.",
        "Two different scenarios will be considered regarding the source of the input information:",
        "i) In the first one, gold standard annotation will be provided to participants.",
        "This input annotation will correctly identify all NPs that are part of coreference chains.",
        "This scenario will be only available for Catalan and Spanish.",
        "ii) In the second, state-of-the-art automatic linguistic analyzers for the three languages will be used to generate the input annotation of the data.",
        "The matching between the automatically generated structure and the real NPs intervening in the chains does not need to be perfect in this setting.",
        "By defining these two experimental settings, we will be able to check the performance of corefer-ence systems when working with perfect linguistic (syntactic/semantic) information, and the degradation in performance when moving to a more realistic scenario with noisy input annotation.",
        "In parallel, we will also consider the possibility of differentiating between closed and open challenges, that is, when participants are allowed to use strictly the information contained in the training data (closed) and when they make use of some external resources/tools (open).",
        "Regarding evaluation measures, we will have specific metrics for each of the subtasks, which will be computed by language and overall.",
        "Several metrics have been proposed for the task of coreference resolution, and each of them presents advantages and drawbacks.",
        "For the purpose of the current task, we have selected two of them -B-cubed and CEAF - as the most appropriate ones.",
        "In what follows we justify our choice.",
        "The MUC scoring algorithm (Vilain et al., 1995) has been the most widely used for at least two reasons.",
        "Firstly, the MUC corpora and the MUC scorer were the first available systems.",
        "Secondly, the MUC scorer is easy to understand and implement.",
        "However, this metric has two major weaknesses: (i) it does not give any credit to the correct identification of singleton entities (chains consisting of one single mention), and (ii) it intrinsically favors systems that produce fewer coreference chains, which may result in higher F-measures for worse systems.",
        "A second well-known scoring algorithm, the ACE value (NIST, 2003), owes its popularity to the ACE evaluation campaign.",
        "Each error (a missing element, a misclassification of a coreference chain, a mention in the response not included in the key) made by the response has an associated cost, which depends on the type of entity (e.g. person, location, organization) and on the kind of mention (e.g. name, nominal, pronoun).",
        "The fact that this metric is entity-type and mention-type dependent, and that it relies on ACE-type entities makes this measure inappropriate for the current task.",
        "The two measures that we are interested in comparing are B-cubed (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998) and CEAF (Luo, 2005).",
        "The former does not look at the links produced by a system as the MUC algorithm does, but looks at the presence/absence of mentions for each entity in the system output.",
        "Precision and recall numbers are computed for each mention, and the average gives the final precision and recall numbers.",
        "CEAF (Luo, 2005) is a novel metric for evaluating coreference resolution that has already been used in some published papers (Ng, 2008; Denis and Baldridge, 2008).",
        "It mainly differs from B-cubed in that it finds the best one-to-one entity alignment between the gold and system responses before computing precision and recall.",
        "The best mapping is that which maximizes the similarity over pairs of chains.",
        "The CEAF measure has two variants: a mention-based, and an entity-based one.",
        "While the former scores the similarity of two chains as the absolute number of common mentions between them, the latter scores the relative number of common mentions.",
        "Luo (2005) criticizes the fact that a response with all mentions in the same chain obtains 100% B-cubed recall, whereas a response with each mention in a different chain obtains 100% B-cubed precision.",
        "However, precision will be penalized in the first case, and recall in the second case, each captured by the corresponding F-measure.",
        "Luo's entity alignment might cause that a correctly identified link between two mentions is ignored by the scoring metric if that entity is not aligned.",
        "Finally, as far as the two CEAF metrics are concerned, the entity-based measure rewards alike a correctly identified one-mention entity and a correctly identified five-mention entity, while the mention-based measure takes into account the size of the entity.",
        "Given this series of advantages and drawbacks, we opted for including both B-cubed and CEAF measures in the final evaluation of the systems.",
        "In this way we will be able to perform a metaevaluation study, i.e. to evaluate and compare the performance of metrics with respect to the task objectives and system rankings.",
        "It might be interesting to break B-cubed and CEAF into partial results across different kinds of mentions in order to get a better understanding of the sources of errors made by each system.",
        "Additionally, the MUC metric will also be included for comparison purposes with previous results.",
        "Finally, for the setting with automatically generated input information (second scenario in Section 2.1.1), it might be desirable to devise metric variants accounting for partial matches of NPs.",
        "In this case, capturing the correct NP head would give most of the credit.",
        "We plan to work in this research line in the near future.",
        "Official scorers will be developed in advance and made available to participants when posting the trial datasets.",
        "The period in between the release of trial datasets and the start of the full evaluation will serve as a test for the evaluation metrics.",
        "Depending on the feedback obtained from the participants we might consider introducing some improvements in the evaluation setting."
