        "The Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) task, which consists in selecting the correct sense of a given word in a given context, has been widely studied in computational linguistics.",
        "For a recent overview of WSD algorithms, resources and applications, we refer to Agirre and Edmonds (2006) and Navigli (2009).",
        "Semantic evaluation competitions such as Senseval and its successor Semeval revealed that supervised approaches to WSD usually achieve better results than unsupervised methods (Marquez et al., 2006).",
        "The former use machine learning techniques to induce a classifier from manually sense-tagged data, where each occurrence of a polysemous word gets assigned a sense label from a predefined sense inventory such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "These supervised methods, however, heavily rely on large sense-tagged corpora which are very time consuming and expensive to build.",
        "This phenomenon, well known as the knowledge acquisition bottleneck (Gale et al., 1992), explains the modest use and success of supervised WSD in real applications.",
        "Although WSD has long time been studied as a standalone NLP task, there is a growing feeling in the WSD community that WSD should preferably be integrated in real applications such as Machine Translation or multilingual information retrieval (Agirre and Edmonds, 2006).",
        "Several studies have demonstrated that for instance Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) benefits from incorporating a dedicated WSD module (Chan et al., 2007; Carpuat and Wu, 2007).",
        "Using translations from a corpus instead of human-defined sense labels is one way of facilitating the integration of WSD in multilingual applications.",
        "It also implicitly deals with the granularity problem as finer sense distinctions are only relevant as far as they are lexicalized in the translations.",
        "Furthermore, this type of corpus-based approach is language-independent, which makes it a valid alternative for languages lacking sufficient sense inventories and sense-tagged corpora, although one could argue that the lack of parallel corpora for certain language pairs might be problematic as well.",
        "The methodology to deduce word senses from parallel corpora starts from the hypothesis that the different sense distinctions of a polysemous word are often lexicalized cross-linguistically.",
        "For instance, if we query the English noun \"bill\" in the English-Dutch Europarl, the following top four translations are retrieved: \"rekening\" (Eng.",
        ": \"invoice\") (198 occurrences), \"kosten\" (Eng.",
        ": \"costs\") (100 occ.",
        "), \"Bill\" (96 occ.)",
        "and \"wetsvoorstel\" (Eng.",
        ": \"piece of legislation\") (77 occ.).",
        "If we make the simplifying assumption for our example that (i) these are the only Dutch translations of our focus word and that (ii) all sense distinctions of \"bill\" are lexicalized in Dutch, we can infer that the English noun \"bill\" has at most four different senses.",
        "These different senses in turn can be grouped in case of synonymy.",
        "In the Dutch-French Europarl, for example, both \"rekening\" and \"kosten\" , are translated by the French \"frais\" , which might indicate that both Dutch words are synonymous.",
        "Several WSD studies are based on the idea of cross-lingual evidence.",
        "Gale et al.",
        "(1993) use a bilingual parallel corpus for the automatic creation of a sense-tagged data set, where target words in the source language are tagged with their translation of the word in the target language.",
        "Diab and Resnik (2002) present an unsupervised approach to WSD that exploits translational correspondences in parallel corpora that were artificially created by applying commercial MT systems on a sense-tagged English corpus.",
        "Ide et al.",
        "(2002) use a multilingual parallel corpus (containing seven languages from four language families) and show that sense distinctions derived from translation equivalents are at least as reliable as those made by human annotators.",
        "Moreover, some studies present multilingual WSD systems that attain state-of-the-art performance in all-words disambiguation (Ng et al., 2003).",
        "The proposed Cross-lingual Word Sense Disambiguation task differs from earlier work (e.g. Ide et al.",
        "(2002)) through its independence from an externally defined sense set.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we present a detailed description of the cross-lingual WSD task.",
        "It introduces the parallel corpus we used, informs on the development and test data and discusses the annotation procedure.",
        "Section 3 gives an overview of the different scoring strategies that will be applied.",
        "Section 4 concludes this paper."

        "Best result evaluation For the best result evaluation, systems can propose as many guesses as the system believes are correct, but the resulting score is divided by the number of guesses.",
