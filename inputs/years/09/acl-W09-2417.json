        "Semantic role labelling (SRL) has been defined as a sentence-level natural-language processing task in which semantic roles are assigned to the syntactic arguments of a predicate (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002).",
        "Semantic roles describe the function of the participants in an event.",
        "Identifying the semantic roles of the predicates in a text allows knowing who did what to whom when where how, etc.",
        "SRL has attracted much attention in recent years, as witnessed by several shared tasks in Sense-val/SemEval (Marquez et al., 2007; Litkowski, 2004; Baker et al., 2007; Diab et al., 2007), and CoNLL (Carreras and Marquez, 2004; Carreras and Marquez, 2005; Surdeanu et al., 2008).",
        "The state-of-the-art in semantic role labelling has now advanced so much that a number of studies have shown that automatically inferred semantic argument structures can lead to tangible performance gains in NLP applications such as information extraction (Surdeanu et al., 2003), question answering (Shen and Lapata, 2007) or recognising textual entailment (Burchardt and Frank, 2006).",
        "However, semantic role labelling as it is currently defined also misses a lot of information that would be beneficial for NLP applications that deal with text understanding (in the broadest sense), such as information extraction, summarisation, or question answering.",
        "The reason for this is that SRL has traditionally been viewed as a sentence-internal task.",
        "Hence, relations between different local semantic argument structures are disregarded and this leads to a loss of important semantic information.",
        "This view of SRL as a sentence-internal task is partly due to the fact that large-scale manual annotation projects such as FrameNet and PropBanktypically present their annotations lexicographically by lemma rather than by source text.",
        "Furthermore, in the case of FrameNet, the annotation effort did not start out with the goal of exhaustive corpus annotation but instead focused on isolated instances of the target words sampled from a very large corpus, which did not allow for a view of the data as 'full-text annotation'.",
        "It is clear that there is an interplay between local argument structure and the surrounding discourse (Fillmore, 1977).",
        "In early work, Palmer et al.",
        "(1986) discussed filling null complements from context by using knowledge about individual predicates and tendencies of referential chaining across sentences.",
        "But so far there have been few attempts to find links between argument structures across clause and sentence boundaries explicitly on the basis of semantic relations between the predicates involved.",
        "Two notable exceptions are Fillmore and Baker (2001) and Burchardt et al.",
        "(2005).",
        "Fillmore and Baker (2001) analyse a short newspaper article and discuss how frame semantics could benefit discourse processing but without making concrete suggestions of how to model this.",
        "Burchardt et al.",
        "(2005) provide a detailed analysis of the links between the local semantic argument structures in a short text; however their system is not fully implemented either.",
        "In the shared task, we intend to make a first step towards taking SRL beyond the domain of individual sentences by linking local semantic argument structures to the wider discourse context.",
        "In particular, we address the problem of finding fillers for roles which are neither instantiated as direct dependents of our target predicates nor displaced through long-distance dependency or coinstantatiation constructions.",
        "Often a referent for an uninstantiated role can be found in the wider context, i.e. in preceding or following sentences.",
        "An example is given in (1), where the charges role (arg2 in PropBank) of cleared is left empty but can be linked to murder in the previous sentence.",
        "(1) In a lengthy court case the defendant was tried for murder.",
        "In the end, he was cleared.",
        "Another very rich example is provided by (2), where, for instance, the experiencer and the object of jealousy are not overtly expressed as syntactic dependents of the noun jealousy but can be inferred to be Watson and the speaker, Holmes, respectively.",
        "(2) Watson won't allow that I know anything of art but that is mere jealousy because our views upon the subject differ.",
        "NIs are also very frequent in clinical reports.",
        "For example, in (3) the experiencer role of \"cough\", \"tachypnea\", and \"breathing\" can be linked to \"twenty-two month old\".",
        "Text mining systems in the biomedical domain focus on extracting relations between biomedical entities and information about patients.",
        "It is important that these systems extract information as accurately as possible.",
        "Thus, finding co-referents for NIs is also very relevant for improving results on mining relations in biomedical texts.",
        "(3) Twenty-two month old with history of recurrent right middle lobe infiltrate.",
        "Increased cough, tachypnea, and work of breathing.",
        "In the following sections we describe the task in more detail.",
        "We start by providing some background on null instantiations (Section 2).",
        "Section 3 gives an overview of the task, followed by a description of how we intend to create the data (Section 4).",
        "Section 5 provides a short description of how null instantiations could be resolved automatically given the provided data.",
        "Finally, Section 6 discusses the evaluation measures and we wrap up in Section 7."

        "The idea of a licensor refers to the fact that either a particular lexical item or a particular grammatical construction must be present for the omission of a frame element (FE) to occur.",
        "For instance, the omission of the agent in (4) is licensed by the passive construction.",
        "(4) No doubt, mistakes were made oProtagonist.",
        "The omission is a constructional omission because it can apply to any predicate with an appropriate semantics that allows it to combine with the passive construction.",

        "(5) We arrived 0Goal at 8pm.",
        "The above two examples also illustrate the second major dimension of variation.",
        "Whereas, in (4) the protagonist making the mistake is only existentially bound within the discourse (instance of indefinite null instantiation, INI), the Goal locationin (5) is anentity that must be accessible to speaker and hearer from the discourse or its context (definite null instantiation, DNI).",
        "Finally note that the licensing construction or lexical item fully and reliably determines the interpretation.",
        "Missing by-phrases always have an indefinite interpretation and whenever arrive omits the Goal lexically, the Goal has to be interpreted as definite, as it is in (5).",
        "The import of this classification to the task here is that we will concentrate on cases of DNI whether they are licensed lexically or constructionally."

        "We chose fiction rather than news because we believe that fiction texts with a linear narrative generally contain more context-resolvable null instantiations.",
        "They also tend to be longer and have a simpler structure than news texts which typically revisit the same facts repeatedly at different levels of detail (in the so-called 'inverted pyramid' structure) and which mix event reports with commentary and evaluation, thus sequencing material that is understood as running in parallel.",
        "Fiction texts should lend themselves more readily to a first attempt at integrating discourse structure into semantic role labeling.",
        "We chose Conan Doyle's work because most of his books are not subject to copyright restrictions anymore, which allows us to freely release the annotated data.",

        "The data set for the FrameNet version of the task will be built at Saarland University, in close cooperation with the FrameNet team in Berkeley.",
        "We aim for the same density of annotation as is exhibited by FrameNet's existing full-text annotationand are currently investigating whether the semantic argument annotation can be done semi-automatically, e.g., by starting the annotation with a run of the Shal-maneser role labeller (Erk and Pado, 2006), whose output is then corrected and expanded manually.",
        "To ensure a high annotation quality, at least part of the data will be annotated by two annotators and then manually adjudicated.",
        "We also provide detailed annotation guidelines (largely following the FrameNet guidelines) and any open questions are discussed in a weekly annotation meeting.",
        "For the annotation of null instantiations and their links to the surrounding discourse we have to create new guidelines as this is a novel annotation task.",

        "We will mark only identity relations but not part-whole or bridging relations between referents.",
        "The set of unrealised roles under consideration includes only the core arguments but not adjuncts (peripheral or extra-thematic roles in FrameNet's terminology).",
        "Possible antecedents are not restricted to noun phrases but include all constituents that can be (local) role fillers for some predicate plus complete sentences (which can sometimes fill roles such as message).",

        "To do this, one can use rules and heuristics based on various syntactic and lexical facts of English.",
        "As an example of a relevant syntactic fact, consider that subjects in English can only be omitted when licensed by a construction.",
        "One such construction is the imperative (e.g.",
        "Please, sit down).",

        "As for using lexical knowledge, consider omissions of the Goods FE of the verb steal in the Theft frame.",
        "FrameNet annotation shows that whenever the Goods FE of steal is missing it is interpreted indefinitely, suggesting that a new instance of the FE being missing should have the same interpretation.",
        "More evidence to the same effect can be derived using Ruppenhofer's (2004) observation that the interpretation of a lexically licensed omission is definite if the overt instances of the FE have mostly definite form (i.e. have definite determiners such as that, the , this), and indefinite if they are mostly indefinite (i.e. have bare or indefinite determiners such as a(n) or some).",
        "The morphology of overt instances of an FE could be inspected in the FrameNet data, or if the predicate has only one sense or a very dominant one, then the frequencies could even be estimated from unannotated corpora.",
        "The third step is linking definite omissions to referents in the context.",
        "This linking problem could be modelled as a co-reference resolution task.",
        "While the work of Palmer et al.",
        "(1986) relied on special lexicons, one might instead want to learn information about the semantic content of different role fillers and then assess for each of the potential referents in the discourse context whether their semantic content is close enough to the expected content of the null instantiated role.",
        "Information about the likely fillers of a role can be obtained from annotated data sets (e.g., FrameNet or PropBank).",
        "For instance, typical fillers of the charges role of clear might be murder, accusations, allegations, fraud etc.",
        "The semantic content of the role could then be represented in a vector space model, using additional unannotated data to build meaning vectors for the attested role fillers.",
        "Meaning vectors for potential role fillers in the context of the null instantiation could be built in a similar fashion.",
        "The likelihood of a potential filler filling the target role can then be modelled as the distance between the meaning vector of the filler and the role in the vector space model (see Padó et al.",
        "(2008) for a similar approach for semi-automatic SRL).",
