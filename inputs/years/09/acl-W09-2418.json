        "Newspaper texts, narratives and other such texts describe events which occur in time and specify the temporal location and order of these events.",
        "Text comprehension, even at the most general level, involves the capability to identify the events described in a text and locate these in time.",
        "This capability is crucial to a wide range of NLP applications, from document summarization and question answering to machine translation.",
        "As in many areas of NLP, an open evaluation challenge in the area of temporal annotation will serve to drive research forward.",
        "The automatic identification of all temporal referring expressions, events, and temporal relations within a text is the ultimate aim of research in this area.",
        "However, addressing this aim in a first evaluation challenge was deemed too difficult and a staged approach was suggested.",
        "The 2007 SemEval task, TempEval (henceforth TempEval-1), was an initial evaluation exercise based on three limited tasks that were considered realistic both from the perspective of assembling resources for development and testing and from the perspective of developing systems capable of addressing the tasks.",
        "We are now preparing TempEval-2, a temporal evaluation task based on TempEval-1.",
        "TempEval-2 is more elaborate in two respects: (i) it is a multilingual task, and (ii) it consists of six subtasks rather than three."

        "TempEval-1 consisted of three tasks:",
        "A. determine the relation between an event and a timex in the same sentence;",
        "B. determine the relation between an event and the document creation time;",
        "C. determine the relation between the main events of two consecutive sentences.",
        "The data sets were based on TimeBank (Puste-jovsky et al., 2003; Boguraev et al., 2007), a hand-built gold standard of annotated texts using the TimeML markup scheme.",
        "The data sets included sentence boundaries, timex3 tags (including the special document creation time tag), and event tags.",
        "For tasks A and B, a restricted set of events was used, namely those events that occur more than 5 times in TimeBank.",
        "For all three tasks, the relation labels used were before, after, overlap, before-or-overlap, overlap-or-after and vague.",
        "For a more elaborate description of TempEval-1, see (Verhagen et al., 2007; Verhagen et al., 2009).",

        "There were six systems competing in TempEval-1: University of Colorado at Boulder (CU-TMP); Language Computer Corporation (LCC-TE); Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST); University of Sheffield (USFD); Universities of Wolverhampton and Allicante (WVALI); and XEROX Research Centre Europe (XRCE-T).",
        "The difference between these systems was not large, and details of system performance, along with comparisons and evaluation, are presented in (Verhagen et al., 2009).",
        "The scores for WVALI's hybrid approach were noticeably higher than those of the other systems in task B and, using relaxed scoring, in task C as well.",
        "But for task A, the highest scoring systems are barely ahead of the rest of the field.",
        "Similarly, for task C using strict scoring, there is no system that clearly separates itself from the field.",
        "Interestingly, the baseline is close to the average system performance on task A, but for other tasks the system scores noticeably exceed the baseline.",
        "Note that the XRCE-T system is somewhat conservative in assigning TLINKS for tasks A and B, producing lower recall scores than other systems, which in turn yield lower f-measure scores.",
        "For task A, this is mostly due to a decision only to assign a temporal relation between elements that can also be linked by the syntactic analyzer."

        "The set of tasks chosen for TempEval-1 was by no means complete, but was a first step towards a fuller set of tasks for temporal parsing of texts.",
        "While the main goal of the division in subtasks was to aid evaluation, the larger goal of temporal annotation in order to create a complete temporal characterization of a document was not accomplished.",
        "Results from the first competition indicate that task A was defined too generally.",
        "As originally defined, it asks to temporally link all events in a sentence to all time expressions in the same sentence.",
        "A clearer task would have been to solicit local anchorings and to separate these from the less well-defined temporal relations between arbitrary events and times in the same sentence.",
        "We expect both inter-annotator agreement and system performance to be higher with a more precise subtask.",
        "Thus, the set of tasks used in TempEval-1 is far from complete and the tasks could have been made more restrictive.",
        "As a result, inter-annotator agreement scores lag, making precise evaluation more challenging.",
        "The overall goal of temporal tagging of a text is to provide a temporal characterization of a set of events that is as complete as possible.",
        "If the annotation graph of a document is not completely connected then it is impossible to determine temporal relations between two arbitrary events because these events could be in separate subgraphs.",
        "Hence, for the current competition, TempEval-2, we have enriched the task description to bring us closer to creating such a temporal characterization for a text.",
        "We have enriched the TempEval-2 task definition to include six distinct subtasks:",

        "In addition, determine value of the features type and val.",

        "E. Determine the temporal relation between two main events in consecutive sentences.",

        "For this task, however, we assume a reduced subset, as introduced in TempEval-1: before, after, overlap, before-or-overlap, overlap-or-after and vague.",
        "However, we are investigating whether for some tasks the more precise set of TimeML relations could be used.",
        "Task participants may choose to either do all tasks, focus on the time expression task, focus on the event task, or focus on the four temporal relation tasks.",
        "In addition, participants may choose one or more of the five languages for which we provide data: English, Italian, Chinese, Spanish, and Korean.",

        "Syntactically, events are typically expressed as inflected verbs, although event nominals, such as \"crash\" in killed by the crash, should also be annotated as EVENTs.",
