        "Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) competitions have focused on general domain texts, as attested in the last Senseval and Semeval competitions (Kil-garriff, 2001; Mihalcea et al., 2004; Pradhan et al., 2007).",
        "Specific domains pose fresh challenges to WSD systems: the context in which the senses occur might change, distributions and predominant senses vary, some words tend to occur in fewer senses in specific domains, and new senses and terms might be involved.",
        "Both supervised and knowledge-based systems are affected by these issues: while the first suffer from different context and sense priors, the later suffer from lack of coverage of domain-related words and information.",
        "Domain adaptation of supervised techniques is a hot issue in Natural Language Processing, including Word Sense Disambiguation.",
        "Supervised Word Sense Disambiguation systems trained on general corpora are known to perform worse when applied to specific domains (Escudero et al., 2000; Martinez and Agirre, 2000), and domain adaptation techniques have been proposed as a solution to this problem with mixed results.",
        "Current research on applying WSD to specific domains has been evaluated on three available lexical-sample datasets (Ng and Lee, 1996; Weeber et al., 2001; Koeling et al., 2005).",
        "This kind of dataset contains hand-labeled examples for a handful of selected target words.",
        "As the systems are evaluated on a few words, the actual performance of the systems over complete texts can not be measured.",
        "Differences in behavior of WSD systems when applied to lexical-sample and all-words datasets have been observed on previous Senseval and Semeval competitions (Kilgarriff, 2001; Mihalcea et al., 2004; Pradhan et al., 2007): supervised systems attain results on the high 80's and beat the most frequent baseline by a large margin for lexical-sample datasets, but results on the all-words datasets were muchmore modest, on the low 70's, and a few points above the most frequent baseline.",
        "Thus, the behaviour of WSD systems on domain-specific texts is largely unknown.",
        "While some words could be supposed to behave in similar ways, and thus be amenable to be properly treated by a generic",
        "WSD algorithm, other words have senses closely linked to the domain, and might be disambiguated using purpose-built domain adaptation strategies (cf.",
        "Section 4).",
        "While it seems that domain-specific WSD might be a tougher problem than generic WSD, it might well be that domain-related words are easier to disambiguate.",
        "The main goal of this task is to provide a multilingual testbed to evaluate WSD systems when faced with full-texts from a specific domain, that of environment-related texts.",
        "The paper is structured as follows.",
        "The next section presents current lexical sample datasets for domain-specific WSD.",
        "Section 3 presents some possible settings for domain adaptation.",
        "Section 4 reviews the state-of-the art in domain-specific WSD.",

        "We will briefly present the three existing datasets for domain-related studies in WSD, which are all lexical-sample.",
        "The most commonly used dataset is the Defense Science Organization (DSO) corpus (Ng and Lee, 1996), which comprises sentences from two different corpora.",
        "The first is the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), which belongs to the financial domain, and the second is the Brown Corpus (BC) which is a balanced corpora of English usage.",
        "191 polysemous words (nouns and verbs) of high frequency in WSJ and BC were selected and a total of 192,800 occurrences of these words were tagged with WordNet 1.5 senses, more than 1,000 instances per word in average.",
        "The examples from BC comprise 78,080 occurrences of word senses, and examples from WSJ consist on 114,794 occurrences.",
        "In domain adaptation experiments, the Brown Corpus examples play the role of general corpora, and the examples from the WSJ play the role of domain-specific examples.",
        "Koeling et al.",
        "(2005) present a corpus were the examples are drawn from the balanced Bn c corpus (Leech, 1992) and the Sports and Finances sections of the newswire Reuters corpus (Rose et al., 2002), comprising around 300 examples (roughly 100 from each of those corpora) for each of the 41 nouns.",
        "The nouns were selected because they were salient in either the Sports or Finances domains, or because they had senses linked to those domains.",
        "The occurrences were hand-tagged with the senses from WordNet version 1.7.1 (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "In domain adaptation experiments the Bnc examples play the role of general corpora, and the Finances and Sports examples the role of two specific domain corpora.",
        "Finally, a dataset for biomedicine was developed by Weeber et al.",
        "(2001), and has been used as a benchmark by many independent groups.",
        "The UMLS Metathesaurus was used to provide a set of possible meanings for terms in biomedical text.",
        "50 ambiguous terms which occur frequently in MED-LINE were chosen for inclusion in the test set.",
        "100 instances of each term were selected from citations added to the MEDLINE database in 1998 and manually disambiguated by 11 annotators.",
        "Twelve terms were flagged as \"problematic\" due to substantial disagreement between the annotators.",
        "In addition to the meanings defined in UMLS, annotators had the option of assigning a special tag (\"none\") when none of the UMLS meanings seemed appropriate.",
        "Although these three corpora are useful for WSD research, it is difficult to infer which would be the performance of a WSD system on full texts.",
        "The corpus of Koeling et al., for instance, only includes words which where salient for the target domains, but the behavior of WSD systems on other words cannot be explored.",
        "We would also like to note that while the biomedicine corpus tackles scholarly text of a very specific domain, the WSJ part of the DSO includes texts from a financially oriented newspaper, but also includes news of general interest which have no strict relation to the finance domain."

        "When performing supervised WSD on specific domains the first setting is to train on a general domain data set and to test on the specific domain (source setting).",
        "If performance would be optimal, this would be the ideal solution, as it would show that a generic WSD system is robust enough to tackle texts from new domains, and domain adaptation would not be necessary.",
        "The second setting (target setting) would be to train the WSD systems only using examples from the target domain.",
        "If this would be the optimal setting, it would show that there is no cost-effective method for domain adaptation.",
        "WSD systems would need fresh examples every time they were deployed in new domains, and examples from general domains could be discarded.",
        "In the third setting, the WSD system is trained with examples coming from both the general domain and the specific domain.",
        "Good results in this setting would show that supervised domain adaptation is working, and that generic WSD systems can be supplemented with hand-tagged examples from the target domain.",
        "There is an additional setting, where a generic WSD system is supplemented with untagged examples from the domain.",
        "Good results in this setting would show that semi-supervised domain adaptation works, and that generic WSD systems can be supplemented with untagged examples from the target domain in order to improve their results.",
        "Most of current all-words generic supervised WSD systems take SemCor (Miller et al., 1993) as their source corpus, i.e. they are trained on SemCor examples and then applied to new examples.",
        "Sem-Cor is the largest publicly available annotated corpus.",
        "It's mainly a subset of the Brown Corpus, plus the novel The Red Badge of Courage.",
        "The Brown corpus is balanced, yet not from the general domain, as it comprises 500 documents drawn from different domains, each approximately 2000 words long.",

        "For instance, (DaumÃ© III, 2007) shows that a simple feature augmentation method for svm is able to effectively use both labeled target and source data to provide the best domainadaptation results in a number of NLP tasks.",
        "His method improves or equals over previously explored more sophisticated methods (DaumÃ© III and Marcu, 2006; Chelba and Acero, 2004).",
        "In contrast, (Agirre and Lopez de Lacalle, 2009) reimplemented this method and showed that the improvement on WSD in the (Koeling et al., 2005) data was marginal.",
        "Better results have been obtained using purpose-built adaptation methods.",
        "Chan and Ng (2007) performed supervised domain adaptation on a manually selected subset of 21 nouns from the DSO corpus.",
        "They used active learning, count-merging, and predominant sense estimation in order to save target annotation effort.",
        "They showed that adding just 30% of the target data to the source examples the same precision as the full combination of target and source data could be achieved.",
        "They also showed that using the source corpus significantly improved results when only 10%-30% of the target corpus was used for training.",

        "al., 2008), the feature augmentation approach was combined with active learning and tested on the OntoNotes corpus, on a large domain-adaptation experiment.",
        "They significantly reduced the effort of hand-tagging, but only obtained positive domainadaptation results for smaller fractions of the target corpus.",
        "In (Agirre and Lopez de Lacalle, 2009) the authors report successful adaptation on the (Koeling et al., 2005) dataset on supervised setting.",

        "The methos has two steps: In the first, a corpus of untagged text from the target domain is used to construct a thesaurus of similar words.",
        "In the second, each target word is disambiguated using pairwise WordNet-based similarity measures, taking as pairs the target word and each of the most related words according to the thesaurus up to a certain threshold.",
        "This method aims to obtain, for each target word, the sense which is the most predominant for the target corpus.",
        "When a general corpus is used, the most predominant sense in general is obtained, and when a domain-specific corpus is used, the most predominant sense for that corpus is obtained (Koeling et al., 2005).",
        "The main motivation of the authors is that the most frequent sense is a very powerful baseline, but it is one which requires hand-tagging text, while their method yields similar information automatically.",
        "The results show that they are able to obtain good results.",
        "In related work, (Agirre et al., 2009) report improved results using the same strategy but applying a graph-based WSD method, and highlight the domain-adaptation potential of unsupervised knowledge-based WSD systems compared to supervised WSD."
