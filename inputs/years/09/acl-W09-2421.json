      "text": [
        "Named entity recognition can be considered the first step towards semantic analysis of texts and a crucial subtask of information extraction systems.",
        "Proper names, besides their high frequency in language, do more than just refer - they convey additional information as instances of general semantic categories.",
        "But NE recognition is, as just mentioned, only the first step for full language processing.",
        "If we want to go beyond the detection of entities, a natural step is establishing semantic relations between these entities, and this is what this paper is about.",
        "There are two fairly independent communities that focus on the task of detecting relations between named entities: the work on anaphora resolution, illustrated by (Mitkov, 2000; Collovini et al., 2007; de Souza et al., 2008) and the work on relation detection in information extraction, see e.g. (Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Zhao and Grishman, 2005; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004).",
        "Although both communities are doing computational semantics, the two fields are largely non-overlapping, and one of the merits of our work is that we tried to merge the two.",
        "Let us briefly describe both traditions: as (Mitkov, 2000) explains, anaphora resolution is concerned with studying the linguistic phenomenon of pointing back to another expression in the text.",
        "The semantic relations between the referents of these expressions can be of different types, being co-reference a special case when the relation is identity.",
        "The focus of anaphora resolution is determining the antecedent chains, although it implicitly also allows to elicit semantic relations between referents.",
        "This task has a long tradition in natural language processing (NLP) since the early days of artificial intelligence (Webber, 1978), and has from the start been considered a key ingredient in text understanding.",
        "A different tradition, within information extraction and ontology building, is devoted to fact extraction.",
        "The detection of relations involving named entities is seen as a step towards a more structured model of the meaning of a text.",
        "The main concerns here (see e.g. (Zhao and Grishman, 2005)) are the extraction of large quantities of facts, generally coupled with machine learning approaches.",
        "Although mentions of named entities may express semantic relations other than identity or dependency, the main focus of the first school has been limited to co-reference.",
        "Yet, relations such as part-of have been considered under the label of indirect anaphora, also known as associative or bridging anaphora.",
        "Contrarywise, the list of relations of interest for the second school is defined simply by world knowledge (not linguistic clues), and typical are the relations between an event and its location, or an organization and its headquarters.",
        "Obviously, these relations do occur between entities that do not involve (direct or indirect) anaphora in whatever broad understanding of the term.",
        "Also, relation detection in the second school does not usually cover identity (cf.",
        "ACE's seven relation types): identity or co-reference is often considered an intermediate step before relation extraction (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004).",
        "In devising the ReRelEM pilot track, our goal was twofold: to investigate which relations could be found between named entities in Portuguese text, and how could a pilot task be devised that compared the performance of different automatic systems supposed to identify them.",
        "It should be emphasized that both MUC and ACE were key inspiration sources for ReRelEM, which stems from Linguateca's emphasis on evaluation.",
        "In fact, we were conversant with MUC co-reference track and the way it was scored, as well as aware of two other related evaluation contests: ACE (Doddington et al., 2004; NIST and ACE, 2007), which extended MUC by dropping the requirement that entities had to be named, and ARE (Orasan et al., 2008), which requested the identification of an anaphoric relation in certain types of predefined relations (identity, synonymy, generalization and specification), but which ignored indirect anaphora (that may convey meronymy, or inclusion, in a broad sense).",
        "ReRelEM, although maintaining (or adding) the restriction to named entitites, is, from our point of view, an advance in the field of relation detection, since we proposed the detection (and classification) of all (relevant) kinds of relations between NEs in a document, providing thus both a merge and an extension of the previous evaluation campaigns.",

        "In order for it to be feasible in the short time we had, the track definition required that both referring expression and their semantic referent were named entities.",
        "Pronouns and definite descriptions were hence excluded.",
        "Note also that ReRelEM was defined in the context of the second edition of a larger evaluation contest dealing with NE detection and classification in Portuguese, HAREM (Santos et al., 2008) (for a detailed description of HAREM, in Portuguese, see also (Santos and Cardoso, 2007; Mota and Santos, 2008)).",
        "HAREM required systems to choose among ten categories (see Table 2), 43 types and 21 subtypes, the later concerning the categories tempo (time) and local (place).",
        "So, it should be emphasized that ReRelEM focuses only on the classification and detection of the relations, not limiting in any way the kinds of (named) entities that can be related (as usualy done in other detection tasks).",
        "It only enforces the kinds of relations that must be identified.",
        "The establishment of an inventory of the most relevant relations between NEs is ultimately subjective, depending on the kind of information that each participant aims to extract.",
        "We have nevertheless done an exploratory study and annotated exhaustively a few texts to assess the most frequent and less controversial (or easier to assign) relations, and came up with just the following relation types for the task proposal:• identity (ident);",
        "• inclusion (inclui (includes) or incluido (included));",
        "For further description and examples see section 3.",
        "However, during the process of building ReRelEM's golden collection (a subset of the HAREM collection used as gold standard), human annotation was felt to be more reliable - and also more understandable - if one specified what \"other\" actually meant, and so a further level of detail (twenty new relations) was selected and marked, see Table 3.",
        "(In any case, since this new refinement did not belong to the initial task description, all were mapped back to the coarser outra relation for evaluation purposes.)",
        "The annotation process began after the annotation of HAREM's golden collection, that is, the relations started to be annotated after all NE had been tagged and totally revised.",
        "For ReRelEM, we had therefore no say in that process - again, ReRelEM was only concerned with the relations between the classified NEs.",
        "However, our detailed consideration of relations helped to uncover - and correct some mistakes in the original classification.",
        "In order to explain the task(s) at hand, let us describe shortly ReRelEM's syntax: In ReRelEM's golden collection, each NE has a unique ID.",
        "A relation between NE is indicated by the additional attributes COREL (filled with the ID of the related entity) and TIPOREL (filled with the name of the relation) present in the NE that corresponds to one of the arguments of the relation.",

        "As a consequence, different systems may tag the same text in different ways, but encoding the same knowledge.",
        "An important difference as to what we expect as relevant relations should be pointed out: instead of requiring explicit (linguistic) clues, as in traditional research on anaphor, we look for all relations that may make sense in the specific context of the whole document.",
        "Let us provide two arguments supporting this decision:",
        "• the first one is philosophical: the borders between world knowledge and contextual inference can be unclear in many cases, so it is not easy to distinguish them, even if we did believe in that separation in the first place;",
        "• the second is practical: marking all possible relations is a way to also deal with unpredictable informational needs, for example for text mining applications.",
        "Take a sentence like \"When I lived in Peru, I attended a horse show and was able to admire breeds I had known only from pictures before, like Falabella and Paso.\".",
        "From this sentence, few people would infer that Paso is a Peruvian breed, but a horse specialist might at once see the connection.",
        "The question is: should one identify a relation between Peru and Paso in this document?",
        "We took the affirmative decision, assuming the existence of users interested in the topic: \"relation of breeds to horse shows: are local breeds predominant?",
        "\".",
        "However, and since this was the first time such evaluation contest was run, we took the following measure: we added the attribute INDEP to the cases where the relation was not possible to be inferred by the text.",
        "In this way, it is possible to assess the frequency of these cases in the texts, and one may even filter them out before scoring the system runs to check their weight in the ranking of the systems.",
        "Interestingly, there were very few cases (only 6) marked INDEP in the annotated collection."
