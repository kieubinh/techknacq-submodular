        "The task of identifying the events and times described in a text and classifying the relations that hold among them has proven to be difficult, however, with reported results for relation classification tasks ranging in F-score from 0.52 to 0.60.",

        "A first attempt to standardize this task was the 2007 Tem-pEval competition(Verhagen et al., 2007).",
        "This competition provided a standardized training and evaluation scheme for automatic temporal interpretation systems.",
        "Systems were pitted against one another on three simple relation-identification tasks.",

        "But, a lot of reporting events are used as main events.",
        "When we consider that important events in news paper are cited, the current TempEval task can miss useful information.",
        "Six participants make very little correct predictions on before-or-overlap, overlap-or-after, and vague.",
        "A reason on the poor prediction can be small distribution in the training data as we can see in Table 1.",
        "Data sparsity problem is a bottleneck in natural language processing.",
        "The addition of the disjunctive relations and vague to the target labels can make the sparsity problem worse.",
        "When we consider the participants' poor performance on the labels, we suggest to use three labels (before, overlap, and after) as the target labels.",
