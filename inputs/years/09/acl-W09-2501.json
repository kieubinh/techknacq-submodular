        "Multi-word expressions (MWEs) can be defined as \"idiosyncratic interpretations that cross word boundaries\", such as traffic light or kick the bucket.",
        "Called a \"pain in the neck for NLP\", they have received considerable attention in recent years and it has been suggested that proper treatment could make a significant difference in various NLP tasks (Sag et al., 2002).",
        "Lhe importance attributed to them is also reflected in a number of workshops (Bond et al., 2003; Lanaka et al., 2004; Moiron et al., 2006; Grégoire et al., 2007).",
        "However, there are few detailed breakdowns of the benefits that improved MWE handling provides to applications.",
        "Lhis paper investigates the impact of MWEs on the \"recognition of textual entailment\" (RLE) task (Dagan et al., 2006).",
        "Our analysis ties in with the pivotal question of what types of knowledge are beneficial for RLE.",
        "A number of papers have suggested that paraphrase knowledge plays a very important role (Bar-Haim et al., 2005; Marsi et al., 2007; Dinu and Wang, 2009).",
        "For example, Bar-Haim et al.",
        "(2005) conclude: \"Our analysis also shows that paraphrases stand out as a dominant contributor to the entailment task.\"",
        "Lhe term \"paraphrase\" is however often construed broadly.",
        "In Bar-Haim et al.",
        "(2005), it refers to the ability of relating lexico-syntactic reformulations such as diathesis alternations, passivizations, or symmetrical predicates (X lent his BMW to YIY borrowed X's BMW).",
        "If \"paraphrase\" simply refers to the use of a language's lexical and syntactic possibilities to express equivalent meaning in different ways, then paraphrases are certainly important to RTE.",
        "But such a claim means little more than that RTE can profit from good understanding of syntax and semantics.",
        "However, given the abovementioned interest in MWEs, there is another possibility: does success in RTE involve proper handling of MWEs, such as knowing that take a pass on is equivalent to aren 'tpurchasing, or kicked the bucket to died?",
        "This seems not too far-fetched: Knowledge about MWEs is under-represented in existing semantic resources like WordNet or distributional thesauri, but should be present in paraphrase resources, which provide similarity judgments between phrase pairs, including MWEs.",
        "The goal of our study is to investigate the merits of this second, more precise, hypothesis, measuring the impact of MWE processing on RTE.",
        "In the absence of a universally accepted definition of MWEs, we define MWEs in the RTE setting as multi-word alignments, i.e., words that participate in more than one word alignment link between premise and hypothesis:",
        "PRE: He died.",
        "HYP: He kicVedlriel^ket.",
        "The exclusion of MWEs that do not lead to multiword alignments (i.e., which can be aligned word by word) is not a significant loss, since these cases are unlikely to cause significant problems for RTE.",
        "In addition, an alignment-based approach has the advantage of generality: Almost all existing RTE models align the linguistic material of the premise and hypothesis and base at least part of their decision on properties of this alignment (Burchardt et al., 2007; Hickl and Bensley, 2007; Iftene and Balahur-Dobrescu, 2007; Zanzotto et al., 2007).",
        "We proceed in three steps.",
        "First, we analyze the Microsoft Research (MSR) manual word alignments (Brockett, 2007) for the RTE2 dataset (Bar-Haim et al., 2006), shedding light on the relationship between alignments and multi-word expressions.",
        "We provide frequency estimates and a coarse-grained classification scheme for multiword expressions on textual entailment data.",
        "Next, we analyze two widely used types of paraphrase resources with respect to their modeling of MWEs.",
        "Finally, we investigate the impact of MWEs and their handling on practical entailment recognition."

        "Other work on RTE has targeted specifically this observation and has described paraphrases on a dependency level (Marsi et al., 2007; Dinu and Wang, 2009).",
        "Setup.",
        "To set the parameters of the two models (i.e., the weights for different lexical resources for UNIQ, and the weights for the edit operation for MANLI), we use the RTE2 development data.",
        "Testing takes place on the RTE2 test and RTE4 datasets.",
        "For MANLI, we performed this procedure twice, with the paraphrase resources described in Section 4 once deactivated and once activated.",
        "We evaluated the output of the Stanford RTE system both on the word alignment level, and on the entailment decision level.",
        "The results for evaluating the MANLI and UNIQ alignments against the manual alignment links in the MSR RTE2 test set are given in Table 4.",
        "We present micro-averaged numbers, where each alignment link counts equally (i.e., longer problems have a larger impact).",
        "The overall difference is not large, but MANLI produces a slightly better alignment.",
        "The ability of MANLI to construct many-to-many alignments is reflected in a different position on the precision/recall curve: the MANLI aligner is less precise than UNIQ, but has a higher recall.",
        "Examples for UNIQ and MANLI alignments are shown in Figures 1 and 2.",
        "A comparison of the alignments shows the pattern to be expected from Table 4: MANLI has a higher recall, but contains occasional questionable links, such as at President – > President in Figure 1.",
        "However, the many-to-many alignments that MANLI produces do not correspond well to the MWE alignments.",
        "The overall impact of the paraphrase resources is very small, and their addition actually hurts MANLFs performance slightly.",
        "A more detailed analysis revealed two contrary trends.",
        "On the one hand, the paraphrase resources provide beneficial information, maybe surprisingly, in the form of broad distributional similarities for single words that were not available from the standard lexical resources (e.g., the alignment \"the company's letter\" – > \"the company's certificate\").",

        "We see this as the practical consequences of our observation from Section 4: The scores in current paraphrase resources are too noisy to support accurate MWE recognition (cf. Table 3).",
        "We finally evaluated the performance of the Stanford system using UNIQ and MANLI alignments on the entailment task.",
        "We consider two datasets: RTE2 test, the alignment evaluation dataset, and the most recent RTE4 dataset, where current numbers for the Stanford system are available from last year's Text Analysis Conference (TAC).",
        "A reasonable conjecture would be that better alignments translate into better entailment recognition.",
        "However, as the results in Tables 5 and 6 show, this is not the case.",
        "Overall, UNIQ outperforms MANLI by several percent accuracy despite MANLI's better alignments.",
        "This \"baseline\" difference should not be overinterpreted, since it may be setup-specific: the features computed in the inference stage of the Stanford system were developed mainly with the UNIQ aligner in mind.",
        "A more significant result is that the integration of paraphrase knowledge in MANLI has no effect on RTE2 test, and even decreases performance on RTE4.",
        "The general picture that we observe is that there is only a loose coupling between alignments and the entailment decision: individual alignments seldom matter.",
        "This is shown, for example, by the alignments in Figures 1 and 2.",
        "Even though MANLI provides a better overall alignment, UNIQ's alignment is \"good enough\" for entailment purposes.",
        "In Figure 1, the two words UNIQ leaves unaligned are a preposition {at) and a light verb (aimed), both of which are not critical to determine whether or not the premise entails the hypothesis.",
        "This interpretation is supported by another analysis, where we tested whether entailments involving at least one true MWE are more difficult to recognize.",
        "We computed the entailment accuracy for all applicable RTE2 test pairs (7%, 58 sentences).",
        "The accuracy on this subset is 62% for the MANLI model without paraphrases, 64% for the MANLI model with paraphrases, and 74% for UNIQ.",
        "The differences from the numbers in Table 5 are not significant due to the small size of the MWE sample, but we observe that the accuracy on the MWE subset tends to be higher than on the whole set (rather than lower).",
        "Futhermore, even though we finally see a small beneficial effect of paraphrases on the MANLI aligner, the UNIQ aligner, which completely ignores MWEs, still performs substantially better.",
        "Our conclusion is that wrong entailment decisions rarely hinge on wrongly aligned MWEs, at least with a probabilistic architecture like the Stanford system.",
        "Consequently, it suffices to recover the most crucial alignment links to predict entailment, and the benefits associated with the use of a more restricted alignment formulation, like the one-to-one alignment formulation of UNIQ, outweighs those of more powerful alignment models, like MANLI's phrasal alignments."

        "Consequently, at least in the Stanford system, the integration of paraphrase knowledge to enable MWE recognition has made almost no difference either in terms of alignment accuracy nor in entailment accuracy.",
        "Furthermore, it is not the case that entailment recognition accuracy is worse for sentences with \"true\" MWEs.",
        "In sum, we find that even though capturing and representing MWEs is an interesting problem in itself, MWEs do not seem to be such a pain in the neck at least not for textual entailment.",
        "Our results may seem to contradict the results of many previous RTE studies such as (Bar-Haim et al., 2005) which found paraphrases to make an important contribution.",
        "However, the beneficial effect of paraphrases found in these studies refers not to an alignment task, but to the ability of relating lexico-syntactic reformulations such as diathesis alternations or symmetrical predicates {buy/sell).",
        "In the Stanford system, this kind of knowledge is already present in the features of the inference stage.",
        "Our results should therefore rather be seen as a clarification of the complementary nature of the paraphrase and MWE issues.",
        "In our opinion, there is much more potential for improvement from better estimates of semantic similarity.",
        "This is true for phrasal similarity, as our negative results for multi-word paraphrases show, but also on the single-word level.",
        "The 2% gain in accuracy for the Stanford system here over the reported TAC RTE4 results stems merely from efforts to clean up and rescale the lexical resources used by the system, and outweighs the effect of MWEs.",
        "One possible direction of research is conditioning semantic similarity on context: Most current lexical resources characterize similarity at the lemma level, but true similarities of word or phrase pairs are strongly context-dependent: obtain and be awarded are much better matches in the context of a degree than in the context of data."
