        "WordNet (Miller, 1995), a manually constructed lexical database, is probably the mostly used resource for lexical inference in NLP tasks, such as Question Answering (QA), Information Extraction (IE), Information Retrieval and Textual Entailment (RTE) (Moldovan and Mihalcea, 2000; Paşca and Harabagiu, 2001; Bar-Haim et al., 2006; Giampiccolo et al., 2007).",
        "Inference using WordNet typically involves lexical substitutions for words in text based on WordNet relations, a process known as lexical chains (Barzilay and Elhadad, 1997; Moldovan and Novischi, 2002).",
        "For example, the answer to \"From which country was Louisiana acquired?\"",
        "can be inferred from \"The United States bought up Louisiana from France\" using the chains 'France => European country => country' and 'buy up => buy => acquire'.",
        "When performing inference between predicates there is an additional complexity on top of lexical substitution: the syntactic relationship between the predicate and its arguments may change as well.",
        "For example, 'X buy Y for Z => Xpay ZforF'.",
        "Currently, argument mappings are not specified for WordNet's relations.",
        "Therefore, correct Word-Net inference chains over predicates can be performed only for substitution relations (mainly synonyms and hypernyms, e.g. 'buy => acquire'), for which argument positions do not change.",
        "Other relation types that may be used for inference cannot be utilized when the predicate arguments need to be traced as well.",
        "Examples include the Word-Net 'entailment' relation (e.g. 'buy => pay') and relations between morphologically derived words (e.g. 'acquire <^ acquisition').",
        "Our goal is to obtain argument mappings for WordNet relations that are often used for inference.",
        "In this paper we address several prominent WordNet relations, including verb-noun derivations and the verb-verb 'entailment' and 'cause' relations, referred henceforth as inferential relations.",
        "Under the Textual Entailment paradigm, all these relations can be viewed as expressing entailment.",
        "Accordingly, we propose a novel framework, called Argument-mapped Word-Net (AmWN), that represents argument mappings for inferential relations as entailment rules.",
        "These rules are augmented with subcategorization frames and functional roles, which are proposed as a generally-needed extension for predicative entailment rules.",
        "Following our new representation scheme, we present a concrete implementation of AmWN for a large number of WordNet's relations.",
        "The mappings for these relations are populated by combining information from manual and corpus-based resources, which provides broader coverage compared to prior work and more accurate mappings.",

      "text": [
        "In our framework we represent argument mappings for inferential relations between predicates through an extension of entailment rules over syntactic representations.",
        "As defined in earlier works, an entailment rule specifies an inference relation between an entailing template and an entailed template, where templates are parse subtrees with argument variables (Szpektor and Da-gan, 2008).",
        "For example, 'X < – L ^Uy – L, y",
        "When a rule is applied to a text, a new consequent is inferred by instantiating the entailed template variables with the argument instantiations of the entailing template in the text.",
        "In our example, \"IBM paid for Cognos\" can be inferred from \"IBM bought Cognos\".",
        "This way, the syntactic structure of the rule templates specifies the required argument positions for correct argument mapping.",
        "However, representing entailment rule structure only by syntactic argument positions is insufficient for predicative rules.",
        "Correct argument mapping",
        "!We plan to make our AmWN publicly available.",
        "depends also on the specific syntactic functional roles of the arguments (subject, object etc.)",
        "and on the suitable subcategorization frame (frame) for the predicate mention - a set of functional roles that a predicate may occur with.",
        "For example, 'X's buyout => buy X' is incorrectly applied to \"IBM's buyout of Cognos\" if roles are ignored, since 'IBM' plays the subject role while X needs to be an object.",
        "Seeking to address this issue, we were inspired by the Nomlex database (Macleod et al., 1998) (see Section 3.2.1) and explicitly specify argument mapping for each frame and functional role.",
        "As in Nomlex, we avoid the use of semantic roles and stick to the syntactic level, augmenting the representation of templates with: (a) a syntactic functional role for each argument; (b) the valid predicate frame for this template mentions.",
        "We note that such functional roles typically coincide with dependency relations of the verbal form.",
        "A rule example is lXsut,j hreak^intransj => damage{tmras} X0^j'.",
        "More examples are shown in Table 1.",
        "Unlike Nomlex records, our templates can be partial: they may contain only some of the possible predicate arguments, e.g. 'huy^transj Xobj', where the subject, included in the frame, is omitted.",
        "Partial templates are necessary for matching predicate occurrences that include only some of the possible arguments, as in \"Cognos was bought yesterday\".",
        "Additionally, some resources, such as automatic rule learning methods (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Sekine, 2005), can provide only partial argument information, and we would want to represent such knowledge as well.",
        "In our framework we follow (Szpektor and Da-gan, 2008) and use only rules between unary templates, containing a single argument.",
        "Such templates can describe any argument mapping by decomposing templates with several arguments into unary ones, while preserving the specification of the subcategorization frame.",
        "To apply a rule, the entailing template must be first matched in the text, which includes matching the template's syntactic dependency structure, functional roles, and frame.",
        "Such procedure requires texts to be annotated with these types of information.",
        "This can be reasonably performed with existing tools and resources, as described for our own text processing in Section 4.",
        "Explicitly matching frames and functional roles in rules avoids incorrect rule applications.",
        "For example, 'Xgb/s buyout => buy X0b/ would be applied only to \"Cognos's buyout by IBM\" following proper role annotation of the text, but not to \"IBM's buyout of Cognos\".",
        "As another example, 'Xsubj breakjiratmras} => damagejtmras} X^f would be applied only to the intransitive occurrence of 'break', e.g. \"The vase broke\", but not to \"John broke the vase\".",
        "Ambiguous cases may occur during annotation.",
        "For example, the role of 'John' in \"John's invitation was well intended\" could be either subject or object.",

        "Since we focus on entailment between predicates, we include only predicative synsets: all verb synsets and noun synsets identified as predicates (see Section 3.2).",
        "In addition, only WordNet relations that correspond to some type of entailment are considered, as detailed in Section 3.2.",
        "In our framework, different subcategorization frames are treated as having different \"meanings\", since different frames may correspond to different entailment rules.",

        "Mapping edges specify entailment rules that require argument mapping, where the entailing and entailed template predicates are replaced by synsets.",

        "Substitution edges connect pairs of predicates, of the same part-of-speech, which preserve argument positions in inference.",
        "This is analogous to how WordNet may be currently used for inference via the synonym and hypernym relations.",

        "AmWN is utilized by generating rule chains for a given input unary template.",
        "First, starting nodes that match the input predicate are selected.",
        "Then, rules are generated by traversing either incoming or outgoing graph edges transitively, depending on the entailment direction requested.",

        "For each Nomlex entry, we extract all possible argument mappings between the verbal and nominal forms, as well as between different argument realizations of the noun.",
        "For example, the mappings 'Xobj's employment <^ employ X0bj and 'Xobj's employment <^ employment of X0bj are derived from the entry in Figure 2.",
        "The major challenge in integrating Nomlex and WordNet is to identify for each Nomlex noun which WordNet synsets describe its predicative meanings.",
        "For example, one synset of 'acquisition' that is derivationally related to 'acquire' is not predicative: \"an ability that has been acquired by training\".",
        "We mark noun synsets as predicative if they are (transitive) hyponyms of the act high-level synset.",
        "Once predicative synsets are identified, we create, for each synset, a node for each subcategorization frame of its noun members, as found in Nomlex-plus.",
        "In some nodes not all original synset members are retained, since not all members share all their frames.",
        "Mapping edges are then added between nodes that have the same frame.",

        "A byproduct of this process is the automatic extension of Nomlex-plus with 5100 new nominalization entries, based on the inherited information.",
        "There are two inferential relations between verbs in WordNet that do not preserve argument positions: cause and entailment.",

        "From the false positives analysis (Table 4) we see that practically all generated rules are correct (99.4%), that is, they would be valid in some contexts.",
        "Almost all errors come from matching errors (including parse errors) and context mismatches, due to our limited IE implementation.",
        "The only two incorrect rules sampled were due to an incorrect Nomlex entry and a WordNet synset that should have been split into two separate senses.",
        "Considering that correct extractions resulted, per our analysis, from correct rules, the analysis of this sample indicates that virtually all AmWN edges that get utilized in practice are correct.",
        "Context mismatches, which constitute the majority of errors (57.2%), occur when the entailing template of a rule is matched in inappropriate contexts.",
        "This occurs typically when the match is against another sense of the predicate, or when an argument is not of the requested type (e.g. \"The Enron sentence\" vs. \"A one month sentence\").",
        "In future work, we plan to address this problem by utilizing context-sensitive application of rules in the spirit of (Szpektor et al., 2008).",
        "Table 5 presents the false negatives analysis.",
        "Most missed extractions are due to rules that were not learned (67.7%).",
        "These mainly involve complex templates ('file a lawsuit <^ sue') and inference rules that are not synonyms/hypernyms ('execute => sentence'), which are not widely annotated in WordNet.",
        "From further analysis, we found that 10% of these misses are due to rules that are generated from AmWN but filtered out by one of our filtering methods (Section 3.3).",
        "12% of the arguments cannot be extracted by rules alone, due to required discourse analysis, while 18% of the mentions were missed due to incorrect syntactic matching.",
        "By assuming correct matches in these cases and avoiding rule filtering, we can estimate the upper bound recall of the rule-set for the ACE dataset to be 40%.",
        "In conclusion, for better performance the system should be augmented with context modeling and better template matching.",
        "Additionally, other rule-bases, e.g.",
        "DIRT (Lin and Pantel, 2001), should be added to increase rule coverage.",

        "The standard entailment rule representation is augmented in our work with functional roles and subcategorization frames, shown to be a feasible extension needed for correct rule application in general.",
        "Our implementation of AmWN populates WordNet with mappings based on combining manual and corpus-based resources.",
        "It covers a broader range of relations compared to prior work and yields more accurate mappings.",
        "We also introduced a novel corpus-based validation mechanism, avoiding rules for infrequent senses.",
        "Our experiments show that AmWN substantially improves standard WordNet-based inference.",
        "In future work we plan to add mappings between verbs and adjectives and between different frames of a verb.",
