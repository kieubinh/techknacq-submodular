        "One of the main aspects of natural languages is to express the same meaning in many possible ways, which directly increase the language variability and emerges the complex structure in dealing with human languages.",
        "Almost all computational linguistics tasks such as Information Retrieval (IR), Question Answering (QA), Information Extraction (IE), text summarization and Machine Translation (MT) have to cope with this notion.",
        "Textual Entailment Recognition was proposed by (Dagan and Glickman, 2004), as a generic task in order to conquer the problem of lexical, syntactic and semantic variabilities in languages.",
        "Textual Entailment can be explained as an association between a coherent text (T) and a language expression, called hypothesis (H) such that entailment function for the pair TH returns the true value when the meaning of H can be inferred from the meaning of T and false, otherwise.",
        "Amongst the approaches to the problem of textual entailment, some methods utilize the notion of distance between the pair of T and H as the main feature which separates the entailment classes (positive and negative).",
        "One of the successful algorithms implemented Tree Edit Distance (TED), based on the syntactic features that are represented in the structured parse tree of each string (Kouylekov and Magnini, 2005).",
        "In this method the distance is computed as the cost of the edit operations (insertion, deletion and substitution) that transform the text T into the hypothesis H. Each edit operation has an associated cost and the entailment score is calculated such that the set of operations would lead to the minimum cost.",
        "Generally, the initial cost is assigned to each edit operation empirically, or based on the expert knowledge and experience.",
        "These methods emerge a critical problem when the domain, field or application is new and the level of expertise and empirical knowledge is very limited.",
        "In dealing with textual entailment, (Kouylekov and Magnini, 2006) tried to experiment different cost values based on various linguistics knowledge and prob-abilistics estimations.",
        "For instance, they defined the substitution cost as a function of similarity between two nodes, or, for insertion cost, they employed Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) of the inserted node.",
        "However, the results could not proven to be optimal.",
        "Other approaches towards estimating the cost of operations in TED tried to learn a generic or discriminative probabilistic model (Bernard et al., 2008; Neuhaus and Bunke, 2004) from the data, without concerning the optimal value of each operation.",
        "One of the drawbacks of those approaches is that the cost values of edit operations are hidden behind the probabilistic model.",
        "Additionally, the cost can not be weighted or varied according to the tree context and node location (Bernard et al., 2008).",

        "One of the approaches to textual entailment is based on the Tree Edit Distance (TED) between T and H. The tree edit distance measure is a similarity metric for rooted ordered trees.",
        "This metric was initiated by (Tai, 1979) as a generalization of the string edit distance problem and was improved by (Zhang and Shasha, 1989) and (Klein, 1998).",
        "The distance is computed as the cost of editing operations (i.e. insertion, deletion and substitution), which are required to transform the text T into the hypothesis H, while each edit operation on two text fragments A and B (denoted as A – > B) has an associated cost (denoted as 7 (A – > B)).",
        "In textual entailment context, the edit operations are defined in the following way based on the dependency parse tree of T and H:",
        "• Insertion (A – > A): insert a node A from the dependency tree of H into the dependency tree of T. When a node is inserted it is attached to the dependency relation of the source label.",
        "• Deletion (A – > A): delete a node A from the dependency tree of T. When A is deleted all its children are attached to the parent of A.",
        "It is not required to explicitly delete the children of A, as they are going to be either deleted or substituted in a following step.",
        "• Substitution (A – > B): change the label of a node A in the source tree into a label of a node B of the target tree.",
        "In the case of substitution, the relation attached to the substituted node is changed with the relation of the new node.",
        "According to (Zhang and Shasha, 1989), the minimum cost mappings of all the descendants of each node has to be computed before the node is encountered, so the least-cost mapping can be selected right away.",
        "To accomplish this the algorithm keeps track of the keyroots of the tree, which are defined as a set that contains the root of the tree plus all nodes which have a left sibling.",
        "This problem can be easily solved using recursive methods (Selkow, 1977), or as it was suggested in (Zhang and Shasha, 1989) by dynamic programming.",

        "where FF and Fh are forests of T and H, while rFr and rFlI are the rightmost roots of the trees in Ft and Fh respectively.",
        "6 is an empty forest.",
        "Moreover, Ft(vft) and Fh(vfh) are the forests rooted in rFj, and rFll respectively.",
        "Estimating 5 as the bottom line of the computation is directly related to the cost of each operation.",
        "Moreover, the cost of edit operations can simply change the way that a tree is transformed to another.",

        "Based on the",
        "lrThe example adapted from (Demaine et al., 2007)",
        "main definition of this approach, TED is the cost of minimum cost edit script between two trees.",
        "The entailment score for a pair is calculated on the minimal set of edit operations that transform the dependency parse tree of T into H. An entailment relation is assigned to a TH pair where the overall cost of the transformations is below a certain threshold.",
        "The threshold, which corresponds to tree edit distace, is empirically estimated over the dataset.",
        "This method was implemented by (Kouylekov and Magnini, 2005), based on the algorithm by (Zhang and Shasha, 1989).",
        "In this method, a cost value is assigned to each operation initially, and the distance is computed based on the initial cost values.",
        "Considering that the distance can vary in different datasets, converging to an optimal set of values for operations is almost empirically impossible.",
        "In the following sections, we propose a method for estimating the optimum set of values for operation costs in TED algorithm dealing with textual entailment problem.",
