        "Open-domain textual inference provides a vast array of challenges to a textual entailment system.",
        "In order to ensure a wide distribution of these challenges in building the PASCAL 2005 corpus (Da-gan et al., 2005), seven different application settings were used for inspiration: Information Retrieval, Comparable Documents, Reading Comprehension, Question Answering, Information Extraction, Machine Translation, and Paraphrase Acquisition.",
        "While PASCAL 2005 and its subsequent challenges have released numerous corpora for open-domain textual inference, many types of textual inference are sparsely represented.",
        "This speaks not to a weakness in the mentioned corpora, but rather the depth and complexity of challenges that textual inference presents.",
        "Purthermore, the open-domain inference task often forces systems to face more than one of these challenges on a single inference pair (such as requiring both an understanding of paraphrases and part-whole relationships).",
        "In many cases, it is desirable to isolate out most of these \"sub-tasks\" within textual inference and concentrate on a single aspect.",
        "Partly for this reason, the Boeing-Princeton-ISI (BPI) Textual Entailment Test Suite was developed.",
        "Its focus is real-world knowledge and not syntactic constructions, so it provides 250 syntactically simple but semantically rich inference pairs.",
        "This paper explores the creation of such a specific textual inference corpus based on verb classes, specifically focusing on the class of motion verbs and their nominalizations.",
        "The goal is to develop a publicly available corpus for spatial inference involving motion.",
        "Section 2 analyzes the properties of such a corpus.",
        "Section 3 outlines the effort to build a motion corpus.",

        "Annotated corpora are designed for training and evaluation for specific classification tasks, and thus an optimal corpus is one that maximizes a system's ability to form a discriminative feature space.",
        "However, knowing ahead of time what the feature space will look like may be difficult.",
        "But, at the same time the corpus should be also reflective of the real world.",
        "One method for developing a useful corpus under these conditions, especially for a specific domain, is to use an existed textual entailment system that can aid in the example generation process.",
        "By using such a system to suggest examples, one is able to both reduce the time (and cost) of annotation as well as producing a corpus with a desirable distribution of features.",

        "Textual inference about motion requires an external representation apart from the text.",
        "While many inference pairs can be solved with strategies such as lexical alignment or paraphrasing, many texts assume the reader has knowledge of the properties of motion.",
        "Table 1 shows two such inference pairs.",
        "The first can be solved through a paraphrase strategy, while the second requires explicit knowledge of the properties of motion that are difficult to acquire through a paraphrasing method.",
        "Unfortunately, most open-domain inference corpora are sparsely populated with such types of inference pairs, so a new corpus is required.",
        "For the purpose of the corpus, the concept of motion is strictly limited to the set of words in the (Levin, 1993) verb-class Motion.",
        "This greatly benefits the annotation process: passages or sentences without a verb or nominalization that fits into the Motion class can immediately be discarded.",
        "Levin's verb classes are easily accessible via VerbNet (Kipper et al., 1998), which provides additional syntactic and semantic information as well as mappings into WordNet (Fell-baum, 1998).",
        "(Muller, 1998) proposes a qualitative theory of motion based on spatio-temporal primitives, while (Pustejovsky and Moszkowicz, 2008) shows an annotation structure for motion.",
        "Furthermore, representing motion requires the complete representation of spatial information, as motion is simply a continuous function that transforms space.",
        "(Hobbs and Narayanan, 2002) discuss many of the properties for spatial representation, including dimensionality, frame of reference, regions, relative location, orientation, shape, and motion.",
        "It is therefore desirable for a motion corpus to require inference over many different aspects of space as well as motion.",
        "Table 2 shows the properties of motion incorporated in the inference system.",

        "The corpus annotation process shall disregard many discourse-related phenomena, including co-reference.",
        "Further, the text and hypothesis for each inference pair will be limited to one sentence.",
        "In this way, knowledge of motion is emphasized over other linguistic tasks."

        "Vd is then updated to reflect the new distribution of verbs and properties in the annotated example set.",
        "There are several items to note.",
        "First, the example might contain multiple properties not chosen by the NextExampleType method.",
        "When a motion event with a path{Mx) is chosen, it is not uncommon for a dest{Mx) property to be a part of the same event.",
        "This is why the Vd and Vf distributions are necessary: they are a feedback mechanism to try to keep the actual distribution, Vd, as close to the desired distribution as possible.",
        "Second, the value for a is the sole pre-specified parameter.",
        "It dictates the likelihood of choosing an example despite its a priori probability.",
        "Setting a to 1.0 will result in only sampling based on the Vf distribution, and setting it to 0.0 will generate a uniform sampling.",
        "In practice, this is set to 0.8 to allow many of the sparse features through.",
        "Third, Vd and Vf account even for properties generated from the uniform distribution.",
        "In practice this means that low-probability events will be generated from U and not Vf, especially later in the sampling process.",
        "Due to the non-independence of the properties as discussed above, this discrepancy is difficult to account for and is considered acceptable: U will still dictate a much higher distribution of low-probability properties than would otherwise be the case.",
        "While the hypothesis itself must be written by the annotator, one can apply some of the same principles to ensure a coverage of motion concepts.",
        "Since not every motion term in the text need be tested by the hypothesis, it is beneficial to keep track of which properties are tested within each.",
        "For this reason, the annotator is responsible for indicating which motion properties are used in the hypothesis.",

        "The purpose of the algorithm from Section 3.1 is not only to build a more balanced corpus, but to do so more quickly.",
        "By looking through examples that are more likely to maintain a balanced corpus, annotators are saved from looking through hundreds (or thousands!)",
        "of examples that contain overly redundant properties.",
        "To illustrate this point, consider a random sample of 2000 sentences.",
        "Table 3 shows the extracted counts for some of the least and most common verbs and properties alongside projections of how many motion sentences would need to be annotated with and without the algorithm to attain a rather modest 20 examples of each.",
        "The results prove that, for many features, the example generation approach allows many more instances of that feature to be placed in the corpus.",
        "The process presented in Section 3.1 bears a close resemblence with active learning, so the differences between the two merit some discussion.",
        "Active learning seeks to improve a specific classifier by selecting training data based on some confidence/score metric for the purpose of improving an overall metric (usually the score across all annotated data).",
        "Often, examples on which the classifier is the least confident are presented to an annotator for manual classification.",
        "Then the system is retrained to include the new data, and the process repeats.",
        "The annotation process presented above, however, is not \"active\" in this same sense.",
        "Instead it seeks a certain distribution of properties regardless of a classifier's ability to accurately perform inferences.",
