        "Other systems based on statistical classifiers and machine learning achieve broad coverage but sacrifice accuracy by using shallow semantic representations (MacCartney et al., 2006).",
        "Natural logic was developed as a compromise between these two extremes (MacCartney and Manning, 2009).",
        "It makes use of rich semantic features while using syntactic representations closely related to the natural language surface strings to achieve broad coverage.",
        "Other work has demonstrated the effectiveness of lexically triggered inferences and presuppositions to the task of natural language entailment and contradiction detection (Nairn et al., 2006; Hickl et al., 2006).",
        "The natural logic model attempted to integrate these insights but recognized the difficulty of treating presuppositions within their current framework.",
        "Natural logic models negation, monotonicity, lexical relations and implicatures together as part of a sentence's asserted content allowing them to be treated through a single projection mechanism.",
        "Presuppositions notoriously do not interact with these features although they do interact with other semantic features requiring a separate projection mechanism.",

        "A defining feature of presuppositions is their invariance under negation so we have (1b) also entailing (1c).",
        "The factive presupposition is said to project through negation to become a presupposition of the entire sentence.",
