        "The project's research methodology particularly focusses on parallelism which means that the researchers rely on a common syntactic theory as well as development tools, but which also concerns parallelism on the level of syntactic analyses.",
        "As the LFG formalism assumes a two-level syntax that divides the analysis into a more language and surface dependent constituent structure and a functional structure which basically represents the surface independent grammatical relations of a sentence, it constitutes a particularly appropriate basis for large-scale, multilingual syntax.",

        "Since the early days of LFG, there has been research on interfacing LFG syntax with various semantic formalisms (Dalrym-ple, 1999).",
        "For the English and Japanese ParGram grammar, a broad-coverage, glue semantic construction has been implemented by (Crouch, 1995; Umemoto, 2006).",
        "In contrast to these approaches, the semantic conversion described in (Crouch and King, 2006) is not driven by a specific semantic theory about meaning representation, nor by a theoretically motivated apparatus of meaning construction.",
        "Therefore, we will talk about \"semantic conversion\" instead of \"construction\" in this paper.",
        "The main idea of the system is to convert the surface-independent, syntactic relations and features encoded in an f-structure to normalized semantic relations.",
        "The representation simplifies many phenomena usually discussed in the formal semantic literature (see the next section), but is tailored for use in Question Answering (Bobrow et al., 2007a) or Textual Entailment (Bobrow et al., 2007b) applications.",
        "The semantic conversion was implemented by means of the XLE platform, used for grammar development in the ParGram project.",
        "It makes use of the built-in transfer module to convert LFG f-structures to semantic representations.",
        "The idea to use transfer rules to model a semantic concstruction has also been pursued by (Spreyer and Frank, 2005) who use the transfer module to model a RMRS semantic construction for the German treebank TIGER .",
        "As a first example, a simplified f-structure analysis for the following sentence and the corresponding semantic representation are given in figure 1.",
        "(1) In the afternoon, John was seen in the park.",
        "The basic idea of the representation exemplified in figure 1 is to represent the syntactic arguments and adjuncts of the main predicate in terms of semantic roles of the context introduced by the main predicate or some higher semantic operator.",
        "Thus, the grammatical roles of the main verb in sentence (1) are semantically normalized such that the subject of the passive becomes a theme and an unspecified agent is introduced, see figure 1.",
        "The role of the modifiers are specified in terms of their head preposition.",
        "This type of semantic representation is inspired by Neo-Davidsonian event semantics (Parsons, 1990).",
        "Other semantic properties of the event introduced by the main verb such as tense or nominal properties such as quantification and cardinality are explicitely encoded as conventionalized predications.",
        "The contexts can be tought of as propositions or possible worlds.",
        "They are headed by an operator that can recursively embed further contexts.",
        "Context embeddings can be induced by lexical items or syntactic constructions and include the following operators: (i) negation (ii) sentential modifiers (possibly) (iii) coordination with or (iv) conditionals (v) some subordinating conjunctions (without) (vi) clause-embedding verbs (doubt).",
        "The representation avoids many formal semantic complexities typically discussed in the literature, for instance the interpretation of quantifiers by encoding them as conventionalized semantic predications.",
        "Given this skolemized first-order language, the task of textual entailment can be conceived as matching the hypothesis representation against the semantic representation of the text where higher-order reasonning is approximated by explicit entailment rules (e.g. all entails some, past does not entail present), see (Bobrow et al., 2007b) for a presentation of an RTE system based on this semantic representation.",
        "The XLE transfer module, which we use for the implementation of the conversion of f-structures to semantic representations, is a term rewrite system that applies an ordered list of rewrite rules to a given f-structure input and yields, depending on the rewrite rules, new f-structures (e.g. translated f-structures) or semantic representations.",

        "The semantic conversion, as described in (Crouch and King, 2006), is not a priori constrained by a formal apparatus of meaning assembly.",
        "The main intuition of the conversion is that the embeddings encoded in the syntactic analysis have to be normalized or reencoded in a way such that they correspond to a semantic embedding.",
        "An example rewrite rule which applies to passive f-structure analyses and converts them to an active analysis is given in figure refpassive-fig.",
        "In order to be maintainable and extensible, the set of transfer rules producing the semantic representations are organized in a modular way.",
        "The main steps of the semantic conversion are given in the following: (i) Flattening of syntax specific f-structure embeddings that don't correspond to semantic embeddings (ii) Canonicalization of grammatical relations (e.g. depassivization) (iii) Marking of items that induce a semantic embedding (which is not encoded in the f-structure) (iv) Linking of f-structure scopes and context of the semantic representation.",

        "This has a number of methodological implications for \"semantic grammar\" development.",
        "For instance, the authors in (de Paiva and King, 2008) argue for large-scale development of a semantics that is based on an application-oriented testsuite of entailment pairs instead of sentences and their theoretically correct representations.",
        "However, in the context of this work, we didn't focus on a semantic application, but we wanted to assess the portability of the semantic representations to other languages directly.",
        "Adopting such a theory-driven perspective on semantic grammar development, the only possibility to account for the accuracy of the semantic construction is to manually inspect the output of the system for a necessarily small set of input sentences.",
        "Moreover, the transfer scenario complicates the assessment of the system's coverage.",
        "While in (Bos et al., 2004), the coverage of the meaning construction can be quantified by the number of syntactic analysis that the construction algorithm can process, the transfer conversion will never fail on a given syntactic input.",
        "Since the transfer rules just try to match the input, the unmatched features just pass unchanged to the output and will be probably deleted by some of the catchall rules which remove remaining syntactic features in the final step of the conversion.",
        "Therefore, manual inspection is necessary to see whether the conversion has processed all the input it was supposed to process.",
        "This limited evaluation scenario entails that the semantics developer has to think hard about defining the set of phenomena he wants to cover and document precisely which type of syntactic phenomena his semantics intends to assign an interpretation to.",
        "Therefore, in the rest of this section, we will try to give a concrete overview of the type of phenomena that is covered by the English-German semantics.",

        "As our base English semantics implicitely defines a set of core phenomena interpreted by the syntax-semantic interface, we dispose of a set of grammatical f-structure relations that receive a particular semantic representation.",
        "Fortunately, the developers of the English semantics had documented many \"core\" transfer rules (assuring the normalization and context embedding) with example phrases or sentences such that one could easily reconstruct the type of phenomenon each transfer rule was intended to analyze.",
        "On the basis of this system documentation, we first conceived an English testsuite where each sentence contained a construction related to the application of a specific transfer rule.",
        "For each of the sentences we selected a German sentence which exhibited the German counterpart of the phenomenon targeted in the English sentence.",
        "For instance, if a transfer rule for relative clauses fired on a given English sentence we translated the German sentence such that it contained a relative clause.",
        "As most of the test sentences target fairly general phenomena at the syntax-semantic interface (see the next section), there was a parallel German realization of the construction in most of the cases.",
        "In cases where no straightforward parallel realization could be found, we recur to a semantically parallel translation.",
        "For instance, the English cleft construction exemplified by the following sentence of our testsuite, does not have a syntactically parallel realization in German.",

        "Out of these 47 rules, 23 rules relate to real structural differences in the f-structure encoding for German and English.",
        "The rest of the modifications is mainly due to renamings of the features or lexical items that are hard-coded in the transfer grammar.",
        "While in a more surface-oriented syntax, it would be hardly possible to design largely parallel syntax-semantic interfaces for the range of phenomena listed in the last section, the surface-independence (and the resulting relative crosslingual generality) of LFG f-structures ensures that a major part of the English core semantics straightforwardly applies to the German input.",
        "An impressive illustration of the language independence of LFG f-structure analyses in the ParGram grammars is the pair of analyses presented in figure 3, produced by the semantic conversion for the example pair in (3).",
        "The representation for the German sentence was produced by running the English transfer semantics on German syntactic input.",
        "Although the word-order of English and German questions is governed by distinct syntactic principles, the semantic representation of the German sentence is almost entirely correct since the f-structure analyses abstract from the word-order differences.",
        "The only fault in the German representation in 3 is the interpretation of the temporal adverb yesterday - gestern.",
        "The transfer rule for temporal verb modification didn't fire because the adverb type features for English and German differ.",
        "The crosslinguistic parallelism of the semantics presented in this paper is also due to the relative coarse-grained level of representation that interprets many phenomena prone to subtle crosslingual divergences (e.g. the interpretation of quantifiers or tense and aspect) in terms of conventionalized predications, e.g. the interpretation of tense as past(see) in figure 1.",
        "Thus, the real semantic interpretation of these phenomena is deferred to later representation or processing layers, as in this framework, to the definition of entailment relations (Bobrow et al., 2007b).",
        "A meaning representation that defers much of the semantic interpretation to the formulation of entailment rules runs the obvious risk of making to few theoretical generalizations which results in very complex entailment rules.",
        "This section will briefly illustrate this problem by discussing the representation of clause-embeddings in our semantics.",
        "The various semantic operators defined by the semantic conversion to induce an embedding (see section 2.1) embed a semantic entity of the type context which can be roughly considered as the common semantic type of \"proposition\".",

        "whom the speaker is not committed to, i.e. which aren't veridical.",
        "In our system, the veridicality inferences that these embeddings exhibit are computed by further knowledge representation modules that explicitely represent the speaker commitment of a context (Bobrow et al., 2007b).",
        "Concerning the complements of clause-embedding verbs, these inferences are modelled via a lexical verb classification that basically distinguishes im-plicatives (manage to TRUE - don't manage to FALSE) and factives (know that TRUE don't know that TRUE) (Nairn et al., 2006).",

        "This account of clause-embeddings - a unified semantic representation and a lexical entailment classification - generalizes and probably simplifies too much the various theoretical insights into the semantics of complementation.",
        "In the formal semantics literature, various theories opt for a semantic representation that assumes several types of abstract semantic entities (e.g. events (Parsons, 1990), situations (Barwise and Perry, 1999) or other, very fine-grained categories (Asher, 1993) ).",
        "In terms of entailment, the typological literature reports crosslingually relatively stable distinctions of types of complements according to the semantic relations the matrix verbs have to their complement (Givon, 1990).",
        "For instance, while in example (5), the infinite complement has causal, temporal and spatial relations to the matrix event, there is no such inferential relation between matrix and complement in example (4) .",
        "(5) Seine Freundin brachte ihn dazu, ein Haus zu bauen.",
        "His girlfriend made him build a house.",
        "Moreover, the semantics of clause-embedding verbs shows subtle distinctions with resepct to other linguistic features (apart from the polarity of the context) that can trigger a particular speaker commitment.",

        "In sentence (6), the imperfect aspect causes the modality of the complement such that it is not necessarily true, while in sentence (7), the embedded clause is necessarily true due to the perfective aspect of the clause-embedding verb.",
        "This aspectual matrix-com-plement relation is however only observable for certain types of modality or clause-embedding verbs and has no clear semantic parallel in other languages that don't have aspectual marking.",
        "For another type of clause-embedding verbs, called epistemic verbs, the recent formal semantics literature discusses many examples where the lexical neutral entailment class is overriden by pragmatic interpretation constraints that cause the embedded complement to be interpreted as true although the embedding operator does not entail the veridicality of its complement (Simons, 2006; von Fintel and Gillies, 2007).",
        "As an example, consider the following text - hypothesis pair annotated as a valid entailment in the Pascal RTE 3 set altough the hypothesis clearly refers to an embedded proposition in the given text.",
