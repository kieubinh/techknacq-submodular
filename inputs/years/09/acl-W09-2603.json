        "Rule-based, human-curated approaches are thought to be more accurate for linguistic constructions explicitly covered by the rules.",
        "However, such approaches often have trouble scaling up to a wider range of phenomena or different genres of text.",
        "There have been repeated moves towards hybridized approaches, in which rules created with human linguistic intuitions are supplemented by automatically derived corpus data (cf. (Klavans and Resnik, 1996)).",
        "Unstructured corpus data for English can easily be found on the Internet.",
        "Large corpora of text annotated with part of speech information are also available (such as the British National Corpus).",
        "However, it is much harder to find widely available, large corpora annotated for syntactic or semantic structure.",
        "The Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) has until recently been the only such corpus, covering 4.5M words in a single genre of financial reporting.",
        "At the same time, the accuracy and speed of syntactic parsers has been improving greatly, so that in recent years it has become possible to automatically create parsed corpora of reasonable quality, using much larger amounts of text with greater genre variation.",
        "For many NLP tasks, having more training data greatly improves the quality of the resulting models (Banko and Brill, 2001), even if the training data are not perfect.",
        "We have access to the entire English-language text of Wikipedia (about 2M pages) that was parsed using the XLE parser (Riezler et al., 2002), as well as an architecture for distributed data-mining within this corpus, called Oceanography (Waterman, 2009).",
        "Using the parsed corpus, we extract a large volume of dependency relations and derive lexical models that significantly improve a rule-based system for determining the underlying argument structure of deverbal noun constructions."

      "heading": "2. Deverbal Argument Mapping",
      "text": [
        "Deverbal nouns, or nominalizations, are nouns that designate some aspect of the event referred to by the verb from which they are morphologically derived (Quirk et al., 1985).",
        "For example, the noun destruction refers to the action described by the verb destroy, and destroyer may refer to the agent of that event.",
        "Deverbal nouns are very common in English texts: by one count, about half of all sentences in written text contain at least one deverbal noun (Gurevich et al., 2008).",
        "Thus, a computational system that aims to match multiple ways of expressing the same underlying events (such as question answering or search) must be able to deal with deverbal nouns.",
        "To interpret deverbal constructions, one must be able to map nominal and prepositional modifiers to the various roles in the verbal frame.",
        "For intransitive verbs, almost any argument of the deverbal noun is mapped to the verb's subject, e.g. abundance of food gives rise to subj(abound, food).",
        "If the underlying verb is transitive, and the deverbal noun has two arguments, the mappings are also fairly straightforward.",
        "For example, the phrase Carthage's defeat by Rome gives rise to the arguments subj(defeat, Rome) and obj(defeat, Carthage), based on knowledge that a \"by\" argument usually maps to the subject, and the possessive in the presence of a \"by\" argument usually maps to the object (Nunes, 1993).",
        "However, in many cases a deverbal noun has only one argument, even though the underlying verb may be transitive.",
        "In such cases, our system has to decide whether to map the lone argument of the deverbal onto the subject or object of the verb.",
        "This mapping is in many cases obvious to a human: e.g., the king's abdication corresponds to subj(abdicate, king), whereas the room's adornment corresponds to obj(adorn, room).",
        "In some cases, the mapping is truly ambiguous, e.g., They enjoyed the support of the Queen vs.",
        "They jumped to the support of the Queen.",
        "Yet in other cases, the lone argument of the deverbal noun is neither the subject nor the object of the underlying verb, but it may correspond to a different (e.g. prepositional) argument of the verb, as in the travels of1996 (corresponding to someone traveled in 1996).",
        "Finally, in some cases the deverbal noun is being used in a truly nominal sense, without an underlying mapping to a verb, as in Bill Gates' foundation, and the possessive is not a verbal argument.",
        "The predictive models in this paper focus on this case of single arguments of deverbal nouns with transitive underlying verbs.",
        "To constrain the scope of the task, we focus on possessive arguments, like the room's adornment, and 'of' arguments, like the support of the Queen.",
        "Our goal is to improve the accuracy of verbal roles assigned in such cases by creating lexically-specific preferences for individual deverbal noun / verb pairs.",
        "Some of our experiments also take into account some lexical properties of the deverbal noun's arguments.",
        "The lexical preferences are derived by comparing argument preferences of verbs with those of related deverbal nouns, derived from a large parsed corpus using Oceanography.",
        "We have a list of approximately 4000 deverbal noun / verb pairs, constructed from a combination of WordNet's derivational links (Fellbaum, 1998), NomLex (Macleod et al., 1998), NomL-exPlus (Meyers et al., 2004b) and some independent curation.",
        "In the current system implementation, we attempt to map deverbal nouns onto corresponding verbs using a small set of heuristics described in (Gurevich et al., 2008).",
        "We distinguish between event nouns like destruction, agentive nouns like destroyer, and patient-like nouns like employee.",
        "If a deverbal noun maps onto a transitive verb and has only one argument, the heuristics are as follows.",
        "Arguments of agentive nouns become objects while the nouns themselves become subjects, so the ship s destroyer maps to subj(destroy, destroyer); obj(destroy, ship).",
        "Arguments of patientlike nouns become subjects while the nouns themselves become objects, so the company's employee becomes subj(employ, company); obj(employ, employee).",
        "The difficult case of event nouns is currently handled through default mappings: possessive arguments become subjects (e.g., his confession – subj(confess, he)), and 'of' arguments become objects (e.g., confession ofsin – obj(confess, sin)).",
        "However, as we have seen from examples above, these defaults are not always correct.",
        "The correct mapping depends on the lexical nature of the deverbal noun and its corresponding verb, and possibly on properties of the possessive or 'of' argument as well.",
        "The deverbal argument mapping occurs in the context of a larger semantic search application, where the goal is to match alternate forms expressing similar concepts.",
        "We are currently processing the entire text of the English-language Wikipedia, consisting of about 2M unique pages.",
        "Parsing in this system is done using the XLE parser (Kaplan and Maxwell, 1995) and a broad-coverage grammar of English (Riezler et al., 2002; Crouch et al., 2009), which produces constituent structures and functional structures in accordance with the theory of Lexical-Functional Grammar (Dalrymple, 2001).",
        "Parsing is followed by a semantic processing phase, producing a more abstract argument structure.",
        "Semantic representations are created using the Transfer system of successive rewrite rules (Crouch and King, 2006).",
        "Numerous constructions are normalized and rewritten (e.g., passives, relative clauses, etc.)",
        "to maximize matching between alternate surface forms.",
        "This is the step in which deverbal argument mapping occurs.",
        "To evaluate the performance of the current and experimental argument mappings, we extracted a random set of 1GGG sentences from the parsed Wikipedia corpus in which a deverbal noun had a single possessive argument.",
        "Each sentence was manually annotated with the verb role mapping between the deverbal and the possessive arguments.",
        "One of six labels were assigned:",
        "• Subject, e.g. John's attention",
        "• Object, e.g. arrangement of flowers",
        "• Other: there is an underlying verb, but the relationship between the verb and the argument is neither subject nor object; these relations often appear as prepositional arguments in the verbal form, e.g.",
        "Declaration ofDelhi",
        "• Noun modifier: the argument modifies the nominal sense of the deverbal noun, rather than the underlying verb, although there is still an underlying event, as in director of25 years",
        "• Not deverbal: the deverbal noun is not used to designate an event in this context, e.g. the rest ofthem",
        "• Error: the parser incorrectly identified the argument as modifying the deverbal, or as being the only argument of the deverbal",
        "Similarly, we extracted a sample of 75G sentences in which a deverbal noun had a single 'of' argument, and annotated those manually.",
        "The distribution of annotations is summarized in Table 1.",
        "For possessive arguments, the prevalent role was subject, and for 'of' arguments it was object.",
        "The defaults will correctly assign the majority of arguments roles.",
        "Our basic premise is that knowledge about role-mapping behavior of particular verbs will inform the role-mapping behavior of their corresponding deverbal nouns.",
        "For example, if a particular argument of a given verb surfaces as the verb's subject more often than as object, we might also prefer the subject role when the same argument occurs as a modifier of the corresponding deverbal noun.",
        "However, as nominal modification constructions impose their own role-mapping preferences (e.g., possessives are more likely to be subjects than objects), we expect different distributions of arguments to appear in the various deverbal modification patterns.",
        "Making use of this intuition requires collecting sufficient information about corresponding arguments of verbs and deverbal nouns.",
        "This is available, given a large parsed corpus, a reasonably accurate and fast parser, and enough computing capacity.",
        "The remainder of the paper details our data extraction, model-building methods, and the results of some experiments."

        "The advantage of this evaluation is that it is very fast to run and is easily reproducible outside of our specialized environment.",
        "This evaluation differed from the full-pipeline evaluation in two ways: (1) it did not distinguish event deverbals from agentive and patient-like deverbals, thus possibly introducing errors, and (2) it did not look up all argument lemmas to find out their animacy.",

        "Of these, 20 deverbal nouns were predicted by the model to prefer objects (e.g., Hopkins' accusation), and 19 did not get assigned either subject or object due to other errors (including a few mislabeled evaluation sentences).",
        "Some of the false negatives involved deverbal nouns that refer to reciprocal predicates such as his marriage, or causative ones such as Berlin's unity, which could map to subject or objects.",
        "Our current system does not allow us to express such ambiguity, but it is a possible future improvement.",
        "Looking at the false negatives produced by the all-arg model, 3 deverbal nouns received more accurate predictions with the animacy model (e.g., his sight; Peter Kay's statement).",
        "Intuitively, the animacy model should in general make more informed decisions about the argument mappings because it takes properties of individual arguments into account.",
        "However, as we have seen, it does not in fact outperform the model that treats all arguments the same way.",
        "We believe this is due to the fact that the an-imacy model was trained on less data than the all-arg model, because we only considered animate pronouns and common nouns when generating argument-mapping predictions.",
        "Excluding all named entities and non-animate pronouns most likely had an effect on the number of deverbals for which the model was able to make accurate predictions.",
        "In the next iteration, we would like to use all available arguments, relying on the named entity type and information available in WordNet for common nouns to distinguish between animate and inanimate arguments.",
        "The all-arg model evaluation resulted in 131 false positives (cases where the model predicted the relation to be 'subject', but the human judge thought it was something else).",
        "Of these, 105 were marked by the human judge as having objects, 8 as having a verbal relation other than subject or object, 9 as having nominal modifiers, 9 has having no deverbal.",
        "Altogether, false positives covered 85 unique verbs.",
        "Of these, 48 had been explicitly predicted by our model to prefer subjects, and the rest had no explicit prediction, thus defaulting to having a subject.",
        "3 of these deverbals would have been correctly identified as having objects by the animacy model (e.g., his composition; her representation).",
        "Although it is hard to predict the outcome of a statistical model, we feel that more reliable information about the animacy of arguments at training time would improve the performance of the ani-macy model, potentially making it better than the all-arg model.",
        "The evaluation procedure for 'of' arguments was the same as for possessive arguments, except that the default argument mapping was 'object', and the evaluated decision was whether a particular role was object or non-object.",

        "One of the earliest computational attempts to derive argument structures for deverbal nouns is (Hull and Gomez, 1996), with hand-crafted mapping rules for a small set of individual nouns, exemplifying a highly precise but not easily scalable method.",
        "In recent years, NomBank (Meyers et al., 2004a) has provided a set of about 200,000 manually annotated instances of nominalizations with arguments, giving rise to supervised machine-learned approaches such as (Pradhan et al., 2004) and (Liu and Ng, 2007), which perform fairly well in the overall task of classifying deverbal arguments.",
        "However, no evaluation results are provided for specific, problematic classes of nominal arguments such as possessives; it is likely that the amount of annotations in NomBank is insufficient to reliably map such cases onto verbal arguments.",
        "(Padó et al., 2008) describe an unsupervised approach that, like ours, uses verbal argument patterns to deduce deverbal patterns, though the resulting labels are semantic roles used in SLR tasks (cf. (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2000)) rather than syntactic roles.",

        "We have demonstrated that large amounts of lexical data derived from an unsupervised parsed corpus improve role assignment for deverbal nouns.",
        "The improvements are significant even with a relatively small training set, relying on parses that have not been hand-corrected, using a very simple prediction model.",
        "Larger amounts of extracted data improve performance even more.",
        "There is clearly still headroom for improvement in this method.",
        "In a pilot study, we used argument preferences for individual deverbal-argument pairs, falling back to deverbal-only generalizations when more specific patterns were not available.",
        "This model had slightly higher precision and slightly lower recall than the deverbal-only model, suggesting that a more sophisticcated probabilistic prediction model may be needed.",
        "In addition, performance should improve if we allow non-binary decisions: in addition to mapping deverbal arguments to subject or object of the underlying verb, we could allow mappings such as \"unknown\" or \"ambiguous\".",
        "The same training sets can be used to produce a model that makes a 3 or 4-way split.",
        "In the possessive and 'of' sets, the \"unknown / ambiguous\" class would cover between 15% and 20% of all the data.",
        "This third possibility becomes even more important for other deverbal arguments.",
        "For example, if the deverbal noun has a prenominal modifier (as in city destruction), in a third of the cases the underlying relation is neither the subject nor the object (Lapata, 2002).",
        "And, of course, the methodology of extracting lexical preferences based on large parsed corpora can be applied to many other NL tasks not related to deverbal nouns."
