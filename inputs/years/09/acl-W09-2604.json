        "Hausa is a tone language spoken by over 30 million speakers in Northern Nigeria and bordering areas of Niger.",
        "Genetically, the language belongs to the Chadic sub-branch of the Afroasiatic family.",
        "In this language, both tone and length are lexically and grammatically distinctive: Hausa distinguishes two vowel lengths, as well as two underlying tones, H(igh) and L(ow).",
        "At the surface level, we can observe two level tones, as well as one contour tone (fall).",
        "Wolff (1993) cites the following minimal pairs for tone:",
        "b. fari – 'dry season' c. fan – 'white/whiteness'",
        "Rising tone only results from the interaction of grammatical and intonational tone (Sharon Inkelas and Cobler, 1987; Inkelas and Leben, 1990).",
        "In addition to its function of differentiating lexical items, tone is also grammatically distinctive:",
        "the paradigms of subjunctive and preterite (relative completive) TAM markers partially overlap in terms of their segments (ka '2sg.subj, ya '3sg.m.subj', ta '3sg.f.subj' vs. ka '2sg.rel.compl, ya '3sg.m.rel.compl', ta '3sg.f.rel.compl').",
        "Further, the bound possessive linker and the previous reference (=specificity) marker are systematically distinguished by tonal means alone.",
        "gown.f-of.f Audi.m 'Audu's gown' gown.f-spec.f 'the (aforementioned) gown town.m-of.m Kano 'Kano town' b. birni-n town.m-spec.m 'the (aforementioned) town'",
        "Similarly, vowel lengthis also distinctive onboth lexical and grammatical levels: Newman (2000) cites the following pair (inter alia): f&sa 'postpone' vs. fasai 'smash'.",
        "Examples of grammatical length distinctions can again be found in the areas of TAM marking: in relative clauses and focus constructions, completive aspect is expressed by means of the relative completive set (or preterite), using short vowel na '1.sg.rel.compl, ka '2.sg.rel.compl', ya '3.sg.m.rel.compl' and ta '3.sg.f.rel.compl', inter alia, which contrasts with the long vowel absolute completive na, ka, ya, and ta used elsewhere (see Jaggar (2006) for discussion of the use of the preterite in narratives).",
        "Furthermore, Hausa uses verb-final vowel length to signal presence of a following in-situ direct object (Hayes, 1990; Crys-mann, 2005).",
        "Despite the fact that the sophisticated models of suprasegmental phonology developed more than a quarter of a century ago within Autosegmental",
        "Theory (Goldsmith, 1976; Leben, 1973) have already been rigorously formalised in the nineties in the context of feature-structure-based computational phonology (Bird, 1995; Scobbie, 1991; Bird and Klein, 1994; Walther, 1999), the representation of tone and length has received little or no attention in the area of grammar engineering.",
        "This may be partly due to the fact that the languages for which substantial grammars have been developed are not tone languages.",
        "Existing grammar implementations of tone languages like Chinese (Fang and King, 2007) do not appear to make use of au-tosegmental models either, possibly because the assignment of tone in an isolating language is not as intimately connected to inflectional and derivational processes, as it is in a morphologically rich language like Hausa.",
        "In this paper, I shall argue that the issue of suprasegmental phonology is an integral part of any implemented grammar of Hausa, not only from the point of view of linguistic adequacy, but also under grammar-engineering and application-oriented perspectives.",
        "I shall propose a treatment of tone and length in an LKB-grammar of Hausa that systematically builds on separate representations of segments, tone and length and discuss how various salient aspects of Hausa syntax and morphology can be addressed using a representation inspired by Autosegmental Theory.",
        "Furthermore, I shall address how different levels of suprasegmental information encoded in the different writing systems employed in the language can be robustly integrated into a single grammar, and explore its application potential."

      "text": [
        "Modern Hausa is standardly written using (a modified version of) the Latin script, called bokdo.",
        "In addition to the standard 26 letters of the Latin alphabet, Boko uses hooked letters, the apostrophe, as well as digraphs to represent glottalised consonants (6, tf, fi, ts [s'], 'y [Pj], ' [?]).",
        "Yet, neither tone nor length are represented in the standard orthography.",
        "In contrast to the standard orthography, tone and length are typically fully represented in the academic literature on Hausa.",
        "Besides reference grammars and other scientific publications on the language, this includes lexica, some of which exist in machine-readable form (e.g., the on-line version of Bargery (1934) at http://bargeryhausa.",
        "gotdns.com/).",
        "Length in scientific publications is typically marked using one of the following strategies: diacritical marking of long (macron or postfixed colon; Newman (2000; Jaggar (2001)) or short vowels (ogonek; Newman and Ma Newman (1977)), and segmental gemination of vowels (long) (Wolff, 1993).",
        "Regardless of whether the strategy is diacritic or segmental, there is a strong tendency to have short vowels unmarked, representing the length information on long vowels only.",
        "Tone, by contrast, is exclusively marked by means of diacritics: again, two systems are typically used, one marking low tone with a grave accent leaving high tone unmarked, the other marking high tone with an acute accent, leaving low tone unmarked.",
        "Besides that, fully toned representations can also occasionally be found (using acute and grave accents).",
        "Falling tone, which phonologically corresponds to a H-L contour associated with a single heavy syllable, is standardly marked with a circumflex accent.",
        "Rising tone, by contrast, which only ever plays a role in intonational phonology, as mentioned in section 1, is typically not represented.",
        "Apart from the scientific literature, full representation of suprasegmental information is also provided in most of the Hausa language teaching literature, e.g. Cowan and Schuh (1976; Jungraithmayr et al.",
        "(2004).",
        "Conventions tend to follow those found in the scientific literature, given that Hausa language teaching often forms an integral part of African linguistics curricula.",
        "The marking strategy assumed in this paper follows the one found in Newman (2000) and Jaggar (2001), using diacritics for low and falling tones, taking high tone as the default.",
        "Long vowels are marked by a macron.",
        "Besides the now standard Latin orthography, Hausa has been written traditionally using a slightly modified version of the Arabic script called ajami.",
        "Today, Ajami is still used occasionally, mainly in the context of religious texts.",
        "Just like Boko, Ajami does not represent tone.",
        "Owing to the Semitic origin of the script, however, length distinctions are indeed captured: while short vowels are solely marked by diacritics, if at all, long vowels are represented using a combination of letters and diacritics: long front vowels (/i:/ and /e:/) using the letter ya (otherwise used for the palatal glide /j/, long back vowels using the letter wau (j), also used for the labio-velar glide /w/, and long /a:/ being represented by alif (I).",
        "Vowel quality (/i:/ vs. /e:/ and /o:/ vs. /u:/) is differentiated by means of diacritics.",
        "Thus, depending on the writing system, different levels of suprasegmental information need to be processed, ranging from full representation in scientific and educational texts, over partial representation (Ajami), to complete absence of any tone or length marking (Boko).",
        "This means that the grammar should be able to extract what information is available, and robustly deal with both specified and underspecified input.",
        "This is even more important, if we want to include applications, where input in parsing is an underspecified representation, but output in generation requires full specification of suprasegmentals, e.g., in TTS or CALL scenarios."

        "On the segmental level, affixes can be divided into fully specified suffixes, and reduplicative suffixes.",
        "Although partial and full reduplication of entire CV-sequences can also be observed, probably the most common reduplicative pattern involves reduplication and gemination of root consonants, with vowel melodies prespecified.",
        "Tonally, affixes fall into one of three categories: affixes lexically unspecified for tone (only prefixes), tone-integrating affixes (suffixes only) and non-integrating affixes.",
        "While non-integrating affixes only specify their own lexical tone, possibly affecting the segmental and suprasegmental realisation of a preceding syllable, tone-integrating suffixes holistically assign a tonal melody to the entire word they attach to.",
        "In contrast to tone, which is often assigned to the entire morphological word, alternations in length do not tend to affect the entire base, but rather only syllables at morpheme boundaries.",
        "Hausa plurals represent the prototypical case of tone-integrating affixation.",
        "The language has an extremely rich set of morphological patterns for plural formation: Newman (2000) identifies 15 classes, many of which have between 2 and 6 subclasses.",

        "Among these 15 plural classes, three are particularly productive, most notably classes 1-3.",

        "Length specifications, by contrast are carried over from the base, except of course for the base-final vowel.",

        "An example of a prefix of the latter type is provided by the reduplicative prefixes Ci VCi- and C VC2 found with pluractional verbs.",
        "These prefixes consists of an initial consonant that copies the first consonant of the base, followed by a short vowel copying the irst vowel of the base (possibly undergoing centralisation).",

        "The tonal pattern assigned to Hausa verbs are determined by paradigm membership, the so-called grade (Parsons, 1960), together with the number of syllables.",
        "Tone melodies range from monotonal, over bitonal, to maximally tritonal patterns.",
        "Thus, tone-assignment to quadrisyllabic verbs, as derived by pluractional preixes, is an effect of automatic spreading.",
        "Pluractional afixation to bisyllabic verbs constitutes a slightly more complicated case: Since some paradigms assign different tone melodies to bisyllabic and trisyllabic verbs, preixation to bisyllabic bases triggers a change in tonal pattern.",

        "The third class of affixes we shall discuss are lexically specified for tone again (if vocalic).",
        "Yet, in contrast to tone-integrating suffixes, they do not override the entire tonal specification of the base.",
        "Examples of tonally non-integrating suffixes are manifold.",
        "They include nominal and verbal suffixes like the bound accusative (polar) and genitive pronouns, the genitive linker (-n/-r), the inherently low-tone specificity marker (-nl/-r), and the regular gerundive suffix -\"wâ, among many others.",
        "What is common to all these suffixes is that they only affect the segmental and suprasegmental specification of the immediately preceding base-final syllable.",
        "Regular gerunds of verbs in grades 1, 4, 5, 6 and 7 are formed by affixation of a floating tone-initial suffix -\"wâ.",
        "When attached to a verb ending in a long high syllable, the base final high tone and the floating low tone combine into a falling contour tone.",
        "If the base ends in a high short syllable, as in grade 7, or if the base-final vowel is already low, no tonal change to the base can be observed.",
        "Note that apart from tonal change of high long to falling, the base undergoes no segmental or length change.",
        "Consonantal suffixes, like the genitive linker and the specificity marker, by contrast, necessarily integrate into the coda of the preceding syllable.",
        "Since Hausa does not allow long vowels in closed syllables, base-final long vowels and diphthongs are shortened.",
        "The specificity marker is identical to the genitive linker, as far as truncation of long vowels and diphthongs is concerned.",
        "It differs from the genitive linker, in that it is inherently specified as low, giving rise to a falling tone with high-final bases.",

        "Note that in contrast to tone-integrating suffixes, segmental and suprasegmental changes are strictly local, affecting material in adjacent syllables only.",
        "Besides non-integrating suffixes there are some very rare prefixes that can be regarded as inherently specified for tone.",
        "One such prefix is low tone bà- that features in singular ethnonyms, like, e.g. bàhâushe 'Hausa person'.",
        "Typically, the prefix bà-is accompanied by a final tone-integrating HL suffix e (masc) or HLH -â/-îyâ (fem), but not always.",
        "With regular ethnonyms, the initial tone of the suffix (H) spreads to the left, up to but excluding the low tone prefix.",
        "The plural of such ethnonyms is formed without a prefix.",
        "Instead, a tone-integrating H or LH suffix -âwâ is used.",

        "According to Newman (2000), however, many Hausa speakers prefer to use the regular tone-integrating suffix e instead.",
        "Thus, entirely non-integrating formation of ethnonyms has ceased to be a part of productive Hausa morphology.",
        "Moreover, even the productivity of tonally specified bà- seems to be diminished: while the plural is still productive, new ethnonyms tend to be formed using alternate periphrastic constructions dân/mùtumîn 'son/man of' (Newman, 2000).",

        "As a result, we always get a surface representation with full tone and length information.",
        "Post-generation Lisp functions are used to convert the sufixal notation into the appropriate diacritic format.",
        "The main motivation for having tone and length represented on separate lists is two-fold: irst, as witnessed by Ajami, writing systems may overtly mark one distinction but not the other.",
        "Second, and more importantly, we have seen in section 3, that morphological processes tend to leave length intact, even if the entire word is holistically marked with a completely new tonal melody, unrelated to that of the base.",
        "Having two separate lists, we can replace the tonal structure in the course of morphological derivation but still have the rhythmic structure shared between base and derived form by means of reentrancies.",
        "Here we investigate in more detail the role these representations play in morphological derivation.",
        "In the previous section, we provided a general representation of segmental and suprasegmental information, the latter being encoded by means of two lists and showed how preprocessor rules and orthographemic rules are used to extract this information from the input and associate it with parts of the feature structure, such that it can be matched against morphological and lexical constraints on length and tone.",
        "Since both tone and length are lexically distinctive, every lexical item speciies the contents of its supra|tone and supra|len lists.",
        "The order of the elements on these two lists is right to left, facilitating a treatment of tone spreading by means of list types.",
        "At the same time, this encoding provides convenient access to the rightmost length and tone speciication.",
        "Since Hausa is predominantly suf-ixal, non-holistic morphophonological changes to tone and length speciications exclusively target the rightmost syllable of the base.",
        "As we have observed above, tonal changes can be far more global than segmental and length alternations.",
        "Thus, we will use the LEN list to synchronise the segmental and suprasegmental representations.",
        "Consequently, length speciications will always be a closed list.",
        "Tone, by contrast, may involve spreading, i.e. the exact number of individual H of an all H tone melody is determined by the number of available tone bearing units, which corresponds to vowel length speciications in our grammar.",
        "Since the number of tone bearing units is already ixed by the length of LEN, and because the tone marking rules operate synchronously on TONE and L EN, we are free to underspecify the tonal representation as to the exact length of the melody.",

        "In this paper, we have proposed a treatment of tone and length in Hausa in terms of distinct representations of segments, tone and length.",
        "We have shown that this separation is not only needed to accommodate different orthographic representations in the input, but that it also paves the way for a more general account of Hausa morphology, most notably holistic assignment of tonal melodies combined with tone spreading.",
        "At present, the grammar is not only capable of extracting different levels of suprasegmental annotations contained in the input, but can also resolving tone and length ambiguities on the basis of grammatical constraints: e.g., the ambiguity between genitive linker and previous reference marker, or the ambiguity between subjunctive, preterite, and absolute completive in relative and focus constructions.",
        "In the future, we intend to equip the grammar with parse selection models, to further enhance disambiguation.",
        "Given the bidirectionality of the grammar and its flexible support for tone and length, we plan to use it in the context of TTS and CALL applications in the near future."
