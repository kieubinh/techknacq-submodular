        "Current NLG systems typically produce paragraph-length text tailored to a specific domain and the grammars in these systems contain only a limited number of grammatical constructions, typically collected during a corpus study of example documents.",
        "Often the grammar is implemented using schemas or \"canned\" expressions, and individual grammatical levels are distributed in independent modules.",
        "Organizing the grammar this way severely limits the flexibility of NLG systems.",
        "It has long been recognized in the literature that text fluency can be improved by modeling interactions between grammar modules.",
        "The most commonly mentioned interactions are those among discourse/rhetorical relations and syntax (Scott and Souza, 1990;",
        "Hovy, 1993; Callaway, 2003), rhetorical relations, syntax and referring expressions (Kibble and Power, 2004); and layout and referring expressions (N. Bouayad-Agha, 2001).",
        "It is clear that in order to generate high quality, coherent discourse, a generator needs access to a grammar which is able to model the interdependent, context-sensitive behaviour of these separate linguistic phenomena.",
        "In this paper we draw a parallel between grammar design and the design ofnatural language generation systems.",
        "We argue that in order to generate complex linguistic constructions, current NLG systems tend to have overly complicated architectures.",
        "To illustrate this point we show how a surface realizer can take on tasks from other components when linguistic information from different grammar modules (and hence, system modules) is integrated.",
        "This simplifies system architecture by reducing the need for interaction between modules and enables the generator to produce more complex and coherent text.",
        "We illustrate this point by first showing constraints that parenthetical constructions impose on pronomi-nalization.",
        "Then we present a grammar which integrates a representation for referring expressions into a syntax/discourse grammar.",

        "To design a grammar for parenthetical constructions, we have carried out a corpus study on embedded rhetorical relations in the RST treebank (Banik and Lee, 2008).",
        "The corpus study has shown that the most numerous class of embedded subordinate clauses that occur in sentence-medial position contain a subject pronoun (as in 4a).",

        "Of the 119 sentence-medial subordinate clauses that we looked at in the study, 35 were of this type (what we call pseudo-relatives).",
