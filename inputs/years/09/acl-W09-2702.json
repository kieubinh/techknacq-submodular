        "In the era of Information and Communications Technology (ICT), mobile is a fast and convenient way to communicate over a network.",
        "Knowledge service via a mobile as \"a right information for a right man\" is a challenging task.",
        "However, this means of interchange between persons has the limitation of personal timing.",
        "Therefore, Short Message Service (SMS) is a better way for giving knowledge service, especially automatic interchange of short text messages, by providing the information from an automatic Question & Answering System.",
        "From the results of the statistical ICT data survey concerning the number and percent of the population 6 years of age and over who use information and communication technology: 2003 - 2007 by the National Statistical Office, Thailand, it was found that 47.2% of people in the entire kingdom have owned their mobile(s).",
        "Consequently, communicating via SMS facilitates an effective knowledge service for supporting the farmers in problem-solving, decision making, and early warning, and also supports the government, or a related organization, in order to e-communicate to the farmer by changing the model of \"Training and Visit\" to e-service and changing the collective to support cooperative problem solving.",
        "This kind of communication will provide the necessary long-term cost reductions to the agricultural economy in the areas of travel, visiting, productivity, etc.",
        "Nowadays, providing a knowledge service through SMS is not limited to only a Question-Answering Services System, but also for such one-way services as early warning systems, for example, a Tsunami Alert System, a FloodSMS - Early Detection and Warning of Catastrophic Flooding via SMS, etc.",
        "The development of a Question-Answering Services System through SMS is not the design of a new technology.",
        "There have been several theories developed earlier, in the context of NLP or cognitive sciences, such as Natural Language Information Retrieval (NLIR), rule based Q&A, etc.",
        "Nevertheless, some former theories of Q&A relied on complex semantic information.",
        "For instance, a Wireless Natural Language Search Engine [6] was implemented using a system residcatastrophic-flooding-sms ing on a server, which can translate questions or phrases into search engine queries or queries to SOAP Web services, where a gateway mediates between the mobile network and the Internet.",
        "Also, [15] developed the SMS for Question-Answering in the m-Learning Scenario System by using the Simple Matching Algorithm to match the learners' answer messages with the original answer string, thus facilitating the learners to get the necessary feedback and assessment.",
        "In this paper, we propose the development of the Question-Answering Services System for the Farmer through SMS by focusing on query analysis and annotation, as well as on selected text matching utilizing lexical inference and semantic roles.",
        "The annotation emphasizes the semantics model of \"What\" and \"How\" queries.",
        "Finally, we show how these annotations and inference rules contribute to the generalization of the matching system over semantic categories in order to have a large scale question-answering system.",
        "In the current stage, we have designed Q&A schema with thematic roles and have borrowed some primitive systems of the Lexical Conceptual Structure (LCS).",
        "Also, we are annotating 1000 questions and text related to the query (but we randomly choose 100 pairs of Q&A for the experiment).",
        "In the same time, we are generalizing inference rules in order to match a question to its answer.",
        "This is particularly crucial when there is no straightforward response, e.g. when they require some form of lexical inference, elaboration, and reasoning or when the response is not a simple item, but a well-formed fragment of text, e.g. a chain of events leading to a consequence, a procedure, etc.",
        "The project we present here emerged from a need of the real end-users, the Agricultural Land Reform Office, Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperative, Thailand, in the project of ALRO Cy-berBrain [3], which is a social network framework that combines approaches based on knowledge science and engineering with language engineering, consisting of an ontology-based search engine, information extraction for Q&A system, knowledge aggregation through a knowledge portal and visualized in a browser with semantic links between problems, methods of problems solving and man who is the problem solver (PMM map Model) [1].",
        "The main goal is to develop tools for e-Farming, in particular rice farming, so that farmers can easily get information on farming rice and rice diseases.",
        "Now, it has been extended to provide question-answering services for the farmers through SMS [2]."

        "To match the action 'destroy' in the question with the text portion from which the response is extracted, it is then necessary to identify the inference:",
        "This example shows that (1) in the question and in the answer, annotations are used to identify the different components, arguments, adjuncts, but also some other components (e.g. temporal adverbs), and (2) the annotation is developed to characterize the matching steps and inferential components (either lexical or domain knowledge) between the question and the answer.",
        "This latter form of annotation, which is quite time-consuming to develop, is the means we use to induce and develop domain dependent forms of lexical inference (or other phenomena like synonymy, lexical equivalence, etc.)",
        "and relevant domain knowledge.",
        "The types and lexical functions which are introduced are then used in the process of induction of generalizations over some semantic categories (plants, products, etc.",
        "), and verb classes.",
        "This way of annotating knowledge and inferences is obviously a simple bottom-up process, with well known limitations, but we feel it may have some advantages for inducing an upper organization of knowledge, in conjunction, and as a complement to, the domain ontology.",
        "It is also simple and accessible to annotators.",
        "Obviously this remains to be evaluated.",
        "At this level, the inferences which may be drawn are directly attached to the terms which are tagged.",
        "This is obviously too limited.",
        "We are now experimenting with different generalization strategies in order to tune the lexical inference rules.",
        "This process involves:",
        "(1) developing various generic principles over different types and categories (via the domain ontology), We will annotation the title for matching the \"theme\" of the answer to the \"theme\" and \"Focus\" of the question by using word net and",
        "(2) a set of principles that limit these generalizations via, for example, the taking into account of the semantics restrictions imposed by lexical items, in particular verbs.",
        "The main words of the question focus and text body that already annotated will be considered for extracting the potential candidates containing the response.",
        "The sentences, where the terms of the question or derived terms (closely related terms) are effectively found, will be the corresponding answer by using matching function as shown below._",
        "Function Matching (Question Q, Answer A){ Match = false; //Relevant document If (Q.focus = A.index) then // Relevant answer If (Q.type = A.task type) then //Detect Answer for the Question If (Q.focus = A.title) then",

        "Return Match;}_",
        "The tuning of the level of these generalizations is obviously one main parameter of our project.",

        "The matching problem between questions and documents to retrieve answers in question-answering systems in concrete applicative contexts is often a difficult problem.",
        "This matching procedure often requires very accurate domain knowledge, besides ontological descriptions.",
        "It is not always easy to access this knowledge in a structured way or to extract it from texts.",
        "The present contribution, still experimental and in an early stage of development, is an attempt, via annotations, at resolving this problem, following a simple and clear methodology.",
        "This task needs to be developed and evaluated gradually.",
        "So far, it is too early to evaluate the quality of the generalizations and the inferential patterns we get.",
        "This approach, and the principles we have briefly outlined, allow us to introduce a working method for the development of question-answering systems for concrete applications, especially for non-factoid questions, an area which is still not very much developed in spite of its obvious usefulness.",
        "One of the reasons is that non-factoid questions require a language processing technology, analysis methods, reasoning aspects, and a conceptual approach, which are substantially different from what is used for factoid questions."
