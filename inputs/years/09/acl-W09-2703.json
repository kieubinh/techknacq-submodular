        "Users then have to manually scan those documents for needed information.",
        "Due to this limitation, many techniques for implementing QA systems have been proposed in the past decades.",
        "From the literature reviews, previous and existing QA systems can be broadly categorized into two types:",

        "Knowledge Intensive: Knowledge intensive systems focus on analyzing and understanding the input questions.",
        "The system knows exactly what to be answered, and also what type the answer should be.",
        "The analysis phase usually depends on an ontology or a semantic lexicon like WordNet.",

        "Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are heavily used in a knowledge intensive system.",
        "2.",
        "Data Intensive: Data intensive systems, which do not fully analyze the input questions, rely on the redundancy of huge amount of data (Dumais et al., 2002).",
        "The idea is that if we have a huge amount of data, a piece of information is likely to be stated more than once in different forms.",
        "As a result, the data-intensive QA systems are not required to perform many complex NLP techniques.",
        "In this paper, we propose an open-domain QA system for Lhai Wikipedia called QAST.",
        "The system supports five types of close-ended questions: person, organization, place, quantity, and date/-time.",
        "Our system can be classified as a data intensive type with an additional support of structured information.",
        "Structured information in Thai Wikipedia is extracted and represented in the form of RDF.",
        "We use SPARQL to retrieve specific information from the RDF base.",

        "Normally, a SPARQL query is generated and used to retrieve a candidate answer from the RDF base.",
        "When the SPARQL fails to find an answer, the system will switch to the index search.",

        "After X is determined from a user's question, the hrst paragraph of the article titled X is retrieved and directly returned to the user.",

        "e.g., \"When was SUT established ?\"",
        "which can be answered by looking for the right information in the RDF base.",
        "A simplified SPARQL query used to retrieve an answer for this type of question is as follows.",

        "Although retrieving more texts from the corpus would likely increase the chance of finding the answer (Moldovan et al., 2002), our trial-and-error showed that 500 documents seem to be a good trade-off between speed and content coverage.",
        "To look for an occurrence of hint terms, each span is stretched backward and forward for 10 terms (i.e., s = 10).",
        "Finally, we set k equal to 5 to return only the top hve spans as the answers.",

        "In the case when the search index is used, all candidate answers are sorted by the heuristic span score (i.e., sp = msw â  (1 + hw)).",
        "The function mostly relies on regular expressions defining expected answer patterns.",
        "If a span has an occurrence of one of the defined patterns (i.e., hw > 0), it is directly proportional to the suitability of the occurrence with respect to the question, length and rareness of the pattern occurrence.",
