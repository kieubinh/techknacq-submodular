        "Question answering (QA) is nowadays an established technology, advancing information retrieval to the point of allowing queries to be formulated in natural language and to return actual answers (in the form of sentences/phrases).",
        "While the first QA systems (Simmons, 1965) mainly dealt with factoid questions, i.e. questions about names, dates and all that can be reduced to a fact, a number of systems in the last decade have appeared with the aim of addressing non-factoid questions (Voorhees, 2003).",
        "In particular, the problem of addressing definition questions has received great attention from the research community (Chen et al., 2006; Moschitti et al., 2007) , while less research has been conducted so far on other types of non-factoid QA, such as why-questions (Verberne et al., 2007; Pechsiri et al., 2008) and procedural (also called how-to) questions (Yin, 2006; Delpech and Saint-Dizier, 2008).",
        "Another recent trend in QA is interactivity, i.e. the use of a dialogue interface to better support the user, e.g. by resolving anaphoric and elliptic",
        "Patrick Saint-Dizier",
        "Toulouse, France",
        "expressions in his/her queries (Webb and Strza-lkowski, 2006).",
        "Indeed, the dialogue community has been addressing the problem of information seeking for decades, often with very satisfying commercial products able to interact not only in text but especially via spoken interfaces (Gupta et al., 2006; Traum, 1996).",
        "However, also in this field the information retrieval task has mainly focused on a limited domain (travel planning, telecom rates) and on returning database values rather than cooperatively solving problems or providing complex information.",
        "In this paper, we focus on handling procedural questions, not as commonly researched as definitional QA but for which a number of resources are available on the Web.",
        "Indeed, although portals dedicated to how-to questions exist (eHow.",
        "com), where stereotyped questions are presented together with a few responses, QA would allow a broader approach to intelligently respond to how-to questions.",
        "Our main claim is that joining the existing QA technology for complex procedural questions with the potentials of spoken conversation would provide an excellent testbed for the integration of these two technologies.",
        "Indeed, understanding and answering procedural questions requires a high level of cooperation between the user and the system: a procedure is a complex answer to return and would better be provided and received step by step than \"dumped\" in a text-to-speech generator or a text file.",
        "In the rest of this document, we outline the main features of procedural QA and the approach we propose to address it via dialogue.",
        "We illustrate the potentials of our approach with two use cases of different complexity."

        "To our knowledge, little extensive work exists in this field; an example is the TextCoop project (Delpech and Saint-Dizier, 2008) that produced a procedural tagger able to recognize and segment the main units found in French procedural text (titles, instructions, prerequisites, warnings and advice) via an ad hoc markup convention (see Table 1).",
        "In addition, QA technology was used for the resolution of elliptic titles and their indexing for answer matching (titles often express goals).",
        "Although automatic procedure tagging and analysis appears as a necessary step towards an efficient treatment of procedural questions, we argue that an accurate choice of the format and modality in which their answers are returned would be a vital advantage.",
        "In particular, we propose to return the response to a procedural QA under the form of oral instructions rather than text to read.",
        "Indeed, besides the advantages of oral communication in terms of expressiveness, the latter solution may be inappropriate in some situations such as when walking around or driving.",

        "Indeed, work on procedural QA so far accounts for the textual structures of written documents; since procedural texts are in general highly interactive, it is clear that the pairing with a spoken dialogue system is of much interest.",
        "In addition, a spoken interface enables to go far beyond a mere enumeration of instructions (as found in Web pages), achieving cooperation between the service provider (SDS) and the user.",
        "A first step towards this is the (automatic or semi-automatic) annotation of procedural texts via an ad hoc markup in order to distinguish subtexts that can yield to dialogues, such as conditions (texts containing \"if you are under 20 ...\", \"if you are aged between ...\" may be translated in the question: \"how old are you?\").",
        "Similarly, in warnings, terms bearing the illocutionary force (\"Remember\", \"Caution\", \"Notice\") can be marked in order to be stressed.",
        "During system execution, instructions can be uttered one after the other, waiting for an acknowledgement from the user, but the system can also provide more information about the task at hand upon request.",
        "Moreover, the system can provide alternative solutions when users have trouble carrying out an instruction (\"I cannot pay by credit card\"), or make an instruction more explicit by splitting it into simpler ones (automatically generating another how-to question for the subgoal at hand).",
        "Finally, in addition to speech and dialogue, multimodal aspects of interactivity can be considered, such as displaying a map when providing an itinerary, or a 3D picture related to an instruction.",
        "Translating a procedural text into speech is a challenge that requires intensive NLP processing, a strong and accurate domain model and an ability for reasoning.",
