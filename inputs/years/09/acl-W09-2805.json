        "are estimated from a training set of 1035 (Sentence, Sentencecampress) pairs, manually crafted, while considering lexical and syntactical features.",

        "In the work of (Le Nguyen & Ho, 2004) two sentence reduction algorithms were also proposed.",
        "Lhe first one is based on template-translation learning, a method inherited from the machine translation field, which learns lexical transformation rules, by observing a set of 1500 {Sentence, SentenceredUced) pair, selected from a news agency and manually tuned to obtain the training data.",
        "Due to complexity difficulties found for the application of this big lexical ruleset, they proposed an improvement where a stochastic Hidden Markov Model is trained to help in the decision of which sequence of possible lexical reduction rules should be applied to a specific case.",
        "An unsupervised approach was included in the work of (Lurner & Charniak, 2005), where training data are automatically extracted from the Penn Treebank corpus, to fit a noisy channel model, similar to the one used by (Knight & Marcu, 2002).",
        "Although it seems an interesting approach to provide new training instances, it still be dependent upon data manually labeled.",

        "In Figure 2, we present seven different rules which have been automatically induced from our architecture.",
        "These rules are formed by the conjunction of several literals, and they define constraints under which certain sentence subparts may be deleted, therefore compressing or simplifying the sentence.",

        "Many different algorithms exist to induce knowledge from data.",
        "In this paper, we use Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) (Muggleton, 1991) and it was a choice based on a set of relevant features like: the capacity to generate symbolic and relational knowledge; the possibility to securely avoid negative instances; the ability to mix different types of attribute and to have more control over the theory search process.",
        "Unlike (Clarke & Lapata, 2006), we aim at inducing human understandable knowledge, also known as symbolic knowledge.",
        "For that purpose, ILP satisfies perfectly this goal by producing clauses based on first order logic.",
        "Moreover, most of the learning algorithms require a complete definition and characterization of the feature set, prior to the learning process, where any attribute must be specified.",
        "This is a conceptual bottleneck to many learning problems such as ours, since we need to combine different types of attributes i.e. lexical, morpho-syntactic and syntactical.",
        "With ILP, we only need to define a set of possible features and the induction process will search throughout this set.",
        "The Aleph system(Srinivasan, 2000) is an empirical ILP system, initially designed to be a prototype for exploring ILP ideas.",
        "It has become a quite mature ILP implementation, used in many research projects, ranging form Biology to NLP.",
        "In fact, Aleph is the successor of several and \"more primitive\" ILP systems, like: Progol (Muggleton, 1999), FOIL (Quinlan, 1990), and Indlog (Cama-cho, 1994), among others, and may be appropriately parametrized to emulate any of those older systems.",
        "One interesting advantage in Aleph is the possibility to learn exclusively from positive instances, contrarily to what is required by most learning systems.",
        "Moreover, there is theoretical research work (Muggleton, 1996) demonstrating that the increase in the learning error tend to be negligible with the absence of negative examples, as the number of learning instances increases.",
        "This is a relevant issue, for many learning domains, and specially ours, where negative examples are not available.",
        "In our problem, we define predicates that characterize possible features to be considered during the induction process.",
        "Regarding the structure of our learning instances (bubbles), we define predicates which restrict left and right context sequences as well as the aligned middle sequence.",
        "In particular, we limit the size of our context sequences to a maximum of three words and, so far, only use bubbles in which the middle sequence has a maximum length of three words.",
        "The notion of contexts from bubbles is clarified with the next example.",
        "For such a case, we consider [ li , L2 ] as the left context, [Rl, R2, R3] as the right context, and [xi, X2, X3] as the aligned middle sequence.",

        "As mentioned previously, with an ILP system, and in particular with Aleph, the set of attributes is defined through a set of conditions, expressed in the form of predicates.",
        "These predicates are the building blocks that will be employed to construct rules, during the induction process.",
        "Hence, our attribute search space is defined using Prolog predicates, which define the complete set of possibilities for rule body construction.",
        "In our problem, we let the induction engine seek generalization conditions for the bubble main regions (left, middle, and right).",

        "Lexical conditions impose a fixed position to match a given word.",
        "The POS condition is similar to the lexical one, but more general, as the position must match a specific part-of-speech tag.",
        "Likely, chunk conditions bind a region to be equal to a particular chunk type.",
        "For example, by looking at Figure 2, the attentive reader may have noticed that these three conditions are present in rule 7.",

        "To perform our evaluation, a sample of 300 sentences were randomly extracted, where at least one compression rule had been applied.",
        "This evaluation set may be subdivided into three subsets, where 100 instances came from rules with Z^X) = 1 (BD1), 100 from rules with Z{x) = 2 (BD2), and the other 100 from rules with Z^X) = 3 (BD3).",
        "Another random sample, also with 100 cases has been extracted to evaluate our baseline (BL) which consists in the direct application of the bubble set to make compressions.",

        "Moreover, best results overall are obtained for BD2 with 80.6% Precision, 85.72% Utility and 90.03% Ngram-simplification which means that we can expect a reduction of two words with high quality for a great number of sentences.",
