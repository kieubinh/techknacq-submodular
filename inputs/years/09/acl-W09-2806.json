        "Appropriate evaluation of results is an important aspect of any research.",
        "In areas such as automatic summarization, the problem is especially complex because of the inherent subjectivity in the task itself and its evaluation.",
        "There is no single objective standard for a good quality summary; rather, its value depends on the summary's purpose, focus, and particular requirements of the reader (Sparck lones, 2007).",
        "While the purpose and focus can be set as constant for a specific task, the variability of human judgment is more difficult to control.",
        "Therefore, in attempts to produce stable evaluations, it has become standard to use multiple judges, not necessarily for parallel evaluation, but in such a way that each judge evaluates a different subset of the many summaries on which the final system assessment is based.",
        "The incorporation of multiple points of view is also reflected in automatic evaluation, where it fakes the form of employing multiple model summaries to which a candidate summary is compared.",
        "Since these measures to neutralize judgment variation involve the production of multiple model summaries, as well as multiple topics, evaluation can become quite costly.",
        "Therefore, it is interesting to examine how many models and topics are necessary to obtain a relatively stable evaluation, and whether this number is different for manual and automatic metrics.",
        "In their examination of summary evaluations, van Halteren and Teufel (2003) suggest that it is necessary to use at least 30 to 40 model summaries for a stable evaluation; however, Harman and Over (2004) argue that a stable evaluation can be conducted even with a single model, as long as there is an adequate number of topics.",
        "This view is supported by Lin (2004a), who concludes that \"correlations to human judgments were increased by using multiple references but using single reference summary with enough number of samples was a valid alternative\".",
        "Interestingly, similar conclusions were also reached in the area of Machine Translation evaluation; in their experiments, Zhang and Vogel (2004) show that adding an additional reference translation compensates the effects of removing 10-15% of the testing data, and state that, therefore, \"it seems more cost effective to have more test sentences but fewer reference translations\".",
        "In this paper, we look at how various metrics behave with respect to a variable number of topics and models used in the evaluation.",
        "This lets us determine the stability of individual metrics, and helps to illuminate the trade-offs inherent in designing a good evaluation.",
        "For our experiments, we used data from the Summarization track at the Text Analysis Conference (TAC) 2008, where participating systems were assessed on their summarization of 48 topics, and the automatic metrics ROUGE and BE, as well as the manual Pyramid evaluation method, had access to 4 human models.",
        "TAC 2008 was the first task of the TAC/DUC (Document Understanding Conference) series in which the Pyramid method was used on all evaluated data, making it possible to conduct a full comparison among the manual and automatic methods.",
        "Despite the lack of full Pyramid evaluation in DUC 2007, we look at the remaining metrics applied that year (ROUGE, BE, and Content Responsiveness), in order to see whether they confirm the insights gained from the TAC 2008 data."

        "The main evaluation at TAC 2008 was performed manually, assessing the automatic candidate summaries with respect to Overall Responsiveness, Overall Readability, and content coverage according to the Pyramid framework (Nenkova and Pas-sonneau, 2004; Passonneau etal., 2005).",
        "Task participants were asked to produce two summaries for each of the 48 topics; the first (initial summary) was a straightforward summary of 10 documents in response to a topic statement, which is a request for information about a subject or event; the second was an update summary, generated on the basis of another set of 10 documents, which followed the first set in temporal order and described further developments in the given topic.",
        "The idea behind the update summary was to avoid repeating all the information included in the first set of documents, on the assumption that the reader is familiar with that information already.",
        "The participating teams submitted up to three runs each; however, only the first and second runs were evaluated manually due to limited resources.",
        "For each summary under evaluation, assessors rated the summary from 1 (very poor) to 5 (very good) in terms of Overall Responsiveness, which measures how well the summary responds to the need for information expressed in the topic statement and whether its linguistic quality is adequate.",
        "Linguistic qualities such as grammaticality, coreference, and focus were also evaluated as Overall Readability, also on the scale from 1 to 5.",
        "Content coverage of each summary was evaluated using the Pyramid framework, where assessors create a list of information nuggets (called Summary Content Units, or SCUs) from the set of human-produced summaries on a given topic, then decide whether any of these nuggets are present in the candidate summary.",
        "All submitted runs were evaluated with the automatic metrics: ROUGE (Lin, 2004b), which calculates the proportion of n-grams shared between the candidate summary and the reference summaries, and Basic Elements (Hovy et al., 2005), which compares the candidate to the models in terms of head-modifier pairs.",
        "2.1 Manual metrics",
        "Evaluating Overall Responsiveness and Overall Readability is a rather straightforward procedure, as most of the complex work is done in the mind of the human assessor.",
        "Each candidate summary is given a single score, and the final score for the summarization system is the average of all its summary-level scores.",
        "The only economic factor here is the number of topics, i.e. summaries per system, that need to be judged in order to neutralize both intra-and inter-annofator variability and obtain a reliable assessment of the summarization system.",
        "When it comes to the Pyramid method, which measures content coverage of candidate summaries, the need for multiple topics is accompanied by the need for multiple human model summaries.",
        "First, independent human assessors produce summaries for each topic, guided by the topic statement.",
        "Next, in the Pyramid creation stage, an assessor reads all human-produced summaries for a given topic and extracts all \"information nuggets\", called Summary Content Units (SCUs), which are short, atomic statements of facts contained in the text.",
        "Each SCU has a weight which is directly proportional to the number of model summaries in which it appears, on the assumption that the fact's importance is reflected in how many human summarizers decide to include it as relevant in their summary.",
        "Once all SCUs have been harvested from the model summaries, an assessor then examines each candidate summary to see how many of the SCUs from the list it contains.",
        "The final Pyramid score for a candidate summary is its total SCU weight divided by the maximum SCU weight available to a summary of average length (where the average length is determined by the mean SCU count of the model summaries for this topic).",
        "The final score for a summarization system is the average score of all its summaries.",
        "In TAC 2008, the evaluation was conducted with 48 topics and 4 human models for each topic.",
        "We examined to what extent the number of models and topics used in the evaluation can influence the Pyramid score and its stability.",
        "The stability, similarly to the method employed by Voorhees and Buckley (2002) for Information Retrieval, is determined by how well a system ranking based on a small number of models/topics cor-",
        "Table 1: Mean correlations of Responsiveness and other metrics using 1, 2, 3, or 4 models for TAC 2008 initial summaries.",

        "Table 3: Mean correlations of 4-model Pyramid score and other metrics using 1, 2, 3, or 4 models for TAC 2008 initial summaries.",
        "Values in each row are significantly different from each other at 95% level except ROUGE-2 and BE in 4-model category.",
        "relates with the ranking based on another set of models/topics, where the two sets are randomly selected and mutually exclusive.",
        "This methodology allows us to check the correlations based on up to half of the actual number of models/topics only (because of the non-overlap requirement), but it gives an indication of the general tendency.",
        "We also look at the correlation between the Pyramid score and Overall Responsiveness.",
        "We don't expect a perfect correlation between Pyramid and Responsiveness in the best of times, because Pyramid measures content identity between the candidate and the model, and Responsiveness measures content relevance to topic as well as linguistic quality.",
        "However, the degree of variation between the two scores depending on the number of models/topics used for the Pyramid will give us a certain indication of the amount of information lost.",
        "Similarly to the Pyramid method, ROUGE (Lin, 2004b) and Basic Elements (Hovy et al., 2005) require multiple topics and model summaries to produce optimal results.",
        "ROUGE is a collection of automatic n-gram matching metrics, ranging from unigram to four-gram.",
        "It also includes measurements of the longest common subsequence, weighted or unweighted, and the option to compare stemmed versions of words and omit stop-words.",
        "There is also the possibility of accepting skip-n-grams, that is, counting n-grams as matching even if there are some intervening non-",

        "matching words.",
        "The skip-n-grams together with stemming are the only ways ROUGE can accomodate alternative forms of expression and match concepts even though they might differ in terms of their syntactic or lexical form.",
        "These methods are necessarily limited, and so ROUGE relies on using multiple parallel model summaries which serve as a source of lexical/syntactic variation in the comparison process.",
        "The fewer models there are, the less reliable the score.",
        "Our question here is not only what this relation looks like (as it was examined on the basis of Document Understanding Conference data in Lin (2004a)), but also how it compares to the reliability of other metrics.",
        "Basic Elements (BE), on the other hand, goes beyond simple string matching and parses the syntactic structure of the candidate and model to obtain a set of head-modifier pairs for each, and then compares the sets.",
        "A head-modifier pair consist of the head of a syntactic unit (e.g. the noun in a noun phrase), and the word which modifes the head (i.e. a determiner in a noun phrase).",
        "It is also possible to include the name of the relation which connects them (i.e. subject, object, etc.).",
        "Since BEs reflect thematic relations in a sentence rather than surface word order, it should be possible to accommodate certain differences of expression that might appear between a candidate summary and a reference, especially as the words can be stemmed.",
        "This could, in theory, allow us to use fewer models for the evaluation.",
        "In practice, however, it fails to account for the total possible variety, and, what is more, the additional step of parsing the text can introduce noise into the comparison.",

        "With more and more system submissions to judge, and the simultaneous need for multiple topics and models in order to provide a stable assessment, difficult decisions of cutting costs and effort might sometimes be necessary.",
        "It would be useful then to know where such decisions will have the smallest negative impact, or at least, what might be the trade-offs inherent in such decisions.",
        "From our experiments, it appears that manual metrics such as Pyramid gain less from the addition of more model summaries than the automatic metrics.",
        "A Pyramid score based on any two models correlates very highly with the score based on any other two models.",
        "For the automatic metrics, the largest gain is recorded with adding the second model; afterwards the returns diminish.",
        "BE seems to be the most sensitive metric to changes in the number of models and topics; ROUGE-SU4, on the other hand, is the least sensitive to such changes and the most stable, but it does not obtain the highest correlations when many models and topics are available.",
        "Whatever the number of models, manual Pyramid considerably outperforms automatic metrics, as can be expected, since human understanding is not hampered by the possible differences in surface expression between a candidate and a model.",
        "But when it comes to decreased number of topics, the inherent variability of human judgment shows strongly, to the extent that, in extreme cases of very few topics, it might be more prudent to use ROUGE-SU4 than Pyramid or Responsiveness.",
        "Lastly, we observe that, as with models, adding one or two topics to the evaluation plays a great role only if we have very few topics to start with.",
        "Our experiments suggest that, as the number of topics available for evaluation increases, so does the number of additional topics necessary to make a difference in the system ranking produced by a metric.",
