        "We address the problem of revising the lead sentence in a broadcast news text to increase the amount of background information in the lead.",
        "This is one of the draft and revision approaches to summarization, which has received keen attention in the research community.",
        "Unlike many other methods that directly utilize noun phrase (NP) coreference (Nenkova 2008; Mani et al.",
        "1999), we propose a method that employs insertion and substitution of phrases that modify the same chunk in the lead and other sentences.",
        "We also show its effectiveness in a revision experiment.",
        "As is well known, the extractive summary that has been extensively studied from the early days of summarization history (Luhn, 1958) suffers from various drawbacks.",
        "These include the problems of a break in cohesion in the summary text such as dangling anaphora and a sudden shift in topic.",
        "To ameliorate these problems, the idea of revising the extracted sentences was proposed in a single document summarization study.",
        "Jing and McKeown (1999; 2000) found that human summarization can be traced back to six cut-and-paste operations of a text and proposed a revision method consisting of sentence reduction and combination modules with a sentence extraction part.",
        "Mani and colleagues (1999) proposed a summarization system based on \"draft and revision\" together with sentence extraction.",
        "The revision part is achieved with the sentence aggregation and smoothing modules.",
        "The cohesion break problem becomes particularly conspicuous in multi-document summarization.",
        "To ameliorate this, revision of the extracted sentences is also thought to be effective, and many ideas and methods have been proposed so far.",
        "For example, Otterbacher and colleagues (2002) analyzed manually revised extracts and factored out cohesion problems.",
        "Nenkova (2008) proposed a revision idea that utilizes noun coreference with linguistic quality improvements in mind.",
        "Other than the break in cohesion, multi-document summarization faces the problem of information overlap particularly when the document set consists of similar sentences.",
        "Barzilay and McKeown (2005) proposed an idea called sentence fusion that integrates information in overlapping sentences to produce a non-overlapping summary sentence.",
        "Their algorithm firstly analyzes the sentences to obtain the dependency trees and sets a basis tree by finding the centroid of the dependency trees.",
        "It next augments the basis tree with the sub-trees in other sentences and finally prunes the predefined constituents.",
        "Their algorithm was further modified and applied to the German biographies by Filippova and Strube (2008).",
        "Like the work of Jing and McKeown (2000) and Mani et al.",
        "(1999), our work was inspired by the summarization method used by human abstractors.",
        "Actually, our abstractors first extract important sentences, which is called lead identification, and then revise them, which is referred to as phrase elaboration or specification.",
        "In this paper, we concentrate on the revision part.",
        "Our work can be viewed as an application of the sentence fusion method to the draft and revision approach to a single Japanese news document summarization.",
        "Actually, our dependency structure alignment is almost the same as that of Filippova and Strube (2008), and our lead sentence plays the role of a basis tree in the Barzilay and McKeown approach (2005).",
        "Though the idea of sentence fusion was developed mainly for suppressing the overlap in multi-document summarization, we consider this effective in augmenting the extracts in a single-document summarization task where we face less overlap among sentences.",
        "Before explaining the method in detail, we will briefly introduce the Japanese dependency structure on which our idea is based.",
        "The dependency structure is constructed based on the bunsetsu chunk, which we call \"chunk\" for simplicity.",
        "The chunk usually consists of one content-bearing word and a series of function words.",
        "All the chunks in a sentence except for the last one modify a chunk in the right direction.",
        "We call the modifying chunk the modifier and the modified chunk the head.",
        "We usually span a directed edge from a modifier chunk to the head chunk .",
        "Our dependency tree has no syntactic information such as subject or object."

        "This revision strategy was employed by the human reviser mentioned in section 2, and we consider this to be effective because our target document has a so-called inverse pyramid structure (Robin and McKeown 1996), in which the first sentence is elaborated by the following sentences.",

        "The chunk H^LfLfc touchaku-shimashita 'arrived' and IAEA <D IAEA-no 'of the IAEA' in Figure 1 are examples.",
        "Identifying our coreferential chunks is even harder than the conventional coreference resolution, and we made a simplifying assumption as in Nenkova (2008) with some additional conditions that were obtained through our preliminary experiments.",
        "(1) Assumption: Two chunks having the same surface forms are coreferential.",
        "(2) Conditions for light verb (noun) chunks: Agreement of modifying verbal nous is fur-",
        "The sign a ~ b means the chunk \"a\" and \"b\" are triggers.",
        "The sign p <-> q means the phrases \"p\" and \"q\" are aligned.",
        "ther required for chunks whose content words consist only of light verbs such as 5 aru 'be' and ^5 naru 'become': these chunks themselves have little lexical meaning.",
        "The agreement is checked with the hand-crafted rules.",
        "Similar checks are applied to chunks whose content words consist only of light nouns such as ^Ldr koto ('koto' makes the previous verb a noun) .",
        "(3) Conditions for verb inflections: a chunk that contains a verb usually ends with a function word series that indicates a variety of information such as inflection type, dependency type, tense, aspect, and modality.",
        "Some information such as tense and aspect is vital to decide the coreference relation (exchanging the modifier phrases \"arrive\" and \"will arrive\" will likely bring about inconsistency in meaning), although some is not.",
        "We are in the process of categorizing function words that do not affect the coreference relation and temporally adopted the empirically obtained rule: the difference in verb inflection between the te-form (predicate modifying form) and dictionary form (sentence end form) can be ignored.",
        "We used the surface form agreement for similarity evaluation.",
        "We applied several metrics and explain them one by one.",
        "1) Chunk similarity t, s",
        "t, s : x,ye chunk – [0, 1].",
        "Function t is the Dice coefficient between the set of content words in x and those in y.",
        "The same coefficient calculated with all words (function and content words) is denoted as s.",
        "2) Phrase absorption ratio",
        "a : px, pye phrases – [0, 1] This is the function that indicates how many chunks in phrase px is represented in py and is calculated with t as in, a(px, py) :=t – \\ Y. max(t(x,y)).",
        "\\px\\zepx yepy",
        "3) Alignment quality",
        "With the above two functions, the alignment qual-lity is evaluated by the function g : px, py e phrases – [0, 1] where the shorter phrase is set to px so that |px| < py .",
        "The variables x and y are the last chunks in px and py, respectively.",
        "Intuitively, the function evaluates how many chunks in the shorter phrase px are represented in py and how similar the last chunks are.",
        "The last chunk in a phrase, especially the function words in the chunk, determines the syntactic character of the phrase, and we measured this value with the second term of the alignment quality.",
        "The parameter a is decided empirically, which was set at 0.375 in this paper.",
        "In alignment, we calculated the score for all possible phrase combinations and then greedily selected the pair with the highest score.",
        "We set the minimum alignment score at 0.185; those pairs with scores lower than this value were not aligned.",

        "Step 5 starts either an insertion or substitution process, as in Table 2.",
        "If pb ^ 0 (body phrase is not null) and pi = 0 (lead phrase is null) in Table 2, the insertion process starts.",
        "In this process, we check the following.",
        "1) Redundancy check",
        "Insertion may cause redundancy in information.",
        "As a matter of fact, redundancy often happens when there is an error in syntactic analysis.",
        "Suppose there are the same lead and body phrases that modify the same chunks in the lead and body sentences.",
        "If the lead phrase fails to modify the correct chunk because of an error, the body phrase loses the chance to be aligned to the lead phrase since they belong to different trigger chunks.",
        "As a result, the body phrase becomes a floating phrase and is inserted into the lead chunk, which duplicates the same phrase.",
        "To prevent this, we evaluate the degree of duplication with the phrase absorption ratio a and allow phrase insertion when the score is below a predefined threshold 0: we allow insertion when a(pb, L) <0, pb e phrase, L : lead sentence, is satisfied.",
        "2) Discourse coherence check",
        "Blind phrase insertion may invite a break in cohesion in a lead sentence.",
        "This frequently happens when the inserted phrase has words that require an antecedent.",
        "We then prepared a list of words that contain such context-requiring words and forbid phrase insertions that contain words that are on the list.",
        "This list contains the pronoun family such as kokono 'this' and special adjectives such as 15 chigau 'different.'",
        "3) Insertion point decision The body phrase should be inserted at the proper position in the lead sentence to maintain the syntactic consistency.",
        "Because we dealt with single-phrase insertion here, we employed a simple heuristics.",
        "Since the Japanese dependency edge spans from left to right as we mentioned in section 1, we considered that the right phrase of the inserted phrase is important to keep the new dependency from the inserted phrase to the trigger chunk.",
        "Because we already know the phrase alignment status at this stage, we follow the next steps to determine the insertion position in the lead of the insertion phrase.",
        "A) In the body sentence, find the nearest right substitution phrase prof the insertion phrase.",
        "B) Find the pr 's aligned phrase in the lead prL.",
        "C) Insert the phrase to the left of the prL.",
        "D) If there is no pr, insert the phrase to the left to the trigger.",
        "If pb ^ 0 and pi ^ 0 in Table 2, the substitution process starts.",
        "This process first checks if each aligned phrase pair contains the same chunk other than the present trigger.",
        "If there is such a chunk, the substitution phrase is reduced to the subtree from the present trigger to the identical chunk.",
        "The newly found identical chunks are in trigger table T, and the remaining part will be evaluated later in the main loop.",
        "Owing to the phrase partitioning, we can avoid phrase substitutions which are in an inclusive relation.",
        "The substitution candidate goes through three checks: information increase, redundancy, and discourse cohesion.",
        "As the latter two are almost the same as those in the insertion, we explain here the information increase.",
        "This involves checking whether the number of chunks in the body phrase is greater than that in the aligned lead phrase.",
        "This is based on the simple assumption that elaboration requires more words."

        "• Purpose",
        "We conducted a lead revision experiment with three purposes.",
        "The first one was to empirically evaluate the validity of our simplified assumptions: trigger identification and concreteness increase evaluation.",
        "For trigger identification, we basically viewed the identical chunks as triggers and added some amendments for light verbs (nouns) and verb inflections.",
        "For the check of an increase in concreteness, we assumed that phrases with more chunks were more concrete.",
        "However, these simplifications should be verified in experiments.",
        "The second purpose was to check the validity of using the revision phrases only in body sentences and not in the supplemental sentences.",
        "The last one was to determine how ineffective the result is if the syntactic parsing fails.",
        "With these purposes in mind, we designed our experiment as follows.",
        "A total of 257 articles from news programs broadcast on 20 Jan., 20 Apr., and 20 July in 2004 were tagged with lead, body, and supplement tags by a native Japanese evaluator.",
        "The articles were morphologically analyzed by Me-cab (Kudo et al., 2003) and syntactically parsed by Cabocha (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2002).",
        "• Evaluator and evaluation detail",
        "We prepared an evaluation interface that presents a lead with one revision point (insertion or substitution) that was obtained using the body and supplemental sentences to an evaluator.",
        "A Japanese native speaker evaluated the results one by one with the above interface.",
        "We planned a linguistic evaluation like DUC2005 (Hoa Trang, 2005).",
        "Since their five-type evaluation is intended for multi-document summarization, whereas our task is single-document summarization, and we are interested in evaluating our questions mentioned above, we carried out the evaluation as follows.",
        "In future, we plan to increase the number of evaluation items and the number of evaluators.",
        "E1) The evaluator judged if the revision was obtained from the lead and body sentences with or without parsing errors.",
        "Here, errors that did not affect the revision were not considered.",
        "E2) Second, she checked whether the revision was semantically correct or revised information matching the fact described in the lead sentence.",
        "Here, she did not care about the grammaticality or the improvements in concreteness of the revision; if the revision was problematic but manually correctable, it was judged as OK.",
        "This step evaluated the correctness of the trigger selection; wrong triggers, i.e., those referring to different facts produce semantically inconsistent revisions as they mix up different facts.",
        "The following evaluation was done for those judged correct in evaluation step E2, as we found that revisions that were semantically inconsistent with the lead's facts were often too difficult to evaluate further.",
        "E3) Third, she evaluated the change in concreteness after revision with the revisions that passed evaluation E2.",
        "She judged whether or not the revision increased the concreteness of the lead in three categories (Table 3).",
        "Notice that original lead sentences are supposed to have an average score of 1.",
        "E4) Last, she checked the sentential completeness of the revision result that passed evaluation E2.",
        "They still contained problems such as grammatical errors and improper insertion position.",
        "Rather than evaluating these items separately, we measured them together for sentential completeness.",
        "At this time, we measured in terms of the number of operations (insertion, deletion, substitution) needed to make the sentence complete.",
        "As shown in Table 4, revisions requiring more than two operations are categorized as \"poor,\" those requiring one operation are \"acceptable,\" and those requiring no operations are \"perfect.\"",
        "We employed this measure because we found that grading detailed items such as grammaticality and insertion positions at fine levels was rather difficult.",
        "We also found that native Japanese speakers can correct errors easily.",
        "Notice the lead sentences are perfect and are supposed to have an average score of 2 in sentential completeness.",
        "Since the revision does not improve the completeness further but elicits defects such as grammatical errors, it usually produces a score below 2.",
