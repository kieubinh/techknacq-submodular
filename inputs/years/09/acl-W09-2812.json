        "One of the main issues in automatic multi-document summarization is avoiding redundancy.",
        "As the source documents are all related to the same topic, at least some of their content is likely to overlap.",
        "In fact, this is in part what makes multi-document summarization feasible.",
        "For example, news articles that report on a particular event, or that are based on the same source, often contain similar information expressed in different ways.",
        "A multi-document summarizer should include this overlapping information not more than once.",
        "The backbone of most current approaches to automatic summarization is a vector space model in which a sentence is regarded as a bag of words and a weighted cosine similarity measure is used to quantify the amount of shared information between a pair of sentences.",
        "Cosine similarity (in this context) essentially amounts to calculating word overlap, albeit with weighting of the terms and normalization for differences in sentence length.",
        "It is clear that this approach to detecting redundancy is far from satisfactory, because it only covers redundancy in its most trivial form, i.e., identical words.",
        "In contrast, the redundancy that we ultimately want to avoid in summarization is that at the semantic level.",
        "As an extreme case in point, two sentences with no words in common can still carry virtually the same meaning.",

        "In Section 2 we introduce a tool for detecting semantic overlap.",
        "In section 3 we present a Dutch multi-document summarization system, based on the MEAD summarization toolkit (Radev et al., 2004).",

        "In this section, we detail the semantic overlap detection tool and the resources we build on.",
        "Parallel/comparable text corpus The basis for our semantic overlap detection tool is a monolingual parallel/comparable treebank of 1 million words of Dutch text (Marsi and Krahmer, 2007).",
        "Half of the text material has so far been manually aligned at the sentence level.",
        "Subsequently, the sentences have been parsed and the resulting parse trees have been aligned at the level of syntactic nodes.",
        "Moreover, aligned nodes have been labeled according to a set of semantic similarity labels that express the type of similarity relation between the nodes.",
        "The following five labels are used: generalize, specify, intersect, restate, and equal.",
        "The corpus serves as the basis for developing tools for automatic alignment and relation labeling.",
        "Word aligner The word alignment tool takes as input a pair of source and target sentences and produces a matching between the words, that is, a (possibly partial) one-to-one mapping of source to target words.",
        "This aligner is a part of the full fledged tree aligner currently under development.",
        "The alignment task comprises several subtasks.",
        "First, the input sentences are tokenized and parsed with the Alpino syntactic parser for Dutch (Bouma et al., 2001).",
        "Apart from the syntactic analysis, which we disregard in the current work, the parser performs lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging and compound analysis, all of which are used here.",
        "In addition, the aligner uses lexical-semantic knowledge from Cornetto, a lexical database for Dutch (40K entries) similar to the well-known English WordNet (Vossen et al., 2008).",
        "The relations we use are synonym, hyperonym, and xpos-near-synonym (align near synonyms with different POS labels).",
        "In addition we check whether a pair of content words has a least common sub-sumer (LCS) in the hyperonym hierarchy.",
        "As path length has been shown to be a poor predictor in this respect, we calculate the Lin similarity, which combines the Information Content of the words involved (Lin, 1998).",
        "A current limitation is that we lack word sense disambiguation, hence we take the maximal score over all the senses of the words.",
        "The components described above can be considered as experts which predict word alignments with a certain probability.",
        "Since alignments can support, complement or contradict each other, we are faced with the problem of how to combine the evidence.",
        "Our approach is to view the alignment as a weighted bipartite multigraph.",
        "That is, a graph where source and target nodes are in disjoint sets, multiple edges are allowed between the same pair of nodes, and edges have an associated weight.",
        "Our goal is on the one hand to maximize the sum of the edge weights, and on the other hand to reduce this graph to a model in which every node can have at most one associated edge.",
        "This is a combinatorial optimization problem known as the assignment problem for which efficient algorithms exist.",
        "We use a variant of the The Hungarian Algorithm (Kuhn, 1955), for the computation of the matches.",
        "Sentence similarity score Given a word alignment between a pair of sentences, a similarity score is required to measure the amount of semantic overlap or redundancy.",
        "Evidently the similarity score should be proportional to the relative number of aligned words.",
        "However, some alignments are more important than others.",
        "For example, the alignment between two determiners (e.g. the) is less significant than that between two common nouns.",
        "This is modeled in our similarity score by weighting alignments according to the idf (inverse document frequency) (Sparck Jones, 1972) of the words involved.",
        "Here s\\ and s2 are sentences, S is the longest of the two sentences, Wj are the words in S, A is the subsequence of aligned words in S, and Wi are the words in A."

        "The system creates a summary by extracting a subset of sentences from the original documents.",
        "The summarizer reads in a cluster of documents, i.e. a set of documents relevant for the same topic, and for each sentence it extracts a set of features.",
        "These features are combined to determine an importance score for each sentence.",
        "Next the sentences are sorted according to their importance score.",
        "The system starts a summary by adding the sentence with the highest weight.",
        "Then it examines the second most important sentence and measures the similarity with the sentence that is already added.",
        "If the overlap is limited, the sentence is added to the summary, otherwise it is disregarded.",
        "This process is repeated until the intended summary size is reached.",
        "The module that performs this last step of determining which sentences end up in the final summary is called the reranker.",
        "We use two baseline systems: the random baseline system randomly selects a set of sentences and the lead-based system which selects a subset of initial sentences as summary.",
        "We investigated the following features.",
        "A simple and effective features is the position: each sentence gets a score of 1/position where 'position' is the place in the document.",
        "The length feature is a filter that removes sentences shorter than the given threshold.",
        "The simwf feature presents the overlap of a sentence with the title of the document computed with cosine similarity.",
        "One of MEAD's main features is centroid-based summarization.",
        "Centroids of clusters are used to determine which words are important for the cluster and sentences containing these words are considered to be central sentences.",
        "The words are weighted with tf*idf.",
        "The aim of query-based summarization is to create summaries that are relevant with respect to a particular query.",
        "This can easily be done with features that express the overlap between the query and a source sentence.",
        "We examined three different query-based features that measure simple word overlap between the query and the sentence, cosine similarity with tf*idf weighting of words and cosine similarity without tf*idf weighting.",
        "The MEAD toolkit implements multiple reranker modules, we investigated the following three: the cosine-reranker, the mmr-reranker and novelty-reranker.",
        "We compare these rerankers against the semantic overlap detection (sod) tool detailed in section 2.",
        "The cosine-reranker represents two sentences as tf*idf weighted word vectors and computes a cosine similarity score between them.",
        "Sentences with a cosine similarity above the threshold are disregarded.",
        "The mmr-reranker module is based on the maximal margin relevance criterion (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998).",
        "MMR models the trade-off between a focused summary and a summary with a wide scope.",
        "The novelty-reranker is an extension of the cosine-reranker and boosts sentences occurring after an important sentence by multiplying with 1.2.",

        "We try out each of the characteristics discussed in section 3.",
        "The best combination found on the development set is the feature combination position, centroid, length with cut-off 13, and query Cosine.",
        "We tested the different rerankers and vary the similarity thresholds to determine their optimal threshold value.",

        "We presented an automatic multi-document summarization system for Dutch based on the MEAD system, supporting the claim that MEAD is largely language-independent.",
        "We experimented with different features and parameter settings of the summarizer, and optimized it for summarization of Dutch newspaper text.",
        "We presented a semantic overlap detection tool, developed on the basis of a monolingual corpus of parallel/comparable Dutch text, which goes beyond simple string matching.",
        "We expected this tool to improve the sentence reranking step, thereby reducing redundancy in the summaries.",
        "However, we were unable to show a significant effect.",
        "We have several possible explanations for this.",
        "First, many of the sentence pairs that share the same semantic content, also share a number of identical words.",
        "To detect these cases, therefore, computing cosine similarity may be just as effective.",
        "Second, the accuracy of the alignment tool may not be good enough, partly because of errors in the linguistic analysis or lack of coverage, and partly because certain types of knowledge (word sense, syntactic structure) are not yet exploited.",
        "Third, reranking of sentences is unlikely to improve the summary in cases where the preceding step of sentence ranking within documents performs poorly.",
        "We are currently still investigating this matter and hope to obtain significant results with an improved version of our tool for detecting semantic overlap.",
        "We plan to work on a more refined version that not only uses word alignment but also considers alignments at the parse tree level.",
