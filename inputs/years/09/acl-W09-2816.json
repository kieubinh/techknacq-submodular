        "This was the second time we ran a shared task using the grec-msr data (following a first run in 2008).",
        "The task definition was again kept fairly simple, but in the 2009 round the main aim for participating systems was to select an appropriate word string to serve as a referring expression, whereas in 2008 it was to select an appropriate type of referring expression (name, common noun, pronoun, or empty reference).",
        "The immediate motivating application context for the grec-msr Task is the improvement of referential clarity and coherence in extractive summaries by regenerating referring expressions in them.",
        "There has recently been a small flurry of work in this area (Steinberger et al., 2007; Nenkova, 2008).",

        "These categories of referring expressions (re) are relatively straightforward to identify and to achieve high inter-annotator agreement on (complete agreement among four annotators in 86% of msrs), and account for most cases of overt main subject reference in the grec texts.",

        "refs have three attributes: id, a unique reference identifier; semcat, the semantic category of the referent, ranging over city, country, river, person, mountain; and syncat, the syntactic category required of referential expressions for the referent in this discourse context (np-obj, np-subj, subj-det).",
        "A ref is composed of one refex element (the 'selected' referential expression for the given reference; in the training/development data texts it is simply the referential expression found in the corpus) and one alt-refex element which in turn is a list of refexs which are possible alternative referential expressions (see following section).",

        "The rego8 type attribute indicates basic re type.",
        "The choice of types is motivated by the hypothesis that one of the most basic decisions to be taken in re selection for named entities is whether to use an re that includes a name, such as Modern India (the corresponding rego8-type value is name); whether to go for a common-noun re, i.e. with a category noun like country as the head (common); whether to use a pronoun (pronoun); or whether it can be left unrealised (empty).",

        "The rationale behind computing the Word String Accuracy scores in this way for multiple-re test sets (maximising scores on re chains rather than individual res) is that an re is not good or bad in its own right, but depends on other msres in the same text.",
