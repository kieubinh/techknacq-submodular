        "of academic prose, and for Jackendoff (1997) the number of MWEs in a speaker's lexicon is of the same order of magnitude as the number of single words.",
        "However, these estimates are likely to be underestimates if we consider that for language from a specific domain the specialized vocabulary is going to consist largely of MWEs (global warming, protein sequencing) and new MWEs are constantly appearing (weapons ofmass destruction, axis of evil).",
        "Multiword expressions play an important role in Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, which should not only identify the MWEs but also be able to deal with them when they are found (Fazly and Stevenson, 2007).",
        "Failing to identify MWEs may cause serious problems for many NLP tasks, especially those envolving some kind of semantic processing.",
        "For parsing, for instance, Baldwin et al.",
        "(2004), found that for a random sample of 20,000 strings from the British National Corpus (BNC) even with a broad-coverage grammar for English (Flickinger, 2000) missing MWEs accounted for 8% of total parsing errors.",
        "Therefore, there is an enormous need for robust (semi-)automated ways of acquiring lexical information for MWEs (Villavicencio et al., 2007) that can significantly extend the coverage of resources.",
        "For example, one can more than double the number of verb-particle constructions (VPCs) entries in a dictionary, such as the Alvey Natural Language Tools (Carroll and Grover, 1989), just extracting VPCs from a corpus like the BNC (Baldwin, 2005).",
        "Furthermore, as MWEs are language dependent and culturally motivated, identifying the adequate translation of MWE occurrences is an important challenge for machine translation methods.",
        "In this paper, we investigate experimentally the",
        "A multiword expression (MWE) can be defined as any word combination for which the syntactic or semantic properties of the whole expression cannot be obtained from its parts (Sag et al., 2002).",
        "Examples of MWEs are phrasal verbs (break down, rely on), compounds (police car, coffee machine), idioms (rock the boat, let the cat out ofthe bag).",
        "They are very numerous in lan- use of an alignment-based approach for the iden-guages, as Biber et al.",

        "We look between 30% and 45% of spoken English and 21% at the use of several sources of data, including parallel corpora, using English and Portuguese data from a corpus of Pediatrics, and examining how a second language can provide relevant cues for this tasks.",
        "In this way, cost-effective tools for the automatic alignment of texts can generate a list of MWE candidates with their appropriate translations.",
        "Such an approach to the (semi-)automatic identification of MWEs can considerably speed up lexicographic work, providing a more targeted list of MWE candidates and their translations, for the construction of bilingual resources, and/or with some semantic information for monolingual resources.",

        "The term Multiword Expression has been used to describe a large number of distinct but related phenomena, such as phrasal verbs (e.g. come along), nominal compounds (e.g. frying pan), institutionalised phrases (e.g. bread and butter), and many others (Sag et al., 2002).",
        "They are very frequent in everyday language and this is reflected in several existing grammars and lexical resources, where almost half of the entries are Multiword Expressions.",
        "However, due to their heterogeneous characteristics, MWEs present a tough challenge for both linguistic and computational work (Sag et al., 2002).",
        "Some MWEs are fixed, and do not present internal variation, such as ad hoc, while others allow different degrees of internal variability and modification, such as touch a nerve (touch/find a nerve) and spill beans (spill several/musical/mountains ofbeans).",
        "In terms of semantics, some MWEs are more opaque in their meaning (e.g. to kick the bucket as to die), while others have more transparent meanings that can be inferred from the words in the MWE (e.g. eat up, where the particle up adds a completive sense to eat).",
        "Therefore, providing appropriate methods for the automatic identification and treatment of these phenomena is a real challenge for NLP systems.",
        "A variety of approaches has been proposed for automatically identifying MWEs, differing basically in terms of the type of MWE and language to which they apply, and the sources of information they use.",
        "Although some work on MWEs is type independent (e.g. (Zhang et al., 2006; Villavicencio et al., 2007)), given the heterogeneity of MWEs much of the work looks instead at specific types of MWE like collocations (Pearce, 2002), compounds (Keller and Lapata, 2005; Carlos Ramisch and Aline Villavicencio and Leonardo Moura and Marco Idiart, 2008).",
        "Some of these works concentrate on particular languages and (Piao et al., 2006) for Chinese), but some work has also benefitted from asymmetries in languages, using information from one language to help deal with MWEs in the other (e.g. (na Villada Moiron and Tiedemann, 2006; Caseli et al., 2009)).",
        "As basis for helping to determine whether a given sequence of words is in fact an MWE (e.g. ad hoc vs the small boy) some of these works employ linguistic knowledge for the task (Villavicen-cio, 2005), while others employ statistical methods (Pearce, 2002; Evert and Krenn, 2005; Zhang et al., 2006; Villavicencio et al., 2007) or combine them with some kinds of linguistic information such as syntactic and semantic properties (Baldwin and Villavicencio, 2002; Van de Cruys and na Villada Moiron, 2007) or automatic word alignment (na Villada Moiron and Tiedemann, 2006).",
        "Statistical measures of association have been commonly used for this task, as they can be democratically applied to any language and MWE type.",
        "However, there is no consensus about which measure is best suited for identifying MWEs in general.",
        "Villavicencio et al.",
        "(2007) compared some of these measures (mutual information, permutation entropy and %) for the type-independent detection of MWEs and found that Mutual Information seemed to differentiate MWEs from non-MWEs, but the same was not true of %2.",
        "In addition, Evert and Krenn (2005) found that for MWE identification the efficacy of a given measure depends on factors like the type of MWEs being targeted for identification, the domain and size of the corpora used, and the amount of low-frequency data excluded by adopting a threshold.",
        "Nonetheless, Villavicencio et al.",
        "(2007), discussing the influence of the corpus size and nature over the methods, found that these different measures have a high level of agreement about MWEs, whether in carefully constructed corpora or in more heterogeneous web-based ones.",
        "They also discuss the results obtained from adopting approaches like these for extending the coverage of resources, arguing that grammar coverage can be significantly increased if MWEs are properly identified and treated (Villavicencio et al., 2007).",
        "Among the methods that use additional information along with statistics to extract MWE, the one proposed by na Villada Moiron and Tiede-mann (2006) seems to be the most similar to our approach.",
        "The main difference between them is the way in which word alignment is used in the MWE extraction process.",
        "In this paper, the word alignment is the basis for the MWE extraction process while Villada Moiron and Tiedemann's method uses the alignment just for ranking the MWE candidates which were extracted on the basis of association measures (log-likelihood and salience) and head dependence heuristic (in parsed data).",
        "Our approach, as described in details by Caseli et al.",
        "(2009), also follows to some extent that of Zhang et al.",
        "(2006), as missing lexical entries for MWEs and related constructions are detected via error mining methods, and this paper focuses on the extraction of generic MWEs as a byproduct of an automatic word alignment.",
        "Another related work is the automatic detection of non-compositional compounds (NCC) by Melamed (1997) in which NCCs are identified by analyzing statistical translation models trained in a huge corpus by a time-demanding process.",
        "Given this context, our approach proposes the use of alignment techniques for identifying MWEs, looking at sequences detected by the aligner as containing more than one word, which form the MWE candidates.",
        "As a result, sequences of two or more consecutive source words are treated as MWE candidates regardless of whether they are translated as one or more target words."

        "The primary aim of the Pediatrics Glossary, as an online resource for long-distance education, was to train, qualify and support translation students on the domain of pediatrics texts.",

        "This post-processing resulted in 3,645 ngrams, which were manually checked by translation students, and resulted in 2,407 terms, with 1,421 bigrams, 730 trigrams and 339 ngrams with n larger than 3 (not considered in the experiments presented in this paper)."

        "Statistical measures of association have been widely employed in the identification of MWEs.",
        "The idea behind their use is that they are an inexpensive language and type independent means of detecting recurrent patterns.",
        "As Firth famously said a word is characterized by the company it keeps and since we expect the component words of an MWE to occur frequently together, then these measures can give an indication of MWE-ness.",
        "In this way, if a group of words co-occurs with significantly high frequency when compared to the frequencies of the individual words, then they may form an MWE.",
        "Indeed, measures such as Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI), Mutual Information (MI), %2, log-likelihood (Press et al., 1992) and others have been employed for this task, and some of them seem to provide more accurate predictions of MWEness than others.",
        "In fact, in a comparison of some measures for the type-independent detection of MWEs, MI seemed to differentiate MWEs from non-MWEs, but the same was not true of %2 (Villavicencio et al., 2007).",
        "In this work we use two commonly employed measures for this task: PMI and MI, as implemented in the Ngram Statistics Package (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2003).",
        "From the Portuguese portion of the Corpus of Pediatrics, 196,105 bigram and 362,663 trigram MWE candidates were generated, after filtering ngrams containing punctuation and numbers.",
        "In order to evaluate how these methods perform without any linguistic filtering, the only threshold employed was a frequency cut-off of 2 occurrences, resulting in 64,839 bigrams and 54,548 trigrams.",
        "Each of the four measures were then calculated for these ngrams, and we ranked each n-gram according to each of these measures.",
        "The average of all the rankings is used as the combined measure of the MWE candidates.",
        "The second of the MWE extraction approaches to be investigated in this paper is the alignment-based method.",
        "The automatic word alignment of two parallel texts – a text written in one (source) language and its translation to another (target) language – is the process of searching for correspondences between source and target words and sequences of words.",
        "For each word in a source sentence equivalences in the parallel target sentence are looked for.",
        "Therefore, taking into account a word alignment between a source word sequence S (S = s\\... sn with n > 2) and a target word sequence T (T = t\\.. .tm with m > 1), that is S <-> T, the alignmet-based MWE extracion method assumes that: (a) S and T share some semantic features, and (b) S may be a MWE.",
        "In other words, the alignment-based MWE extraction method states that the sequence S will be a MWE candidate if it is aligned with a sequence T composed of one or more words (a n : m alignment with n > 2 and m > 1 ).",
        "For example, the sequence of two Portuguese words aleitamento materno – which occurs 202 times in the corpus used in our experiments – is a MWE candidate because these two words were joined to be aligned 184 times with the word breastfeeding (a 2 : 1 alignment), 8 times with the word breastfed (a 2 : 1 alignment), 2 times with breastfeeding practice (a 2 : 2 alignment) and so on.",
        "Thus, notice that the alignment-based MWE extraction method does not rely on the conceptual asymmetries between languages since it does not expect that a source sequence of words be aligned with a single target word.",
        "The method looks for the sequences of source words that are frequently joined together during the alignment despite the number of target words involved.",
        "These features indicate that the method priorizes precision in spite of recall.",
        "It is also important to say that although the sequences of source and target words resemble the phrases used in the phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT), they are indeed a refinement of them.",
        "More specifically, although both approaches rely on word alignments performed by GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2000), in the alignment-based approach not all sequences of words are considered as phrases (and MWE candidates) but just those with an alignment n : m (n >= 2) with a target sequence.",
        "To confirm this assumption a phrase-based SMT system was trained with the same corpus used in our experiments and the number of phrases extracted following both approaches were compared.",
        "While the SMT extracted 819,208 source phrases, our alignment-based approach (without applying any part-of-speech or frequency filter) extracted only 34,277.",
        "These results show that the alignment-based approach refines in some way the phrases of SMT systems.",
        "In this paper, we investigate experimentally whether MWEs can be identified as a by-product of the automatic word alignment of parallel texts.",
        "We focus on Portuguese MWEs from the Corpus of Pediatrics and the evaluation is performed using the bigrams and trigrams from the Pediatrics Glossary as gold standard.",
        "To perform the extraction of MWE candidates following the alignment-based approach, first, the original corpus had to be sentence and word aligned and Part-of-Speech (POS) tagged.",
        "For these preprocessing steps were used, respectively: a version of the Translation Corpus Aligner (TCA) (Hofland, 1996), the statistical word aligner GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2000) and the morphological analysers and POS taggers from Apertium (Armentano-Oller et al., 2006).",
        "From the preprocessed corpus, the MWE candidates are extracted as those in which two or more words have the same alignment, that is, they are linked to the same target unit.",
        "This initial list of MWE candidates is, then, filtered to remove those candidates that: (a) match some sequences of POS tags or words (patterns) defined in previous experiments (Caseli et al., 2009) or (b) whose frequency is below a certain threshold.",
        "The remaining units in the candidate list are considered to be MWEs.",
        "Several filtering patterns and minimum frequency thresholds were tested and three of them are presented in details here.",
        "The first one (F1) is the same used during the manual building of the reference lists of MWEs: (a) patterns beginning with Article + Noun and beginning or finishing with verbs and (b) with a minimum frequency threshold of 5.",
        "The second one (F2) is the same used in the (Caseli et al., 2009), mainly: (a) patterns beginning with determiner, auxiliary verb, pronoun, adverb, conjunction and surface forms such as those of the verb to be (are, is, was, were), relatives (that, what, when, which, who, why) and prepositions (from, to, of ) and (b) with a minimum frequency threshold of 2.",
        "And the third one (F3) is the same as (Caseli et al., 2009) plus: (a) patterns beginning or finishing with determiner, adverb, conjunction, preposition, verb, pronoun and numeral and (b) with a minimum frequency threshold of 2."

        "MWEs are a complex and heterogeneous set of phenomena that defy attempts to capture them fully, but due to their role in communication they need to be properly accounted for in NLP applications and tasks.",
        "In this paper we investigated the identification of MWEs from technical domain, testing statistically-driven and alignment-based approaches for identifying MWEs from a Pediatrics parallel corpus.",
        "The alignment-based method generates a targeted precision-oriented list of MWE candidates, while the statistical methods produce recall-oriented results at the expense of precision.",
        "Therefore, the combination of these methods can produce a set of MWE candidates that is both more precise than the latter and has more coverage than the former.",
        "This can significantly speed up lexicographic work.",
        "Moreover, the results obtained show that in comparison with the manual extraction of MWEs, this approach can provide also a general set of MWE candidates in addition to the manually selected technical terms.",

        "Using the alignment-based extraction method we notice that it is possible to extract MWEs that are Pediatrics terms with a precision of 38% for bigrams and 20% for trigrams, but with very low recall since only the MWEs in the Pediatrics Glossary were considered correct.",
        "However, after a manual analysis carried out by two native speakers of Portuguese we found that the percentage of true MWEs considered by both or at least one of them were, respectively, 65.97% and 75.92%.",
        "This was a significative improvement but it is important to say that, in this manual analysis, the human experts classified the MWEs as true independently of them being Pediatrics terms.",
        "So, as future work we intend to carry out a more carefull analysis with experts in Pediatrics to evaluate how many MWEs candidates are also Pediatrics terms.",
        "In addition, we plan to investigate a weighted combination of these methods, favouring those that have better precision.",
        "Finally, we also intend to apply the results obtained in to the semiautomatic construction of ontologies."
