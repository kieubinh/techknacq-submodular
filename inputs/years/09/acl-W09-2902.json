        "Keyphrases are simplex nouns or noun phrases (NPs) that represent the key ideas of the document.",
        "Keyphrases can serve as a representative summary of the document and also serve as high quality index terms.",
        "It is thus no surprise that keyphrases have been utilized to acquire critical information as well as to improve the quality of natural language processing (NLP) applications such as document summarizer(Davanzo and Magnini, 2005), information retrieval (IR)(Gutwin et al., 1999) and document clustering(Hammouda et al., 2005).",
        "In the past, various attempts have been made to boost automatic keyphrase extraction performance based primarily on statistics(Frank et al., 1999; Turney, 2003; Park et al., 2004; Wan and Xiao, 2008) and a rich set of heuristic features(Barker and Corrnacchia, 2000; Medelyan and Witten, 2006; Nguyen and Kan, 2007).",
        "In Section 2, we give a more comprehensive overview of previous attempts.",
        "Current keyphrase technology still has much room for improvement.",
        "First of all, although several candidate selection methods have been proposed for automatic keyphrase extraction in the past (e.g. (Frank et al., 1999; Park et al., 2004; Nguyen and Kan, 2007)), most of them do not effectively deal with various keyphrase forms which results in the ignorance ofsome keyphrases as candidates.",
        "Moreover, no studies thus far have done a detailed investigation of the nature and variation of manually-provided keyphrases.",
        "As a consequence, the community lacks a standardized list of candidate forms, which leads to difficulties in direct comparison across techniques during evaluation and hinders re-usability.",
        "Secondly, previous studies have shown the effectiveness of their own features but not many compared their features with other existing features.",
        "That leads to a redundancy in studies and hinders direct comparison.",
        "In addition, existing features are specifically designed for supervised approaches with few exceptions.",
        "However, this approach involves a large amount of manual labor, thus reducing its utility for real-world application.",
        "Hence, unsupervised approach is inevitable in order to minimize manual tasks and to encourage utilization.",
        "It is a worthy study to attest the reliability and re-usability for the unsupervised approach in order to set up the tentative guideline for applications.",
        "This paper targets to resolve these issues of candidate selection and feature engineering.",
        "In our work on candidate selection, we analyze the nature and variation of keyphrases with the purpose of proposing a candidate selection method which improves the coverage of candidates that occur in various forms.",
        "Our second contribution re-examines existing keyphrase extraction features reported in the literature, in terms of their effectiveness and re-usability.",
        "We test and compare the usefulness of each feature for further improvement.",
        "In addition, we assess how well these features can be applied in an unsupervised approach.",
        "In the remaining sections, we describe an overview of related work in Section 2, our proposals on candidate selection and feature engineering in Section 4 and 5, our system architecture and data in Section 6.",

        "Features used can be categorized into three broad groups: (1) document cohesion features (i.e. relationship between document and keyphrases)(Frank et al., 1999; Matsuo and Ishizuka, 2004; Medelyan and Witten, 2006; Nguyen and Kan, 2007), and to lesser, (2) keyphrase cohesion features (i.e. relationship among keyphrases)(Turney, 2003) and (3) term cohesion features (i.e. relationship among components in a keyphrase)(Park et al., 2004).",
        "The simplest system is KEA (Frank et al., 1999; Witten et al., 1999) that uses TF*IDF (i.e. term frequency * inverse document frequency) and first occurrence in the document.",
        "TF*IDF measures the document cohesion and the first occurrence implies the importance of the abstract or introduction which indicates the keyphrases have a locality.",
        "Turney (2003) added the notion of keyphrase cohesion to KEA features and Nguyen and Kan (2007) added linguistic features such as section information and suffix sequence.",

        "In previous study, KEA employed the indexing words as candidates whereas others such as (Park et al., 2004; Nguyen and Kan, 2007) generated handcrafted regular expression rules.",
        "However, none carefully undertook the analysis of keyphrases.",
        "We believe there is more to be learned from the reference keyphrases themselves by doing a fine-grained, careful analysis of their form and composition.",
        "Note that we used the articles collected from ACM digital library for both analyzing keyphrases as well as evaluating methods.",
        "See Section 6 for data in detail.",
        "Syntactically, keyphrases can be formed by either simplex nouns (e.g. algorithm, keyphrase, multi-agent) or noun phrases (NPs) which can be a sequence of nouns and their auxiliary words such as adjectives and adverbs (e.g. mobile network, fast computing, partially observable Markov decision process) despite few incidences.",
        "They can also incorporate a prepositional phrase (PP) (e.g. quality ofservice, policy ofdistributed caching).",
        "When keyphrases take the form of an NP with an attached PP (i.e. NPs in of-PP form), the preposition ofis most common, but others such as for, in, via also occur (e.g. incentive for cooperation, inequality in welfare, agent security via approximate policy, trade in financial instrument based on logical formula).",
        "The patterns above correlate well to part-of-speech (POS) patterns used in modern keyphrase extraction systems.",
        "However, our analysis uncovered additional linguistic patterns and alternations which other studies may have overlooked.",
        "In our study we also found that keyphrases also occur as a simple conjunctions (e.g. search and rescue, propagation and delivery), and much more rarely, as conjunctions of more complex NPs (e.g. history of past encounter and transitivity).",
        "Some keyphrases appear to be more complex (e.g. pervasive document edit and management system, task and resource allocation in agent system).",
        "Similarly, abbreviations and possessive forms figure as common patterns (e.g. belief desire intention = BDI, inverse document frequency = (IDF); Bayes' theorem, agent's dominant strategy).",
        "A critical insight of our work is that keyphrases can be morphologically and semantically altered.",
        "Keyphrases that incorporate a PP or have an underlying genitive composition are often easily varied by word order alternation.",
        "Previous studies have used the altered keyphrases when forming in of-PP form.",
        "For example, quality ofservice can be altered to service quality, sometimes with little semantic difference.",
        "Also, as most morphological variation in English relates to noun number and verb inflection, keyphrases are subject to these rules as well (e.g. distributed system = distributing system, dynamical caching = dynamical cache).",
        "In addition, possessives tend to alternate with of-PP form (e.g. agent's goal = goal of agent, security's value = value of security)."

        "In previous study, KEA employed the indexing words as candidates whereas others such as (Park et al., 2004; Nguyen and Kan, 2007) generated handcrafted regular expression rules.",

        "In this section, before we present our method, we first describe the detail of keyphrase analysis.",
        "In our keyphrase analysis, we observed that most of author assigned keyphrase and/or reader assigned keyphrase are syntactically more often simplex words and less often NPs.",
        "When keyphrases take an NP form, they tend to be a simple form of NPs.",
        "i.e. either without a PP or with only a PP or with a conjunction, but few appear as a mixture of such forms.",
        "We also noticed that the components of NPs are normally nouns and adjectives but rarely, are adverbs and verbs.",
        "As a result, we decided to ignore NPs containing adverbs and verbs in this study as our candidates since they tend to produce more errors and to require more complexity.",
        "Another observation is that keyphrases containing more than three words are rare (i.e. 6% in our data set), validating what Paukkeri et al.",
        "(2008) observed.",
        "Hence, we apply a length heuristic.",
        "Our candidate selection rule collects candidates up to length 3, but also of length 4 for NPs in of-PP form, since they may have a non-genetive alternation that reduces its length to 3 (e.g. performance of distributed system = distributed system performance).",
        "In previous studies, words occurring at least twice are selected as candidates.",
        "However, during our acquisition of reader assigned keyphrase, we observed that readers tend to collect NPs as keyphrases, regardless of their frequency.",
        "Due to this, we apply different frequency thresholds for simplex words (>= 2) and NPs (>= 1).",
        "Note that 30% of NPs occurred only once in our data.",
        "Finally, we generated regular expression rules to extract candidates, as presented in Table 1.",
        "Our candidate extraction rules are based on those in Nguyen and Kan (2007).",
        "However, our Rule6 for NPs in of-PP form broadens the coverage of possible candidates.",
        "i.e. with a given NPs in of-PP form, not only we collect simplex word(s), but we also extract non-of-PP form of NPs from noun phrases governing the PP and the PP.",

        "To re-examine features, we analyzed the impact of existing and new features and their variations.",
        "First of all, unlike previous studies, we found that the performance with and without TF*IDF did not lead to a large difference which indicates the impact of TF*IDF was minor, as long as other features are incorporated.",
        "Secondly, counting substrings for TF improved performance, while applying term weighting for TF and/or IDF did not impact on the performance.",
        "We estimated the cause that many of keyphrases are substrings of candidates and vice versa.",
        "Thirdly, section information was also validated to improve performance, as in Nguyen and Kan (2007).",
        "Extending this logic, modeling additional section information (related work) and weighting sections both turned out to be useful features.",
        "Other locality features were also validated as helpful: both first occurrence and last occurrence are helpful as it implies the locality of the key ideas.",
        "In addition, keyphrase co-occurrence with selected sections was proposed in our work and found empirically useful.",
        "Term cohesion (Park et al., 2004) is a useful feature although it has a heuristic factor that reduce the weight by 10% for simplex words.",
        "Normally, term cohesion is subject to NPs only, hence it needs to be extended to work with multi-word NPs as well.",
        "Table 5 summarizes the reflections on each feature.",
        "As unsupervised methods have the appeal of not needing to be trained on expensive hand-annotated data, we also compared the performance of supervised and unsupervised methods.",
        "Given the features initially introduced for supervised learning, unsupervised performance is surprisingly high.",
        "While supervised classifier produced a matching count of 3.15, the unsupervised classifier obtains a count of 2.61.",
        "We feel this indicates that the existing features for supervised methods are also suitable for use in unsupervised methods, with slightly reduced performance.",
        "In general, we observed that the best features in both supervised and unsupervised methods are the same - section information and candidate length.",
        "In our analysis of the impact of individual features, we observed that most features affect performance in the same way for both supervised and unsupervised approaches, as shown in Table 5.",
        "These findings indicate that although these features may be been originally designed for use in a supervised approach, they are stable and can be expected to perform similar in unsupervised approaches.",
