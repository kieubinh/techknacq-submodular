        "In the literature in general a multiword expression (MWE) refers to a multiword unit or a collocation of words that co-occur together statistically more than chance.",
        "A MWE is a cover term for different types of collocations which vary in their transparency and fixedness.",
        "MWEs are pervasive in natural language, especially in web based texts and speech genres.",
        "Identifying MWEs and understanding their meaning is essential to language understanding, hence they are of crucial importance for any Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications that aim at handling robust language meaning and use.",
        "In fact, the seminal paper (Sag et al., 2002) refers to this problem as a key issue for the development of high-quality NLP applications.",
        "For our purposes, a MWE is defined as a collocation of words that refers to a single concept, for example - kick the bucket, spill the beans, make a decision, etc.",
        "An MWE typically has an idiosyncratic meaning that is more or different from the meaning of its component words.",
        "An MWE meaning is transparent, i.e. predictable, in as much as the component words in the expression relay the meaning portended by the speaker compositionally.",
        "Accordingly, MWEs vary in their degree of meaning compositionality; composition-ality is correlated with the level of idiomaticity.",
        "An MWE is compositional if the meaning of an",
        "MWE as a unit can be predicted from the meaning of its component words such as in make a decision meaning to decide.",
        "If we conceive of idiomaticity as being a continuum, the more idiomatic an expression, the less transparent and the more non-compositional it is.",
        "Some MWEs are more predictable than others, for instance, kick the bucket, when used idiomatically to mean to die, has nothing in common with the literal meaning of either kick or bucket, however, make a decision is very clearly related to to decide.",
        "Both of these expressions are considered MWEs but have varying degrees of compositionality and predictability.",
        "Both of these expressions belong to a class of idiomatic MWEs known as verb noun constructions (VNC).",
        "The first VNC kick the bucket is a non-decomposable VNC MWE, the latter make a decision is a decomposable VNC MWE.",
        "These types of constructions are the object of our study.",
        "To date, most research has addressed the problem of MWE type classification for VNC expressions in English (Melamed, 1997; Lin, 1999; Baldwin et al., 2003; na Villada Moiron and Tiedemann, 2006; Fazly and Stevenson, 2007; Van de Cruys and Villada Moiron, 2007; McCarthy et al., 2007), not token classification.",
        "For example: he spilt the beans on the kitchen counter is most likely a literal usage.",
        "This is given away by the use of the prepositional phrase on the kitchen counter, as it is plausable that beans could have literally been spilt on a location such as a kitchen counter.",
        "Most previous research would classify spilt the beans as idiomatic irrespective of contextual usage.",
        "In a recent study by (Cook et al., 2008) of 53 idiom MWE types used in different contexts, the authors concluded that almost half of them had clear literal meaning and over 40% of their usages in text were actually literal.",
        "Thus, it would be important for an NLP application such as machine translation, for example, when given a new VNC MWE token, to be able to determine whether it is used idiomatically or not as it could potentially have detrimental effects on the quality of the translation.",
        "In this paper, we address the problem of MWE classification for verb-noun (VNC) token constructions in running text.",
        "We investigate the binary classification of an unseen VNC token expression as being either Idiomatic (IDM) or Literal (LIT).",
        "An IDM expression is certainly an MWE, however, the converse is not necessarily true.",
        "To date most approaches to the problem of idiomaticity classification on the token level have been unsupervised (Birke and Sarkar, 2006; Diab and Krishna, 2009b; Diab and Krishna, 2009a; Sporleder and Li, 2009).",
        "In this study we carry out a supervised learning investigation using support vector machines that uses some of the features which have been shown to help in unsupervised approaches to the problem.",
        "This paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we describe our understanding of the various classes of MWEs in general.",
        "Section 3 is a summary of previous related research.",
        "Section 4 describes our approach.",
        "In Section 5 we present the details of our experiments.",

        "We apply a supervised learning framework to the problem of both identifying and classifying a MWE expression token in context.",

        "We use the annotated data by (Cook et al., 2008).",
        "We adopt a chunking approach to the problem using an Inside Outside Beginning (IOB) tagging framework for performing the identification of MWE VNC tokens and classifying them as idiomatic or literal in context.",
        "For chunk tagging, we use the Yam-",
        "Cha sequence labeling system.",
        "YamCha is based on Support Vector Machines technology using degree 2 polynomial kernels.",
        "We label each sentence with standard IOB tags.",
        "Since this is a binary classification task, we have 5 different tags: B-L (Beginning of a literal chunk), I-L (Inside of a literal chunk), BI (Beginning an Idiomatic chunk), II (Inside an Idiomatic chunk), O (Outside a chunk).",
        "As an example a sentence such as John kicked the bucket last Friday will be annotated as follows: John O, kicked B-I, the I-I, bucket I-I, last O, Friday O.",
        "We experiment with some basic features and some more linguistically motivated ones.",
        "We experiment with different window sizes for context ranging from – /+1 to – /+5 tokens before and after the token of interest.",
        "We also employ linguistic features such as character n-gram features, namely last 3 characters of a token, as a means of indirectly capturing the word inflectional and derivational morphology (NGRAM).",
        "Other features include: Part-of-Speech (POS) tags, lemma form (LEMMA) or the citation form of the word, and named entity (NE) information.",
        "The latter feature is shown to help in the unsupervised setting in recent work (Diab and Krishna, 2009b; Diab and Krishna, 2009a).",
        "In general all the linguistic features are represented as separate feature sets explicitly modeled in the input data.",
        "Hence, if we are modeling the POS tag feature for our running example the training data would be annotated as follows: {John NN O, kicked VBD B-I, the Det I-I, bucket NN I-I, last ADV O, Friday NN O }.",
        "Likewise adding the NGRAM feature would be represented as follows: {John NN ohn",
        "O, kicked VBD ked B-I, the Det the I-I, bucket NN ket I-I, last ADV ast O, Friday NN day O.}",
        "and so on.",

        "We have two settings for NES: one with the full 19 tags explicitly identified (NES-Full) and the other where we have a binary feature indicating whether a word is a NE or not (NES-Bin).",
        "Moreover, we added another experimental condition where we changed the words' representation in the input to their NE class, Named Entity InText (NEI).",
        "For example for the NEI condition, our running example is represented as follows: {PER NN ohn O, kicked VBD ked B-I, the Det the I-I, bucket NN ket I-I, last ADV ast O, DAY NN day O}, where John is replaced by the NE \"PER\" ."
