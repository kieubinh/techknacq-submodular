        "Parallel corpora have proved to be a valuable resource not only for statistical machine translation, but also for crosslingual induction of morphological, syntactic and semantic analyses (Yarowsky et al., 2001; Dyvik, 2004).",
        "In this paper, we propose an approach to the identification of multiword expressions (MWEs) that exploits translational correspondences in a parallel corpus.",
        "We will consider in translations of the following type:",
        "(1) Der Rat sollte unsere Position berücksichtigen.",
        "The Council should our position consider.",
        "(2) The Council should take account of our position.",
        "This sentence pair has been taken from the German - English section of the Europarl corpus (Koehn, 2005).",
        "It exemplifies a translational correspondence between an English MWE take account of and a German simplex verb berücksichtigen.",
        "In the following, we refer to such correspondences as one-to-many translations.",
        "Based on a study of verb translations in Europarl, we will explore to what extent one-to-many translations provide evidence for MWE realization in the target language.",
        "It will turn out that crosslingual correspondences realize a wide range of different linguistic patterns that are relevant for MWE identification, but that they pose problems to automatic word alignment.",
        "We propose an extraction method that combines distributional word alignment with syntactic filters.",
        "We will show that these correspondences can be reliably detected on dependency-parsed, wordaligned sentences and are able to identify various MWE patterns.",
        "In a monolingual setting, the task of MWE extraction is usually conceived of as a lexical association problem where distributional measures model the syntactic and semantic idiosyncracy exhibited by MWEs, e.g. (Pecina, 2008).",
        "This approach generally involves two main steps: 1) the extraction of a candidate list of potential MWEs, often constrained by a particular target pattern of the detection method, like verb particle constructions (Baldwin and Villavicencio, 2002) or verb PP combinations (Villada Moiron and Tiede-mann, 2006), 2) the ranking of this candidate list by an appropriate assocation measure.",
        "The crosslingual MWE identification we present in this paper is, a priori, independent of any specific association measure or syntactic pattern.",
        "The translation scenario allows us to adopt a completely data-driven definition of what constitutes an MWE: Given a parallel corpus, we propose to consider those tokens in a target language as MWEs which correspond to a single lexical item in the source language.",
        "The intuition is that if a group of lexical items in one language can be realized as a single item in another language, it can be considered as some kind of lexically fixed entity.",
        "By this means, we will not approach the MWE identification problem by asking for a given list of candidates whether these are MWEs or not.",
        "Instead, we will ask for a given list of lexical items in a source language whether there exists a one-to-many translation for this item in a target language (and whether these one-to-many translations correspond to MWEs).",
        "This strategy offers a straightforward solution to the interpretation problem: As the translation can be related to the meaning of the source item and to its other translations in the target language, the interpretation is independent of the expression's transparency.",
        "This solution has its limitations compared to other approaches that need to automatically establish the degree of compositionality of a given MWE candidate.",
        "However, for many NLP applications, coarse-grained knowledge about the semantic relation between a wide range of MWEs and their corresponding atomic realization is already very useful.",
        "In this work, we therefore focus on a general method of MWE identification that captures the various patterns of translational correspondences that can be found in parallel corpora.",
        "Our experiments described in section 3 show that one-to-many translations should be extracted from syntactic configurations rather than from unstructured sets of aligned words.",
        "This syntax-driven method is less dependent on frequency distributions in a given corpus, but is based on the intuition that monolingual idiosyncracies like MWE realization of an entity are not likely to be mirrored in another language (see section 4 for discussion).",
        "Our goal in this paper is twofold: First, we want to investigate to what extent one-to-many translational correspondences can serve as an empirical basis for MWE identification.",
        "To this end, Section 2 presents a corpus-based study of the relation between one-to-many translations and MWEs that we carried out on a translation gold standard.",
        "Second, we investigate methods for the automatic detection of complex lexical correspondences for a given parallel corpus.",
        "Therefore, Section 3 evaluates automatic word alignments against our gold standard and gives a method for high-precision one-to-many translation detection that relies on syntactic filters, in addition to word-alignments."

        "The idea to exploit one-to-many translations for the identification of MWE candidates has not received much attention in the literature.",
        "Thus, it is not a priori clear what can be expected from translational correspondences with respect to MWE identification.",
        "To corroborate the intuitions introduced in the last section, we carried out a corpus-based study that aims to discover linguistic patterns exhibited by one-to-many translations.",
        "We constructed a gold standard covering all English translations of four German verb lemmas extracted from the Europarl Corpus.",
        "These verbs subcategorize for a nominative subject and an accusative object and are in the middle frequency layer (around 200 occurrences).",
        "We extracted all sentences in Europarl with occurences of these lemmas and their automatic word alignments produced by GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003).",
        "These alignments were manually corrected on the basis of the crosslingual word alignment guidelines de-velopped by (Graca et al., 2008).",

        "Table 1 shows the distribution of these categories for each verb.",
        "Strikingly, the four verbs show very different proportions concerning the types of their translational correspondences.",

        "Since this gold standard is to small to draw conclusions about the quality of MWE patterns that the system detects, we further evaluate the translational correspondences for a larger set of verbs.",
        "Translation evaluation: In the first experiment, we extracted all types of translational correspondences for the verbs we annotated in the gold standard.",
        "We converted the output dependency configurations to the lemmatized bag-of-word form we already applied for the alignment evaluation and calculated the FPR and FNR of the translation types.",
        "The evaluation is displayed in table 4.",
        "Nearly all translation types that our system detected are correct.",
        "This confirms our hypothesis that syntactic filtering yields more reliable translations that just coocurrence-based alignments.",
        "However, the false negative rate is also very high.",
        "This low recall is due to the fact that our syntactic filters are very restrictive such that a major part of the occurrences of the source lemma don't figure in the prototypical syntactic configuration.",
        "Column two and three of the evaluation table present the FPR and FNR for experiments with a relaxed syntactic filter that doesn't constrain the syntactic type of the parallel argument relations.",
        "While not decreasing the FNR, the FPR decreases significantly.",
        "This means that the syntactic filters mainly fire on noisy configurations and don't decrease the recall.",
        "A manual error analysis has also shown that the relatively flat annotation scheme of our dependency parses significantly narrows down the number of candidate configurations that our algorithm detects.",
        "As the dependency parses don't provide deep analyses for tense or control phenomena, very often, a verb's arguments don't figure as its syntactic dependents and no coniguration is found.",
        "Future work will explore the impact of deep syntactic analysis for the detection of translational correspondences.",
        "MWE evaluation: In a second experiment, we evaluated the patterns of correspondences found by our extraction method for use in an MWE context.",
        "Therefore, we selected 50 random verbs occurring in the Europarl corpus and extracted their respective translational correspondences.",
        "This set of 50 verbs yields a set of 1592 one-to-many types of translational correspondences.",
        "We iltered the types wich display only morphological variation, such that the set of potential MWE types comprises 1302 types.",
        "Out of these, we evaluated a random sample of 300 types by labelling the types with the MWE categories we established for the analysis of our gold standard.",
        "During the clas-siication, we encountered a further category of oneto- many correspondence which cannot be considered an MWE, the category of alternation.",
        "For instance, we found a translational correspondence between the active realization of the German verb begrüßen (en.",
        "appreciate) and the English passive be pleased by.",
        "The classiication is displayed in table 5.",
        "Almost 83% of the translational correspondences that our system extracted are perfect translation types.",
        "Almost 60% of the extracted types can be considered MWEs that exhibit some kind of semantic idiosyncrasy.",
        "The other translations could be classiied as paraphrases or alternations.",
        "In our random sample, the portions of idioms is signii-cantly higher than in our gold standard which con-irms our intuition that the MWE pattern of the one-to-many translations for a given verb are related to language-speciic, semantic properties of the verbs and the lexical concepts they realize."

        "Syntax-based translation that speci-ies formal relations between bilingual parses was established by (Wu, 1997).",
        "Our way to use syntactic configurations can be seen as a heuristic to check relaxed structural parallelism.",
        "Work on MWEs in a crosslingual context has almost exclusively focussed on MWE translation (Smadja and McKeown, 1994; Anastasiou, 2008).",
        "In (Villada Moiron and Tiedemann, 2006), the authors make use of alignment information in a parallel corpus to rank MWE candidates.",
        "These approaches don't rely on the lexical semantic knowledge about MWEs in form of one-to-many translations.",
        "By contrast, previous approaches to paraphrase extraction made more explicit use of crosslingual semantic information.",
        "In (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005), the authors use the target language as a pivot providing contextual features for identifying semantically similar expressions.",
        "Paraphrasing is however only partially comparable to the crosslingual MWE detection we propose in this paper.",
        "Recently, the very pronounced context dependence of monolingual pairs of semantically similar expressions has been recognized as a major challenge in modelling word meaning (Erk and",
        "Pado, 2009).",
        "The idea that parallel corpora can be used as a linguistic resource that provides empirical evidence for monolingual idiosyncrasies has already been exploited in, e.g. morphology projection (Yarowsky et al., 2001) or word sense disambiguation (Dyvik, 2004).",
        "While in a monolingual setting, it is quite tricky to come up with theoretical or empirical definitions of sense discriminations, the crosslingual scenario offers a theory-neutral, data-driven solution: Since ambiguity is an idiosyncratic property of a lexical item in a given language, it is not likely to be mirrored in a target language.",
        "Similarly, our approach can also be seen as a projection idea: we project the semantic information of simplex realization in a source language to an idiosyncratic, multiword realization in the target language.",

        "We have explored the phenomenon of one-to-many translations in parallel corpora from the perspective of MWE identification.",

        "It challenges the distinction between paraphrases and MWEs, a problem that does not arise at all in the context of monolingual MWE extraction.",
        "It also allows for the study of the relation between the semantics of lexical concepts and their MWE realization.",
        "Further research in this direction should investigate translational correspondences on a larger scale and further explore these for monolingual interpretation of MWEs.",
        "Our extraction method that is based on syntactic filters identifies MWE types with a much higher precision than purely cooccurence-based word alignment and captures the various patterns we found in our gold standard.",
        "Future work on the extraction method will have to focus on the generalization of these filters and the generalization to other items than verbs.",
        "The experiments presented in this paper also suggest that the MWE realization of certain lexical items in a target language is subject to certain linguistic patterns.",
        "Moreover, the method we propose is completely languagein-dependent such that further research has to study the impact of the relatedness of the considered languages on the patterns of one-to-many translational correspondences."
