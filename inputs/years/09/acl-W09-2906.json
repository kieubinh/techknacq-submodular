        "A CP in Hindi is a syntactic construction consisting of either a verb, a noun, an adjective or an adverb as main predicator followed by a light verb (LV).",
        "Thus, a CP can be a noun+LV, an adjective+LV, a verb+LV or an adverb+LV.",
        "Further, it is also possible that a CP is followed by a LV (CP+LV).",
        "The light verb carries the tense and agreement morphology.",
        "In V+V CPs, the contribution of the light verb denotes aspectual terms such as continuity, perfectivity, inception, completion, or denotes an expression of forcefulness, suddenness, etc.",
        "(Singh, 1994; Butt, 1995).",
        "The CP in a sentence syntactically acts as a single lexical unit of verb that has a meaning distinct from that of the LV.",
        "CPs are also referred as the complex or compound verbs.",

        "On the other hand in example (2), the verb dii (gave) is a simple verb in past tense form and is not a light verb.",
        "Although, same Hindi verb denaa (to give) is used in both the examples, it is a light verb in (1) and a main verb in (2).",
        "Whether it acts as a light verb or not, depends upon the semantics of the preceding noun.",
        "However, it is observed that the English meaning in case of the complex predicate is not derived from the individual meanings of the constituent words.",
        "It is this observation that forms basis of our approach for mining of CPs.",

        "The semantic interpretations in the two cases remain the same.",
        "It may be noted that the word vaapas (return) is also a noun and in such a case the CP is a noun+LV.",
