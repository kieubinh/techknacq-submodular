        "To utilize the robustness of phrases and make up the lack of syntax or semantic information in phrase-based model for domain translation, we study domain bilingual multiword expressions and integrate them to the existing phrase-based model.",
        "A multiword expression (MWE) can be considered as word sequence with relatively fixed structure representing special meanings.",
        "There is no uniform definition of MWE, and many researchers give different properties of MWE.",

        "(2002) roughly defined MWE as \"idiosyncratic interpretations that cross word boundaries (or spaces)\".",
        "Cruys and Moiron (2007) focused on the non-compositional property of MWE, i.e. the property that whole expression cannot be derived from their",
        "component words.",
        "Stanford university launched a MWE project , in which different qualities of MWE were presented.",
        "For bilingual multiword expression (BiMWE), we define a bilingual phrase as a bilingual MWE if (1) the source phrase is a MWE in source language; (2) the source phrase and the target phrase must be translated to each other exactly, i.e. there is no additional (boundary) word in target phrase which cannot find the corresponding word in source phrase, and vice versa.",
        "In recent years, many useful methods have been proposed to extract MWEs or BiMWEs automatically (Piao et al., 2005; Bannard, 2007; Fazly and Stevenson, 2006).",
        "Since MWE usually constrains possible senses of a polysemous word in context, they can be used in many NLP applications such as information retrieval, question answering, word sense disambiguation and so on.",
        "For machine translation, Piao et al.",
        "(2005) have noted that the issue of MWE identification and accurate interpretation from source to target language remained an unsolved problem for existing MT systems.",
        "This problem is more severe when MT systems are used to translate domain-specific texts, since they may include technical terminology as well as more general fixed expressions and idioms.",
        "Although some MT systems may employ a machine-readable bilingual dictionary of MWE, it is time-consuming and inefficient to obtain this resource manually.",
        "Therefore, some researchers have tried to use automatically extracted bilingual",

        "Nonetheless, since MWE represents liguistic knowledge, the role and usefulness of MWE in full-scale SMT is intuitively positive.",
        "The difficulty lies in how to integrate bilingual MWEs into existing SMT system to improve SMT performance, especially when translating domain texts.",
        "In this paper, we implement three methods that integrate domain bilingual MWEs into a phrase-based SMT system, and show that these approaches improve translation quality significantly.",
        "The main difference between our methods and Lambert and Banchs' work is that we directly aim at improving the SMT performance rather than improving the word alignment quality.",
        "In detail, differences are listed as follows:",
        "• Instead of using the bilingual n-gram translation model, we choose the phrase-based SMT system, Moses, which achieves significantly better translation performance than many other SMT systems and is a state-of-the-art SMT system.",
        "• Instead of improving translation indirectly by improving the word alignment quality, we directly target at the quality of translation.",
        "Some researchers have argued that large gains of alignment performance under many metrics only led to small gains in translation performance (Ayan and Dorr, 2006; Fraser",
        "and Marcu, 2007).",
        "Besides the above differences, there are some advantages of our approaches:",
        "• In our method, automatically extracted MWEs are used as additional resources rather than as phrase-table filter.",
        "Since bilingual MWEs are extracted according to noisy automatic word alignment, errors in word alignment would further propagate to the SMT and hurt SMT performance.",
        "• We conduct experiments on domain-specific corpus.",
        "For one thing, domain-specific",
        "corpus potentially includes a large number of technical terminologies as well as more general fixed expressions and idioms, i.e. domain-specific corpus has high MWE coverage.",
        "For another, after the investigation, current SMT system could not effectively deal with these domain-specific MWEs especially for Chinese, since these MWEs are more flexible and concise.",
        "Take the Chinese term \"ffi M W ^o\" for example.",
        "The meaning of this term is \"soften hard mass and dispel pathogenic accumulation\".",
        "Every word of this term represents a special meaning and cannot be understood literally or without this context.",
        "These terms are difficult to be translated even for humans, let alone machine translation.",
        "So, treating these terms as MWEs and applying them in SMT system have practical significance.",
        "• In our approach, no additional corpus is introduced.",
        "We attempt to extract useful MWEs from the training corpus and adopt suitable methods to apply them.",
        "Thus, it benefits for the full exploitation ofavailable resources without increasing great time and space complexities of SMT system.",

        "In this section we describe our approach of bilingual MWE extraction.",
        "In the first step, we obtain monolingual MWEs from the Chinese part of parallel corpus.",
        "After that, we look for the translation of the extracted MWEs from parallel corpus.",
        "In the past two decades, many different approaches on automatic MWE identification were reported.",
        "In general, those approaches can be classified into three main trends: (1) statistical approaches (Pantel and Lin, 2001; Piao et al., 2005), (2) syntactic approaches (Fazly and Stevenson, 2006; Bannard, 2007), and (3) semantic approaches (Baldwin et al., 2003; Cruys and Moiron, 2007).",
        "Syntax-based and semantic-based methods achieve high precision, but syntax or semantic analysis has to be introduced as preparing step, so it is difficult to apply them to domains with few syntactical or semantic annotation.",
        "Statistical approaches only consider frequency information, so they can be used to obtain MWEs from bilingual corpora without deeper syntactic or semantic analysis.",
        "Most statistical measures only take two words into account, so it not easy to extract MWEs containing three or more than three words.",
        "Log Likelihood Ratio (LLR) has been proved a good statistical measurement of the association of two random variables (Chang et al., 2002).",
        "We adopt the idea of statistical approaches, and propose a new algorithm named LLR-based Hierarchical Reducing Algorithm (HRA for short) to extract MWEs with arbitrary lengths.",
        "To illustrate our algorithm, firstly we define some useful items.",
        "In the following definitions, we assume the given sentence is \"A B C D E\".",
        "Definition 1 Unit: A unit is any sub-string of the given sentence.",
        "For example, \"A B\", \"C\", \"CDE\" are all units, but \"A B D\" is not a unit.",
        "Definition 2 List: A list is an ordered sequence of units which exactly cover the given sentence.",
        "For example, (\"A\",\"B C D\",\"E\"} forms a list.",
        "Definition 3 Score: The score function only defines on two adjacent units and return the LLR between the last word of first unit and the first word of the second unit.",
        "For example, the score of adjacent unit \"B C\" and \"D E\" is defined as",
        "LLR(\"C\",\"D\").",
        "Definition 4 Select: The selecting operator is to find the two adjacent units with maximum score in a list.",
        "Definition 5 Reduce: The reducing operator is to remove two specific adjacent units, concatenate them, and put back the result unit to the removed position.",
        "For example, if we want to reduce unit \"B C\" and unit \"D\" in list (\"A\",\"B C\",\"D\",\"E\"}, we will get the list (\"A\",\"B CD\",\"E\"}.",
        "Initially, every word in the sentence is considered as one unit and all these units form a initial list L. If the sentence is of length N, then the list contains N units, of course.",
        "The final set of MWEs, S, is initialized to empty set.",
        "After initialization, the algorithm will enter an iterating loop with two steps: (1) select the two adjacent units with maximum score in L, naming U\\ and U2; and (2) reduce U\\ and U2 in L, and insert the reducing result into the final set S. Our algorithm terminates on two conditions: (1) if the maximum score after selection is less than a given threshold; or (2) if L contains only one unit.",
        "Let us make the algorithm clearer with an example.",
        "Assume the threshold of score is 20, the given sentence is \"Win K Am * $ MM ^\".",
        "Figure 1 shows the hierarchical structure of given sentence (based on LLR of adjacent words).",
        "In this example, four MWEs (\"K Am\", \"K Am *\", \"MM \"Wfe K Am *\") are extracted in the order, and sub-strings over dotted line in figure 1 are not extracted.",
        "From the above example, we can see that the extracted MWEs correspond to human intuition.",
        "In general, the basic idea of HRA is to reflect the hierarchical structure pattern of natural language.",
        "Furthermore, in the HRA, MWEs are measured with the minimum LLR of adjacent words in them, which gives lexical confidence of extracted MWEs.",
        "Finally, suppose given sentence has length N, HRA would definitely terminate within N – 1 iterations, which is very efficient.",
        "However, HRA has a problem that it would extract substrings before extracting the whole string, even if the substrings only appear in the particular whole string, which we consider useless.",
        "To solve this problem, we use contextual features, contextual entropy (Luo and Sun, 2003) and C-value (Frantzi and Ananiadou, 1996), to filter out those substrings which exist only in few MWEs.",
        "ci(Km K am*)",
        "C2(K am *)",
        "In subsection 2.1, we described the algorithm to obtain MWEs, and we would like to introduce the procedure to find their translations from parallel corpus in this subsection.",
        "For mining the English translations of Chinese MWEs, we first obtain the candidate translations of a given MWE from the parallel corpus.",

        "3.",

        "After the above procedure, we have already extracted all possible candidate translations of a given MWE.",
        "The next step is to distinguish right candidates from wrong candidates.",
        "We construct perceptron-based classification model (Collins, 2002) to solve the problem.",
        "We design two groups of features: translation features, which describe the mutual translating chance between source phrase and target phrase, and the language features, which refer to how well a candidate is a reasonable translation.",
        "The translation features include: (1) the logarithm of source-target translation probability; (2) the logarithm of target-source translation probability; (3) the logarithm of source-target lexical weighting; (4) the logarithm of target-source lexical weighting; and (5) the logarithm of the phrase pair's LLR (Dunning, 1993).",
        "The first four features are exactly the same as the four translation probabilities used in traditional phrase-based system (Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "The language features include: (1) the left entropy of the target phrase (Luo and Sun, 2003); (2) the right entropy of the target phrase; (3) the first word of the target phrase; (4) the last word of the target phrase; and (5) all words in the target phrase.",
        "We select and annotate 33000 phrase pairs randomly, of which 30000 pairs are used as training set and 3000 pairs are used as test set.",

        "This paper presents the LLR-based hierarchical reducing algorithm to automatically extract bilingual MWEs and investigates the performance of three different application strategies in applying bilingual MWEs for SMT system.",
        "The translation results show that using an additional feature to represent whether a bilingual phrase contains bilingual MWEs performs the best in most cases.",
        "The other two strategies can also improve the quality of SMT system, although not as much as the first one.",
        "These results are encouraging and motivated to do further research in this area.",
        "The strategies of bilingual MWE application is roughly simply and coarse in this paper.",
        "Complicated approaches should be taken into account during applying bilingual MWEs.",
        "For example, we may consider other features of the bilingual MWEs and examine their effect on the SMT performance.",
        "Besides application in phrase-based SMT system, bilingual MWEs may also be integrated into other MT models such as hierarchical phrase-based models or syntax-based translation models.",
        "We will do further studies on improving statistical machine translation using domain bilingual MWEs."
