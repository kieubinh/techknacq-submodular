        "Much research has been done on abbreviation extraction to detect terms having the same meaning.",
        "However, most previous studies (Hisamitsu and Niwa, 2001; Park and Byrd, 2001; Schwartz and Hearst, 2003; Adar, 2004; Sakai and Ma-suyama, 2005; Nadeau and Turney, 2005; Okazaki and Ananiadou, 2006; Okazaki et al., 2008(1); Okazaki et al., 2008(2)) aimed at extracting abbreviations of organization names and technical terms from well-written documents such as news articles and techincal papers.",
        "Many Japanese terms indicating individual TV programs, songs, comics, novels, and so on, are multi-word expressions and have the characteristics distinct from terms treated in most previous studies on abbreviation extraction.",
        "These terms can take several grammatical forms: a noun phrase, a sentence fragment, and even a sentence.",
        "Also, many of these expressions contain a variety of types of characters: kanji, hiragana, katakana, alphabet, digit, and symbol, and some of them contain colloquial expressions.",
        "Abbreviations of these expressions are often used in colloquial text such as chat or blog, and spoken sentences.",
        "To treat an abbreviation as a term having the same meaning as the original expression for NLP applications such as keyboard-based and speech-based information retrieval, an abbreviation generation method effective for this type of multi-word expressions is needed.",
        "However, it is not easy to ascertain abbreviations associated with their full forms.",
        "This is because although these terms become widely used in speech, they do not appear in well-written documents, such as newspaper articles or research papers, in which the abbreviations are clearly defined for use in the subsequent texts with certain lexical patterns, such as parenthesis.",
        "Therefore this paper describes an approach to generate abbreviation candidates from an original term and to rank them according to their probabilities of abbreviation.",
        "We assume that top-ranked abbreviations will be narrowed down by using Web search results in the future."

        "We extracted abbreviations listed and described on the Japanese Wikipedia site , which is a multilingual project to create a complete and accurate open content encyclopedia.",
        "First, we collected lists of abbreviations classified according to types of Japanese character.",

        "We extracted pairs of abbreviations and their full forms from each list and obtained 928, 245, and 399 abbreviations, respectively.",
        "Also, we extracted pairs of university names and their abbreviations from a list of university abbreviations on Wikipedia .",

        "Therefore, we used names of universities and extracted 523 abbreviations.",
        "Almost all of the nouns are kanji.",
        "Additionally, we extracted abbreviations of TV program titles from descriptions on each page of Wikipedia.",
        "This is because many TV program titles contain various types of characters or colloquial expressions different from the others we extracted.",
        "However, there are no lists of TV program titles in Wikipedia.",
        "Therefore, we gathered TV program titles satisfying the following criterion: the first sentence of the description of the Wikipedia page of the TV program title indicates that the page is about the TV program.",
        "And, in the same paragraph, if abbreviations are introduced by using key phrases such as \"BSjfpHi A\"(it means \"it is abbreviated as A\"), we extracted bold or parenthetical words in the key phrases.",
        "There were 326 abbreviations.",
        "Finally, we gathered abbreviations of TV program titles in TV schedules written in short form because of space limitations.",
        "In this process, we used program titles in TV schedules in newspapers as short forms and EPG data as long forms.",
        "When a title in the schedule is written with short form of the title with the same date, time, and channel as EPG data, we recognized that it is an abbreviation and the other is its full form.",
        "We extracted 603 abbreviations.",
        "In this paper, we focus on abbreviations that lack some characters compared with the full forms.",
        "The fallowings are well-known characteristics of Japanese abbreviations (Sakai and Masuyama, 2005; Enoki et al., 2007; Murayama and Oku-mura, 2008).",
        "Abbreviations are created according to rules: (1) retain the beginning of a word and omit the rest (truncation); (2) divide an original term into base words, retaining several substrings from some of them, and combine them (contraction).",
        "In particular, four-mora katakana abbreviations are often created by combining two-mora as in the case of the katakana words in Figure 2.",
        "Also, the length of an abbreviation in kanji tends to be two or three letters as in the case of the kanji words in Figure 2.",
        "Moreover, if an original term consists of katakana with the specific characters such as sokuon and chon in the middle, these characters tend to be dropped in abbreviations.",

      "text": [
        "In this section, we propose a new method to generate Japanese abbreviations by using the Log-Linear Model to rank abbreviation candidates.",
        "As mentioned in Section 2.2, Japanese abbreviation characteristics are evident in the composition of abbreviations, not in generation rules from their full forms.",
        "Therefore, we first generate possible abbreviations from an original term and rank them in descending order of probability of abbreviations.",
        "Our method uses a three-step process as",
        "Table 1: Abbreviation data sets, their types and number of terms(NT), average number of characters with standard deviation(SD), average number of characters per term in each type of character( (a)kanji, (b)katakana, (c)hiragana, (d)alphabet, (e)number, (fjspace), and proportion of terms with a single type of character (SC).",
        "follows: l)base word division, 2)candidate generation, and 3)ranking abbreviations.",
        "In this step, we divide terms into base words for abbreviations because Japanese is an agglutinative language.",
        "In order to deal with neologisms and colloquial expressions, we divide terms by using web search results instead of morphological analyzer.",
        "When a term t is divided into two substrings after the ith charcter t, we denote the anterior half by Si,ant and the posterior half by SiyP0St.",
        "A link strength D(tj) between Si,ant and SiyP0St is defined as follows:",
        "Note that hit(t) is calculated as the number of search results by using the term t in double quotes as one query on the Web.",
        "The formulation of D(ti) is mostly the same as Simpson's Coefficient except that the numerator is modified.",
        "We divide the term t after the fcth character where D(tk) is the smallest and repeat this process by using substrings divided in the previous operation as new t^s recursively.",
        "We heuristically set the stopping conditions as two kanji characters or four characters of other types.",
        "This dividing process works well because a set of words containing a term is stylized expression that is different from a sentence.",
        "For example, suppose that a term t is \"VivaVi-vaV6\", which is one of the TV program titles.",
        "All divisions into two of the term are \"V/ivaVivaV6\", \"Vi/vaVivaV6\", â¢ â¢ â¢, and \"VivaVivaV/6\".",
        "Here, the symbol \"/\"\" indicates a division point.",
        "Then,",
        "\".",
        "We used Yahoo web search API.",
        "http://developer.yahoo.co.jp/search/webA' 1 /webSearch.html",
        "D(ti)s are calculated as follows:",
        "When D(tg) is the smallest of all D(t{), \"VivaVi-vaV6\" is divided into \"VivaViva\" and \"V6\".",
        "The length of \"V6\" is two and is satisfied with the stopping conditions.",
        "Then, we continue to calculate D(ti) of \"VivaViva\" because the length of the substring is not satisfied with the stopping conditions.",
        "Finally, the divisions are fixed based on the following modifications.",
        "If a division is just before the sokuon or the chon, we eliminate the division because these cannot appear at the beginning of a word.",
        "Also, if the division is just before \"Â©\"(no), which is a hiragana character and one of the particles used to indicate possession and so on, we insert a division after the \"Â©\"(no) to make it one word because of the stopping conditions.",
        "Additionally, we combine some segments to form one word when there is a word in a transliteration dictionary of katakana corresponding to an English word.",
        "In this step, we generate abbreviation candidates by applying the following simple rules to all words containing a certain term.",

        "Additionally, let sum(len(subi),l,m) denote a summation of len(subi)(i = 1, â¢ â¢ â¢, m), and let com((fi(i), f2(i)), 1; tn) denote a combination of a feature fi(i) and a feature f2(i) from i = 1 to i = m. Here, we show all categories of features we used as follows:.",
        "A substring of a zth base word is generated by applying one of the rules from 2) to 7) in Step 2.",

        "Table 2 shows features for \"VVV6\" whose original term is \"VivaVivaV6\".",
        "Its base words subi are \"V\", \"V\", and \"V6\" because of the division as \"V/V/V6\".",
        "When i = 1, ch(subi) is equal to ALPHA, that is, an alphabetical character, and len(subi) is equal to 1.",
        "Therefore, for \"VVV6\", a feature in a category tp is generated by combination of the ch(subi) and len(subi) from i = 1 to i = m, that is, I ALPHA I ALPHA 2ALPIIA.",
        "Other features are also generated by calculating in the same way as tp.",
        "We cannot list all possible features because they depend on compositions of abbreviation candidates.",
        "Therefore, we prepare a zero feature for each category.",
        "If features do not appear in positive examples in a training data set, we assign them to zero features.",
        "For example, because a feature \"1KANJL5KANJI\" in category \"tp\" does not appear in positive examples of a training set, we use",
        "\"tpO\" as an alternative feature.",
        "However, wO is assigned when any features in category \"w\" do not appear in them.",
