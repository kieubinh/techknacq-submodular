        "The Turkish Discourse Bank (TDB) is a project initiated by the joint effort of a group of researchers in Turkey.",
        "The project builds on an existing corpus, namely the METU Turkish Corpus (MTC) (Say et al., 2002), and extends it to a discourse level resource by following the principles of the PDTB (Prasad et al., 2007) in annotating discourse connectives and their arguments.",
        "The 2-million-word MTC contains 520 continuous texts from various genres written between 1991-2000.",
        "From a semantic perspective, we take discourse connectives as predicates that take as their arguments tensed or untensed clauses with abstract object interpretations.",
        "Abstract objects are propositions, facts, events, situations, etc.",
        "(Asher, 1993).",
        "Connectives themselves may be realized explicitly or implicitly (Halliday, 1985; Prasad et al., 2007).",
        "Explicit connectives are simple or complex lexical items that encode a discourse relation, while implicit connectives can be inferred from related text spans that have coherence relations.",
        "The TDB project aims to annotate explicit connectives only.",
        "In Turkish, discourse connectives are identified with three syntactic categories (Zeyrek and Webber, 2008): (a) Coordinating conjunctions (b) Sub-ordinators (c) Discourse adverbials (or anaphoric connectives).",
        "All these discourse connectives have two and only two arguments, which are conveniently labeled as ARG1 and ARG2.",
        "ARG2 is always the argument that syntactically hosts the connective.",
        "The ARG1/ARG2 organization of discourse connectives is consistent with the following observations in discourse: Sentences in discourse are coherently related, and therefore when explicit discourse connectives are used, if they are really discourse connectives, they are bound to set up a relation between a consequent clause and its antecedent.",
        "(Note that the ARG2 designation does not imply that ARG2 is consequent or antecedent.)",
        "In certain cases presupposition needs a mediator, viz. the discourse connective.",
        "Noncon-nectival discourse relations are certainly possible, but connective-engendered discourse relations are claimed to be more specific about their semantics, e.g. they bring about presuppositional meaning (van der Sandt, 1992; Webber et al., 1999).",
        "In this regard, the ARG1/ARG2 classification is unlike syntactic subcategorization, which is a lexical property of functors (e.g. verbs) which are not necessarily presuppositional and hence they can differ in arbitrary ways (ditransitive, transitive, unergative, unaccusative etc.",
        ")."

        "Two of the connectives, i.e. ragmen and karsin expect action nominals, the person agreement suffix, and the dative suffix -(y)A on their ARG2.",
        "On the other hand, the connective halde expects a fac-tive nominal and the person agreement suffix.",
        "In the examples below, we show these suffixes with glosses on the English translations.",
