        "In this section, we describe an annotation system, similar to that of (Parent et al., 2008) described above, although based on a rich cascade of inite state transducers and a shallow syntactic analysis, as opposed to a full dependency parse.",
        "The system is made up principally of two modules, the first tagging temporal expressions (section 3.1), the second identifying and annotating event expressions (section 3.2).",
        "This module carries out the tagging and normalization of temporal expressions.",
        "The module consists of a large-coverage set of iniste state transducers developed with the Unitex corpus processor.",
        "The transducers in this large-coverage grammar, applied to raw text, recognize patterns of dates, times, duration and frequency and tag expressions with the appropriately typed <timex3>.",
        "A transducer matching expressions not to be marked up was also created.",
        "This transducer tags with the label <GARBAGE> expressions such as phone numbers, which could otherwise match numerical dates.",
        "The ambiguous word été (been/summer), when preceded by an adverb or the auxiliary verb avoir is tagged as <garbage>, as it has its verb rather than noun reading in this context.",
        "Other expressions tagged as <garbage> include the common expression les 35 heures (the French 35 hour week) and names of streets containing a date, such as la place du 13 Mai, etc.",
        "The normalization script, written in Perl, calculates the standard values of temporal expressions, including underspeciied deictic expressions, and removes annotations on items marked <GARBAGE>.",
        "The script consists of a set of substitution functions for each type of temporal expression tagged by the transducers.",
        "Each function converts the content of the expression into a TimeML standard value and inserts it in the value attribute of each <timex3> tag.",
        "This module is available for download at http://www.linguist.univ-paris-diderot.frAabittar.",
        "This approach differs from that of (Parent et al., 2008) in that it relies almost entirely on lexical processing.",
        "An evaluation was carried out on a subset of the corpus used to evaluate the similar module described in section 2.",
        "Our corpus consists of the 45 news articles from the Agence France Press used in the training and test sets described by (Parent et al., 2008).",
        "Figures for the evaluation are given in Table 2.",
        "The column labeled \"Loose\" represents the number of matches which cover an incomplete span of the expression, for example un mois (one month) instead of un mois et demi (a month and a half).",
        "The column \"Strict\" is for exact matches.",
        "The \"Value\" column represents the correctly normalized values for the temporal expressions detected, calculated over strict matches.",
        "These igures are much in line with those of the system described in (Parent et al., 2008).",
        "Performance is slightly lower on loose matches (F-score 87.1 versus 91.0), but we achieve better results on strict matches (F-score 83.0 versus 81.0).",
        "This could be explained by the fact that we did not develop our grammar on the same type of source text, but shows that the grammar has a good coverage of the variants of each type of expression.",
        "Sources of noise include age values tagged as durations, e.g. M. Dupont, 58 ans (Mr. Dupont, 58 years old) (11 errors), and numerical values taken to be years, e.g. l'asteroi'de 2001 UU92 (Asteroid 2001 UU92) (8 errors).",
        "Silence occurs mostly on coordinated date expressions or sequences, e.g. les 4, 5 et 6 février (the 4th, 5th and 6th ofFebruary) (11 errors) or expressions taking a \"vague\" normalized value, e.g. dans le passe (in the past) (15 errors).",

        "The majority of errors produced by our system (97 out of 167) are due to the fact that our normalization script does not yet fully deal with underspecified weekday expressions, such as jeudi soir (Thursday evening).",
        "In the hand-annotated corpus these expressions are fully resolved, with year, month and day values specified, e.g. 2002-01-15TEV, whereas we provide a correct, but not completely resolved value, which specifies the day of the week, e.g. 2 0 02-wxx-4tev.",
        "Excluding this difference in processing boosts precision to 73.6 and recall to 60.1 (F-score 66.85) for the normalization of values.",
        "We are currently working on fully normalizing these values.",
        "This module tags event expressions with the <event> tag and classifies the events according to the ontology defined for TimeML.",
        "It also detects negative polarity contexts, as well as any aspectual or modal properties of certain verbal constructions.",
        "Input is a text having undergone part-of-speech tagging, an inflectional morphological analysis and shallow syntactic analysis, carried out by Macaon, a modular processing pipeline for French.",
        "The Event tagger consists of several levels of processing - a layer of lexical processing, basically a lexical lookup for nouns and verb classes, and a layer of contextual processing consisting in the application of heuristics for detecting and eliminating event candidates and classifying them.",
        "This module relies on certain lexical resources.",
        "For the detection of event nominals, a lexicon containing nouns with at least one event interpretation is used.",
        "Many of the entries in this lexicon are ambiguous as they may also have a non-event interpretation.",
        "For example, repas (meal) has an object interpretation as well as an event reading.",
        "This highlights the need for disambiguation of nominals.",
        "The noun lexicon is based on the VerbAction lexicon (Hathout et al., 2002) which provided 9 200 unique deverbal noun lemmas.",
        "We further enriched the lexicon through semi-automated search engine queries, such as X a eu lieu (X took place) and lors du/de la/des X (during the X), where X is likely to be an event nominal.",
        "An initial application of this method yielded 769 unique noun lemmas which were not in VerbAction mostly rare or non-deverbal nouns, such as antico-agulotherapie (anticoagulation therapy) and anniversaire (birthday).",
        "The noun lexicon is of comparable size to that used in Evita.",
        "We created by hand a verb lexicon which is used to perform classiication of verbal events.",
        "It contains 200 lemmas for verbs in 6 of the 7 TimeML event classes.",
        "Verbs were initially added to the lexicon by translating those proposed in the TimeML classifcation for English.",
        "The list of verbs was enriched by querying the dictionary of synonyms at the Universite de Caen.",
        "The lexicon is small for the time being and will need to be increased to ensure better coverage for classiication.",
        "Like the noun lexicon, the lexicon of verbs contains ambiguities as certain verbs may belong to different classes or may not have an event reading in certain contexts.",
        "For example, the verb expliquer (to explain) belongs to the class reporting when it introduces a complementizer phrase in que (that) headed by an event (Max a explique qu'il avait commis une erreur - Maca explained that he had made a mistake).",
        "This is the class attributed by the lexicon.",
        "However, when it has a human subject and an event in object position (Le manager a explique le renouvellemetn de l'équipe - the manager explained the renewal ofthe team), it must be annotated with the class i_action.",
        "Finally, if this verb has events in both subject and object position (Le réchauffement climatique explique la fonte des calottes glacieres - global warming explains the melting ofthe ice caps), it is to be annotated with the class CAUSE.",
        "The system is thus confronted with the non-trivial problem of word sense disambiguation to identify the correct readings of nouns and verbs in the text.",
        "Initially, we tackle this problem for verbs with a number of heuristics, applied to local chunk context, for each of the TimeML verb classes in the lexicon.",
        "A total of 16 heuristics are used for choosing candidates for markup with the <EVENT> tag and 30 heuristics for classifying the events and determining values for the aspect, modality and polarity attributes.",
        "For example, in the case of the verb expliquer given above, the heuristics include a search for the complementizer que in the chunk after the verb and a search for an event nominal chunk directly to the left of the verb chunk (approximation of subject position).",
        "Further heuristics are used to eliminate verbs and nouns which do not have an event reading.",
        "For example, event nominal chunks which do not have a determiner, such as in prisonier de guerre (prisoner of war), are not considered as candidates as they do not denote event instances, but rather event types, and cannot be attributed a specific temporal localisation.",
        "A set of heuristics is used to detect predicative adjectives, like in Jean etait malade (Jean was sick), which are potential candidates for markup with the <EVENT> tag.",
        "For example, if the preceding verb is a copula, the adjective is flagged as a markable.",
        "To evaluate our event tagger we used a corpus of 30 hand-annotated news articles from the newspaper Le Monde.",
        "The corpus was split into a development set of 20 documents (11 224 tokens, 1 187 EVENT tags) and a test set of 10 documents (5 916 tokens, 583 event tags).",
        "Overall, the corpus contains 1 205 verbal, 471 nominal, 62 adjectival and 18 prepositional phrase event tags.",
        "The results shown in Table 3 are fairly homogenous over both the development and test sets.",
        "The detection of event verbs performs slightly lower than that of the other system for French, although the evaluations were carried out on different corpora.",
        "For nominals, our system makes a vast improvement on the performance of the other system described in this paper (an F-score of 74.5 versus 54.2 over the respective test sets).",
        "The large-coverage lexicon of event nominals allows for a good recall, although precision remains low as more disambiguation is required to filter out nominals with non-event readings.",
        "Performance on adjectival events is lower than the other system, although not as bad as might have been expected.",
        "This is likely due to the difference in depth of syntactic analysis available to each system."
