        "Despite the usefulness of images in expressing ideas, machine understanding of the meaning of an image remains a daunting task for computers, as the interplay between the different visual components of an image does not conform to any fixed pattern that allows for formal reasoning of its semantics.",
        "Often, the machine interpretation of the concepts present in an image, known as automatic image annotation, can only be inferred by its accompanying text or co-occurrence information drawn from a large corpus of texts and images (Li and Wang, 2008; Barnard and Forsyth, 2001).",
        "Not surprisingly, humans have the innate ability to perform this task reliably, but given a large database of images, manual annotation is both labor-intensive and time-consuming.",
        "Our work centers around the question : Provided an image with its associated text, can we use the text to reliably extract keywords that relevantly describe the image ?",
        "Note that we are not concerned with the generation of keywords for an image, but rather their extraction from the related text.",
        "Our goal eventually is to automate this task by leveraging on texts which are naturally occurring with images.",
        "In all our experiments, we only consider the use of nouns as annotation keywords."

        "Although automatic image annotation is a popular task in computer vision and image processing, there are only a few efforts that leverage on the multitude of resources available for natural language processing to derive robust linguistic based image annotation models.",
        "Most of the work has posed the annotation task as a classification problem, such as (Li and Wang, 2008), where images are annotated using semantic labels associated to a semantic class.",
        "The most recent work on image annotation using linguistic features (Feng and Lapata, 2008) involves implementing an extended version of the continuous relevance model that is proposed in (Jeon et al., 2003).",
        "The basic idea underlying their work is to perform annotation of a test image by using keywords shared by similar training images.",
        "Evaluation of their system performance is based on a dataset collected from the news domain (BBC).",
        "Unlike them, in this paper, we attempt to perform image annotation on datasets from unrestricted domains.",
        "We are also interested in extending the work pursued in (Deschacht and Moens, 2007), where visualness and salience are proposed as important textual features for discovering named entities present in an image, by extracting other textual features that can further improve existing image annotation models."

        "We use 180 images collected from the Web, from pages that have a single image within a specified size range (width and height of 275 to 1000 pixels).",
        "110 images are used for development, while the remaining 70 are used for test.",
        "We create two different gold standards.",
        "The first, termed as Intuitive annotation standard (GS'intuition), presents a user with the image in the absence of its associated text, and asks the user for the 5 most relevant annotations.",
        "The second, called Contextual annotation standard (GScontext), provides the user with a list of candidates for annotation, with the user free to choose any of the candidates deemed relevant to describe the image.",

        "strained to choose any candidate word, nor is she obligated to choose a specified number of candidates.",
        "For each image I in the evaluation set, we invited five users to perform the annotation task per gold standard.",
        "The agreement is 7.78% for GSintuition and 22.27% for GScontext, where we consider an annotation that is proposed by three or more users as one that is being agreed upon.",
        "The union of their inputs forms the set GSintuition (I) and GScontext(I) respectively.",
        "We do not consider image captions for use as a gold standard here due to their absence in many of the images - a random sampling of 15 images reveals that 7 of them lack captions.",
        "Contrary to their use as a proxy for annotation keywords in (Feng and Lapata, 2008; Deschacht and Moens, 2007), where evaluation is performed on datasets gleaned from authoritative news websites, most captions in our dataset are not guaranteed to be noise free.",
        "However, they are used as part of the text for generating annotations where they exist."

        "We approach the task of automatic image annotation using four methods.",
        "Due to the orthogonal nature in their search for keywords, the output for each method is generated separately and later combined in an unsupervised setting.",
        "However, all four methods perform their discrimination of words by drawing information exclusively from the text associated to the image, using no image visual features in the process.",
        "Every text describes at least one topic that can be semantically represented by a collection of words.",
        "Intuitively, there exists several \"clouds\" of semantically similar words that form several, possibly overlapping, sets of topics.",
        "Our task is to select the dominant topic put forward in the text, with the assumption that such a topic is being represented by the largest set of words.",
        "We use an adapted version of the K-means clustering approach, which attempts to find natural \"clusters\" of words in the text by grouping words with a common centroid.",
        "Each centroid is the semantic center of the group of words and the distance between each centroid and the words are approximated by ESA (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007).",
        "Further, we perform our experiments with the following assumptions : (1) To maximize recall, we assume that there are only two topics in every text.",
        "(2) Every word or collocation in the text must be classified under one of these two topics, but not both.",
        "In cases, where there is a tie, the classification is chosen randomly.",
        "For each dominant cluster extracted, we rank the words in decreasing order of their ESA distance to the centroid.",
        "Together, they represent the gist of the topic and are used as a set of candidates for labeling the image.",
        "Words that are lexically close to the picture in the document are generally well-suited for annotating the image.",
        "The assumption is drawn from the observation that the caption of an image is usually located close to the image itself.",
        "For images without captions, we consider words surrounding the image as possible candidates for annotation.",
        "Whenever a word appears multiple times within the text, its occurrence closest to the image is used to calculate the lexical distance.",
        "To discriminate against general words, we weigh the Lexical Distance Score (LDS) for each word by its tf * idf score as in the equation shown below :",
        "where LS(Wi) is the minimum lexical distance of Wi to the image, and idf is calculated using counts from the British National Corpus.",
        "To our knowledge, all word similarity metrics provide a symmetric score between a pair of words w1 and w2 to indicate their semantic similarity.",
        "Intuitively, this is not always the case.",
        "In psycholinguistics terms, uttering wi may bring into mind w2, while the appearance of w2 without any contextual clues may not associate with wi at all.",
        "Thus, the degree of similarity of wi with respect to w2 should be separated from that of w2 with respect to w1.",
        "We use a directional measure of similarity:",
        "where Cij is the count of articles in Wikipedia containing words wi and wj, Ci is the count of articles containing words wi, and Sim(wi, wj) is the cosine similarity of the ESA vectors representing the two words.",
        "The directional weight (Cij/Ci) amounts to the degree of association of wi with respect to wj.",
        "Using the directional inferential similarity scores as directed edges and distinct words as vertices, we obtain a graph for each text.",
        "The directed edges denotes the idea of \"recommendation\" where we say w1 recommends w2 if and only if there is a directed edge from w1 to w2, with the weight of the recommendation being the directional similarity score.",
        "By employing the graph iteration algorithm proposed in (Mihalcea and Ta-rau, 2004), we can compute the rank of a vertex in the entire graph.",
        "The output generated is a sorted list of words in decreasing order of their ranks, which serves as a list of candidates for annotating the image.",
        "Note that the top-ranked word must infer some or all of the words in the text.",
        "Some words are more pic urable than others.",
        "For instance, it is easy to find a picture that describes the word banana than another word paradigm.",
        "Clearly, picturable words in the associated text of an image are natural candidates for labeling it.",
        "Unlike the work in (Deschacht and Moens, 2007), we employ a corpus-based approach to compute word to word similarity.",
        "We collect a list of 200 manually-annotated words that are deemed to be picturable by humans.",
        "We use this list of words as our set of seed words, Sseed.",
        "We then iterate a bootstrapping process where each word in the text is compared to every word in the set of seed words, and any word having a maximum ESA score of greater than 0.95 is added to Sseed.",
        "Similarly, the maximum ESA score of each word over all Sseedwords is recorded.",
        "This is the picturability score of the word."
