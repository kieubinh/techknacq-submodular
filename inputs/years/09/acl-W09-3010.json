        "In recent years, systems have been developed with the long-term goal of detecting, in the writing of non-native speakers, usage errors involving articles, prepositions and noun number (Knight and Chander, 1994; Minnen et al., 2000; Lee, 2004; Han et al., 2005; Peng and Araki, 2005; Brockett et al., 2006; Turner and Charniak, 2007).",
        "These systems should, ideally, be evaluated on a corpus of learners' writing, annotated with acceptable corrections.",
        "However, since such corpora are expensive to compile, many researchers have instead resorted to measuring the accuracy of predicting what a native writer originally wrote in well-formed text.",
        "This type of evaluation effectively makes the assumption that there is one correct form of native usage per context, which may not always be the case.",
        "Two studies have already challenged this \"single correct construction\" assumption by comparing the output of a system to the original text.",
        "In (Tetreault and Chodorow, 2008), two human judges were presented with 200 sentences and, for each sentence, they were asked to select which preposition (either the writer's preposition, or the system's) better fits the context.",
        "In 28% of the cases where the writer and the system differed, the human raters found the system's prediction to be equal to or better than the writer's original preposition.",

        "Noun phrases with certain words, such as non-article determiners (e.g., this car), possessive pronouns (e.g., his car), cardinal numbers (e.g., one car) or quantifiers (e.g., some cars), also fall into this category.",
