        "Manually supplied annotation metadata is at the heart of (semi)supervised machine learning techniques which have become very popular in NLP research.",
        "At their flipside, they create an enormous bottleneck because major shifts in the domain of discourse, the basic entities of interest, or the text genre often require new annotation efforts.",
        "But annotations are costly in terms of getting well-trained and intelligible human resources involved.",
        "Surprisingly, cost awareness has not been a primary concern in most of the past linguistic annotation initiatives.",
        "Only recently, annotation strategies (such as Active Learning (Cohn et al., 1996)) which strive for minimizing the annotation load have gained increasing attention.",
        "Still, when it comes to the empirically plausible assessment of annotation costs even proponents of Active Learning make overly simplistic and empirically questionable assumptions, e.g., the uniformity of annotation costs over the number of linguistic units (e.g., tokens) to be annotated.",
        "We here consider the time it takes to annotate a particular entity mention as a natural indicator of effort for named entity annotations.",
        "In order to lay the empirical foundations for experimentally grounded annotation cost models we couple common named entity annotation metadata with a time stamp reflecting the time measured for decision making.",
        "Previously, two studies - one dealing with POS annotation (Haertel et al., 2008), the other with named entity and relation annotation (Settles et al., 2008) - have measured the time needed to annotate sentences on small data sets and attempted to learn predictive models of annotation cost.",
        "However, these data sets do not meet our requirements as we envisage a large, coherent, and also well-known newspaper entity corpus extended by annotation costs on a fine-grained level.",
        "Especially size and coherence of such a corpus are not only essential for building accurate cost models but also as a reference baseline for cost-sensitive annotation strategies.",
        "Moreover, the annotation level for which cost information is available is crucial because document-or sentence-level data might be too coarse for several applications.",
        "Accordingly, this paper introduces Muc7t, our extension to the entity annotations of the MUC7 corpus (Linguistic Data Consortium, 2001) where time stamps are added to two levels of annotation granularity, viz. sentences and complex noun phrases."

        "Our annotation initiative constitutes an extension to the named entity annotations (ENAMEX) of the English part of the MUC7 corpus covering New York Times articles from 1996.",
        "ENAMEX annotations cover three types of named entities, viz. persons, locations, and organizations.",
        "We instructed two human annotators, both advanced students of linguistics with good English language skills, to re-annotate the MUC7 corpus for the ENAMEX subtask.",
        "To be as consistent as possible with the existing Muc7 annotations, the annotators had to follow the original guidelines of the Muc7 named entity task.",
        "For ease of reannotation, we intentionally ignored temporal and number expressions (Timex and Numex).",
        "Muc7 covers three distinct document sets for the named entity task.",
        "We used one of these sets to train the annotators and develop the annotation design, and another one for our actual annotation initiative which consists of 100 articles reporting on airplane crashes.",
        "We split lengthy documents (27 out of 100) into halves to fit on the annotation screen without the need for scrolling.",
        "Furthermore, we excluded two documents due to over-length which would have required overly many splits.",
        "Our final corpus contains 3,113 sentences (76,900 tokens) (see Section 3.1 for more details).",
        "Time-stamped Enamex annotation of this corpus constitutes Muc7t, our extension of Muc7.",
        "Annotation time measurements were taken on two syntactically different annotation units of single documents: (a) complete sentences and (b) complex noun phrases.",
        "The annotation task was defined such as to assign an entity type label to each token of an annotation unit.",
        "Sentence-level annotation units where derived by the OpenNLP sentence splitter.",
        "The use of complex noun phrases (CNPs) as an alternative annotation unit is motivated by the fact that in Muc7 the syntactic encoding of named entity mentions basically occurs through nominal phrases.",
        "CNPs were derived from the sentences' constituency structure using the OpenNLP parser (trained on PennTree-Bank data) to determine top-level noun phrases.",
        "To avoid overly long phrases, CNPs dominating special syntactic structures, such as coordinations, appositions, or relative clauses, were split up at discriminative functional elements (e.g., a relative pronoun) and these elements were eliminated.",
        "An evaluation of our CNP extractor on Enamex annotations in Muc7 showed that 98.95% of all entities where completely covered by automatically identified CNPs.",
        "For the remaining 1.05% of the entity mentions, parsing errors were the most common source of incomplete coverage.",
        "While the annotation task itself was \"officially\" declared to yield only annotations of named entity mentions within the different annotation units, we were primarily interested in the time needed for these annotations.",
        "For precise time measurements, single annotation examples were shown to the annotators, one at a time.",
        "An annotation example consists of the chosen Muc7 document with one annotation unit (sentence or CNP) selected and highlighted.",
        "Only the highlighted part of the document could be annotated and the annotators were asked to read only as much of the context surrounding the annotation unit as necessary to make a proper annotation decision.",
        "To present the annotation examples to annotators and allow for annotation without extra time overhead for the \"mechanical\" assignment of entity types, our annotation GUI is controlled by keyboard shortcuts.",
        "This minimizes annotation time compared to mouse-controlled annotation such that the measured time reflects only the amount of time needed for taking an annotation decision.",
        "In order to avoid learning effects at the annota-tors' side on originally consecutive syntactic sub-units, we randomly shuffled all annotation examples so that subsequent annotation examples were not drawn from the same document.",
        "Hence, annotation times were not biased by the order of appearance of the annotation examples.",
        "Annotators were given blocks of either 500 CNP- or 100 sentence-level annotation examples.",
        "They were asked to annotate each block in a single run under noise-free conditions, without breaks and disruptions.",
        "They were also instructed not to annotate for too long stretches of time to avoid tiring effects making time measurements unreliable.",
        "All documents were first annotated with respect to CNP-level examples within 2-3 weeks, with only very few hours per day of concrete annotation work.",
        "After completion of the CNP-level annotation, the same documents had to be annotated on the sentence level as well.",
        "Due to randomization and rare access to surrounding context during the CNP-level annotation, annotators credibly reported that they had indeed not remembered the sentences from the CNP-level round.",
        "Thus, the time measurements taken on the sentence level do not seem to exhibit any human memory bias.",
        "Both annotators went through all annotation examples so that we have double annotations of the complete data set.",
        "Prior to coding, they independently got used to the annotation guidelines and were trained on several hundred examples.",
        "For the annotators' performance see Section 3.2."

        "Still, removing the non-CNP tokens markedly reduces the amount of tokens to be considered for entity annotation.",
        "CNPs cover slightly less entities (3,937) than complete sentences (3,971), a marginal loss only.",
        "On the average, sentences have a length of 24.7 tokens, while CNPs are rather short with 3.0 tokens, on the average.",
        "However, CNPs vary tremendously in their length, with the shortest ones having only one token and the longest ones (mostly due to parsing errors) spanning over 30 (and more) tokens.",
        "Figure 1 depicts the length distribution of sentences and CNPs showing that a reasonable portion of CNPs have less than five tokens, while the distribution of sentence lengths almost follows a normal distribution in the interval [0, 50].",
        "While 63% of all sentences contain at least one entity mention, only 23% of CNPs contain entity mentions.",
        "These statistics show that CNPs are generally rather short and a large fraction of CNPs does not contain entity mentions at all.",
