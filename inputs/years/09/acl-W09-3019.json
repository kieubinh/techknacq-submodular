        "For each sentence, a GLARFer constructs both a Feature Structure (FS) representing a constituency analysis and a set of 31-tuples, each representing up to three dependency relations between pairs of words.",
        "Due to space limitations, we will focus on the 6 fields of the 31-tuple represented in Figure 1.",
        "These include: (1) a functor (func); (2) the depending argument (Arg); (3) a surface (Surf) label based on the position in the parse tree with no regularizations; (4) a logicl label (L1) for a relation that reflects grammar-based regularizations of the surface level.",
        "This marks relations for filling gaps in relative clauses or missing infinitival subjects, represents passives as paraphrases as actives, etc.",
        "While the general framework supports many regularizations, the relations actually represented depends on the implemented grammar, e.g., our current grammar of English regularizes across passives and relative clauses, but our grammars of Japanese and Chinese do not currently.",

        "Figure 1 contains several transparent relations.",
        "The interpretation of the *CONJ relations in the Japanese example, include not only that the nouns [zaisan] (assets) and [seimei] (lives) are conjoined, but also that these two nouns, together form the object of the Japanese verb [mamoru] (protect).",
        "Thus, for example, semantic selection patterns should treat these nouns as possible objects for this verb.",

        "Penn-treebank (PTB) parsing, for example, most parsers (not all) leave out function tags and empty categories.",
        "Consistency is an important goal for manual annotation for many reasons including: (1) in the absence of a clear correct answer, consistency helps clarify measures of annotation quality (inter-annotator agreement scores); and (2) consistent annotation is better training data for machine learning.",
        "Thus, annotation specifications use defaults to ensure the consistent handling ofspurious ambiguity.",
        "For example, given a sentence like I bought three acres of land in California, the PP in California can be attached to either acres or land with no difference in meaning.",
        "While annotation guidelines may direct a human annotator to prefer, for example, high attachment, systems output may have other preferences, e.g., the probability that land is modified by a PP (headed by in) versus the probability that acres can be so modified.",
        "Even if the manual annotation for a particular corpus is consistent when it comes to other factors such as tokenization or part of speech, developers of parsers sometimes change these guidelines to suit their needs.",
        "For example, users of the Char-niak parser (Charniak, 2001) should add the AUX category to the PTB parts of speech and adjust their systems to account for the conversion of the word ain't into the tokens IS and n't.",
        "Similarly, to-kenization decisions with respect to hyphens vary among different versions of the Penn Treebank, as well as different parsers based on these treebanks.",
        "Thus if a system uses multiple parsers, such differences must be accounted for.",
        "Differences that are not important for a particular application should be ignored (e.g., by merging alternative analyses).",
        "For example, in the case of spurious attachment ambiguity, a system may need to either accept both as right answers or derive a common representation for both.",
        "Of course, many of the particular problems that result from spurious ambiguity can be accounted for in hind sight.",
        "Nevertheless, it is precisely this lack of a controlled environment which adds elements of spurious ambiguity.",

        "The Charniak parser for English was trained on the Wall Street Journal corpus and can achieve about 90% accuracy on similar corpora, but lower accuracy on other genres.",
        "Differences between treebank and parser results for English were higher for LET and NAR genres than for the TEL because the system is not currently designed to handle TEL-specific features like disfluencies.",
        "All processors were trained on or initially designed for news corpora.",
        "Thus corpora out of this domain usually produce lower results.",
        "LET was easier as it consisted mainly of short simple sentences.",
        "In (Meyers et al., 2009), we evaluated our results on 40 Japanese sentences from the JENAAD corpus (Utiyama and Isahara, 2003) and achieved a higher F-score (90.6%) relative to the Kyoto corpus, as JENAAD tends to have fewer long complex sentences.",
        "By using our answer key for multiple inputs, we discovered errors and consequently improved the quality of the answer keys.",
        "However, at times we were also compelled to fork the answer keys-given multiple correct answers, we needed to allow different answer keys corresponding to different inputs.",
        "For English, these items represent approximately 2% of the answer keys (there were a total of 74 4-tuples out of a total of 3487).",
        "Figure 3 lists examples of answer key divergences that we have found: (1) alternative tokenizations; (2) spurious differences in attachment and conjunction scope; and (3) ambiguities specific to our framework.",
        "Examples 1 and 2 reflect different treatments of hyphenation and contractions in treebank specifications over time.",
        "Parsers trained on different treebanks will either keep hyphenated words together or separate more words at hyphens.",
        "The Treebank treatment of can't regularizes so that (can need not be differentiated from ca), whereas the parser treatment makes maintaining character offsets easier.",
        "In example 3, the Japanese parser recognizes a single word whereas the treebank divides it into a prefix plus stem.",
        "Example 4 is a case of differences in character encoding (zero).",
        "Example 5 is a common case of spurious attachment ambiguity for English, where a transparent noun takes an ofPP complement-nouns such as form, variety and thousands bear the feature transparent in the NOMLEX-PLUS dictionary (a NomBank dictionary based on NOMLEX (Macleod et al., 1998b)).",
        "The relative clause attaches either to the noun thousands or people and, therefore, the subject gap of the relative is filled by either thousands or people.",
        "This ambiguity is spurious since there is no meaningful distinction between these two attachments.",
        "Example 6 is a case of attachment ambiguity due to a support construction (Meyers et al., 2004).",
        "The recipient of the gift will be Goodwill regardless of whether the PP is attached to give or gift.",
        "Thus there is not much sense in marking one attachment more correct than the other.",
        "Example 7 is a case ofconjunction ambiguity-the context does not make it clear whether or not the pearls are part of a necklace or just the beads are.",
        "The distinction is of little consequence to the understanding of the narrative.",
        "Example 8 is a case in which our grammar handles a case ambiguously: the prenominal adjective can be analyzed either as a simple noun plus adjective phrase meaning various businesses or as a noun plus relative clause meaning businesses that are varied.",
