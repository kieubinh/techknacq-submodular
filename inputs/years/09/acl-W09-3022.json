        "Non-native English speaking authors producing documents in English often encounter lexical, grammatical and stylistic difficulties that make their texts difficult for native speakers to understand.",
        "As a result, the professionalism and the credibility of these texts is often affected.",
        "Our main aim is to develop procedures for the correction of those errors which cannot (and will not in the near future) be treated by the most advanced text processing systems such as those proposed in the Office Suite, OpenOffice and the like.",
        "In the type of errors taken into consideration, several levels are often intertwinned: morphology, lexicon, grammar, style, textual structure, domain usages, context of production, target audience, etc..",
        "While we attempt to correct errors, it turns out that, in a large number of cases, (1) there may be ambiguities in the analysis of the nature of errors, (2) errors can receive various types and levels of corrections depending on the type of document, reader, etc., and (3) some corrections cannot be successfully done without an interaction with the author.",
        "To achieve these aims we need to produce a model of the cognitive strategies deployed by human experts (e.g. translators correcting texts, teachers) when they detect and correct errors.",
        "Our observations show that it is not a simple and straightforward strategy, but that error diagnosis and corrections are often based on a",

        "Since we want our system to have a didactic capacity, in order to help writers understand their errors, we propose an analysis of error diagnosis based on argumentation theory, outlining arguments for or against a certain correction and their relative strength paired with a decision theory.",
        "The modelling of correction strategies is based on the annotation of a large variety of types of documents in English produced by a large diversity of French speakers.",
        "Annotations allow us to identify and categorize errors as well as the parameters at stake (e.g. category change, length of new corrected segment) at stake when making corrections.",
        "This is carried out by bilingual correctors in collaboration with didacticians.",
        "Those parameters are a priori neutral in the annotation schemas.",
        "We then define a preference model that assigns polarity (positive, negative) and a weight to each of these parameters, together with additional parameters among which the target reader, the type of document, etc.",
        "An argumentation model that considers these parameters as weighted arguments, for or against a certain correction, can thus be introduced.",
        "Paired with a decision model, optimal corrections can be proposed to the author, together with explanations.",
        "This approach confers a formal interpretation to our annotation schema.",

        "2006), (Tetreau et al. 2008), (Writer's v. 8.2) recently started to appear.",
        "Theapproach presented here, which is still preliminary, is an attempt to include some didactic aspects into the correction by explaining to the user the nature of her/his errors, whether grammatical or stylistic, while weighing the pros and cons of a correction, via argumentation and decision theories (Boutiler et ali.",
        "1999), (Amgoud et ali.",
        "2008).",

        "In this document, we present the premisses of an approach to correcting complex grammar and style errors, which allow us to evaluate difficulties, challenges, deadlocks, etc.",

        "the original fragment, change: indicates if the changes in the correction are syntactic, lexical, stylistic, semantic or textual, comp: indicates if the proposed correction is a text fragment which is easy to understand or not; values are: yes, average, no, fix: indicates, when mentioned, that the error is very specific to that string of words and that the correction is idiosyncratic and cannot be extended to any other such structure.",
        "qualif: indicates the certainty level of the annotator and didacticians, it qualifies the certainty of the error detection and of the proposed correction se-paretely, correct: gives the correction.",

        "These tags are relatively simple and intuitive.",
        "After some basic training, 2 independent annotators covered about 25 pages (emails and reports) so that we can measure the stability of the annotations and the annotators comprehension and agreement/disagreement.",
        "Results are not easy to analyze in a simple way since annotators disagree on some error existence and nature.",
        "In about 20% of the cases we observed such forms ofdisagreement.",
        "Beside this observation, annotations turn out to be quite convenient, although, for each error, a considerable analysis effort is required for its analysis.",

        "Then, the attributes in each of the correction, which form arguments, are integrated in the decision process.",
