        "Bilingual or multilingual corpora are significant language resources in various language studies, such as language education, comparative linguistics, in particular, NLP.",
        "What holds the key position in bilingual resources is how to align linguistic units between two languages.",
        "In this context, three fundamental questions about how to harness bilingual resources can be raised; (i) which linguistic unit or level should correspond to those in the corresponding language?",
        "(ii) which method should be employed for alignment?",
        "(iii) which environments should be prepared for users?",
        "This paper covers these matters related to bilingual resources and their use.",
        "The language resource that this paper handles is the Sejong Korean-Japanese Bilingual Corpus (henceforth SKJBC).",
        "The original version of the SKJBC, constructed in a XML format, aligns sentence by sentence or paragraph by paragraph.",
        "This research reorganizes and realigns the original version using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) and Moses (Koehn et al.",
        "2007), and interpolates the aligning information into each original file automatically.",
        "Turning to the interface, this research converts the whole data into a database system (MySQL) to guarantee data integrity.",
        "Building on the database, this research implements an online search system accessible without any restrictions; dubbed NARA."

      "heading": "2. The SKJBC",
      "text": [
        "The SKJBC had been constructed as a subset of the Sejong project which had been carried out from 1998 to 2007, sponsored by the Korean government.",
        "The SKJBC is divided into two parts; one is the raw corpus annotated only with sentence aligning indices, the other is the POS-tagged corpus, in which the tag set for Korean complies with the POS-tagging guideline of the Sejong project, and the morphological analysis for Japanese is based on ChaSen (Matsumoto et al., 1999).",
        "This paper is exclusively concerned with the latter, because it is highly necessary for the phrase alignment to make use of well-segmented and well-refined data.",
        "Table 1 illustrates the basic configuration of the SKJBC.",
        "Since the prime purpose of the Sejong project was to build up balanced corpora, the SKJBC consists of various genres, as shown in Figure 1.",
        "This makes a clear difference from other bilingual resources where the data-type is normally homogeneous (e.g. newspapers).",
        "Moreover, since it had been strictly prohibited to manipulate the original source for any reasons, the data in SKJBC fully reflect on the real usage of Korean.",
        "These characteristics, however, sometimes work against computational implementation.",
        "Bi-texts do not always correspond to each other sentence by sentence; we can find out that there are a number of cases that a sentence matches two or more sentences in the other language or the corresponding sentences might be non-existent.",
        "In other words, it is almost impossible to align all the sentences only one-to-one.",
        "These cases eventually produce the multiple-to-multiple alignment, unless annotators discard or separate them artificially.",
        "No artificial manipulation was allowed under construction, the SKJBC contains quite a few pairs in a multiple-to-multiple relation.",
        "document sentence",
        "word morpheme Korean__Japanese",
        "Table i. Configuration of the SKJBC",
        "This section is connected with the first question raised in section 1; the proper level of alignment.",
        "Most bilingual corpora, including the SKJBC, have been constructed sentence by sentence despite shortcomings, because it costs too much time and effort to annotate word or phrase correspondence by hand (Abeille, 2003).",
        "To annotate more specified alignment between two languages is to enhance the utility value of the resource; this research, first of all, considers how to align at the level of word and phrase.",
        "Multiple Alignments: Because of the problem mentioned in the previous section, the pairs which do not match in a one-to-one relation were excluded from the target of alignment.",
        "Throughout a preliminary experiment, it was born out that, if they remained, they led to a worse result.",
        "After casting them away, the number of target sentences is 3,776, which account for about 86 percent of the whole data.",
        "Word vs.",
        "Phrase: To make the units equivalent as far as possible is the crucial factor in aligning as accurately as possible.",
        "One of the main issues that should be taken into account in aligning Korean and Japanese phrases is word boundary.",
        "Though Korean and Japanese share lots of features, the boundary of word or phrase is inconsistent with each other.",
        "The general concept to segment words in Korean is the so-called ejeol, tantamount to word-spacing, whereas that in Japanese is bunsetsu, what we say.",
        "The difference stems from the different writing style; Korean inserts spacing between words, while Japanese seldom uses spacing.",
        "Consequently, each word in Korean is virtually equivalent to a phrasal unit in Japanese, as given in (1-2).",
        "wus-ess-ta laugh-PAST 'langhed'",
        "The first line (i.e. ejeol) in (1) for Korean corresponds to the first and second line (i.e. bunsetsu) in (2).",
        "Hence, it is the most suitable choice to align Korean morphemes (e.g. wus) and Japanese bunsetsu (e.g. z%o warat).",
        "On the other hand, there is a clear cut between lemmatized lexical forms and surface forms in Japanese, (e.g. and z%o in the above, respectively), whereas there is none in Korean.",
        "In order to prevent the result from being biased, this paper establishes two training sets (i.e. lemma-tized and surface forms) for alignment.",
        "Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD): Other than the above issues, it is also needed to consider WSD.",
        "For example, a Korean word & salm has two meanings; one is 'life' as a nominal expression, the other is 'boil' as a verbal lexeme, which correspond to ^ sei, niru, respectively.",
        "This research, therefore, makes training data composed of each morpheme plus its POS tag, such as '#/NNG' and '^/NCPV'."
