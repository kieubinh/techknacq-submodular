        "Broad coverage parsing is a challenging task.",
        "For languages such as the Indian languages, it becomes all the more difficult as these languages are morphologically richer and the word order for these languages is relatively variable and less bound.",
        "Although dependency grammar driven parsing is much better suited for such type of languages (Hudson, 1984; Mel'Cuk, 1988), robust broad coverage parsing (Bharati et.",
        "al, 2008) still involves extensive analysis.",
        "Achieving good results in parsing for these languages may require large amount of linguistic resources such as annotated corpora, verb frames, lexicon etc.",
        "On the other hand, pure shallow parsing techniques (PVS and Gali, 2007) are not enough for providing sufficient information for applications such as machine translation, query answering etc.",
        "It is here that the notion of a simple parser is born where the idea is to parse a sentence at a coarser level.",
        "One could go to a finer level of parse depending on the ease with which such a parse can be generated.",
        "The simple parser that we describe here is a grammar oriented model that makes use of linguistic features to identify relations.",
        "We have modeled the simple parser on the Paninian grammatical model (Begum et al., 2008; Bharati et al., 1995) which provides a dependency grammar framework.",
        "Paninian dependency grammar works well for analyzing Indian languages (Bharati et al., 1993).",
        "We have followed karaka based approach for parsing.",
        "An effort has been previously made in grammar driven parsing for Hindi by us (Gupta et al., 2008) where the focus was not to mark relations in a broad coverage sense but to mark certain easily identifiable relations using a rule base.",
        "In this paper, we show improvements in results over our previous work by including some additional linguistic features which help in identifying relations better.",
        "Our previous work focused only on inter-chunk annotation.",
        "In this paper, however, we have worked on both inter as well as intra chunk annotation.",
        "We later show their effectiveness and results at different levels of dependency annotation.",
        "We also propose how useful the simple parser is for Indian languages which are similar in nature."

      "heading": "2. Paninian Dependency Annotation Scheme at Various Levels",
      "text": [
        "Paninian dependency scheme is based on a modifier-modified relationship (Bharati et al., 1995).",
        "The modified chunk (or group) is classified on the basis of its part of speech category.",
        "A hierarchy of dependency relations is thus established on the basis of this category.",
        "For example, all those relations whose parent (modified group) is a verb are classified under the verb modifier (vmod) category.",
        "Subsequent levels further classify these relations (or labels).",
        "Depth of a level in the hierarchy reflects the fineness of the dependency relations/labels.",
        "There are five labels at the coarsest level namely, vmod, nmod (noun modifier), jjmod (adjective modifier), advmod (adverbial modifier) and ccof (conjunct of).",
        "Athough, ccof is not strictly a dependency relation (Begum et al., 2008).",
        "Figure 1 shows the hierarchy of relations used in the scheme.",
        "Procedure",
        "The next level comprises of varg (verb argument), vad (verb adjunct) and vmod_1 labels under vmod.",
        "Under the nmod label, nmodadj (adjective), r6 (genitive) are classified.",
        "At the most fine grained level, varg and vad further branch out into labels like k1, k2, k3, k5, k7 and rh, rt, rd, k1s etc.",
        "The relations under varg are the six karakas that are the most essential participants in an action.",
        "All the other dependency labels are non-karakas (for a more detailed explanation see Begum et al.",
        "(2008) and Bharati et al.",
        "(1995)).",
        "Languages often have constructions that are ambiguous, owing to similar feature and context distribution.",
        "Thus, in such cases, it is appropriate to under-specify the relations (labels) or group some of them together.",
        "Also, some labels have very less frequency of occurrence in the corpus and it is thus appropriate to leave them out for marking by the simple parser.",
        "One can later, on the availability of more information, try to identify and mark such instances with appropriate labels.",
        "The dependency tagset described in this section is used to mark inter-chunk relations.",
        "For marking relations between words within a chunk (intra-chunk), a similar tagset has been developed.",
        "vmod_1: A dependency relation in the vmod category, that exists between a non-finite verb and its parent verb.",
        "It has been underspecified for simplicity.",
        "Our approach is corpus based where rules have been crafted after studying the corpus.",
        "We used the Hyderabad Dependency Treebank (HyDT) for development and testing our rules.",
        "The treebank consists of about 2100 sentences in Hindi, of which 1800 were part of the development set and 300 were used as test data.",
        "Each sentence is POS tagged and chunked (Bharati et al., 2006) in SSF format (Bharati et al., 2005).",
        "The simple parser we propose here is a language independent engine that takes a rule file specific for a particular language (Gupta et.",
        "al, 2008).",
        "Indian languages are similar in various respects (Emeneau 1956; 1980).",
        "Hence, rules made for one language can be efficiently transferred for other similar languages.",
        "However, there can be cases where rules for one language may not work for another.",
        "These cases can be handled by adding some new rules for that particular language.",
        "The relative closeness among such languages, determines the efficiency of transference of rules from one language to another.",
        "We have taken Hindi and Punjabi, as example languages to support our proposal.",
        "1(a) below is in Hindi,",
        "1(a).",
        "raama ko „Ram - dat lagatii.",

        "raama nuu mitthaai changii nii „Ram - daf ,sweets' ,good' ,not' lagadii.",
        ",appear'",
        "Now, the rules for identifying k1 and k2 in Hindi are similar to that of Punjabi.",
        "For instance, in both the cases, the noun chunk possessing a nominative case marker (chunks take the properties of their heads) and the TAM (tense, aspect and modality of the main verb) should agree in",
        "k1 (karta) and k2 (karma) are syntactico-semantic labels which have some properties of both grammatical roles and thematic roles.",
        "k1 for example, behaves similar to subject and agent.",
        "Likewise, k2 behaves like object/theme (Begum et al., 2008)",
        "GNP for the noun to be a k2.",
        "It is easy to see how rules made for identifying certain relations in Hindi can be transferred to identify the same relations in Punjabi and similarly for other languages.",
        "However, not all rules can be transferred from one language to another.",
        "We also mark intra-chunk dependency relations.",
        "The procedure of marking intra-chunk labels is also rule based.",
        "Rules have been crafted using a common POS tagset for Indian languages (Bha-rati et al., 2006).",
        "Rules can be applied to other languages.",
        "However, some rules may not work.",
        "In those cases we need to add some rules specific to the language.",
