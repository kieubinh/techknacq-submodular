        "Such data are considered to be atomic in the sense that they are not built on top of lower level data.",
        "When looking more closely at these kinds of data, several characteristics can be identified:",
        "- Location: primary data is usually localized with respect to a timeline or a position: gestures can be localized into the video signal, phonemes into the speech one, words into the string or objects into a scene or a context.",
        "Two different kinds of localisation are used: temporal and spatial.",
        "In the first case, a data is situated by means of a time interval whereas spatial data are localised in terms of relative or absolute positions.",
        "- Realization: primary data usually refer to concrete (or physical) objects: phonemes, gestures, referential elements into a scene, etc.",
        "However, other kinds of primary data can be abstract such as concepts, ideas, emotions, etc.",

        "This classification is only relevant for data corresponding to concrete objects.",
        "- Production: the study of information structure shows the necessity to take into account accessibility of the objects: some data are directly accessible from the signal or the discourse, they have an existence or have already been mentioned.",
        "In this case, they are said to be \"produced\".",
        "For example, gestures, sounds, physical objects fall in this category.",
        "On the other hand, other kinds of data are deduced from the context, typically the abstract ones.",
