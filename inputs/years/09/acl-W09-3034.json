        "resources to provide training data to develop language models and optimize statistical algorithms, language resources-including (usually large) collections of language data and linguistic descriptions in machine readable form, together with tools and systems (lemmatizers, parsers, summarizers, information extractors, speech recognizers, annotation development software, etc.",
        ")- are critical to this development.",
        "Over the past two decades, the NLP community has invested substantial effort in the creation of computational lexicons and compendia of semantic information (e.g., framenets, ontologies, knowledge bases) together with language corpora annotated for all varieties of linguistic features, which comprise the central resource for current NLP research.",
        "However, the lack of a thorough, well-articulated longer-term vision for language processing research has engendered the creation of a disjointed set of language resources and tools, which exist in a wide variety of (often incompatible) formats, are often unusable with systems other than those for which they were developed, and utilize linguistic categories derived from different theoretical frameworks.",
        "Furthermore, these expensive investments are often produced only for one of several relatively isolated subfields (e.g., NLP, information retrieval, machine translation, speech processing), or even worse, for one application in one subfield.",
        "In addition, the high cost of resource development has prevented the creation of reliable, large-scale language data and annotations for many phenomena, and for languages other than English.",
        "Interoperability of resources, tools, and frameworks has recently come to be recognized as perhaps the most pressing current need for language processing research.",
        "Interoperability is especially critical at this time because of the widely recognized need to create and merge annotations and information at different linguistic levels in order to study interactions and interleave processing at these different levels.",
        "It has also become critical because new data and tools for emerging and strategic languages such as Chinese and Arabic as well as minor languages are in the early stages of development.",
        "Two major projects in the U.S. and Europe have joined in a collaboration to work toward achieving interoperability among language resources.",

        "In addition to broad-based US and European participation, we are seeking the participation of colleagues in Asia.",
        "To ensure full community involvement and consolidation of effort, SILT and FLaReNet are establishing ties with major ongoing projects and consortia, including the International Standards Organization TC37 SC4 (Language Resource Management) , The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the Text Encoding Initiative, the ACL Special Interest Group on Annotation (SIGANN), and others.",
        "The ultimate goal is to create an Open Language Infrastructure (OLI) that will provide free and open access to resources, tools, and other information that support work in the field, in order to facilitate collaboration, accessibility for all members of the community, and convergence toward interoperability.",
        "The following sections outline the goals of SILT and FLaReNet.",
        "The creation and use of language resources spans several related but relatively isolated disciplines, including NLP, information retrieval, machine translation, speech, and the semantic web.",
        "SILT's goal is to turn existing, fragmented technology and resources developed within these groups in relative isolation into accessible, stable, and interoperable resources that can be readily reused across several fields.",
        "The major activities of the effort are:",
        "• carefully surveying the field to identify the resources, tools, and frameworks in order to examine what exists and what needs to be developed, and to identify those areas for which interoperability would have the broadest impact in advancing research and development and significant applications dependent on them;",
        "• identifying the major efforts on standards development and interoperable system design together with existing and developing technologies, and examining ways to leverage their results to define an interoperablity infrastructure for both tools and data;",
        "• analyzing innovative methods and techniques for the creation and maintenance of language resources in order to reduce the high costs, increase productivity, and enable rapid development of resources for languages that currently lack them;",
        "• implementing proposed annotation standards and best practices in corpora currently under development (e.g., American National Corpus, TimeBank) to evaluate their viability and feed into the process of further standards development, testing, and use of interoperability frameworks (e.g., GATE, UIMA) and implementation of processing modules, and distributing all software, data, and annotations.",
        "• ensuring the broadest possible community engagement in the development of consensus and agreement on strategies, priorities, and",
        "best approaches for achieving broad interoperability by means of sessions, open meetings, and special workshops at major conferences in the field, together with active maintenance of and involvement in open web forums and Wikis;",
        "• providing the technical expertise necessary to turn consensus and agreement into robust interoperability frameworks along with the appropriate tools and resources for their broad use and implementation by means oftutorials and training workshops, especially for undergraduate and graduate students in the field."
