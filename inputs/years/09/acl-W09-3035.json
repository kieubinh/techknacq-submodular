        "Treebanks are also useful for linguistic studies, for example the extraction of syntactic patterns or the investigation of linguistic phenomena.",
        "Recently, treebanks and other large corpora have become more important since the development of powerful machine learning methods.",

        "(1993).",
        "This approach has been successfully applied to a number of languages such as English, Chinese, Arabic, etc.",

        "Word segmentation identifies word boundary in sentences.",
        "POS tagging assigns correct POS tags to words.",
        "Syntactic labeling recognizes both phrase-structure tags and functional tags.",
        "Our main target is to build a corpus of 10,000 syntactically-annotated sentences (trees) and an additional POS tagged data set of 10,000 sentences.",
        "Treebank construction is a very complicated task including major phases: investigation, guideline preparation, building tools, raw text collection, and annotation.",
        "This is a repeated process involving especially three phases: annotation, guideline revision, and tool upgrade.",
        "Raw texts are collected from a newspaper source, the Youth online daily newspaper, with a number of topics including social and politics.",
        "We completed about 9,500 trees and 10,000 POS tagged sentences.",
        "In order to deal with ambiguities occurring at various levels of annotation, we systematically applied linguistic analysis techniques such as deletion, insertion, substitution, questioning, transformation, etc.",

        "These techniques exploit contextual information, word combination, word order, and functional words to disambiguation between possible structures.",
        "The problem of treebank construction can be considered as an application of linguistic theories though treebanks can also be used for linguistic studies.",
        "However, there are still disagreements among linguists as to solutions for many linguistic issues.",
