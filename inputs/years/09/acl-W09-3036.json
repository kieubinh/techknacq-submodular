        "This paper describes the creation of a Hindi/Urdu multi-representational and multi-layered treebank.",
        "Multi-layered means that we design the annotation process from the outset to include both a syntactic annotation and a lexical semantic annotation such as the English Prop-Bank (Palmer et al.",
        "2005).",
        "Multi-representational means that we distinguish conceptually what is being represented from how it is represented; for example, in a case of longdistance wh-movement in English as in Who do you think will come, we can choose to represent the fact that who is an argument of come, or not (what to represent).",
        "Having made this choice, we can determine how to represent it: For example, we can use a discontinuous constituent",
        "Flexibility of representation is important because the proper choice of representation of the syntax of a language is itself an issue in parsing research.",
        "In the application of the Collins parser to the Prague Dependency Treebank (Collins et al.",
        "1999) the automatic mapping from dependency to phrase-structure was a major area of research.",
        "Similarly, automatically changing the representation in a phrase structure treebank can also improve parsing results (for example Klein & Manning 2003).",
        "Finally, there is increasing interest in the use of dependency parses in NLP applications, as they are considered to be simpler structures which can be computed more rapidly and are closer to the kinds of semantic representations that applications can make immediate use of (McDonald et al.",
        "2005, CoNLL 2006 Shared Task).",
        "We first provide a comparison of dependency structure and phrase structure in Section 2.",

        "Two different approaches to describing syntactic structure, dependency structure (DS) (Mel'cuk 1979) and phrase structure (PS) (Chomsky, 1981), have in a sense divided the field in two, with parallel efforts on both sides.",
        "Formally, in a PS tree, all and only the leaf nodes are labeled with words from the sentence (or empty categories), while the interior nodes are labeled with nonterminal labels.",
        "In a dependency tree, all nodes are labeled with words from the sentence (or empty categories).",
        "Linguistically, a PS groups consecutive words hierarchically into phrases (or constituents), and each phrase is assigned a syntactic label.",
        "In a DS, syntactic dependency (i.e., the relation between a syntactic head and its arguments and adjuncts) is the primary syntactic relation represented.",
        "The notion of constituent is only derived.",
        "In a dependency representation, a node stands for itself, for the lexical category (or \"preterminal\") spanning only the word itself (e.g., N), and for its maximal projection spanning the node and all words in the subtree it anchors (e.g., NP).",
        "Thus, intermediate projections which cover only some of the dependents of a word (such as N' or VP) do not directly correspond to anything in a dependency representation.",
        "Attachments at the different levels of projection are therefore not distinguished in a dependency tree.",
        "This has certain ramifications for annotation.",
        "Conisder for example scope in conjunctions.",
        "The two readings of young men and women can be distinguished (are the women young as well or not?).",
        "If a dependency representation represents conjunction by treating the conjunction as a dependent to the first conjunct, then the two readings do not receive different syntactic representations, unless a scope feature is introduced for the adjective.",
        "Suppose y depends on x in a DS, we need to address the following questions in order to devise a DS-to-PS conversion algorithm that builds the corresponding phrase structure: 1) What kinds of projections do x and y have?",
        "2) How far should y project before it attaches to x's projection?",
        "3) What position on x's projection chain should y's projection attach to?",
        "These questions are answered by the annotation manual of the target PS representation - there are many possible answers.",
        "If the source dependency representation contains the right kind of information (for example, the scope of adjectives in conjunctions), and if the target phrase structure representation is well documented, then we can devise a conversion algorithm.",
        "Another important issue is that of \"non-projectivity\" which is used to represent discontinuous constituents.",
        "Non-projectivity is common in dependency-based syntactic theories, but rare in phrase structure-based theories.",

        "Our goal is the delivery of a treebank that is multi-representational: it will have a syntactic dependency version and a phrase structure version.",
        "Another recent trend in treebanking is the addition of deeper, semantic levels of annotation on top of the syntactic annotations of the PTB, for example PropBank (Palmer et al.",
        "2005).",
        "A multi-layered approach is also found in the Prague Dependency Treebank (Hajic et al.",
        "2001), or in treebanks based on LFG (King et al.",
        "2003) or HPSG (Oepen et al.",
        "2002).",
        "A lesson learned here is that the addition of deeper, more semantic levels may be complicated if the syntactic annotation was not designed with the possibility of multiple layers of annotation in mind.",
        "We therefore also propose a treebank that is from the start multi-layered: we will include a PropBank-style predicate-argument annotation in the release.",
        "Crucially, the lexical subcategorization frames that are made explicit during the process of prop-banking should always inform the syntactic structure of the treebanking effort.",
        "In addition, some of the distinctions made by PS that are not naturally present in DS, such as unaccusativity and null arguments, are more naturally made during PropBank annotation.",
        "Our current approach anticipates that the addition of the PropBank annotation to the DS will provide a rich enough structure for accurate PS conversion.",
        "In order to ensure successful conversion from DS to PS, we are simultaneously developing three sets of guidelines for Hindi: dependency structure, phrase structure, and PropBank.",
        "While allowing DS and PS guidelines to be based on different, independently motivated principles (see Section 4), we have been going through a comprehensive list of constructions in Hindi, carefully exploring any potentially problematic issues.",
        "Specifically, we make sure that both DS and PS represent the same syntactic facts (what is represented): we know that if PS makes a distinction that neither DS nor PropBank make, then we cannot possibly convert automatically.",
        "Furthermore, we coordinate the guidelines for DS and PS with respect to the examples chosen to support the conversion process.",
        "These examples form a conversion test suite."

        "Our dependency analysis is based on the Pan-inian grammatical model (Bharati et al. 1999, Sharma et al.",
        "2007).",
        "The model offers a syntac-tico-semantic level of linguistic knowledge with an especially transparent relationship between the syntax and the semantics.",
        "The sentence is treated as a series of modifier-modified relations which has a primary modified (generally the main verb).",
        "The appropriate syntactic cues (relation markers) help in identifying various relations.",
        "The relations are of two types - karaka and others.",
        "'Karakas' are the roles of various participants in an action (arguments).",
        "For a noun to hold a karaka relation with a verb, it is important that they (noun and verb) have a direct syntactic relation.",
        "Relations other than 'karaka' such as purpose, reason, and possession are also captured using the relational concepts of the model (adjuncts).",
        "These argument labels are very similar in spirit to the verb specific semantic role labels used by PropBank, which have already been successfully mapped to richer semantic role labels from VerbNet and FrameNet.",
        "This suggests that much of the task of PropBanking can be done as part of the dependency annotation.",
        "Our PS guidelines are inspired by the Principles-and-Parameters methodology, as instantiated by the theoretical developments starting with Government and Binding Theory (Chomsky 1981).",

        "First, any minimal clause distinguishes at most two positions structurally (the core arguments).",
        "These positions can be identified as the specifier of VP and the complement of V. With a transitive predicate, these positions are occupied by distinct NPs while with an unaccusative or passive, the same NP occupies both positions.",
        "All other NPs are represented as adjuncts.",
        "Second, we represent any displacement of core arguments from their canonical positions, irrespective of whether a clause boundary is crossed, via traces.",
        "The displacement of other arguments is only represented if a clause boundary is crossed.",
        "Third, syntactic relationships such as agreement and case always require c-command but do not necessarily require a [specifier, head] configuration.",
        "Within these constraints, we always choose the simplest structure compatible with the word order.",
        "We work with a very limited set of category labels (NP, AP, AdvP, VP, CP) assuming that finer distinctions between different kinds of verbal functional heads can be made via features.",
