        "Accurate name translation is crucial to many cross-lingual information processing tasks such as information retrieval (e.g. Ji et al., 2008).",
        "Recently there has been heightened interest in discovering name pairs from comparable corpora (e.g. Sproat et al., 2006; Klementiev and Roth, 2006).",
        "By comparable corpora we mean texts that are about similar topics, but are not in general translations of each other.",
        "These corpora are naturally available, for example, many news agencies release multilingual news articles on the same day.",
        "There are no document-level or sentence-level alignments across languages, but important facts such as names, relations and events in one language in such corpora tend to co-occur with their counterparts in the other.",

        "Birth-Place",
        "However, most of the previous approaches used a phonetic similarity based name transliteration module as baseline to generate translation hypotheses, and then exploit the distribution evidence from comparable corpora to re-score these hypotheses.",
        "As a result, these approaches are limited to names which are phonetically transliterated (e.g. translate Chinese name \"jififif (You shen kef\" to \"Yushchenko\" in English).",
        "But many other types of names such as organizations are often rendered semantically, for example, the Chinese name \"MM^JjE (jie fang zhi huf\" is translated into \"Liberation Tiger\" in English.",
        "Furthermore, many name translations are context dependent.",
        "For example, a person name \"M0 fcjfcfiiLiizffi\" should be translated into \"Yasser Arafat (PLO Chairman)\" or \"Yasir Arafat (Cricketer)\" based on different contexts.",
        "Information extraction (IE) techniques - identifying important entities, relations and events are currently available for some non-English languages.",
        "In this paper we define a new notion 'bilingual information networks'' which can be extracted from comparable corpora.",
        "An information network is a set of directed graphs, in which each node is a named entity and the nodes are linked by various 'attributes' such as hometown, employer, spouse etc.",
        "Then we align the information networks in two languages automatically in a bootstrapping way to discover name translation pairs.",

        "We apply a state-of-the-art bilingual information extraction system (Chen and Ji, 2009; Ji and Grishman, 2008) to extract ACEl types of entities, relations and events from the comparable corpora.",
        "Both systems include name tagging, nominal mention tagging, coreference resolution, time expression extraction and normalization, relation extraction and event extraction.",
        "Entities include persons, geopolitical (GPE) and organizations; Relations include 18 types (e.g. \"a town some 50 miles south of Salzburg\" indicates a located relation.",
        "); Events include the 33 distinct event types defined in ACE05 (e.g. \"Barry Diller on Wednesday quit as chief of Vivendi\" indicates that \"Barry Diller\" is the person argument of a quit event occurred on Wednesday).",
        "The relation extraction and event extraction components produce confidence values.",
        "Then we construct a set of directed graphs for each language G = {Gi (Vi, Ei )} , where Vi is the collection of named entities, and Ei is the edges linking one name to the other, labeled by the attributes derived from the following two sources: (1) We select the relations with more static types to form specific attributes in Table 2, according to the entity types of a linked name pair.",
        "(2) For each extracted event we compose an attribute by combining its type and time argument (e.g. the \"Arrest/2001-06-25\" link in Figure 1).",

        "After creating the information networks from each language, we automatically align them to discover name translation pairs.",

        "We repeat this bootstrapping procedure until no new translations are produced.",

        "For example, the seed set in processing ACE newswire data includes famous names such as \"Indonesia\", \"China\", \"Palestine\", \"Sharon\" and \"Yugoslavia\".",
        "For each name pair <CHName, EName>, we search for all its related pairs <CHName', ENName'>.",
        "Assuming CHName is linked to CHName' by an edge CHEdge, and ENName is linked to ENName' by ENEdge, then if the following conditions are satisfied, we align CHName' and ENName' and add them as seeds for the next iteration:",
        "• CHEdge and ENEdge are generated by IE systems",
        "with confidence values higher than thresholds; erau-Levenshtein edit distance between the pinyin form of CHName' and ENName' is lower than a threshold.• CHEdge and ENEdge have the same attributes;",
        "• CHName' and ENName' have the same entity type;",
        "• If CHName' and ENName' are persons, the Dam-",

        "We hold out 20 ACE texts from each language to optimize the thresholds of confidence values in section 4.",
        "A name pair <CHName, EName> is judged as correct if both of them are correctly extracted and one is the correct translation of the other in the certain contexts of the original documents.",

        "In the short term, our approach will provide a framework for many byproducts and directly benefit other NLP tasks.",
        "For example, the aligned sub-graphs with names, relations and events can be used to improve information redundancy in cross-lingual question answering; the outlier (mis-aligned) sub-graphs can be used to detect the novel or local information described in one language but not in the other.",
        "In the future we plan to import more efficient graph mining and alignment algorithms which have been widely used for protein-protein interaction detection (Kelley et al., 2003).",
        "In addition, we will attempt using unsupervised relation extraction based on lexical semantics to replace the supervised IE pipeline.",
        "More importantly, we will investigate the tradeoff between coverage and accuracy by applying the generated name pairs to cross-lingual name search and machine translation tasks."
