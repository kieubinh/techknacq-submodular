        "Aligning Chinese-Uyghur parallel texts at the sentence level, however, is already very difficult because of the considerable differences in the syntactic structures and writing systems of the two languages.",
        "A number of alignment techniques have been proposed for other language pairs, varying from statistical methods to lexical methods.",
        "There are basically three kinds of approaches on sentence alignment: the length-based approach (Gale and",
        "Church, 1991), the lexical approach (Kay and Röscheisen, 1993), and the combination of the two (Chen, 1993 and Wu, 1994).",
        "The first approach is based on modeling the relationship between the lengths of sentences that are mutual translations.",
        "Similar algorithms based on this idea were developed independently by Brown, et al. (1991) and Gale and Church (1993).",
        "However, their main targets are rigid translations that are almost literal translations.",
        "The method is applicable for structurally similar European languages (i.e. English-French or English-German).",
        "One alternative alignment method is the lexicon based approach that uses lexical information to obtain higher accuracy.",
        "Kay and Röscheisen (1993) proposed a relaxation method to sentence alignment using the word correspondences acquired during the alignment process.",
        "Chen (1993) developed a method based on optimizing word translation probabilities which he showed gave better accuracy than the sentence-length based approach.",
        "Wu (1994) used a version of Gale and Church's method adapted to Chinese along with lexical cues in the form of a small corpus-specific bilingual lexicon to improve alignment accuracy in text regions containing multiple sentences of similar length.",
        "Melamed (1996) also developed a method based on word correspondences, for which he reported sentence-alignment accuracy slightly better than Gale and Church.",
        "The method does not capture enough word correspondences for structurally different languages such as Chinese and Uyghur, mainly for the following two reasons.",
        "One is the difference in the character types of the two languages.",
        "Chinese uses Chinese characters as its writing system while Uyghur uses alphabetic character.",
        "The other is the grammatical difference of the two languages.",
        "Chinese is an analytic language that has SVO word order.",
        "In contrast, Uyghur is a suffixing and agglutinative language that has SOV word order.",
        "Thus, it is impossible in general to apply the simple-feature based methods to Chinese-Uyghur sentence alignment.",
        "This paper, on the basis of other sentence alignment methods, introduces an anchor sentence based sentence alignment method, in which some sentences are used as \"anchors\" and two steps are applied.",
        "In the first step, some lexical information such as proper names, technical terms, numbers and punctuation marks, location information and length information are used to generate anchor sentences that satisfy some conditions.",

        "In other words, the search for each anchor sentence pairs alternates between the following three steps: generation phase, correction phase and recognition phase.",
        "• Generation phase",
        "In the generation phase, the algorithm generates candidate anchor sentence points within a search rectangle.",
        "We define a search rectangle as follows: Rectangle(x, y, x+3, y+3) in which x=last anchor point(x) and y=last anchor point(y).",
        "The first search rectangle is anchored at the origin of the bitext map where x=0, y=0.",
        "Subsequent search rectangles are anchored at the previously found points.",
        "In this step, the search for an anchor sentence begins in a small search rectangle in the bitext map, whose diagonal is parallel to the main diagonal.",
        "If no candidate points are found, the search rectangle is proportionally expanded by the minimum possible amount, and the generation cycle is repeated.",
        "The rectangle keeps expanding until at least one acceptable point is found.",
        "Three kinds of information such as sentence length, location information and lexical information are used to generate anchor points.",
        "Sentence pairs that satisfy the following three conditions are added to the candidate anchor sentence array.",
        "(1) Sentence length ratio",
        "As was shown in the sentence alignment literature (Church, 1993), the sentence length ratio is also a very good indication of the alignment of a sentence pair.",
        "In our method, for sentence pair P(c,u), if Len-Ratio(c,u) G [MinLenRatio, MaxLenRatio], sentence pair P(c,u) would be candidate anchor sentences, in which LenRatio(c,u)= Lc/Lu (Lu is Uyghur sentence length, Lc is Chinese sentence length).",

        "The constant C is the expected number of Chinese characters per Uyghur word.",
        "C is the weighted value when taking text size into account, the values of the constants are A=10, B=14.",
        "(2) Matching score",
        "If the matching score of a sentence pair is above the threshold (we set the threshold = 1.1), it is considered a candidate anchor sentence.",
        "By applying this condition, we reject some sentence pairs with a matching score smaller than the threshold.",
        "The matching score is calculated according to the matching degree of the key lexicon and punctuations as described in section 4.3.",
        "(3) Maximum Angle Deviation (MAD) According to the properties of the anchor sentences, the slope of the anchor points should not be much different from the bitext slope.",
        "So some sentence pairs are rejected by setting a maximum angle deviation.",
        "The angle of each anchor point's least-squares line is compared to the arc tangent of the bitext slope.",
        "The anchor point is rejected if the difference exceeds the maximum angle deviation threshold (MAD=3).",
        "The angle between the least-squares line and the bitext slope is calculated according to the following formula:",
        "B= arclanf---J",
        "In this formula, A is the slope of the least-squares line, B is the bitext map slope.",
        "This filtering process generates anchor sentences with higher accuracy; however, it causes errors in some cases.",
        "So, we introduced another correction phase in order to reject some wrongly aligned sentence pairs.",
        "• Correction phase",
        "In this step, some candidate sentences that are no anchor sentences are eliminated according to characteristics of anchor sentences, namely the length ratios of corresponding segments.",
        "First, the algorithm checks if there are any conflicts between anchor points.",
        "The injective property of anchor sentences implies that whenever two anchor points overlap in the x or y axis, but are not identical in the region of overlap, then one of the points must be wrong.",
        "To resolve such conflicts, we employed a lookup method to eliminate conflicting points.",
        "Secondly, length ratios of corresponding segments divided by candidate anchor sentences are calculated according to a similar formula as used for the sentence length ratio in order to reject wrongly aligned anchor points.",
        "If the length ratio of the segments LenRa-tio(c,u) £ [MinLenRatio, MaxLenRatio], the candidate anchor sentence must be an anchor sentence, otherwise it should be eliminated.",
        "MinLenRatio and MaxLenRatio are calculated by using the following formulae: MaxLenRatio=C'+A/( Lc+B)• Recognition phase",
        "A number of candidate anchor sentences can be obtained in a certain search region during application of the above two steps.",
        "For anchor sentence alignment, accuracy is more important than recall rate.",
        "So it is essential to introduce a recognition step in order to achieve higher accuracy by eliminating some unlikely anchor sentences.",
        "In the recognition step, one best anchor sentence pair is selected from candidate anchor sentences according to two parameters: matching score and length similarity score.",
        "The anchor selection algorithm gives a score to each proposed sentence pair during the recognition phase, and finds the alignment with the largest sum of scores.",
        "A parameter estimation method is described in the following section.",
        "Matching score: As previous work suggests, lexical information is critical for sentence alignment, especially for finding anchor points.",
        "It is well-known that some proper names and technical terms have rigid translations in many languages; numbers and punctuations appear in the same or similar forms in both source text and translation text.",
        "In a parallel text, for instance, if a sentence contains a question mark, it is likely to be aligned to a sentence that also contains this mark, which can be a strong clue for sentence alignment.",
        "This is also true for Chinese-Uyghur translations.",
        "However, in our method, lexical and non-lexical clues are not used to align all sentences, but to estimate matching scores and to find the best anchor sentences.",
        "We used multiple clues such as proper names, technical terms, punctuation marks and numbers.",
        "In most cases, proper names, including person names, location names, organization names, and technical terms have unique translations that will be matched easily.",
        "But, the problem is that person names and technical terms are often unknown words.",
        "How to identify them is a difficult problem.",
        "In our case, we first collected some popular proper names and the most frequent technical terms into a small lexicon that we call the key lexicon.",
        "More than 2000 words are included in the key lexicon at present.",
        "Then, a very simple searching method is applied to match corresponding words.",
        "In addition, punctuation marks, including other symbols (e.g. @#$%&), are the most obvious clues in Chinese and Uyghur translation.",
        "The correlation between Chinese and Uyghur punctuations is extremely high as depicted in Table1.",
        "Punctuation full stop question mark exclamation mark comma ideographic comma semicolon colon quotation mark bracket Title mark",
        "For punctuation and numbers, no external resources but some rules are applied to estimate the matching degree of these clues.",
        "The matching scores are calculated according to the average number of matched clues.",
        "In other words, the more matched proper names, technical terms, punctuation and numbers, the higher the matching score.",
        "Length Similarity: Length similarity is a score that reflects the similarity between the length ratio of the current sentence pair and the expected length ratio.",
        "The following formula will be applied to calculate the length similarity of a proposed sentence pair (A;C, A;U): LenSimilar(AiC, AiU )=|Len(AiC)/Len(AiU)-C|/C Hereby C is expected number of Chinese character per Uyghur words.",
        "We obtain C=2.01 experimentally.",
        "Len(A;C) and Len(A;U) are the sentence lengths of A;C, A;U, respectively.",
        "However, the sentence length ratio is not stable when a Chinese sentence is shorter than 10 characters.",
        "So it is necessary to add a weighting factor WF:",
        "The length similarity formula is also adjusted as follows:",
        "Hereby C is the value weighted by the whole text size.",
        "Length Based Sentence Alignment",
        "According to previous work by Gale and Church, length-based approaches are simple and can achieve good performance for different language pairs.",
        "Because of this simplicity, many later researchers integrated this method to their sentence alignment methods.",
        "We also applied the length-based approach to the second step of sentence alignment.",
        "Different length measuring methods can be used in the length-based approach.",
        "Brown (1991) introduced the length-based algorithm based on the number of words in sentences, Gail and Church's algorithm is similar to the Brown's algorithm except that alignment is based on the number of characters in the sentences.",
        "Uyghur is an alphabetic language while Chinese is a non-alphabetic language.",
        "Therefore, it is a difficult problem to select the best length measuring model.",
        "In general, a Chinese sentence does not have word boundary information; so one way to define Chinese sentence length is to count the number of characters in a sentence.",
        "Another way is to count how many words are in a sentence after word segmentation.",
        "For Uyghur sentences, we can similarly define the length in characters or in words.",
        "In our case, we examined three possible length models described in the following Table 2:",
        "The mean sentence length ratios, variances and correlation coefficients for each of the length models are calculated from hand aligned Chinese-Uyghur texts of 988 sentence pairs.",
        "Statistics of the three sentence length models are shown in Table 3.",
        "Bbibst software is used for Chinese word segmentation.",
        "In general, the smaller the variance, the better the sentence length model should be.",
        "From Table 3, we can see that the character based length ratio model has significantly larger variance (0.71) than the other two models (L-2:0.23, L-3: 0.21).",
        "This means L-1 is not as reliable as L-2 and L-3.",
        "Both L-2 and L-3 have similar variance, but L-3 is better than L-2 with regard to the correlation coefficient, which indicates that sentence lengths have higher correlation if the lengths of Chinese and Uyghur texts are measured in characters and words, respectively.",
        "A regression analysis of the three models also proved this result.",
        "So we applied the L-3 model to the length ratio examination and length based sentence alignment.",
        "A length-based sentence alignment program is based on a very simple statistical model of sentence lengths.",
        "The model makes use of the fact that longer sentences in one language tend to be translated into longer sentences in the other language, and that shorter sentences tend to be translated into shorter sentences.",
        "A probabilistic score is assigned to each pair of proposed sentence pairs, based on the ratio of lengths of the two sentences and the variance of this ratio.",
        "This probabilistic score is used in a dynamic programming framework in order to find the maximum likelihood alignment of sentences.",
        "The parameters C and S are used for likelihood estimation.",
        "C is the expected number of Chinese characters per Uyghur words.",
        "The parameters C and S are determined empirically from a hand aligned parallel corpus of multidomain texts.",
        "According to our statistical results, we obtained C=2.01 and S =3.24.",
        "Brown (1991) assume that every parallel corpus can be aligned in terms of a sequence of minimal alignment segments, which they call \"beads\", in which sentences align 1-to-1, 1-to-2, 2-to-1, 2-to-2, 1-to-0, or 0-to-1.",
        "The alignment model is a generative probabilistic model for predicting the lengths of the sentences composing sequences of such beads.",
