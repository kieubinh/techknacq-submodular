        "Parallel corpora, a requisite resource for Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) as well as many other natural language processing applications, remain a sparse resource due to the huge expense (human as well as monetary) required for their creation.",
        "A parallel corpus, also called bitext, consists in bilingual texts aligned at the sentence level.",
        "SMT systems use parallel texts as training material and monolingual corpora for target language modeling.",
        "Though enough monolingual data is available for most language pairs, it is the parallel corpus that is a sparse resource.",
        "The performance of an SMT system heavily depends on the parallel corpus used for training.",
        "Generally, more bitexts lead to better performance.",
        "The existing resources of parallel corpora cover a few language pairs and mostly come from one domain (proceedings of the Canadian or European Parliament, or of the United Nations).",
        "The language jargon used in such corpora is not very well suited for everyday life translations or translations of some other domain, thus a dire need arises for more parallel corpora well suited for everyday life and domain adapted translations.",
        "One option to increase this scarce resource could be to produce more human translations, but this is a very expensive option, in terms of both time and money.",
        "Crowd sourcing could be another option, but this has its own costs and thus is not very practical for all cases.",
        "The world wide web can also be crawled for potential \"parallel sentences\", but most of the found bilingual texts are not direct translations of each other and not very easy to align.",
        "In recent works less expensive but very productive methods of creating such sentence aligned bilingual corpora were proposed.",
        "These are based on generating \"parallel\" texts from already available \"almost parallel\" or \"not much parallel\" texts.",
        "The term \"comparable corpus\" is often used to define such texts.",
        "A comparable corpus is a collection of texts composed independently in the respective languages and combined on the basis of similarity of content (Yang and Li, 2003).",
        "The raw material for comparable documents is often easy to obtain but the alignment of individual documents is a challenging task (Oard, 1997).",
        "Potential sources of comparable corpora are multilingual news reporting agencies like AFP, Xinhua, Al-Jazeera, BBC etc, or multilingual encyclopedias like Wikipedia, Encarta etc.",
        "Such comparable corpora are widely available from LDC, in particular the Gigaword corpora, or over the WEB for many languages and domains, e.g. Wikipedia.",
        "They often contain many sentences that are reasonable translations of each other.",
        "Reliable identification of these pairs would enable the automatic creation of large and diverse parallel corpora.",
        "The ease of availability of these comparable corpora and the potential for parallel corpus as well as dictionary creation has sparked an interest in trying to make maximum use of these comparable resources, some of these works include dictionary learning and identifying word translations (Rapp, 1995), named entity recognition (Sproat et al., 2006), word sense disambiguation (Kaji, 2003), improving SMT performance using extracted parallel sentences (Munteanu and Marcu, 2005), (Rauf and Schwenk, 2009).",
        "There has been considerable amount of work on bilingual comparable corpora to learn word translations as well as discovering parallel sentences.",
        "Yang and Lee (2003) use an approach based on dynamic programming to identify potential parallel sentences in title pairs.",
        "Longest common sub sequence, edit operations and match-based score functions are subsequently used to determine confidence scores.",
        "Resnik and Smith (2003) propose their STRAND web-mining based system and show that their approach is able to find large numbers of similar document pairs.",
        "Works aimed at discovering parallel sentences include (Utiyama and Isahara, 2003), who use cross-language information retrieval techniques and dynamic programming to extract sentences from an English-Japanese comparable corpus.",
        "They identify similar article pairs, and then, treating these pairs as parallel texts, align their sentences on a sentence pair similarity score and use DP to find the least-cost alignment over the document pair.",
        "Fung and Cheung (2004) approach the problem by using a cosine similarity measure to match foreign and English documents.",
        "They work on \"very non-parallel corpora\".",
        "They then generate all possible sentence pairs and select the best ones based on a threshold on cosine similarity scores.",
        "Using the extracted sentences they learn a dictionary and iterate over with more sentence pairs.",
        "Recent work by Munteanu and Marcu (2005) uses a bilingual lexicon to translate some of the words of the source sentence.",
        "These translations are then used to query the database to find matching translations using information retrieval (IR) techniques.",
        "Candidate sentences are determined based on word overlap and the decision whether a sentence pair is parallel or not is performed by a maximum entropy classifier trained on parallel sentences.",
        "Bootstrapping is used and the size of the learned bilingual dictionary is increased over iterations to get better results.",
        "Our technique is similar to that of (Munteanu and Marcu, 2005) but we bypass the need of the bilingual dictionary by using proper SMT translations and instead of a maximum entropy classifier we use simple measures like the word error rate (WER) and the translation edit rate (TER) to decide whether sentences are parallel or not.",
        "We also report an extension of our work (Rauf and Schwenk, 2009) by experimenting with an additional filter TERp, and building a named entity noun dictionary using the unknown words from the SMT (section 5.2).",
        "TERp has been tried encouraged by the outperformance of TER in our previous study on French-English.",
        "We have applied our technique on a different language pair Arabic-English, versus French-English that we reported the technique earlier on.",
        "Our use of full SMT sentences, gives us an added advantage of being able to detect one of the major errors of these approaches, also identified by (Munteanu and Marcu, 2005), i.e, the cases where the initial sentences are identical but the retrieved sentence has a tail of extra words at sentence end.",
        "We discuss this problem as detailed in section 5.1.",
        "We apply our technique to create a parallel corpus for the Arabic/English language pair.",
        "We show that we achieve significant improvements in the BLEU score by adding our extracted corpus to the already available human-translated corpora.",
        "We also perform a comparison of the data extracted by our approach and that by (Munteanu and Marcu, 2005) and report the results in Section 5.3.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "In the next section we first describe the baseline SMT system trained on human-provided translations only.",
        "We then proceed by explaining our parallel sentence selection scheme and the post-processing.",

        "To give a time estimate, using a ±5 day window required 9 seconds per query vs 15 seconds per query when a ±7 day window was used.",
        "We placed a limit of approximately 90 words on the queries and the indexed sentences.",
