        "Sign Language (SL) is a visual-gestural language, using the whole upper body articulators (chest, arms, hands, head, face, and gaze) in a simultaneous way.",
        "Signs (in some way, equivalent to words in vocal languages) are articulated in the signing space located in front of the signer.",
        "This is a natural language, with its own linguistic structures and specificities, used by deaf people to communicate in everyday life.",
        "It can be considered that there is one SL for each country, as for vocal languages.",
        "One particularity is that there is no written form of SL (Garcia, 2006): corpora take the form of videos, thus specific design and analysis methods have to be used.",
        "Therefore, NLP and corpus linguistics definitions may have to be adapted to this research field.",
        "Research in SL has begun with the creation of notation systems.",
        "These systems aim to describe in a written form how SL could be performed.",
        "Bebian (1825), a French teacher, wrote a book where he proposed a description of the French Sign Language (LSF) using drawings.",
        "This description took into account facial expressions and manual gestures.",
        "A major study was conducted by Stokoe (1960) on American SL.",
        "The aim was also to describe SL, but this time only focused on manual gestures.",
        "These studies were based upon live analyses: no video corpus was created.",
        "The researchers had to watch how signers were performing SL, and then write down or draw what they were observing.",
        "In the 1980s, Cuxac (1996) created one of the first video SL corpora for linguistic studies.",
        "From the 1990s until now, video SL corpora have been created both to be used in linguistic studies, as listed by Brugman (2003), and for gathering lexicons to create dictionaries.",
        "A few years ago, some video SL corpora were designed to serve as the basis for NLP and Image",
        "Processing (Neidle, 2000).",
        "Fung (2004) distinguishes four kinds of corpora: parallel (\"a sentence-aligned corpus containing bilingual translations of the same document\"), noisy parallel (\"contain non-aligned sentences that are nevertheless mostly bilingual translations of the same document\"), comparable (\"contain non-sentence-aligned, non-translated bilingual documents that are topic-aligned\"), and very-non-parallel (\"contains far more disparate, very-non-parallel bilingual documents that could either be on the same topic (in-topic) or not (off-topic)\").",
        "If these definitions are still under discussion in the NLP community, there is no such discussion in the community which studies SLs.",
        "Would it be possible to apply such definitions to Sign Languages corpora?",
        "Many corpora are mere dictionaries, i.e. they only contain isolated signs and no utterances, just signs, but could be considered as very basic parallel SL corpora.",
        "As far as we know, there exists very few noisy parallel SL corpora (see section 2.2), and very few comparable SL corpora (Bungeroth 2008, ECHO project).",
        "Because not enough data can be found on the way these corpora have been built and the way they are used, it seems difficult to discuss whether Fung's definitions apply to them.",
        "Thus, we present in this paper the corpora we have built (section 2) and explain why they could be considered as parallel, noisy parallel or comparable.",
        "Section 3 discusses the use of NLP processes for SL corpora analysis, and section 4 presents prospects on existing or possible SL corpora."

        "We are currently building a French Sign Language (LSF)-French dictionary (Segouat 2008) that will be available on the Web.",
        "We will provide not only French and LSF translations, but also linguistic descriptions of signs, and a functionality to search for signs from their visual aspects or their linguistic descriptions.",
        "This is a mere parallel corpus that will be using to analyze the variety of LSF in France (according to where people live, where they have grown, where they learned LSF, etc.",
        ").",
        "We have recently built a corpus related to the railway information domain (Segouat, 2009).",
        "The starting point is written French sentences that exactly correspond to the vocal announcements made in railways stations.",
        "The goal is to provide information in LSF as it is provided vocally: by coarticulating pieces of utterances.",
        "Written French sentences were translated into LSF and filmed, in order to study coarticulation in LSF.",
        "We use this corpus to analyze how signs are modified according to their context.",
        "We participate in the DictaSign European project (Efthimiou, 2009) that aims at gathering parallel SL corpora from four countries (Greece, England, Germany, and France).",
        "One of its purposes is to study translations between different sign languages (SLs) of these four countries.",
        "The welcome page of the website includes presentations of the project in the four different SLs that are each direct translations of the corresponding written texts.",
        "As it is a starting project, this corpus has not yet been studied nor considered from a comparability point of view.",
        "We have taken part in the creation of the LS-COLIN corpus (Cuxac, 2001).",
        "The aim of this project was to design a corpus that could be used by linguists and computer scientists.",
        "The methodology was the following: each deaf signer (i.e. a person who performs SL) was explained the protocol.",
        "The person had to perform several kinds of stories, on several given themes or elicited by using pictures.",
        "For the picture based story, the deaf signer was shown six pictures that draw a line for the story, and then expressed the story in LSF.",
        "This corpus could be considered as a noisy parallel one, because the LSF version is a translation of the pictures with addition of details.",
        "The linguists have created a noisy parallel version of some parts of LS-COLIN, by providing a transcription with glosses (sign to word translation, without taking into consideration the grammatical structure involved: thus there is a lack of information).",
        "All the annotations were made in French text, and were used to analyze the grammatical structure of LSF.",
        "We have participated to the WebSi project (Martin, 2009), which aims at evaluating whether common representations could be designed for gestures performed by speaking and signing persons, allowing bilingual applications to be developed.",
        "The first step was a study dedicated to the comparison of deictic gestures, both with multi-modal-French and LSF utterances.",
        "The corpus consists of answers, by a deaf and a hearing person, to eleven questions eliciting responses with deictic gestures of various kinds.",
        "A French/LSF interpreter formulated the questions so that both subjects were in the closest possible interaction conditions.",
        "The observed productions were indeed very different.",
        "In the deaf person's answers, a more complex structure was observed in deic-tics, because the deictic function is incorporated into the lexical signs, forming what is called indicating signs.",
        "However, common global aspects were observed in both types of productions, which are all constituted by pointing using gaze and manual gestures organized with a given temporal structure.",
        "In the LS-COLIN corpus, each deaf signer had to perform a story on several given themes, for example September 11 tragic events.",
        "This can be considered as a synchronous comparable corpus because each signer expressed his own version of the same event.",
        "The picture-based stories may also be considered as comparable corpora, because deaf signers were asked to perform the story twice: at the beginning and at the end of the recording.",
        "Thus it is the same topic, and the two versions are not translations of one another; but we are not certain that it can be considered as \"non-sentence-aligned\" because they both follow picture order.",
        "Computer scientists have used LS-COLIN from a comparability point of view, to analyze the visual modality in LSF: they studied torso (Segouat, 2006) and facial (Chetelat-Pele, 2008) movements.",
        "These studies were made on same-topic stories performed by different deaf signers.",
        "While these studies did consider the comparability of the corpus, they were not focused on that aspect.",
        "Thanks to these studies, we may observe differences in sign performances among deaf signers, from crossed linguistics and computer science perspectives."

        "The computations in use for written data cannot be used directly for video SL corpora.",

        "But would the conclusions be relevant enough?",
        "A bias is that annotations do not exactly represent SL utterances.",
        "Annotations can be made with glosses or complete translations but these written data cannot describe in an efficient way typical SL properties such as simultaneity, spatial organization, non-manual features, etc.",
        "In our opinion, it would thus be difficult to apply the computations used on written comparable corpora (Fung, 2004; Morin, 2006; Deleger, 2008) or on parallel corpora to comparable or parallel SL corpora.",
        "Some studies currently focus on graphical annotations, or use image processing to analyze video SL corpora (Bungeroth, 2008).",

        "It is more like \"oral\" expression, with discourse corrections, repetitions, etc., thus it is likely to produce noisy corpora.",

        "There are in France and in Great Britain two TV programs presented in SL and made accessible with oral and written translations.",
