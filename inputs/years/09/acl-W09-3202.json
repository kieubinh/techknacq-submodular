        "The recent interest in complex networks among physicists over the past few years has meant that the graph theoretic paradigm has been applied to many different areas, including networks defined in corpora of textual units (Mehler, 2008), and has often revealed hitherto unsuspected patterns.",
        "While graph-based representation of texts had been used for some time in natural language processing tasks, such as, text parsing, disambiguation and clustering (Radev and Mihalcea, 2008), the approach based on the new physics of complex networks often asks questions from a different perspective that can shed new light on the organization of linguistic structure.",
        "For example, networks constructed on the basis of cooccurrence of words in sentences have been seen to exhibit the small-world effect, i.e., a small average distance between any pair of arbitrarily chosen words, and, a scale-free distribution of the number of words a given word is connected to (i.e., its degree) (Ferrer i Cancho and Sole, 2001).",
        "These properties have been proposed to reflect the evolutionary history of lexicons and the origin of their flexibility and combinatorial nature.",
        "Note that, a recent study of a lexical network of words that are phonological neighbors has found that the degree distribution might be better fit by an exponential rather than a power-law function (Vitevitch, 2008).",
        "A theoretical model for such word co-occurrence network, which treats language as a self-organizing network of interacting words, has led to the suggestion that languages may have a core (the \"kernel lexicon\") that does not vary as the language evolves (Dorogovtsev and Mendes, 2001).",
        "However, even though text and speech are sequential, the local correlation between immediately consecutive words may not describe natural languages well - due to the presence of non-local relations between words that occur apart from each other in a sentence.",

        "Note that, on seals, the conventional order in which the signs are read (right to left) is reversed.",
        "analysis has been extended to syntactic dependency networks, where two words are connected if they have been related syntactically in a number of sentences (Ferrer i Cancho et al., 2003).",
        "The theory of complex networks has also been used to investigate the structure of meaningful concepts in the written texts of individual authors, which have been seen to have small-world as well as scale-free characteristics (Caldeira et al., 2006).",
        "The conceptual network of a language has been explored by using the semantic relatedness of words as defined by a thesaurus, and this network too is seen to have small-world nature with scale-free degree distribution (Motter et al., 2002).",
        "In this article, we look at a corpus of inscriptions obtained through archaeological excavations carried out in the ruins of the Indus valley civilization.",
        "The sequences comprise signs, of which there are more than four hundred unique and distinct types.",
        "Since discovery in the early part of the 20th century, there have been attempts at deciphering them.",
        "However, to date there is no generally accepted method of interpreting these inscriptions.",
        "We analyze a representative database of these sequences using techniques inspired by complex network theory.",
        "Our aim is to see whether such methods can reveal the existence of patterns suggesting syntactic organization in the sign sequences.",
        "In the next section, we briefly introduce the historical context of the Indus inscriptions, while in Section 3, we discuss the dataset on which analysis has been carried out.",
        "Our results are reported in Section 4, and we finally conclude with a discussion of unresolved questions and further work that needs to be carried out."

        "The Indus civilization, also known as the Mature Harappan civilization (2500-1900 BCE), was geographically spread over what is now Pakistan and northwestern India, covering approximately a million square kilometers (Possehl, 2002).",
        "It was marked by urbanization centered around large planned cities, as evidenced in the ruins of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro.",
        "Craft specialization and long-distance trade with Mesopotamia and Central Asia have been well-demonstrated.",
        "This civilization came to an end early in the 2nd millennium BC.",
        "There were no historical records of its existence until archaeological excavations in the late 19th and early 20th century uncovered artifacts, and some of the ruined urban centers (Marshall, 1931).",
        "Among the artifacts uncovered during these discoveries were a variety of objects (especially seals) that were inscribed with a variety of signs arranged in sequences (Fig.",
        "1).",
        "Although found primarily on seals and their impressions (seal-ings), inscriptions with similar signs have also been discovered on miniature tablets, pottery, copper tablets, bronze implements, etc.",
        "Unsurprisingly, given the high sophistication of the civilization and the level of social complexity it implies, with the concomitant requirements of coordination and communication, these inscriptions have been interpreted as corresponding to writing.",
        "However, despite periodic claims about decipherment of this writing system, there has as yet been no generally accepted interpretation of the signs.",
        "The failure of decipherment is partly due to lack of knowledge about the language which the signs encode and the lack of any bilingual texts such as the Rosetta stone which was crucial in deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphs.",
        "While there is disagreement on the exact number of unique and distinct signs that occur in the inscriptions, there is overall agreement that they lie in the range of a few hundred.",
        "This rules out the possibility of the signs belonging either to an alphabetic system, which contains on average about 25 letters (such as English) or an ideographic (e.g., Chinese) writing system, comprising more than 50,000 characters.",
        "The brevity of the inscriptions (the longest that occurs on a single line has 14 signs) and the existence of a large number of signs that occur with very low frequency have led to some alternative suggestions regarding the meaning of the sign sequences.",
        "These include the possibilities that, e.g., (i) the signs correspond to a label specifying an individual and his belongings, in the manner of heraldic badges (Fairservis, 1971) and (ii) the signs are ritual or religious symbols which do not encode speech nor serve as mnemonic devices, much as the Vinca signs or emblems in Near Eastern artifacts (Farmer et al., 2004).",
        "The latter possibility implies the absence of any syntactic structure in the Indus inscriptions, a possibility that can be tested without making any a priori assumptions about the meaning of the signs."

        "This is to remove the ambiguity regarding the interpretation of sequences with multiple lines, namely, whether the different lines should be considered as independent sequences or whether they form one continuous sequence.",
        "Moreover, if the same sequence is found in multiple artifacts, it is represented only once in EBUDS.",

        "The link between i and j is weighted by the frequency of occurrence of in the corpus (\"*\" is a wildcard character that may be substituted by any of the 377 signs or blank space).",
        "We note immediately that only 1.5% (=2178) of the 377x377 possible directed pairs are seen to occur in the actual inscriptions.",
        "Furthermore, most of the signs are connected to only one or two other signs.",
        "The connectance (probability of link between any given pair) is only around 0.01, implying that the network is extremely sparse.",
        "However, if we plot the sub-network of connections between nodes corresponding to the 10 most common signs in EBUDS (i.e., the ones occurring with the highest frequency), we note that they are strongly interconnected (Fig.",
        "3).",
        "Therefore the adjacency matrix of the sign network is far from homogeneous, with patches of dense connectivity in certain regions.",

        "To obtain such a decomposition of the network we use a pruning algorithm that successively peels away layers of a given core-order of the network.",
        "The k-core of a network is defined as the subnetwork containing all nodes that have degree at least equal to k. Thus, to obtain it, we have to iteratively remove all nodes having degree less than k. In particular, the 2-core of a network is obtained by eliminating all nodes that do not form part of a loop (i.e., a closed path through a subset of the connected nodes).",
        "For a k-core, there exist at least k paths between any pair of nodes belonging to it.",
        "It is obvious that for any network, there exists an innermost core of maximum order which cannot exceed the highest degree of the network.",

        "Discussion",
        "In this paper we have used complex network analysis techniques on the sign network constructed from a subset of the corpus of inscriptions obtained in Indus civilization excavations.",
        "Our results suggest that though these sign sequences are yet to be deciphered, they have a highly structured arrangement which is suggestive of the existence of syntax.",
        "The inference of a set of rules (i.e., the grammar) for arranging these signs in a particular order, so as to be able to create pseudotexts that are indistinguishable from the excavated ones is the eventual aim of the analysis described here.",
        "However, prior to this several open problems need to be addressed.",
        "One of the extensions of the present work has to do with looking beyond sign pairs to sign triplets, quadruplets, etc.",
        "Preliminary analysis of networks of meta-signs by us indicates that, combinations beyond four signs may not have statistical significance.",
        "A detailed comparison between the sign network described here and the meta-sign network may provide clues about the possible hierarchical arrangement of subsequences in the longer sequences.",
        "Evidence of this is already seen from the construction of segmentation trees of individual sequences based on relative pair frequencies.",
        "It is also possible that there are non-local correlations between signs in a given inscription.",
        "To analyze this, we need to redefine the links in the network as being connections between all signs that occur in the same inscription.",
        "Again, preliminary analysis seems to suggest that this does not provide substantially new results from those reported here.",
        "Based on the number of distinct signs (more than 400) there have been several suggestions that, as the number is too high to be an alphabetic system but too small to be an ideographic system, the inscriptions could well be written in a logo-syllabic system.",
        "Such a writing system combines both logograms (morphemic signs) and syllabic (or phonetic) signs without inherent meaning.",
        "In future work, we plan to investigate the differences that arise in the network structure of languages belonging to these very different systems, in order to make an inference on the nature of the writing system used in the Indus inscriptions.",
        "One of the most controversial aspects of Indus decipherment is the question of how many distinct signs are there.",
        "M77 identified 417 signs, but other researchers have come up with a wide range of different numbers.",
        "Therefore, an important open issue that needs to be settled in the future is the robustness of these results, with respect to analysis based on another sign list, e.g., that created by B. K. Wells (Wells, 2006).",
        "Our analysis of correlations, or rather, the lack of it, between the modules of the network (i.e., groups of signs that have a high probability of co-occurrence) and contexts such as site of excavation, artifact types and field symbols, indicates that the patterns seen in the sequence organization are intrinsic to the sign usage system and not so much dependent on the context in which they arise.",
        "This supports the long-held belief that the signs encode writing, or, at least, proto-writing."
