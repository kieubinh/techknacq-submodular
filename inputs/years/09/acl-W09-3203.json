        "Exact methods have been applied successfully to the analysis of dialect variation for over three decades (Seguy, 1973; Goebl, 1982; Nerbonne et al., 1999), but they have invariably functioned by first probing the linguistic differences between each pair of a range of varieties (sites, such as Whitby and Bristol in the UK) over a body of carefully controlled material (say the pronunciation of the vowel in the word 'put').",
        "Second, the techniques aggregate over these linguistic differences, in order, third, to seek the natural groups in the data via clustering or multidimensional scaling (MDS) (Nerbonne, 2009).",
        "Naturally techniques have been developed to determine which linguistic variables weigh most heavily in determining affinity among varieties.",
        "But all of the following studies separate the determination of varietal relatedness from the question of its detailed linguistic basis.",
        "Kondrak (2002) adapted a machine translation technique to determine which sound correspondences occur most regularly.",
        "His focus was not on dialectology, but rather on diachronic phonology, where the regular sound correspondences are regarded as strong evidence of historical relatedness.",
        "Heeringa (2004: 268-270) calculated which words correlated best with the first, second and third dimensions of an MDS analysis of aggregate pronunciation differences.",
        "Shackleton (2004) used a database of abstract linguistic differences in trying to identify the British sources of American patterns of speech variation.",
        "He applied principal component analysis to his database to identify the common components among his variables.",
        "Nerbonne (2006) examined the distance matrices induced by each of two hundred vowel pronunciations automatically extracted from a large American collection, and subsequently applied factor analysis to the covariance matrices obtained from the collection of vowel distance matrices.",
        "Prokic (2007) analyzed Bulgarian pronunciation using an edit distance algorithm and then collected commonly aligned sounds.",
        "She developed an index to measure how characteristic a given sound correspondence is for a given site.",
        "To study varietal relatedness and its linguistic basis in parallel, we apply bipartite spectral graph partitioning.",
        "Dhillon (2001) was the first to use spectral graph partitioning on a bipartite graph of documents and words, effectively clustering groups of documents and words simultaneously.",
        "Consequently, every document cluster has a direct connection to a word cluster; the document clustering implies a word clustering and vice versa.",
        "In his study, Dhillon (2001) also demonstrated that his algorithm worked well on real world examples.",

        "(2003) used a somewhat adapted bipartite spectral graph partitioning approach to successfully cluster microar-ray data simultaneously in clusters of genes and conditions.",
        "In summary, the contribution of this paper is to apply a graph-theoretic technique, bipartite spectral graph partitioning, to a new sort of data, namely dialect pronunciation data, in order to solve an important problem, namely how to recognize groups of varieties in this sort of data while simultaneously characterizing the linguistic basis of the group.",
        "It is worth noting that, in isolating the linguistic basis of varietal affinities, we thereby hope to contribute technically to the study of how cognitive and social dynamics interact in language variation.",
        "Although we shall not pursue this explicitly in the present paper, our idea is very simple.",

        "Berg, 2003).",

        "To obtain the sound correspondences for every site in the GTRP with respect to the reference site Delft, we used an adapted version of the regular Levenshtein algorithm (Levenshtein, 1965).",
        "The Levenshtein algorithm aligns two (phonetic) strings by minimizing the number of edit operations (i.e. insertions, deletions and substitutions) required to transform one string into the other.",
        "For example, the Levenshtein distance between [leikan] and [likhen], two Dutch variants of the word 'seem', is 4:",
        "leikan delete e 1 Irion subst.",
        "i/i 1 likan insert h 1 likhan subst.",
        "e/a 1 likhen",
        "The corresponding alignment is:",
        "When all edit operations have the same cost, multiple alignments yield a Levenshtein distance of 4 (i.e. by aligning the [i] with the [e] and/or by aligning the [o] with the [h]).",
        "To obtain only the best alignments we used an adaptation of the Levenshtein algorithm which uses automatically generated segment substitution costs.",
        "This procedure was proposed and described in detail by Wieling et al.",
        "(2009) and resulted in significantly better individual alignments than using the regular Levenshtein algorithm.",
        "In brief, the approach consists of obtaining initial string alignments by using the Levenshtein algorithm with a syllabicity constraint: vowels may only align with (semi-)vowels, and consonants only with consonants, except for syllabic consonants which may also be aligned with vowels.",
        "After the initial run, the substitution cost of every segment pair (a segment can also be a gap, representing insertion and deletion) is calculated according to a pointwise mutual information procedure assessing the statistical dependence between the two segments.",
        "I.e. if two segments are aligned more often than would be expected on the basis of their frequency in the dataset, the cost of substituting the two symbols is set relatively low; otherwise it is set relatively high.",
        "After the new segment substitution costs have been calculated, the strings are aligned again based on the new segment substitution costs.",
        "The previous two steps are then iterated until the string alignments remain constant.",
        "Our alignments were stable after 12 iterations.",
        "After obtaining the final string alignments, we use a matrix to store the presence or absence of each segment substitution for every variety (with respect to the reference place).",
        "We therefore obtain an m x n matrix A of m varieties (in our case 423; Delft was excluded as it was used as our reference site) by n segment substitutions (in our case 957; not all possible segment substitutions occur).",
        "A value of 1 in A (i.e. Aij = 1) indicates the presence of segment substitution j in variety i, while a value of 0 indicates the absence.",
        "We experimented with frequency thresholds, but decided against applying one in this paper as their application seemed to lead to poorer results.",
        "We postpone a consideration of frequency-sensitive alternatives to the discussion section.",
        "An undirected bipartite graph can be represented by G = (R,S,E), where R and S are two sets of vertices and E is the set of edges connecting vertices from R to S. There are no edges between vertices in a single set.",
        "In our case R is the set of varieties, while S is the set of sound segment substitutions (i.e. sound correspondences).",
        "An edge between n and Sj indicates that the sound segment substitution sj occurs in variety r%.",
        "It is straightforward to see that matrix A is a representation of an undirected bipartite graph.",

        "For brevity, we will only focus on explaining a few derived sound correspondences for the most important geographical groups.",
        "The main point to note is that besides a sensible geographical clustering, we also obtain linguistically sensible results.",
        "Note that the connection between a cluster of varieties and sound correspondences does not necessarily imply that those sound correspondences only occur in that particular cluster of varieties.",
        "This can also be observed in Figure 2, where sound correspondences in a particular cluster of varieties also appear in other clusters (but less dense).",
        "The Frisian area",
        "The division into two clusters clearly separates the Frisian language area (in the province of Fries-land) from the Dutch language area.",
        "This is the expected result as Heeringa (2004: 227-229) also measured Frisian as the most distant of all the language varieties spoken in the Netherlands and Flanders.",
        "It is also expected in light of the fact that Frisian even has the legal status of a different language rather than a dialect of Dutch.",
        "Note that the separate \"islands\" in the Frisian language area (see Figure 3) correspond to the Frisian cities which are generally found to deviate from the rest of the Frisian language area (Heeringa, 2004: 235-241).",
        "A few interesting sound correspondences between the reference variety (Delft) and the Frisian area are displayed in the following table and discussed below.",
        "In the table we can see that the Dutch /a/ or /a/ is pronounced [i] or [i] in the Frisian area.",
        "This well known sound correspondence can be found in words such as kamers 'rooms', Frisian [kimas] (pronunciation from Anjum), or draden 'threads' and Frisian [tndn] (Bakkeveen).",
        "In addition, the Dutch (long) lol and IvJ both tend to be realized as [e] in words such as bomen 'trees', Frisian [bjeman] (Bakkeveen) or koeien 'cows', Frisian [kei] (Appelscha).",
        "We also identify clustered correspondences of [x]:[j] where Dutch /x/ has been lenited, e.g. in geld (/xrit/) 'money', Frisian [jilt] (Grouw), but note that [x]:[g] as in [gelt] (Franeker) also occurs, illustrating that sound correspondences from another cluster (i.e. the rest of the Netherlands) can indeed also occur in the Frisian area.",
        "Another sound correspondence co-clustered with the Frisian area is the Dutch /x/ and Frisian [z] in zeggen (/zexa/) 'say' Frisian [siza] (Appelscha).",

        "First, the accusative first-person plural pronoun oris 'us' lacks the nasal in Frisian, but the correspondence was not tallied in this case because the nasal consonant is also missing in Delft.",
        "Second, some apparently frequent sound correspondences result from historical accidents, e.g. [r]:[x] corresponds regularly in the Dutch:Frisian pair [dor]:[trux] 'through'.",
        "Frisian has lost the final [x], and Dutch has either lost a final [r] or experienced metathesis.",
        "These two sorts of examples might be treated more satisfactorily if we were to compare pronunciations not to a standard language, but rather to a reconstruction of a proto-language.",
        "The Limburg area",
        "The division into three clusters separates the southern Limburg area from the rest of the Dutch and Frisian language area.",
        "This result is also in line with previous studies investigating Dutch dialectology; Heeringa (2004: 227-229) found the Limburg dialects to deviate most strongly from other different dialects within the Netherlands-Flanders language area once Frisian was removed from consideration.",
        "Some important segment correspondences for Limburg are displayed in the following table and discussed below.",
        "Southern Limburg uses more uvular versions of /r/, i.e. the trill [r], but also the voiced uvular fricative [k].",
        "These occur in words such as over 'over, about', but also in breken 'to break', i.e. both pre-and post-vocalically.",
        "The bipartite clustering likewise detected examples of the famous \"second sound shift\", in which Dutch Ikl is lenited to /x/, e.g. in ook 'also' realized as [ox] in Epen and elsewhere.",
        "Interestingly, when looking at other words there is less evidence of lenition in the words maken 'to make', gebruiken 'to use', koken 'to cook', and kraken 'to crack', where only two Limburg varieties document a [x] pronunciation of the expected stem-final [k], namely Kerkrade and Vaals.",
        "The limited linguistic application does appear to be geographically consistent, but Kerkrade pronounces Ikl as [x] where Vaals lenites further to [s] in words such as ruiken 'to smell', breken 'to break', and steken 'to sting'.",

        "A possible way to reconstruct such a proto-language is by multiple aligning (see Prokic, 2009) all pronunciations of a single word and use the most frequent phonetic symbol at each position in the reconstructed word.",
        "It would be interesting to see if using such a reconstructed proto-language would improve the results by removing sound correspondences such as [r]:[x].",
        "In this study we did not investigate methods to identify the most important sound correspondences.",
        "A possible option would be to create a ranking procedure based on the uniqueness of the sound correspondences in a cluster.",
        "I.e. the sound correspondence is given a high importance when it only occurs in the designated cluster, while the importance goes down when it also occurs in other clusters).",

        "While sound segment correspondences function well as a linguistic basis, it might also be fruitful to investigate morphological distinctions present in the GTRP corpus.",
        "This would enable us to compare the similarity of the geographic distributions of pronunciation variation on the one hand and morphological variation on the other.",
        "As this study was the first to investigate the effectiveness of a co-clustering approach in dialec-tometry, we focused on the original bipartite spectral graph partitioning algorithm (Dhillon, 2001).",
        "Investigating other approaches such as bicluster-ing algorithms for biology (Madeira and Oliveira, 2004) or an information-theoretic co-clustering approach (Dhillon et al., 2003) would be highly interesting.",
        "It would likewise be interesting to attempt to incorporate frequency, by weighting correspondences that occur frequently more heavily than those which occur only infrequently.",
        "While it stands to reason that more frequently encountered variation would signal dialectal affinity more strongly, it is also the case that inverse frequency weightings have occasionally been applied (Goebl, 1982), and have been shown to function well.",
        "We have the sense that the last word on this topic has yet to be spoken, and that empirical work would be valuable.",
        "Our paper has not addressed the interaction between cognitive and social dynamics directly, but we feel it has improved our vantage point for understanding this interaction.",
        "In dialect geography, social dynamics are operationalized as geography, and bipartite spectral graph partitioning has proven itself capable of detecting the effects of social contact, i.e. the latent geographic signal in the data.",
        "Other dialectometric techniques have done this as well.",
        "Linguists have rightly complained, however, that the linguistic factors have been neglected in dialectometry (Schneider, 1988:176).",
        "The current approach does not offer a theoretical framework to explain cognitive effects such as phonemes corresponding across many words, but does enumerate them clearly.",
        "This paper has shown that bipartite graph clustering can detect the linguistic basis of dialectal affinity.",
        "If deeper cognitive constraints are reflected in that basis, then we are now in an improved position to detect them."
