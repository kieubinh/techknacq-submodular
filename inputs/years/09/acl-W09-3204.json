        "Many natural language processing applications must directly or indirectly assess the semantic similarity of text passages.",
        "Modern approaches to information retrieval, summarization, and textual entailment, among others, require robust numeric relevance judgments when a pair of texts is provided as input.",
        "Although each task demands its own scoring criteria, a simple lexical overlap measure such as cosine similarity of document vectors can often serve as a surprisingly powerful baseline.",
        "We argue that there is room to improve these general-purpose similarity measures, particularly for short text passages.",
        "Most approaches fall under one of two categories.",
        "One set of approaches attempts to explicitly account for fine-grained structure of the two passages, e.g. by aligning trees or constructing logical forms for theorem proving.",
        "While these approaches have the potential for high precision on many examples, errors in alignment judgments or formula construction are often insurmountable.",
        "More broadly, it's not always clear that there is a correct alignment or logical form that is most appropriate for a particular sentence pair.",
        "The other approach tends to ignore structure, as canonically represented by the vector space model, where any lexical item in common between the two passages contributes to their similarity score.",
        "While these approaches often fail to capture distinctions imposed by, e.g. negation, they do correctly capture a broad notion of similarity or aboutness.",
        "This paper presents a novel variant of the vector space model of text similarity based on a random walk algorithm.",
        "Instead of comparing two bags-of-words directly, we compare the distribution each text induces when used as the seed of a random walk over a graph derived from Word-Net and corpus statistics.",
        "The walk posits the existence of a distributional particle that roams the graph, biased toward the neighborhood surrounding an input bag of words.",
        "Eventually, the walk reaches a stationary distribution over all nodes in the graph, smoothing the peaked input distribution over a much larger semantic space.",
        "Two such stationary distributions can be compared using conventional measures of vector similarity, producing a final relatedness score.",
        "This paper makes the following contributions.",

        "Table 4 shows the results of using the similarity measure alone to determine entailment; the system's ability to recognize entailment is above chance on all data sets.",
        "Since the RTE data sets are balanced, we used the median of the random walk scores for each data set as the threshold rather than using an absolute threshold.",
        "While the measure does not outperform most RTE systems, it does outperform some systems that used only lexical overlap such as the Katrenko system from the second challenge (Bar-Haim et al., 2006).",

        "In the random walk framework, this expansion is analogous to taking only a single step of the random walk.",
        "Indeed, in the case of the translation model introduced in (Berger and Lafferty, 1999), they are mathematically equivalent.",
        "However, we have argued that the walk is an effective global aggregator of relatedness information.",
        "We can formulate the question as an empirical one – does simulating the walk until convergence really improve our representation of the text document?",
        "To answer this question, we extracted a 200 items subset of the MSR training data and truncated the walk at each time step up until our convergence threshold was reached at around 50 iterations.",
        "We then evaluated the correlation of the walk score with the correct label from the MSR data for 10 random resamplings of 66 documents each.",
        "Figure 1 plots this result for different distributional similarity measures.",
        "We observe that as the number of steps increases, performance under most of the distributional similarity measures improves, with the exception of the asymmetric skew-divergence measure introduced in (Lee, 2001).",
        "This plot also gives some insight into the qualitative nature of the stability of the various distributional measures for the paraphrase task.",
        "For instance, we observe that the Jensen-Shannon score and dice score tend to be the most consistent between runs, but the dice score has a slightly higher mean.",
        "This explains in part why the dice score was the best performing measure for the task.",
        "In contrast, cosine similarity was observed to perform poorly here, although it was found to be the best measure when combined with our textual entailment system.",

        "While lexical relatedness is well studied, it is not directly applicable to text passages without some surrounding environment.",
        "Because this work represents words and passages as interchangeable mathematical objects (teleport vectors), our approach holds promise as a general framework for aggregating local relatedness information between words into reliable measures between text passages.",
        "The random walk framework can be used to evaluate changes to lexical resources because it covers the entire scope of a resource: the whole graph is leveraged to construct the final distribution, so changes to any part of the graph are reflected in each walk.",
        "This means that the meaningfulness of changes in the graph can be evaluated according to how they affect these text similarity scores; this provides a more semantically relevant evaluation of updates to a resource than, for example, counting how many new words or links between words have been added.",
        "As shown in Jar-masz and Szpakowicz (2003), an updated resource may have many more links and concepts but still have similar performance on applications as the original.",

        "Transition matrices from alternative linguistic resources such as corpus co-occurrence statistics or larger knowledge bases such as Wikipedia may very well add value as a lexical resource underlying the walk.",
