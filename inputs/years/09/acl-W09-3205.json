        "There has been quite a lot of research concerned with automatic clustering of semantically similar words or automatic retrieval of collocations among them from corpora.",
        "Most of this work is based on similarity measures derived from the distribution of words in corpora.",
        "However, the facts that a single word does have more than one sense and that the distribution of a word in a corpus is a mixture of usages of different senses of the same word often hamper such attempts.",
        "In general, restriction of the subject domain makes the problem of polysemy less problematic.",
        "However, even in texts from a restricted domain such as economics or sports, one encounters quite a large number of polysemous words.",
        "Therefore, semantic classification of polysemies has been an interest since the earliest days when a number of large scale corpora have become available.",
        "In this paper, we focus on Japanese polysemous verbs, and present a method for polysemous verb classification.",
        "We used a graph-based unsupervised clustering algorithm (Zhang, 2007).",
        "The algorithm combines the idea of modularity function Q, spectral relaxation and fuzzy c-means clustering method to identify overlapping nodes with more than one cluster.",
        "The modularity function measures the quality of a cluster structure.",
        "Spectral mapping performs a dimensionality reduction which makes it possible to cluster in the very high dimensional spaces.",
        "The fuzzy c-means allows for the detection of nodes with more than one cluster.",
        "We applied the algorithm to cluster polysemous verbs.",
        "The modularity function for measuring the quality of a cluster structure is calculated based on the frequency distributions over verb frames with selectional preferences.",
        "We collected semantic classes from IPAL Japanese dictionary (IPAL, 1987), and used them as a gold standard data.",
        "IPAL lists about 900 Japanese basic verbs, and categorizes each verb into multiple senses.",
        "Moreover, the categorization is based on verbal syntax with respect to the choice of its arguments.",
        "Therefore, if the clustering algorithm induces a polysemous verb classification on the basis of verbal syntax, then the resulting classification should agree the IPAL classes.",
        "We used a large Japanese newspaper corpus and EDR (Electronic Dictionary Research) dictionary (EDR, 1986) to obtain verbs and their subcategorization frames with selectional preferences .",
