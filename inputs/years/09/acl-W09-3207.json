        "Vector space models, representing word meanings as points in high-dimensional space, have been used in a variety of semantic relatedness tasks (Sahlgren, 2006; Padó and Lapata, 2007).",
        "Graphs are another way of representing relations between linguistic entities, and they have been used to capture semantic relatedness by using both corpus-based evidence and the graph structure of WordNet and Wikipedia (Pedersen et al., 2004; Widdows and Dorow, 2002; Minkov and Cohen, 2008).",
        "We study the relationship between vector space models and graph random walk models by embedding vector space models in graphs.",
        "The flexibility offered by graph random walk models allows us to compare the vector space-based similarity measures to extended notions of relatedness and similarity.",
        "In particular, a random walk model can be viewed as smoothing direct similarity between two vectors using second-order and even higher-order vectors.",
        "This view leads to the second focal point of this paper: We investigate whether random walk models can simulate the smoothing effects obtained by methods like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).",
        "To answer this question, we compute models on reduced (downsampled) versions of our dataset and evaluate the robustness of random walk models, a classic vector-based model, and SVD-based models against data sparseness."

        "We use directed graphs with weighted edges, G = (V, E, w) where V is a set of nodes, E = V x V is a set of edges and w : E – > R is the weighting function on edges.",
        "For simplicity, we assume that G is fully connected, edges with zero weights can be considered as non-existing in the graph.",
        "On these graphs, we perform random walks with an initial probability distribution q over the nodes (a 1 x \\ V\\ vector).",
        "We then follow edges with probability proportional to their weights, so that the probability of walking from node V\\ to node V2 is w(vi,V2)/ J2V w(vi,v).",
        "A fixed length random walk ends after a predetermined number of steps.",
        "In flexible walks, there is a constant probability 7 of stopping at each step.",
        "Thus, walk length follows a geometric distribution with parameter 7, the probability of a walk of length k is 7(1 – 7)fc_1and the expected walk length is 1/7.",
        "For example, a flexible walk with 7 = 1/2 will produce 1-step, 2-step, and higher-step walks while the expected average length is 2.",
        "Relating vectors and graphs.",
        "Corpus cooccurrence (ei,e2,ai2) of two entities e\\ and e2 that co-occur with (potentially transformed) count a\\2 can be represented in either a vector or a graph.",
        "In a vector, it corresponds to a dimension value of a\\2 for the dimension e2 of entity e\\.",
        "In a graph, it corresponds to two nodes labeled e\\ and e2 connected by an edge with weight aw-Similarity measures.",
        "Let R(q) = p denote a specific random walk process which transforms an initial probability distribution q to a final probability distribution p over the nodes.",
        "We write q{m) for the probability assigned to the node m under q.",
        "If the initial distribution q concentrates all probability on a single node n, i.e., q{n) = 1 and q(x) = 0 for all nodes x / n, we write pr{n – > m) for the probability p{m) of ending up at node m.",
        "The simplest way of measuring relatedness through random walks is to consider the probability p{m) of a single node m as an endpoint for a walk starting with start probability distribution q, that is, p = R(q).",
        "We call this a direct, one-direction measure of relatedness between q and m. Direct, one-direction measures are typically asymmetric.",
        "In case all start probability is concentrated on a single node n, we can also consider direct, two-direction measures, which will be a combination of pr{m – > n) and pr{n – > m).",
        "The point of using two-direction measures is that these can be made symmetric, which is an advantage when we are modeling undirected semantic similarity.",
        "In the experiments below we focus on the average of the two probabilities.",
        "In addition to direct measures, we will use indirect measures, in which we compute the relatedness of endpoint probability distributions pi = ü(qi) and P2 = R(q.2)- As endpoint distributions can be viewed both as probability distributions and as vectors, we used three indirect measures: 1) Jensen/Shannon divergence, a symmetric variant of the Kullback/Leibler divergence between probability distributions.",
        "2) cosine similarity, and 3) dot product.",
        "Dot product is a natural choice in a graph setting because we can view it as the probability of a pair of walks, one starting at a node determined by qi and the other starting at a node governed by q2, ending at the same node.",
        "Discussion.",
        "Direct and indirect relatedness measures together with variation in walk length give us a simple, powerful and flexible way to capture different kinds of similarity (with traditional vector-based approach as a special case).",
        "Longer walks or flexible walks will capture higher order effects that may help coping with data sparseness, similar to the use of second-order vectors.",
        "Dimensionality reduction techniques like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) also capture these higher-order effects, and it has been argued that that makes them more resistant against sparseness (Schütze, 1997).",
        "To our knowledge, no systematic comparison of",
        "SVD and classical vector-based methods has been done on different corpus sizes.",
        "In our experiments, we will compare the performance of SVD and flexible-walk smoothing at different corpus sizes and for a variety of tasks.",
        "Implementation: We extract tuples from the 2-billion word ukWaC corpus, dependency-parsed with MINIPAR.",
        "Following Padó and Lapata (2007), we only consider co-occurrences where two target words are connected by certain dependency paths, namely: the top 30 most frequent preposition-mediated noun-to-noun paths {soldier+with+gun), the top 50 transitive-verb-mediated noun-to-noun paths {soldier+use+gun), the top 30 direct or preposition-mediated verb-noun paths {kill+obj+victim, kill+in+school), and the modifying and predicative adjective-to-noun paths.",
        "Pairs (wi,W2) that account for 0.01% or less of the marginal frequency of W\\ were trimmed.",
        "The resulting tuple list, with raw counts converted to mutual information scores, contains about 25 million tuples.",
        "To test how well graph-based and alternative methods \"scale down\" to smaller corpora, we sampled random subsets of tuples corresponding to 0.1%, 1%, 10%, and 100% of the full list.",
        "To put things into perspective, the full list was extracted from a corpus of about 2 billion words; so, the 10% list is on the order of magnitude of the BNC, and the 0.1% list is on the order of magnitude of the Brown corpus.",
        "From each of the 4 resulting datasets, we built one graph and two vector space models: one space with full dimensionality, and one space reduced to 300 dimensions using singular value decomposition."

        "Both models' performances are comparable with the previously reported studies, and above that of random walks.",
        "Semantic priming: The next dataset comes from Hodgson (1991) and it is of interest since it requires capturing different forms of semantic relatedness between prime-target pairs: synonyms {synonym), coordinates {coord), antonyms {antonym), free association pairs {conass), super-and subordinate pairs {supersub) and phrasal associates {phrasacc).",
        "Following previous simulations of this dataset (Padó and Lapata, 2007), we measure the similarity of each related target-prime pair, and we compare it to the average similarity of the target to all the other primes instantiating the same relation, treating the latter quantity as our surrogate of an unrelated target-prime pair.",

        "Even though the SVD-based and pure-vector models are among the top achievers in general, we see that in different tasks different random walk models achieve comparable or even better performances.",

        "So far, we reported only the results obtained on the full graph.",

        "In this case, we are not interested in the absolute performance of the models per se but the relative performance.",
        "Thus, for ease of comparison we fixed each model's performance on the full graph to 1 for each task and linearly scaled its performance on smaller graphs.",
        "For example saying that the SVD-based model achieves a score of 0.911 on 10% graph for the Rubenstein and Goodenough dataset means that the ratio of the performance of SVD-based model on 10% graph to the performance of the same model on the full graph is 0.911.",

        "In the 10% graph, we see that on all tasks but one, dot 2 is the model least affected by the data reduction.",
        "On the contrary, down-sampling has a positive effect on this model because on 6 tasks, it actually performs better than it does on the full graph!",
        "The same behavior is also observed on the 1% graph - as an example, for phrasal associates relations, dot 2 performance increases by a factor of around 1.2 when we use one hundredth of the graph instead of the full one.",

        "The experiments carried out on 8 different tasks by using the full graph revealed that SVD-based model performs very well across all types of semantic relatedness.",
        "However, there is also evidence that depending on the particular relation-some random walk models can achieve results as good as or even better than those of SVD-based models.",
        "Our second question was whether the random walk models would be able to simulate the smoothing effects obtained by SVD.",
