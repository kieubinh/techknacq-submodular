        "Multiword expressions (MWEs) are defined as \"idiosyncratic interpretations that cross word boundaries or spaces\" (Sag et al., 2001).",
        "Such expressions are pervasive in natural language; they are estimated to be equivalent in number to simplex words in mental lexicon (Jackendoff, 1997).",
        "MWEs exhibit a number of lexical, syntactic, semantic, pragmatic and statistical idiosyncrasies: syntactic peculiarities (e.g., by and large, ad hoc), semantic non-compositionality (e.g., as in kick the bucket (die) and red tape (bureaucracy)), pragmatic idiosyncrasies (the expression is sometimes associated with a fixed pragmatic point, e.g., good morning, good night), variation in syntactic flexibility (e.g., / handed in my thesis = I handed my thesis in vs. Kim kicked the bucket / *the bucket was kicked by Kim), variation in productivity (there are various levels of productivity for different MWEs, e.g., kick/*beat/*hit the bucket, call/ring/phone/*telephone up).",
        "These idiosyncrasies pose challenges for NLP systems, which have to recognize that an expression is an MWE to deal with it properly.",
        "Recognizing MWEs has been shown to be useful for a number of applications such as information retrieval (Lewis and Croft, 1990; Rila Mandala and Tanaka, 2000; Wacholder and Song, 2003) and POS tagging (Piao et al., 2003).",
        "It has also been shown that MWEs account for 8% of parsing errors with precision grammars (Baldwin et al., 2004).",
        "Furthermore, MWE detection is used in information extraction (Lin, 1998b) and an integral component of symbolic MT systems (Gerber and Yang, 1997; Bond and Shirai, 1997).",
        "However, the special properties of MWEs can also be exploited to recognize MWEs automatically.",
        "There have been many studies on MWEs: identification (determining whether multiple simplex words form a MWE in a given token context, e.g. put the sweater on vs. put the sweater on the table), extraction (recognizing MWEs as word units at the type level), detecting or measuring compositionality of MWEs, semantic interpretation (interpreting the semantic association among components in MWEs).",
        "To extract MWEs, various methods have been proposed that exploit the syntactic and lexical fixedness exhibited by MWEs, or apply various statistical measures across all co-occurrence vectors between the whole expression and its component parts (see Section 2).",
        "These methods can be used to automatically identify potentially idiomatic expressions at a type level, but they do not say anything about the idiomaticity of an expression in a particular context.",
        "While some idioms (e.g., ad hoc) are always used idiomatically, there are numerous others that can be used both idiomatically (see Example 1) and non-idiomatically (see Example 2).",
        "(1) When the members of De la Guarda aren't hanging around, they're yelling and bouncing off the wall.",
        "(2) Blinded by the sun, Erstad leaped at the wall, but the ball bounced off the wall well below his glove.",
        "Our work aims to distinguish the literal and non-literal usages of idiomatic expressions in a discourse context (so-called token based classification).",
        "It is therefore different from type-based approaches which aim to detect the general id-iomaticity of an expression rather than its actual usage in a particular context.",
        "We utilize the cohesive structure of a discourse (Halliday and Hasan, 1976) to distinguish literal or non-literal usage of MWEs.",
        "The basic idea is that the component words of an MWE contribute to the cohesion of the discourse in the literal case, while in the non-literal case they do not.",
        "For instance, in the literal use of break the ice in Example 3, the content word ice contributes to the overall semantic connectivity of the whole sentence by the fact that ice is semantically related to water.",
        "In contrast, in the non-literal example in 4, the word ice does not contribute to the overall cohesion as it is poorly connected to all the other (content) words in this specific context (play, party, games).",
        "(3) The water would break the ice into floes with its accumulated energy.",
        "(4) We played a couple of party games to break the ice.",
        "Our approach bears similarities to Hirst and St-Onge's (1998) method for detecting malapropisms based on their non-participation in cohesive chains.",
        "However, computing such chains requires a predefined similarity threshold which governs whether a word is placed in a particular chain.",
        "Setting this threshold typically requires a manually labeled development set, which makes this method weakly supervised.",
        "We propose an alternative, parameter-free method in which we model the cohesive structure of a discourse as a graph structure (called cohesion graph), where the vertices of the graph correspond to the content words of the text and the edges encode the semantic relatedness between pairs of words.",
        "To distinguish between literal and non-literal use of MWEs, we look at how the average relatedness of the graph changes when the component words of the MWE are excluded or included in the graph (see Section 3).",
        "We first introduced the cohesion graph method in Sporleder and Li (2009).",
        "In the present paper,",
        "!By modeling lexical cohesion as a graph structure, we follow earlier approaches in information retrieval, notably by Saltan and colleagues (Saltan et al., 1994).",
        "The difference is that these works aim at representing similarity between larger text segments (e.g., paragraphs) in a so-called 'text' or 'paragraph relation map', whose vertices correspond to a text segment and whose edges represent the similarity between the segments (modeled as weighted term overlap).",
        "we provide a formalization of the graph and experiment with different vertex and edge weighting schemes.",
        "We also report on experiments with varying the size of the input context and also with pruning the graph structure automatically."

        "Methods based on manually built lexical knowledge bases, such as WordNet, compute the shortest path between two concepts in the knowledge base and/or look at word overlap in the glosses (see Budan-itsky and Hirst (2006) for an overview).",
        "Distributional approaches, on the other hand, rely on text corpora, and model relatedness by comparing the contexts in which two words occur, assuming that related words occur in similar context (e.g., Hindle (1990), Lin (1998a), Mohammad and Hirst (2006)).",
        "More recently, there has also been research on using Wikipedia and related resources for modeling semantic relatedness (Ponzetto and Strube, 2007; Zesch et al., 2008).",

        "Dependency Vectors (DV) is a distributional approach which does not look simply at word cooccurrences in a fixed-size window but takes into account syntactic (dependency) relations between words (Pad√≥ and Lapata, 2007).",
        "Each target word is represented by a co-occurrence vector where dimension represents a chosen term and the vector contains the co-occurrence information between that word and the chosen terms in a corpus (we used the BNC in our experiments).",

        "When querying for a term we query for a disjunction of all its inflected forms.",

        "Using web counts rather than bi-gram counts from a corpus as the basis for computing semantic relatedness has the advantage that the web is a significantly larger database than any compiled corpus, which makes it much more likely that we can find information about the concepts we are looking for (thus alleviating data sparseness).",
        "However, search engine counts are notoriously unreliable (Kilgariff, 2007; Matsuo et al., 2007) and while previous studies have shown that web counts can be used as reliable proxies for corpus-based counts for some applications (Zhu and Rosenfeld, 2001; Lapata and Keller, 2005) it is not clear that this also applies when modeling semantic relatedness.",

        "Edge weighting (CGAew), node weighting (CGAnw) and their combination (CGAew+nw), on the other hand, seem to have a somewhat negative influence on the literal recall and F-score.",

        "As a result, the product of the weight and the relatedness value for the idiom component words are lower than the average, which leads to the negative contribution of the idiom words to the cohesion graph (over predicting non-literal usage).",

        "The negative performance of the weighting scheme may be also due to the fact that we used a relatively small context of five paragraphs.Both the idf and the distance weighting should probably be defined on larger contexts.",
        "For example, the distance between two tokens within a paragraph probably has not such a large effect on whether their relatedness score is reliable or accidental.",
        "Hence it might be better to model the edge weight as the distance in terms of paragraphs rather than words.",

        "Hence, idiomatic use of MWEs can be detected by the absence of such ties.",
        "We propose a graph-based method which exploits this behavior to classify MWEs as literal or non-literal.",
        "The method compares how the MWE component words contribute the overall semantic connectivity of the graph.",
        "We provided a formalization of the graph and experimented with varying the context size and weighting scheme for nodes and edges.",
        "We found that the method generally works better for larger contexts; the weighting schemes proved somewhat unsuccessful, at least for our current context size.",
        "In the future, we plan to experiment with larger context sizes and more sophisticated weighting schemes."
