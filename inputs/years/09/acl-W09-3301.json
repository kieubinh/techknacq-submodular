        "Entity extraction is the task of identifying and classifying atomic text elements into predefined categories such as person names, place names, and organization names.",
        "Entity extraction often serves as a fundamental step for complex Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications such as information retrieval, question answering, and machine translation.",
        "It has been recognized that in this task, gazetteers, or entity dictionaries, play a crucial role (Roberts et al., 2008).",
        "In addition, they serve as important resources for other studies, such as assessing level of ambiguities of a language, and disambiguation (Maynard et al., 2004).",
        "Because building and maintaining high quality gazetteers by hand is very time consuming (Ka-zama and Torisawa, 2008), many solutions have proposed generating gazetteers automatically from existing resources.",
        "In particular, the success that solutions which exploit Wikipedia have been enjoying in many other NLP applications has encouraged a number of research works on automatic gazetteer generation to use Wikipedia, such as works by Toral and Munoz (2006), and Kazama and Torisawa (2007).",
        "Unfortunately, current systems still present several limitations.",
        "First, none have exploited the full content and structure of Wikipedia articles, but instead, only make use of the article's first sentence.",
        "However, the full content and structure of Wikipedia carry rich information that has been proven useful in many other NLP problems, such as document classification (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2006), entity disambiguation (Bu-nescu and Pa§ca, 2006), and semantic relatedness (Strube and Ponzetto, 2006).",
        "Second, no other works have evaluated their methods in the context of entity extraction tasks.",
        "Evaluating these generated gazetteers in real NLP applications is important, because the quality of these gazetteers has a major impact on the performance of NLP applications that make use of them.",
        "Third, the majority of approaches focus on newswire domain and the four classic entity types location (LOC), person (PER), organization (ORG) and miscellaneous (MISC), which have been studied extensively.",
        "However, it has been argued that entity extraction is often much harder in scientific domains due to complexity of domain languages, density of information and specificity of classes (Murphy et al., 2006; Byrne, 2007; Nobata et al., 2000).",
        "In this paper we propose a novel approach to automatically generating gazetteers using external knowledge resources.",
        "Our method is language and domain independent, and scalable.",
        "We show that the content and various structural elements of Wikipedia can be successfully exploited to generate high quality gazetteers.",
        "To assess gazetteer quality, we evaluate it in the context of entity extraction in the scientific domain of Archaeology, and demonstrate that the generated gazetteers improve the performance of an SVM-based entity tagger across all entity types on an archaeological corpus.",
        "The rest of the paper is structured as follows.",
        "In the next section, we review related work.",
        "In section 3 we explain our methodology for automatic gazetteer generation.",
        "Section 4 introduces the problem domain and describes the experiments conducted.",

        "Currently, existing methods to automatic gazetteer generation can be categorized into two mainstreams; pattern driven approach and knowledge resource approach.",
        "The pattern driven approach uses domain-and language specific patterns to extract candidate entities from unlabeled corpora.",
        "The idea is to include features derived from unlabeled data to improve a supervised learning model.",
        "For example, Riloff and Jones (1999) introduced a bootstrapping algorithm which starts from seed lists and, iteratively learns and refines domain specific extraction patterns for a semantic category that are then used for building dictionaries from unlabeled data.",
        "Talukdar et al. (2006), also starting with seed entity lists, apply pattern induction to an unlabeled corpus and then use the induced patterns to extract candidate entities from the corpus to build extended gazetteers.",
        "They showed that using the token membership feature with the extended gazetteer improved the performance of a Conditional Random Field (CRF) entity tagger; Kozareva (2006) designed language specific extraction patterns and validation rules to build Spanish location (LOC), person (PER) and organization (ORG) gazetteers from unlabeled data, and used these to improve a supervised entity tagger.",
        "However, the pattern driven approach has been criticized for weak domain adaptability and inadequate extensibility due to the specificity of derived patterns.",
        "(Toral and Munoz, 2006; Ka-zama and Torisawa, 2008).",
        "Also, often it is difficult and time-consuming to develop domain-and language-specific patterns.",
        "The knowledge resource approach, attempts to solve these problems by relying on the abundant information and domain-independent structures in existing large-scale knowledge resources.",
        "Magnini et al. (2002) used WordNet as a gazetteer together with rules to extract entities such as LOC, PER and ORG.",
        "They used two relations in WordNet; Word_Class, referring to concepts bringing external evidence; and Word_Instance, referring to particular instances of those concepts.",
        "Concepts belonging to Word_Class are used to identify trigger words for candidate entities in corpus, while concepts of Word_Instance are used directly as lookup dictionaries.",
        "They achieved good results on a newswire corpus.",
        "The main limitation of Word-Net is lack of domain specific vocabulary, which is critical to domain specific applications (Schütze and Pedersen, 1997).",
        "Roberts et al. (2008) used terminology extracted from UMLS as gazetteers and tested it in an entity extraction task over a medical corpus.",
        "Contrary to WordNet, UMLS is an example of a domain specific knowledge resource, thus its application is also limited.",
        "Recently, the exponential growth in information content in Wikipedia has made this Web resource increasingly popular for solving a wide range of NLP problems and across different domains.",
        "Concerning automatic gazetteer generation, Toral and Munoz (2006) tried to build gazetteers for LOC, PER, and ORG by extracting all noun phrases from the first sentences of Wikipedia articles.",
        "Next they map the noun phrases to WorldNet synsets, and follow the hyperonymy hierarchy until they reach a synset belonging to the entity class of interest.",
        "However, they did not evaluate the generated gazetteers in the context of entity extraction.",
        "Due to lack of domain specific knowledge in WordNet, their method is limited if applied to domain specific gazetteer generation.",
        "In contrast, our method overcomes this limitation since it doesn't rely on any resources other than Wikipedia.",
        "Another fundamental difference is that our method exploits more complex structures of Wikipedia.",
        "Kazama and Torisawa (2007) argued that while traditional gazetteers map word sequences to predefined entity categories such as \"London – {LOCATION}\", a gazetteer is useful as long as it returns consistent labels even if these are not predefined categories.",
        "Following this hypothesis, they mapped Wikipedia article titles to their hypernyms by extracting the first noun phrase after be in the first sentence of the article, and used these as gazetteers in an entity extraction task.",
        "In their experiment, they mapped over 39,000 search candidates to approximately 1,200 hypernyms; and using these hypernyms as category labels in an entity extraction task showed an improvement in system performance.",
        "Later, Ka-zama and Torisawa (2008) did the same in another experiment on a Japanese corpus and achieved consistent results.",
        "Although novel, their method in fact bypasses the real problem of generating gazetteers of specific entity types.",
        "Our method is essentially different in this aspect.",
        "In addition, they only use the first sentence of Wi-kipedia articles."

      "text": [
        "In this section, we describe our methodology for automatic gazetteer generation using the knowledge resource approach.",
        "To demonstrate the validity of our approach, we have selected the English Wikipedia as the external knowledge resource.",
        "Wikipedia is a free multilingual and collaborative online encyclopedia that is growing rapidly and offers good quality of information (Giles, 2005).",
        "Articles in Wiki-pedia are identified by unique names, and refer to specific entities.",
        "Wikipedia articles have many useful structures for knowledge extraction; for example, articles are interconnected by hyperlinks carrying relations (Gabrilovich and Marko-vitch, 2006); articles about similar topics are categorized under the same labels, or grouped in lists; categories are organized as taxonomies, and each category is associated with one or more parent categories (Bunescu and Pa§ca, 2006).",
        "These relations are useful for identifying related articles and thus entities, which is important for automatic gazetteer generation.",
        "Compared to other knowledge resources such as WordNet and UMLS, Wikipedia covers significantly larger amounts of information across different domains, therefore, it is more suitable for building domain-specific gazetteers.",
        "For example, as of February 2009, there are only 147,287 unique words in WordNet, whereas the English Wikipedia is significantly larger with over 2.5 million articles.",
        "A study by Holloway (2007) identified that by 2005 there were already 78,977 unique categories divided into 1,069 disconnected category clusters, which can be considered as the same number of different domains.",
        "We propose an automatic gazetteer generation method using Wikipedia article contents, hyperlinks, and category structures, which can generate entity gazetteers of any type.",
        "Our method",
        "http://wordnet.princeton.edu/man/wnstats.7WN , February 2009",
        "takes input seed entities of any type, and extends them to more complete lists of the same type.",
        "It is based on three hypotheses;",
        "1.",
        "Wikipedia contains articles about domain specific seed entities.",
        "2.",
        "Using articles about the seed entities, we can extract fine-grained type labels for them, which can be considered as a list of hypernyms of the seed entities, and predefined entity type hyponyms of the seeds.",
        "3.",
        "Following the links on Wikipedia articles, we can reach a large collection of articles that are related to the source articles.",
        "If a related article's type label (as extracted above) matches any of those extracted for seed entities, we consider it a similar entity of the predefined type.",
        "Naturally, we divide our methods into three steps; firstly we match a seed entity to a Wikipe-dia article (the matching phase); next we label seed entities using the articles extracted for them and build a pool of fine-grained type labels for the seed entities (the labeling phase); finally we extract similar entities by following links in articles of seed entities (the expansion phase).",
        "The pseudo-algorithm is illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "For a given seed entity, we firstly use the exact phrase to retrieve Wikipedia articles.",
        "If not found, we use the leftmost longest match, as done by Kazama and Torisawa (2007).",
        "In Wiki-pedia, searches for ambiguous phrases are redirected to a Disambiguation Page, from which users have to manually select a sense.",
        "We filter out any matches that are directed to disambiguation pages.",
        "This filtering strategy is also applied to step 3 in extracting candidate entities.",
        "After retrieving Wikipedia articles for all seed entities, we extract fine-grained type labels from these articles.",
        "We identified two types of information from Wikipedia that can extract potentially reliable labels.",
        "Input: seed entities SE of type T Output: new entities NE of type T STEP 1 (section 3.2.1)",
        "Figure 1.",
        "The proposed pseudo-algorithm for gazetteer generation from the content and various structural elements of Wikipedia",
        "As Kazama and Torisawa (2007) observed, in the first sentence of an article, the head noun of the noun phrase just after be is most likely the hypernym of the entity of interest, and thus a good category label.",
        "There are two pitfalls to this approach.",
        "First, the head noun may be too generic to represent a domain-specific label.",
        "For example, following their approach the label extracted for the archaeological term \"Classical Stage\" from the sentence \"The Classic Stage is an archaeological term describing a particular developmental level.\"",
        "is \"term\", which is the head noun of \"archaeological term\".",
        "Clearly in such case the phrase is more domain-specific.",
        "For this reason we use the exact noun phrase as category label in our work.",
        "Second, their method ignores a correlative conjunction which in most cases indicates equivalently useful labels.",
        "For example, the two noun phrases in italic in the sentence \"Sheffield is a city and metropolitan borough in South Yorkshire, England\" are equally useful labels for the article \"Sheffield\".",
        "Therefore, we also extract the noun phrase connected by a correlative conjunction as the label.",
        "We apply this method to articles retrieved in 3.2.1.",
        "For simplicity, we refer to this approach to labeling seed entities as FirstSentenceLabeling, and the labels created as Ls.",
        "Note that our method is essentially different from Kazama and Torisawa as we do not add these extracted nouns to gazetteers; instead, we only use them for guiding the extraction of candidate entities, as described in section 3.2.3.",
        "As mentioned in section 3.1, similar articles in Wikipedia are manually grouped under the same categories by their authors, and categories are further organized as a taxonomy.",
        "As a result, we extract category labels of articles as finegrained type labels and consider them to be hypernyms of the entity's article.",
        "We refer to this method as CategoryLabeling, and apply it to the seed entities to create a list of category labels, which we denote by Lc.",
        "Three situations arise in which the Category-Labeling introduces noisy labels.",
        "First, some articles are categorized under a category with the same title as the article itself.",
        "For example, the article about \"Bronze Age\" is categorized under category \"Bronze Age\".",
        "In this case, we explore the next higher level of the category tree, i.e., we extract categories of the category \"Bronze Age\", including \"2nd Millennium\", \"3rd millennium BC\", \"Bronze\", \"Periods and stages in Archaeology\", and \"Prehistory\".",
        "Second, some categories are meaningless and for management purposes, such as \"Articles to be Merged since 2008\", \"Wikipedia Templates\".",
        "For these, we manually create a small list of \"stop\" categories to be discarded.",
        "Third, according to Strube and Ponzetto (2008), the category hierarchy is sometimes noisy.",
        "To reduce noisy labels, we only keep labels that are extracted for at least 2 seed entities.",
        "Once a pool of fine-grained type labels have been created, in the next step we consider them as fine-grained and immediate hypernyms of the seed entities, and use them as control vocabulary to guide the extraction of candidate entities.",
        "To extract candidate entities, we first identify from Wikipedia the entities that are related to the seed entities.",
        "Then we select from them those candidates that share one or more common hypernyms with the seed entities.",
        "The intuition is that in the taxonomy, nodes that share common immediate parents are mostly related, and, therefore, good candidates for extended gazetteers.",
        "We extract related entities by following the hyperlinks from the articles retrieved for the seed entities, as by section 3.2.1.",
        "This is because in Wikipedia, articles often contain mentions of entities that also have a corresponding article, and these mentions are represented as outgoing hyperlinks.",
        "They link the main article of an entity (source entity) to other sets of entities (related entities).",
        "Therefore, by following these links we can reach a large set of related entities to the seed list.",
        "To reduce noise, we also filter out links to disambiguation pages as in section 3.2.1.",
        "Next, for each candidate in the related set, we use the two labeling approaches introduced in section 3.2.2 to extract its type labels.",
        "If any of these are included by the control vocabulary built with the same labeling approach, we accept them into the extended gazetteers.",
        "That is, if the control vocabulary is built by FirstSentenceLabeling we only use FirstSentenceLabeling to label the candidate.",
        "The same applies to CategoryLabeling.",
        "One can easily extend this stage by recursively crawling the hyperlinks contained in the retrieved pages.",
        "In addition, some Wikipedia articles have one or more redirecting links, which groups several surface forms of a single entity.",
        "For example a search for \"army base\" is redirected to article \"military base\".",
        "These surface forms can be considered as synonyms, and we thus also select them for extend gazetteers.",
        "After applying the above processes to all seed entity articles, we obtain the output extended gazetteers of domain-specific types.",
        "To eliminate potentially ambiguous entities, for each extended gazetteer, we exclude entities that are found in domain-independent gazetteers.",
        "For example, we use a generic person name gazetteer to exclude ambiguous person names from the extended gazetteers for LOC."

        "In addition, they all outperform the original gazetteers, indicating that the quality of extended gazetteers is good for the entity extraction task.",
        "By comparing the effects of each extended gazetteer, we notice that using the gazetteers built with type-labels extracted from the first sentence of Wikipedia article always outperforms using those built via the Wikipedia categories, indicating that the first method (FirstSen-tenceLabeling) results in better quality gazetteers.",
        "This is due to two reasons.",
        "First, the category tree in Wikipedia is not a strict taxonomy, and does not always contain is-a relationships (Strube and Ponzetto, 2006).",
        "Although we have eliminated categories that are extracted for only one seed entity, the results indicate the extended gazetteers are still noisier than those built by FirstSentenceLabeling.",
        "To illustrate, the articles for SUB seed entities \"quiver\" and \"arrowhead\" are both categorized under \"Archery\", which permits noisy candidates such as \"Bowhunting\", \"Camel archer\" and \"archer\".",
        "Applying a stricter filtering threshold may resolve this problem.",
        "Second, compared to Wikipedia categories, the labels extracted from the first sentences are sometimes very fine-grained and restrictive.",
        "For example, the labels extracted for \"Buckinghamshire\" from the first sentence are \"ceremonial Home County\" and \"Non-metropolitan County\", both of which are UK-specific LOC concepts.",
        "These rather restrictive labels help control the gazetteer expansion within the domain of interest.",
        "The better performance with FirstSentence-Labeling indicates that such restrictions have played a positive role in reducing noise in the labels generated, and then improving the quality of candidate entities.",
        "We also tested effects of combining the two approaches, and noticed that taking the intersection of gazetteers generated by the two approaches outperform the union, but figures are still lower than the single best method.",
        "This is understandable because by permitting members of noisier gazetteers the system performance degrades."

        "We have presented a novel language-and domain independent approach for automatically generating domain-specific gazetteers for entity recognition tasks using Wikipedia.",
        "Unlike previous approaches, our approach makes use of richer content and structural elements of Wikipedia.",
        "By applying this approach to a corpus of the Archaeology domain, we empirically observed a significant improvement in system accuracy when compared with the baseline systems, and the baselines plus original gazetteers.",
        "The extensibility and domain adaptability of our methods still need further investigation.",
        "In particular, our methods can be extended to introduce several statistical filtering thresholds to control the label generation and candidate entity extraction in an attempt to reduce noise; also the effect of recursively crawling Wikipedia articles in the candidate extraction stage is worth studying.",
        "Additionally, it would be interesting to study other structures of Wikipedia, such as list structures and info boxes, in gazetteer generation.",
        "In future we will investigate into these possibilities, and also test our approach in different domains.",
