        "The recent creation of large-scale, collaboratively constructed semantic resources provides researchers with cheap, easily accessible information.",
        "Previous metrics used for synonym detection had to be built using co-occurrence statistics of collected corpora (Higgins, 2004) or expensive, expert-created resources such as WordNet or Roget's Thesaurus (Jarmasz and Szpakowicz, 2003).",
        "Here, we evaluate the effectiveness of Wiktionary, a collaboratively constructed resource, as a source of semantic relatedness information for the synonym detection problem.",
        "Researching these metrics is important because they have been empirically shown to improve performance in a variety of NLP applications, including word sense disambiguation (Turdakov and Ve-likhov, 2008), real-world spelling errors (Budan-itsky and Hirst, 2006) and coreference resolution (Strube and Ponzetto, 2006).",
        "Synonym detection is a recognized testbed for comparing semantic relatedness metrics (e.g (Zesch et al., 2008)).",
        "In this task, a target word or phrase is presented to the system, which is then presented with four alternative words or phrases.",
        "The goal of the system is to pick the alternative most related to the target.",
        "Example questions can be found in Figure 1.",
        "Through the Wikimedia Foundation, volunteers have created two large-scale, collaborative resources that have been used in previous relatedness research - Wikipedia (an encyclopedia) and Wiktionary (a dictionary).",
        "These sources have been used for synonym detection and replicating human relatedness evaluations using the category structure (Strube and Ponzetto, 2006), local link structure (Milne and Witten, 2008) and (Turdakov and Velikhov, 2008) and global features (Zesch et al., 2008).",
        "They contain related information but focus on different information needs; which information source provides better results depends on the needs of the task.",
        "We use Wiktionary which, due to its role as a dictionary, focuses on common words and definitions - the type of information found in our synonym detection problems.",
        "Both Wikipedia and Wiktionary are organized around a basic \"page\" unit, containing information about an individual word, phrase or entity in the world - definitions, thesaurus entries, pronunciation guides and translations in Wiktionary and general biographical, organizational or philosophical information in Wikipedia.",
        "In both data sets, pages are linked to each each other and to a user-created category structure - a graph structure where pages are vertices of the graph and page links are the graph edges.",
        "We will leverage this graph for determining relatedness.",

        "We define relatedness based on information flow through the entire Wiktionary graph, rather than by any local inbound or outbound link structure.",
        "This provides a global measurement of vertex importance, as we do not limit the approach to comparing immediate neighbors.",
        "To do this, we first run the PageRank algorithm (Brin and Page, 1998) iteratively over the graph until convergence to measure the a priori importance of each vertex in graph:",
        "In this, E contains the edge transition probabilities, set to a uniform outbound probability.",
        "PR holds the PageRank value for each vertex and J is uniform vector used to randomly transition between vertices.",
        "Traditionally, a = 0.85 and is used to tradeoff between a strict transition model and the random-walk model.",
        "We then adopt the extensions proposed in (01-livier and Senellart, 2007) (OS) to determine relatedness given a source vertex:",
        "S is a vector that contains zeros except for a one at our source vertex, and PR removes an overall value of 1 based on the a priori PageRank value of the vertex.",
        "In this way, vertices close to the source are rewarded with weight and vertices that have a high a priori importance are penalized.",
        "When R converges, it contains measures of importance for vertices based on the source vertex.",
        "Final relatedness values are then calculated from the vector generated by Equation 2 and the a priori importance of the vector based on the PageRank from Equation 1:",
        "w is the vertex for the source word and a is the alternative word vertex.",
        "The PR[a] penalty is used to further ensure that our alternative vertex is not highly valued simply because it is well-connected.",
        "Applying Equation 3 provides comparable semantic relatedness performance (see Tables 1 and 2).",
        "However, cases exist where a single data value is insufficient to make an adequate determination of word relatedness because of small differences for candidate words.",
        "We can incorporate additional relatedness information about our vertices by leveraging information about the set of vertices deemed \"most related\" to our current vertex.",
        "We add information by looking at the similarity between the n-best related words for each vertex.",
        "Intuitively, given a source word w and candidate alternatives a\\ and a2, we look at the set of words that are semantically related to each of the candidates (represented as vectors W, A\\ and A2).",
        "If the overlap between elements of W and A\\ is greater than W and A2, A\\ is more likely to be the synonym of W.",
        "Highly-ranked shared elements are good indicators of relatedness and should contribute more than low-ranked related words.",
        "Lists with many low-ranked words could be an artifact of the data set and should not be ranked higher than ones containing a few high-ranked words.",
        "Our ranked-list comparison metric (NB) is a selective mean reciprocal ranking function:",
        "W is the n-best list based on the source vertex and A is the n-best list based on the alternative vertex.",
        "Values are added to our relatedness metric based on the position of a vertex in the target list and the traditional Dirac ^-function, which has a value of one if the target vertex appears anywhere in our candidate list and a zero in all other cases.",
        "Each metric (OS and NB) will have different ranges.",
        "We therefore normalize the reported value by scaling each based on the maximum value for that portion in order to achieve a uniform scale.",
        "Our final metric (OS+NB) is created by averaging the two normalized scores.",
        "In this work, both scores are given equal weighting.",
        "Deriving weightings for combining the two scores will be part of our future work.",
        "In this, 05*0 returns the normalized relosQ value and NBQ returns the normalized rel^B value.",
        "The maximum relp+^{) value of 1.0 is achieved if Cj has the highest PageRank-based value and the highest N-Best value."

        "We present performance results on three data sets.",
        "The first, ESL, uses 50 questions from the English as a Second Language test (Turney, 2001).",
        "Next, an 80 question data set from the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) is used (Lan-dauer and Dumais, 1997).",
        "Finally, we evaluate on the Reader's Digest WordPower (RDWP) data set (Jarmasz and Szpakowicz, 2003).",
        "This is a set of 300 synonym detection problems gathered from the Word Power game of the Canadian edition of Reader's Digest Word from 2000 - 2001.",
        "We use the Feb. 03, 2009 version of the English Wiktionary data set for extracting graph structure and relatedness information.",
        "Table 1 presents the performance of our algorithm on the ESL and TOEFL test sets.",
        "Our results are compared to Jarmasz and Szpakowicz (2003), which uses a path-based cost on the structure of Roget's Thesaurus (JPL) and a cooccurence-based metric, LC-IR (Higgins, 2004), which constrained context to only consider adjacent words in structured web queries.",
        "Information about our algorithm's performance on the RDWP test set is found in Table 2.",
        "Our results are compared to the previously mentioned algorithms and also the work of Zesch et al.",
        "(2008).",
        "Their first metric (ZPL) uses the path length between two graph vertices for relatedness determination.",
        "The second, (ZCV), creates concept vectors based on a distribution of pages that contain a particular word.",
        "RDWP is not only larger then the previous two, but also more complictated.",
        "TOEFL and ESL average 1.0 and 1.008 number of words in each source and alternative, respectively.",
        "For RDWP each entry averages 1.4 words.",
        "We map words and phrases to graph vertices by first matching against the page title.",
        "If there is no match, we follow the approach outlined in (Zesch et al., 2008).",
        "Common words are removed from the phrase and for every remaining word in the phrase, we determine the page mapping for that individual word.",
        "The relatedness of the phrase is then set to be the maximum relatedness value attributed to any of the individual words in the phrase.",
        "Random guessing by an algorithm could increase algorithm performance through random chance.",
        "Therefore, we present both a overall percentage and also a precision-based percentage.",
        "The first (Raw) is defined as the correct number of guesses over all questions.",
        "The second (Prec) is defined as the correct number of guesses divided by only those questions that were attempted.",
        "For NB and OS+NB, we set n = 3000 based on TOEFL data set training.",
        "Testing was then performed on the ESL and RDWP data set.",
        "As shown in Table 1, the OS algorithm performs better on the task than the comparison systems.",
        "On its own, NB relatedness performs well at or slightly worse than OS.",
        "Combining the two measures increases performance on both data sets.",
        "While our TOEFL results are below the reported performance of (Turney et al., 2003) (97.5%), we do not use any task-dependent learning for our results and our algorithms have better performance than any individual module in their system.",
        "Combining OS with NB mitigates the influence of OS when it is not confident.",
        "OS correctly picks 'pinnacle' as a synonym of 'zenith' with a relatedness value 126,000 times larger than its next competitor.",
        "For 'consumed', OS is wrong, giving 'bred' a higher score than 'eaten' - but only by a value 1.2 times that of 'eaten'.",
        "The latter case is overcome by the addition of n-best information while the former is unaffected.",
        "Table 2 demonstrates that we have results comparable to existing state-of-the-art measures.",
        "Our choice of n resulted in reduced scores on this task when compared to using the OS metric by itself.",
        "But, our algorithm still outperforms both the ZPL and ZCV metrics for our data set in raw scores and in three out of the four precision measures.",
