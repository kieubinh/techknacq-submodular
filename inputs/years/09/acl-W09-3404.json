        "They released 200,000 words parallel corpus of English, Urdu, Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi and Punjabi.",
        "In addition, there are 1,640,000 words of Urdu text in this corpus.",
        "These text collections are also annotated with part of speech tags (Hardie 2003).",

        "2007).",
        "Following this work, a syntactic tagset was developed based on work by existing grammarians and a corpus of 110,000 words was manually tagged.",
        "This annotated corpus is available through the center (Sajjad 2007, Hussain 2008).",

        "Hardie (2003) developed the first POS tagset for Urdu using EAGLES guidelines for computational processing.",
        "The tagset contains 282 mor-pho-syntactic tags, differentiating on the basis of number, gender and other morphological details in addition to the syntactic categories.",
        "Punctuation marks are tagged as they are, and not included in 282 tags.",
        "The tags include the gender and number agreement, in addition to syntactic information.",
        "The complications of Urdu tagset design are also discussed.",
        "One of these complexities is word segmentation issue of the language.",
        "Suffixes in Urdu are written with an orthographic space.",
        "Words are separated on the basis of space and so suffixes are treated same as lexical words.",
        "Hence it is hard to assign accurate tag for an automatic tagger.",
        "Although the tagset is designed considering details, but due to larger number of tags it is hard to get a high accuracy with a small sized corpus.",
        "Due to its morphological dependence and its large size, this tagset is not considered in our analysis.",

        "It also has a special tag NEG to mark any occurrence negation words (aiii \"not\" and ^ \"no\" or \"neither\") regardless of context.",
        "It also has a tag SE to mark every occurrence of 5 (\"from\") without considering the context.",
        "Another example of such a context-free lexical tag is WALA to mark every occurrence (including all the inflections) of the word This tagset is referred to as T1 subsequently in this paper.",
        "Recently Sajjad and Schmid (2009) used the tagged data of 107,514 words and carried out an experiment for tagger comparison.",
        "A total of 100,000 words are used as training set and rest as test data.",
        "Four taggers (TnT, Tree, RF and SVM) are trained using training corpus and then tested accordingly.",
        "Reported results of this work show that SVM tagger is the most accurate, showing 94.15% correct prediction of tags.",
        "Remaining three taggers have accuracies of 93.02% (Tree tagger), 93.28% (RF tagger) and 93.40% (TnT tagger).",
        "Another tagset has recently been developed as a part of a project to develop English-Urdu parallel corpus at CRULP, following the Penn Treebank guidelines (Santorini 1990).",
        "It contains 46 tags, with fewer grades of pronouns (PR, PRP$, PRRF, PRRFP$, and PRRL) and demonstratives (DM and DMRL), as compared to T1.",
        "It has several tags for verbs on the basis of their forms and semantics (VB, VBI, VBL, VBLI, and VBT) in addition to the tags for auxiliaries showing aspect (AUXA) and tense (AUXT).",
        "The NN tag is assigned for both singular and plural nouns and includes adverbial kaf pronoun, kaf pronoun, and adverbial pronoun categories of T1.",
        "Yet, it has several other grades of common nouns (NNC, NNCR, NNCM).",
        "It also has two shades of Proper Nouns (NNP, NNPC), which are helpful in identifying phrase boundary of compound proper nouns.",
        "It also has a tag WALA that is assigned to every occurrence (and inflection) of word (wala).",

        "Discussion and Conclusion",
        "The current work looks at the existing tagsets of Urdu being used for tagging corpora and analyzes them from two perspectives.",
        "First, the tagsets are analyzed to see their linguistic level differences.",
        "Second, they are compared based on their inter-tag confusion after training with two different POS taggers.",
        "These analyses are used to derive a more robust tagset.",
        "The results show that collapsing categories which are not syntactically motivated improves the tagging accuracy in general.",
        "Specifically, light and regular verbs are merged, because they may come in similar syntactic frames.",
        "Reduplicated categories are given the same category tag (instead of a special repetition tag).",
        "Units and dates are also not considered separately as the differences have been semantically motivated and they can be categorized with existing tags at syntactic level.",
        "Though, the measuring unit is currently treated as a noun, it could be collapsed as an adjective as well.",
        "The difference is sometimes lexical, where kilogram is more adjectival, vs. minute is more nominal in nature in Urdu, though both are units.",
        "NNP (Proper Noun) tag could also have been collapsed with NN (Common Noun), as Urdu does not make clear between them at syntactic level.",
        "However, these two tags are kept separate due to their cross-linguistic importance.",
        "One may expect that extending the genre or domain of corpus reduces accuracy of tagging because of increase in the variety in the syntactic patterns and diverse use of lexical items.",
        "One may also expect more accuracy with increase in size.",
        "The current results show that effect on additional domain (when C1 and C2 are mixed) is more pronounced than the increase in size (from approximately 100k to 200k), reducing accuracy from 94.21% (T3 with C2) to 90.99% (T3 with C1 + C2).",
        "The increase in accuracy for T3 vs. T1 may be caused by reduced size of T3.",
        "However, the proposed reduction does not compromise the syntactic word level information, as the collapsed categories are where they were either semantically motivated or motivated due to phrasal level tags.",
        "The work has been motivated to consolidate the existing Urdu corpora annotated with different tagsets.",
        "This consolidation will help build more robust computational models for Urdu.",
