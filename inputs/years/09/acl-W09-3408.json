        "Under the REFLEX-LCTL program, we produced \"language packs\" of basic language resources for 13 such languages.",
        "This paper focuses on the resources created for the 8 Asian languages: Bengali, Pashto, Punjabi, Tamil, Tagalog, Thai, Urdu and Uzbek.",

        "The selection of REFLEX-LCTL target languages was based on a number of criteria, while operating within a fixed budget.",
        "The most basic criterion was that the language be spoken by large number of native speakers, but poorly represented in terms of available language resources.",
        "The Indic languages (Bengali, Punjabi, Urdu) were chosen to give researchers the opportunity to experiment with bootstrapping techniques with resources in related languages.",
        "In order to maximize the usefulness and generality of our methods, the project adopted the additional goals of variation in the expected availability of raw resources and also variation in linguistic characteristics both within the set of selected languages and in comparison to more well-resourced languages.",
        "Though we are focusing, in this paper, on the Asian languages, LCTL languages are linguistically and geographically diverse, representing major language families and major geographical regions.",

        "The language pack for Bengali was the first complete language pack we created, and it served as a pilot language pack for the rest of the project.",
        "There were a relatively large number of raw materials and existing lexicons to support our lexicon development, and our language pack included the largest lexicon among the Asian language packs.",
        "Urdu, spoken primarily in Pakistan and part of India, is closely related to Hindi.",
        "Urdu is traditionally written using Perso-Arabic script, and has vocabulary borrowed from Arabic and Persian.",
        "This was a language which had a large amount of available digital resources in comparison with other LCTLs, but did not meet our original expectations for raw digital text.",
        "Thai is a Tai-Kadai language spoken by more than 20 million people, mainly in Thailand.",
        "Thai was another language which was relatively rich in available digital language resources.",
        "The Thai language pack includes the largest amount of monolingual text and found parallel text among the language packs.",
        "For Thai, tokenization, or word segmentation, was probably the most challenging aspect of the resource creation effort.",

        "One of the first tasks in planning for this data creation effort was to define file formats for the monolingual text, parallel text, lexicons and annotation files.",
        "This designing process was led by us and a group of experts selected from the research sites participating in the REFLEX-LCTL program.",
        "The requirements included the following:",
        "• Monolingual and parallel text files should be able to represent sentence segmentation, and",
        "both tokenized and non-tokenized text.",
        "• For parallel text, the text and the target language and the translations in English should be stored in separate aligned files.",
        "• Unique IDs should be assigned to sentences/segments, so that the segment-level mapping in parallel text is clear.",
        "• Annotation files should be in a stand-off format: i.e., annotations should be separate from the source text files.",
        "• Lexicon files should be able to represent at the minimum of word, stem, part-of-speech, gloss and morphological analysis.",
        "• File formats should be XML-based.",
        "• Files should be encoded in UTF-8 (UNICODE).",
        "After several cycles of prototyping and exchanging feedback, we settled on the following original file formats named \"LCTL text format\" (LTF - file name extension: .ltf.xml), LCTL annotation format\" (LAF - file name extension: .laf.xml), and \"LCTL lexicon format\" (LLF - file name extension .llf.xml.",
        "Appendix A shows the DTD for LTF format.",
        "To support evaluation of language technologies based on the data included in the language packs, we designated approximately 10% of our primary data as the evaluation data and the rest as the training data.",
        "Any data that was included as as-is\", (e.g. found parallel text), was included in the training partition.",
        "Giving all language packs a consistent design and structure allows users to navigate the contents with ease.",

        "In creating the language resources included in the LCTL language packs, we developed a variety of software tools designed for humans, including native speaker informants without technical expertise, to provide data needed for the resource creation efforts as efficiently as possible.",
        "In particular, the following tools played crucial roles in the creation of language packs.",
        "In order to facilitate efficient annotation of a variety of tasks and materials, we created a web-based judgment/annotation tool, named the Annotation Collection Kit interface (ACK).",
        "ACK allows a task manager to create annotation kits,\" which consist of question text and predefined list and/or freeform answer categories.",
        "Any UTF-8 text may be specified for questions or answers.",
        "ACK is ideal for remote creation of multiple types of text-based annotation, by allowing individual kits\" to be uploaded onto a specific server URL which any remote user can access.",
        "In fact, using this tool we were able to support native speaker annotators working on part-of-speech (POS) annotation in Thailand.",
        "When annotators make judgments in ACK, they are stored in a relational database.",
        "The results can be downloaded in CSV (comma-separated value) or XML format, so anyone with secure access to the server can easily access the results.",
        "ACK was designed so that anyone with even a basic knowledge of a scripting language such as Perl or Python would be able to create the ACK annotation kits, which are essentially sets of data corresponding to a sets of annotation decisions in the form of radio buttons, check boxes, pull-down menus, or comment fields.",
        "Indeed some of the linguists on the LCTL project created their own ACK kits when needed.",
        "Although they are limited in scope, creative use of ACK kits can yield a great deal of helpful types of annotation.",
        "For example, for POS annotation, the annotators were given monolingual text from our corpus, word by word, in order, and asked to select the correct part of speech for that word in context.",
        "We also used ACK to add/edit glosses and part of speech tags for lexicon entries, to perform morphological tagging, and various other tasks that required judgment from native speakers.",

      "text": [
        "An intermediate step between planning and creation was to identify and contact any available local experts in the targeted languages, and recruit additional native speakers to serve as annotators and language informants.",
        "Annotators were not necessarily linguists or other language experts, but they were native speakers with reading and writing proficiencies who received training as needed from in-house language experts for creating our annotated corpora, and helped to identify and evaluate harvestable online resources.",
        "Intensive recruiting efforts were conducted for native speakers of each language.",
        "Our recruiting strategy utilized such resources as online discussion boards and student associations for those language communities, and we were also able to capitalize on the diversity of the student/staff body at the University of Pennsylvania by recruiting through posted signs on campus.",
        "The first step in creating each language pack was to identify resources that are already available.",
        "To this end we implemented a series of \"Harvest Festivals\"; intensive sessions where our entire team, along with native speaker informants, convened to search the web for available resources.",
        "Available resources were immediately documented on a shared and group editable internal wiki page.",
        "By bringing together native speakers, linguists, programmers, information managers and projects managers in the same room, we were able to minimize communications latency, brainstorm as a group, and quickly build upon each other's efforts.",
        "This approach was generally quite successful, especially for the text corpora and lexicons, and brought us some of our most useful data.",
        "As soon as Raw digital resources were identified, our local intellectual property rights specialist began investigation into their usability for the REFLEX-LCTL language packs.",
        "It was necessary to contact many individual data providers to obtain an agreement, so the process was quite lengthy and in some cases permission was not granted until shortly before the package was scheduled for release to the REFLEX community.",
        "Our general practice was to process all likely candidate data pools and remove data as necessary in later stages, thus ensuring that IPR was not a bottleneck in language pack creation.",
        "The exception to this was for large data sources, where removal would have significantly affected the quantity of data in the deliverable.",
        "The next step was to create the language-specific basic data processing tools, such as encoding converter, sentence segmenter and tokenizer.",
        "The goal for this project was to include whatever encoding converters were needed to convert all of the raw text and lexical resources collected or created into the standard encoding selected for that target language.",
        "Dividing text into individual sentences is a necessary first step for many processes including the human translation that dominated much of our effort.",
        "Simple in principle, LCTL sentence segmentation can prove tantalizingly complex.",
        "Our goal was to produce a sentence segmenter that accepts text in our standard encoding as input and outputs segmented sentences in the same encoding.",
        "Word segmentation, or tokenization, is also challenging for languages such as Thai.",
        "For Thai, our approach was to utilize an existing opensource word segmentation tool, and enhancing it by using a larger word list than the provided one.",
        "We designed the basic format conversion tools, such as the text-to-LTF converter, to be able to just plug in language-specific tokenizers and segmenters.",
        "The monolingual text corpora in the languages packs were primarily created by identifying and harvesting available resources from the Internet, such as news, newsgroups and weblogs in the target language.",
        "Once the IPR expert determined that we can use the resources for the REFLEX-LCTL program, we harvested the document files recent documents as archived documents.",
        "The harvested files were then analyzed and the files that actually have usable contents, such as news articles and weblog postings were kept and converted into the LCTL Text format.",
        "The formatting process was typically done in the following steps: 1) convert the harvested document or article in html or other web format to a plain text format, stripping html tags, advertisements, links and other non-contents; 2) convert the plain text files into UTF-8, 2) verify the contents with native speakers, and if necessary, further remove non-contents, or divide a file into multiple files; 3) convert the plain text files into the LCTL Text format, applying sentence segmentation and tokenization.",
        "Each document file is assigned a unique document ID.",
        "Essential information about the document such as the publication date was kept in the final files.",
        "Each language pack contains at least 250,000 words of parallel text.",
        "Part of this data was found resources harvested from online resources, such as bilingual news web site.",
        "The found parallel documents were converted into the LTF format, and aligned at the sentence level, producing segment-mapping tables between the LTF files in the LCTL language and the LTF files in English.",
        "The rest of this data was created by manually translating documents in the LCTL language into",
        "English, or documents in English into the LCTL language.",
        "A subset of the monolingual text corpus was selected for translation into English.",
        "In addition, about 65,000 words of English source text were selected as the Common English Subset\" for translation into each LCTL language.",
        "Having the same set of parallel documents for all languages will facilitate comparison between any or all of the diverse LCTL languages.",
        "The Common Subset included : newswire text, weblogs, a phrasebook and an elicitation corpus.",
        "The phrasebook contained common phrases used in daily life, such as \"I'm here\", and \"I have to go\".",
        "The elicitation corpus, provided by Carnegie Mellon University (Alvarez et al., 2006), included expressions, such as malejnameA will write a book for female-name A, where malejnameA and fe-malejnameA are common names in the LCTL language.",
        "The set of elicitation expressions is designed to elicit lexical distinctions which differ across languages.",
        "The manual translation tasks were outsourced to translation agencies or independent translators.",
        "Since the translators were instructed to translate text which had already been sentence-segmented, the creation of sentence-level mappings was trivial.",
        "However, we found that it was important to create a sentence-numbered template for the translators to use, otherwise we were likely to receive translations where the source text sentence boundaries were not respected.",
        "Bilingual lexicons are also an important resource that can support a variety of human language technologies, such as machine translation and information extraction.",
        "The goal for this resource was a lexicon of at least 10,000 lemmas with glosses and parts of speech for each language.",
        "For most of the languages, we were able to identify existing lexicons, either digital or printed, to consult with and extract information for a subset of the lexical entries; however, in all cases we needed to process them substantially before they could be used efficiently.",
        "We performed quality checking, normalizing, added parts of speech and glosses, added entries and removed irrelevant entries.",
        "A subset of the target language text in each language pack received up to three types of annotations: part-of-speech tags, morphological analysis, and named entity tags.",
        "Named entity annotations were created for all language packs.",
        "Annotations were created by native speakers using the annotation tools discussed in section 4.",
        "To address the requirement to include some kind of tool for morphological analysis in each language pack, we created either a morphological analyzer implementing handwritten rules or a stemmer using an unsupervised statistical approach, such as the approach described in (Hammarstrom, 2006).",
        "We created a named entity tagger for each language pack using our common development framework for named entity taggers4.3.",
        "The tagger was created using the named entity annotated text we created for the language packs.",
        "Similarly, we created a POS tagger for each language pack using our common development framework for POS taggers (See Section 4.3).",
        "We coordinated the POS tag sets for the taggers and lexicons.",
        "A transliterator that converts the language's native script into Latin script is a desired resource.",
        "For some languages, this is not a straightforward task.",
        "For example, not all vowels are explicitly represented in Bengali script, and there can be multiple pronunciations possible for a given Bengali character.",
        "Names, especially names foreign to the target language exhibit a wide variety of spelling, and in HLTs, make up a large percentage of the out-of-vocabulary terms.",
