        "A subcategorization frame is a statement of what types of syntactic arguments a verb (or an adjective) takes, such as objects, infinitives, that-clauses, participial clauses, and subcategorized prepositional phrases (Manning,1993).",
        "The verb phrase in a sentence usually takes various types of subcategorization frames compared to phrases of other types and hence the acquisition of such frames for verbs are really challenging.",
        "A subcategorization dictionary obtained automatically from corpora can be updated quickly and easily as different usages develop.",
        "Several large, manually developed subcategorization lexicons are available for English, e.g. the COMLEX Syntax (Macleod et al., 1994), AC-QUILEX (Copestake, 1992) and the ANLT (Briscoe et al., 1987) dictionaries.",
        "VerbNet (VN) (Kipper-Schuler, 2005) is the largest online verb lexicon with explicitly stated syntactic and semantic information based on Levin's verb classification (Levin, 1993).",
        "It is a hierarchical domain-independent, broad-coverage verb lexicon with mappings to other lexical resources such as WordNet (Miller, 1990), XTAG (XTAG Research Group, 2001) and FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998).",
        "But, there is no existing subcategorization lexicon available for Bengali language.",
        "The sub-categorization of verbs is an essential issue in parsing for the free phrase order languages such as Bengali.",
        "As there is no such existing parser available in Bengali, the acquisition as well as evaluation of the acquired subcategorization frames are difficult but crucial tasks.",
        "The main difference between English and Bengali sentence is the variation in the ordering of various phrases.",
        "The pivotal hypothesis here is that the subcategorization frames obtained for a Bengali verb are same with the subcategorization frames that may be acquired for its equivalent verb with an identical sense tag in English.",
        "The present work deals with the acquisition of verb subcategorization frames of a verb kara (do) from a Bengali newspaper corpus.",
        "This verb generates various types of compound verbs in combination with other preceding noun phrases in Bengali.",
        "The sentences containing these types of compound verb entries have been retrieved from the Bengali corpus.",
        "The Bengali verb sub-categorization frame acquisition task has been carried out for the ten most frequent compound verbs that contain kara (do) as a component.",
        "The number of occurrences of other compound verbs is negligible in the corpus.",
        "So, for evaluation purpose, we have not considered those verbs.",
        "Each of the ten Bengali compound verbs has been searched in the Bengali-English bilingual lexicon and the equivalent English verb meanings with its synonyms have been identified and retrieved.",
        "All possible subcategorization frames for each of the English synonyms of the Bengali verb have been acquired from the English VerbNet.",
        "These frames have been mapped to the Bengali sentences that contain the compound verb.",
        "Evaluation results with a test set of 100 sentences show the effectiveness of the model with precision, recall and F-Measure values of 77.11%, 88.23% and 79.24% respectively.",
        "There are some frames that have not been identified due to their absence in the corpus.",
        "Linguists have suggested that these frames do appear in Bengali and hence can be acquired.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 gives the description of the related works carried out in this area.",
        "Section 3 describes the framework for the acquisition of sub-categorization frames for ten compound Bengali verbs.",
        "Evaluation results of the system are discussed in section 4.",
