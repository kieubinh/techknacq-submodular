        "Among these errors, 7.2% involved rarely used character, and 98.4% were assigned common classifications of their causes by human subjects.",
        "In particular, 80% of the errors observed in the writings of middle school students were related to the pronunciations and 30% were related to the logographs of the words.",
        "We conducted experiments that shed light on using the Web-based statistics to correct the errors, and we designed a software environment for preparing test items whose authors intentionally replace correct characters with wrong ones.",
        "Experimental results show that using Web-based statistics can help us correct only about 75% of these errors.",
        "In contrast, Web-based statistics are useful for recommending incorrect characters for composing test items for \"incorrect character identification\" tests about 93% of the time."

        "Incorrect writings in Chinese are related to our understanding of the cognitive process of reading Chinese (e.g., Leck et al., 1995), to our understanding of why people produce incorrect characters and our offering corresponding remedies (e.g., Law et al., 2005), and to building an environment for assisting the preparation of test items for assessing students' knowledge of Chinese characters (e.g., Liu and Lin, 2008).",
        "Chinese characters are composed of smaller parts that can carry phonological and/or semantic information.",

        "The left (i) and the right (&) part of J$L, respectively, carry semantic and phonological information.",
        "The semantic information, in turn, is often related to the logographs that form the Chinese characters.",
        "Evidences show that production of incorrect characters are related to phonological, logographic, or the semantic aspect of the characters.",
        "Although the logographs of Chinese characters can be related to the lexical semantics, not all errors that are related to semantics were caused by the similarity in logographs.",
        "Some were due to the context of the words and/or permissible interpretations of different words.",
        "In this study, we investigate issues that are related to the phonological and logographical influences on the occurrences of incorrect characters in Chinese words.",
        "In Section 2, we present the details about the sources of the reported errors.",
        "We have collected errors from a published book and from a group of middle school students.",
        "In Section 3, we analyze the causes of the observed errors.",
        "Native speakers of Chinese were asked to label whether the observed errors were related to the phonological or the logographic reasons.",
        "In Section 4, we explore the effectiveness of relying on Web-based statistics to correct the errors.",
        "We submitted an incorrect word and a correct word separately to Google to find the number of web pages that contained these words.",
        "The correct and incorrect words differed in just the incorrect character.",
        "We examine whether the number of web pages that contained the words can help us find the correct way of writing.",

        "Experimental results showed that our method outperformed the one reported in (Liu and Lin, 2008), and captured the incorrect characters better than 93% of the time."

        "Two human subjects, who are native speakers of Chinese and are graduate students in Computer Science, examined Elist and Jlist and categorized the causes of errors.",
        "They compared the incorrect characters with the correct characters to determine whether the errors were pronunciation-related or logographs-related.",
        "Referring to an error as being \"semantics-related\" is ambiguous.",
        "Two characters might not contain the same semantic part, but are still semantically related, e.g., misusing 'Mft\"(tou1) for 'W(tou2) in",
        "In this study, we have not considered this factor.",
        "For this reason we refer to the errors that are related to the sharing of logographic parts in characters as composition-related.",
        "Among the 1490 and 1718 words in Elist and Jlist, respectively, the two human subjects had consensus over causes of 1441 and 1583 errors.",
        "It is interesting to learn that native speakers had a high consensus about the causes for the observed errors, but they did not always agree.",
        "To have a common standard in comparison, we studied the errors that the two subjects had agreed categorizations.",
        "The statistics changed when we disregarded errors that involved characters not included in Clist.",
        "An error would be ignored if either the correct or the incorrect character did not belong to the Clist.",
        "It is possible for students to write such rarely used characters in an incorrect word just by coincidence.",
        "After ignoring the rare characters, there were 1333 and 1645 words in Elist and Jlist, respectively.",
        "The subjects had consensus over the causes of errors for 1285 and 1515 errors in Elist and Jlist, respectively.",
        "Table 1 shows the percentages of five categories of errors: C for the composition-related errors, P for the pronunciation-related errors, C&P for the intersection of C and P, NE for those errors that belonged to neither C nor P, and D for those errors that the subjects disagreed on the error categories.",
        "There were, respectively, 505 composition-related and 1314 pronunciation-related errors in Jlist, so we see 505/1645=30.70% and 1314/1645=79.88% in the table.",
        "Notice that C&P represents the intersection of C and P, so we have to deduct C&P from the sum of C, P, NE, and D to find the total probability, namely 1.",
        "It is worthwhile to discuss the implication of the statistics in Table 1.",
        "For the Jlist, similarity between pronunciations accounted for nearly 80% of the errors, and the ratio for the errors that are related to compositions and pronunciations is 1:2.6.",
        "In contrast, for the Elist, the corresponding ratio is almost 1:1.",
        "The Jlist and Elist differed significantly in the ratios of the error types.",
        "It was assumed that the dominance of pronunciation-related errors in electronic documents was Table 1.",
        "Error analysis for Elist and Jlist a result of the popularity of entering Chinese with pronunciation-based methods.",
        "The ratio for the Jlist challenges this popular belief, and indicates that even though the errors occurred during a writing process, rather than typing on computers, students still produced more pronunciation-related errors than composition-related errors.",
        "Distribution over error types is not as related to input method as one may have believed.",
        "Nevertheless, the observation might still be a result of students being so used to entering Chinese text with pronunciation-based method that the organization of their mental lexicons is also pronunciation related.",

        "The second strategy (SC2) gave the same score to any shared component even if the component did not reside at the same location in the characters.",
        "The characters \"SI\", \"Si\", and \"#\" share the same component \"J\".",
        "When computing the similarity between these characters with SC1, the contribution of \"JL\" will be the same for any pair.",
        "When computing with SC2, the contribution of \" JL\" will be larger for the pair \"S\" and \"SS\" than for the pair \"#\" and \"SS\".",
        "In the former case, \" JL\" appears at the same location in the characters.",
        "When there were more than 20 characters that receive nonzero scores in the SC1 and SC2 categories, we chose to select at most 20 characters that had leading scores as the list of recommended characters.",
        "We had to set a bound on the number of candidate characters, i.e., 20, for strategies SC1 and SC2.",
        "The number of candidates generated from these two strategies can be large and artificial, depending on our scoring functions for determining similarities between characters.",
        "We did not limit the sizes of candidate lists that were generated by other strategies because those lists were created based on more objective methods.",
        "The rules for determining \"similar\" sounds were given by the domain experts, so we considered the rules objective in this research.",
        "For the experiments that we reported in the following subsection, we submitted more than 300 thousand of queries to Google.",
        "As we mentioned in Section 4.1, a frequent continual submission of queries to Google will make Google treat our programs as malicious processes.",
        "(We are studying the Google API for a more civilized solution.)",
        "Without the bound, it is possible to offer a very long list of candidates.",
        "On the other hand, it is also possible that our program does not find any visually similar characters for some special characters, and this is considered a possible phenomenon.",
        "We examined the usefulness of these seven categories of candidates with errors in Elist and Jlist.",
        "The first set of evaluation (the inclusion tests) checked whether the lists of recommended characters contained the incorrect character in our records.",
        "The second set of evaluation (the ranking tests) was designed for practical application in computer assisted item generation.",
        "Only for those words whose actual incorrect characters were included in the recommended list, we replaced the correct characters in the words with the candidate incorrect characters, submitted the incorrect words to Google, and ordered the candidate characters based on their NOPs.",
        "We then recorded the ranks of the incorrect characters among all recommended characters.",
        "Since the same character may appear simultaneously in SC1, SC2, and RS, we computed the union of these three sets, and checked whether the incorrect characters were in the union.",
        "The inclusion rate is listed under Comp, representing the inclusion rate when we consider only logographic influences.",
        "Similarly, we computed the union for SSST, SSDT, MSST, and MSDT, checked whether the incorrect characters were in the union, and recorded the inclusion rate under Pom, representing the inclusion rate when we consider only phonological influences.",
        "Finally, we computed the union of the lists created by the seven strategies, and recorded the inclusion rate under Both.",
        "The second and the third rows of Table 3 show the results of the inclusion tests when we recommended candidate characters with the methods indicated in the column headings.",
        "The data show the percentage of the incorrect characters being included in the lists that Table 3.",
        "Incorrect characters were contained and ranked high in the recommended lists were recommended by the seven strategies.",
        "Notice that the percentages were calculated with different denominators.",
        "The number of composition-related errors was used for SC1, SC2, RS, and Comp (e.g., 505 that we mentioned in Section 3 for Jlist); the number of pronunciation-related errors for SSST, SSDT, MSST, MSDT, and Pron (e.g., 1314 mentioned in Section 3 for the Jlist); the number of either of these two types of errors for Both (e.g., 1475 for Jlist).",
        "The results recorded in Table 3 show that we were able to find the incorrect character quite effectively, achieving better than 93% for both Elist and Jlist.",
        "The statistics also show that it is easier to find incorrect characters that were used for pronunciation-related problems.",
        "Most of the pronunciation-related problems were misuses of homophones.",
        "Unexpected confusions, e.g., those related to pronunciations in Chinese dialects, were the main reason for the failure to capture the pronunciation-related errors.",
        "(Namely, few pronunciation-related errors were not considered in the information that the psycholinguist provided.)",
        "SSDT is a crucial complement to SSST.",
        "There is still room to improve our methods to find confusing characters based on their compositions.",
        "We inspected the list generated by SC1 and SC2, and found that, although SC2 outperformed SC1 on the inclusion rate, SC1 and SC2 actually generated complementary lists in many cases, and should be used together.",
        "The inclusion rate achieved by the RS strategy was surprisingly high.",
        "We found that many of the errors that were captured by the RS strategy were also captured by the SSST strategy.",
        "The fourth and the fifth rows of Table 3 show the effectiveness of relying on Google to rank the candidate characters for recommending an incorrect character.",
        "The rows show the average ranks of the included cases.",
        "The statistics show that, with the help of Google, we were able to put the incorrect character on top of the recommended list when the incorrect character was included.",
        "This allows us to build an environment for assisting human teachers to efficiently prepare test items for incorrect character identification.",
        "Note that we did not provide data for all columns in the fourth and the firth rows.",
        "Unlike that we show the inclusion rates in the second and the third rows, the fourth and the fifth rows show how the actual incorrect characters were ranked in the recommended lists.",
        "Hence, we need to have a policy to order the characters of different lists to find the ranks of the incorrect characters in the integrated list.",
        "However, integrating the lists is not necessary and can be considered confusing to the teachers.",
        "The selection of incorrect characters from different lists is related to the goals of the assessment, and it is better to leave the lists separated for the teachers to choose.",
        "The same phenomenon and explanation apply to the sixth and the seventh rows as well.",
        "The sixth and the seventh rows show the average numbers of candidate characters proposed by different methods.",
        "Statistics shown between the second and the fifth rows are related to the recall rates (cf. Manning and Schütz, 1999) achieved by our system.",
        "For these four rows, we calculated how well the recommended lists contained the reported errors and how the actual incorrect characters ranked in the recommended lists.",
        "The sixth and the seventh rows showed the costs for these achievements, measured by the number of recommended characters.",
        "The sum of the sixth and the seventh rows, i.e., 103.59 and 108.75, are, respectively, the average numbers of candidate characters that our system recommended as possible errors recorded in Elist and Jlist.",
        "(Note that some of these characters were repeated.)",
        "There are two ways to interpret the statistics shown in the sixth and the seventh rows.",
        "Comparing the corresponding numbers on the fourth and the sixth rows, e.g., 3.25 and 19.27, show the effectiveness of using the NOPs to rank the candidate characters.",
        "The ranks of the actual errors were placed at very high places, considering the number of the originally recommended lists.",
        "The other way to use the statistics in the sixth and the seventh rows is to compute the average precision.",
        "For instance, we recommended an average 19.13 characters in SSST to achieve the 91.64 inclusion rate.",
        "The recall rate is very high, but the averaged precision is very low.",
        "This, however, is not a very convincing interpretation of the results.",
        "Having assumed that there was only one best candidate as in our experiments, it was hard to achieve high precision rates.",
        "The recall rates are more important than the precision rates, particularly when we have proved that the actual errors were ranked among the top five alternatives.",
        "When designing a system for assisting the authoring of test items, it is not really necessary to propose all of the characters in the categories.",
        "In the reported experiments, choosing the top 5 or top 10 candidates will contain the most of the actual incorrect characters based on the statistics shown in the fourth and the fifth rows.",
        "Hence the precision rates can be significantly increased practically.",
        "We do not have to merge the candidate characters among different categories because choosing the categories of incorrect characters depends on the purpose of the assessment.",
        "Reducing the length of the candidate list increases the chances of reducing the recall rates.",
        "Achieving the best trade off between precision and recall rates relies on a more complete set of experiments that involve human subjects.",

        "Hence, the precision rates are likely to increase and become less disconcerting.",

        "Because the lists might contain the same characters, the sum of the rows showed just the maximum number of queries that we submitted.",
        "Nevertheless, they still served as good estimations, and we actually submitted 103.59x1441(=149273) and 108.75x1583 (=172151) queries to Google for Elist and Jlist in experiments from which we obtained the data shown in the fourth and the fifth rows.",
        "These quantities explained why we had to be cautious about how we submitted queries to Google.",
        "When we run our program for just a limited number of characters, the problems caused by intensive queries should not be very serious.",
        "Dividing characters into subareas proved to be crucial in our experiments (Liu and Lin, 2008; Liu et al., 2009), but this strategy is not perfect, and could not solve all of the problems.",
        "The way we divided Chinese characters into subareas like (Juang et al., 2005; Liu and Lin, 2008) sometimes contributed to the failure of our current implementation to capture all of the errors that were related to the composition of the words.",
        "The most eminent reason is that how we divide characters into areas.",
        "Liu and Lin (2008) followed the division of Cangjie (Chu, 2009), and Juang et al.",
        "(2005) proposed an addition way to split the characters.",
        "The best divisions of characters appear to depend on the purpose of the applications.",
        "Recall that each part of the character is represented by a string of Cangjie codes in ECCs.",
        "The separation of Cangjie codes in ECCs was instrumental to find the similarity of \"a\" and \";fl\" because \"s\" is a standalone subpart in both \"a\" and \";fl\".",
        "The Cangjie system has a set of special rules to divide Chinese characters (Chu, 2009; Lee, 2008).",
        "Take \"S>J\" and for example.",
        "The component \" g \" is recorded as an standalone part in \"S>J\", but is divided into two parts in \";fl\".",
        "Hence, \" g\" is stored as one string, \" – as\", in \"S>J\" and as two strings, \" – a\" and \"s\", in \";fl\".",
        "The different ways of saving \" g \" in two different words made it harder to find the similarity between \"S>J\" and \";fl\".",
        "An operation of concatenation is in need, but the problems are that it is not obvious to tell when the concatenation operations are useful and which of the parts should be rejoined.",
        "Hence, using the current methods to divide Chinese characters, it is easy to find the similar between \"a\" and \";fl\" but difficult to find the similar between \"S>J\" and \";fl\".",
        "In contrast, if we enforce a rule to save \"g \" as one string of Cang-jie code, it will turn the situations around.",
        "Determining the similarity between \"a\" and \";fl\" will be more difficult than finding the similarity between \"S>J\" and",
        "Due to this observation, we have come to believe that it is better to save the Chinese characters with more detailed ECCs.",
        "By saving all detailed information about a character, our system can offer candidate characters based on users' preferences which can be provided via a good user interface.",
        "This flexibility can be very helpful when we are preparing text materials for experiments for psycholinguistics or cognitive sciences (e.g., Leck et al., 1995; Yeh and Li, 2002)."
