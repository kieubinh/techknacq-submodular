        "It is not only an important resource in implementing NLP applications in each language, but also in interlinking WordNets of different languages to develop multilingual applications to overcome the language barrier.",
        "There are some efforts in developing WordNets of some languages (Atserias and et al., 1997; Vossen, 1997; Farrers and et al., 1998; Balkova and et al., 2004; Isahara and et al., 2008).",

        "Different approaches and methods have been applied in constructing WordNet of many languages according to the existing lexical resources.",
        "This section describes how Thai WordNet is constructed either approach or method.",
        "To build language WordNet from scratch, two approaches were brought up into the discussion: the merge approach and the expand approach.",
        "The merge approach is to build the taxonomies of the language; synsets and relations, and then map to the PWN by using the English equivalent words from existing bilingual dictionaries.",
        "The expand approach is to map or translate local words directly to the PWN's synsets by using the existing bilingual dictionaries.",
        "Employing the merge approach, for Thai as an example, we will completely get synsets and relations for the Thai language.",
        "But it is time and budget consuming task and require a lot of skilled lexicographers as well, while less time and budget is used when employing the expand approach to get a translated version of WordNet.",
        "But some particular Thai concepts which do not occur in PWN will not exist in this lexicon.",
        "Comparing between these two approaches, the Thai WordNet construction intended to follow the expand approach by this following reasons;",
        "• Many languages have developed their own WordNet using the PWN as a model, so we can link Thai lexical database to those languages.",
        "• The interface for collaboration for other languages can be easily developed.",
        "As presented above, we follow the expand approach to construct the Thai WordNet by translating the synsets in the PWN to the Thai language.",
        "Both automatic and manual methods are applied in the process.",
        "Following the objective to translate the PWN to Thai, we attempted to use the existing lexical resources to facilitate the construction.",
        "We proposed an automatic method to assign an appropriate synset to a lexical entry by considering its English equivalent and lexical synonyms which are most commonly encoded in a bilingual dictionary.",
        "(Charoenporn 2008; Sornlertlamvanich, 2008).",

        "For the result, there is only 12% of the total number of the synsets that were able to be assigned to Thai lexical entries.",

        "Table 1 shows the successful rate in assigning synsets to the lexical entry in the Thai-English Dictionary.",
        "Considering the list of unmapped lexical entry, the errors can be classified into three groups, as the following.",
        "1.",
        "The English equivalent is assigned in a compound, especially in case that there is no an appropriate translation to represent exactly the same sense.",
        "For example,",
        "L: fiwhiJiin raan3-khaa3-pleek1 E: retail shop",
        "2.",
        "Some particular words culturally used I one language may not be simply translated into one single word sense in English.",

        "As for the second issue, considering between (1) synset-to-synset equivalent assignment or (2) word-to-word equivalent assignment has to be discussed.",

        "These words have the same concepts but are different in usage.",
        "How do we choose the right Thai word for the right equivalent English word?",
        "It is a crucial problem.",
        "In the paragraph below, three English words which represent the concept \"dog\" are used in the different context and cannot be interchanged.",

        "In some cases, the level of the concept relation between English and Thai is not equal.",
        "For example, {hair} in the PWN represents a concept of \"a covering for the body (or parts of it) consisting of a dense growth of threadlike structures (as on the human head); helps to prevent heat loss; ...\" but in Thai, it is divided into two concepts;",
        "T1 to khon4 'hair'",
