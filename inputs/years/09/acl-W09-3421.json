        "During the last two decades corpus-based approaches have come to the forefront of NLP research.",
        "Since without corpora there can be no corpus-based research, the creation of such language resources has also necessarily advanced as well, in a mutually beneficial synergetic relationship.",
        "One of the advantages of corpus-based approaches is that the techniques used are less language specific than classical rule-based approaches where a human analyses the behaviour of target languages and constructs rules manually.",
        "This naturally led the way for international resource standardisation, and indeed there is a long standing precedent in the West for it.",
        "The Human Language Technology (HLT) society in Europe has been particularly zealous in this regard, propelling the creation of resource interoperability through a series of initiatives, namely EAGLES (Sanfilippo et al., 1999), PAROLE/SIMPLE (Lenci et al., 2000), ISLE/MILE (Ide et al., 2003), and LIRICS .These continuous efforts have matured into activities in ISO-TC37/SC4, which aims at making an international standard for language resources.",
        "However, due to the great diversity of languages themselves and the differing degree of technological development for each, Asian languages, have received less attention for creating resources than their Western counterparts.",
        "Thus, it has yet to be determined if corpus-based techniques developed for well-computerised languages are applicable on a broader scale to all languages.",
        "In order to efficiently develop Asian language resources, utilising an international standard in this creation has substantial merits.",
        "We launched a three-year project to create an international standard for language resources that includes Asian languages.",
        "We took the following approach in seeking this goal.",
        "• Based on existing description frameworks, each research member tries to describe several lexical entries and find problems with them.",
        "• Through periodical meetings, we exchange information about problems found and generalise them to propose solutions.",
        "• Through an implementation of an application system, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",
        "Below we summarise our significant contribution to an International Standard (ISO24613; Lexical Markup Framework: LMF).",
        "1st year After considering many characteristics of Asian languages, we elucidated the shortcomings of the LMF draft (ISO24613 Rev.9).",
        "The draft lacks the following devices for Asian languages.",
        "(1) A mapping mechanism between syntactic and semantic arguments (2) Derivation (including reduplication) (3) Classifiers (4) Orthography (5) Honorifics",
        "Among these, we proposed solutions for (1) and (2) to the ISO-TC37 SC4 working group.",
        "2nd year We proposed solutions for above the (2), (3) and (4) in the comments of the Committee Draft (ISO24613 Rev.",

        "problem of classifiers (4') representational issues with the richness of writing systems in Asian languages 3rd year Since ISO 24613 was in the FDIS stage and fairly stable, we built sample lexicons in Chinese, English, Italian, Japanese, and Thai based on ISO24613.",
        "At the same time, we implemented a query expansion system utilising rich linguistic resources including lexicons described in the ISO 24613 framework.",
        "We confirmed that a system was feasible which worked on the tested languages (including both Western and Asian languages) when given lexicons compliant with the framework.",
        "ISO 24613 (LMF) was approved by the October 2008 ballot and published as ISO-24613:2008 on 17th November 2008.",
        "Since we have already reported our first 2 year activities elsewhere (Tokunaga and others, 2006; Tokunaga and others, 2008), we focus on the above query expansion system in this paper."

        "Conventional query expansion techniques expand this keyword to a set of related words by using thesauri or ontologies (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999).",
        "Using the framework proposed by this project, expanding the user's query becomes a matter of following links within the lexicon, from the source lexical entry or entries through predicate-argument structures to all relevant entries (Figure 1).",
        "We focus on expanding the user inputted list of nouns to relevant verbs, but the reverse would also be possible using the same technique and the same lexicon.",
        "This link between entries is established through the semantic type of a given sense within a lexical entry.",
        "These semantic types are defined by higher-level ontologies, such as MILO or SIMPLE (Lenci et al., 2000) and are used in semantic predicates that take such semantic types as a restriction argument.",
        "Since senses for verbs contain a link to a semantic predicate, using this semantic type, the system can then find any/all entries within the lexicon that have this semantic type as the value of the restriction feature of a semantic predicate for any of their senses.",
        "As a concrete example, let us continue using the \"ticket\" scenario from above.",
        "The lexical entry for \"ticket\" might contain a semantic type definition something like in Figure 2.",
        "By referring to the lexicon, we can then derive any actions and events that take the semantic type \"ARTIFACT\" as an argument.",

        "The system was developed in Java for its \"compile once, run anywhere\" portability and its high-availability of reusable off-the-shelf components.",
        "On top of Java 5, the system was developed using JBoss Application Server 4.2.3, the latest standard, stable version of the product at the time of development.",
        "To provide fast access times, and easy traversal of relational data, a RDB was used.",
        "The most popular free open-source database was selected, MySQL, to store all lexicons imported into the system, and the system was accessed, as a web-application, via any web browser.",
        "The finalised database schema is shown in Figure 4.",
        "It describes the relationships between entities, and more or less mirrors the classes found within the adapted LMF framework, with mostly only minor exceptions where it was efficacious for querying the data.",
        "Due to space constraints, metadata fields, such as creation timestamps have been left out of this diagram.",
        "Since the system also allows for multiple lexicons to co-exist, a lexicon Jd resides in every table.",
        "This foreign key has been highlighted in a different color, but not connected via arrows to make the diagram easier to read.",
        "In addition, though in actuality this foreign key is not required for all tables, it has been inserted as a convenience for querying data more efficiently, even within join tables (indicated in blue).",
        "Having multiple lexical resources coexisting within the same database allows for several advantageous features, and will be described later.",
        "Some tables also contain a textJd, which stores the original id attribute for that element found within the XML.",
        "This is not used in the system itself, and is stored only for reference.",
        "As mentioned above, the application is deployed to JBoss AS as an ear-file.",

        "There are three main sections to the application: Search, Browse, and Configure.",
        "Explaining last to first, the Configure section, shown in Figure 5, allows users to create a new lexicon within the system or append to an existing lexicon by uploading a LMF XML file from their web browser, or delete existing lexicons that are no longer needed/used.",
        "After import, the data may be immediately queried upon with no other changes to system configuration, from within both the Browse and Search sections.",
        "Regardless of language, the rich syntactic/semantic information contained within the lexicon is sufficient for carrying out query expansion on its own.",

        "(11) You can make change at some stores, just buy a newspaper or something.",
        "From this example it is apparent that this sort of query expansion is still too naive to apply to real IR systems.",

        "LMF is, admittedly, a \"high-level\" specification, that is, an abstract model that needs to be further developed, adapted and specified by the lexicon encoder.",
        "LMF does not provide any off-the-shelf representation for a lexical resource; instead, it gives the basic structural components of a lexicon, leaving full freedom for modeling the particular features of a lexical resource.",
        "One drawback is that LMF provides only a specification manual with a few examples.",
        "Specifications are by no means instructions, exactly as XML specifications are by no means instructions on how to represent a particular type of data.",
        "Going from LMF specifications to a true instantiation of an LMF-compliant lexicon is a long way, and comprehensive, illustrative and detailed examples for doing this are needed.",
        "Our prototype system provides a good starting example for this direction.",
        "LMF is often taken as a prescriptive description, and its examples taken as predefined normative examples to be used as coding guidelines.",
        "Controlled and careful examples of conversion to LMF-compliant formats are also needed to avoid too subjective an interpretation of the standard.",
        "We believe that LMF will be a major base for various SemanticWeb applications because it provides interoperability across languages and directly contributes to the applications themselves, such as multilingual translation, machine aided translation and terminology access in different languages.",
        "From the viewpoint of LMF, our prototype demonstrates the adaptability of LMF to a representation of real-scale lexicons, thus promoting its adoption to a wider community.",
        "This project is one of the first test-beds for LMF (as one of its drawbacks being that it has not been tested on a wide variety of lexicons), particularly relevant since it is related to both Western and Asian language lexicons.",
        "This project is a concrete attempt to specify an LMF-compliant XML format, tested for representative and parsing efficiency, and to provide guidelines for the implementation of an LMF-compliant format, thus contributing to the reduction of subjectivity in interpretation of standards.",
        "From our viewpoint, LMF has provided a format for exchange of information across differently conceived lexicons.",
        "Thus LMF provides a standardised format for relating them to other lexical models, in a linguistically controlled way.",
        "This seems an important and promising achievement in order to move the sector forward.",
        "6Conclusion",
        "This paper described the results of a three-year project for creating an international standard for language resources in cooperation with other initiatives.",
        "In particular, we focused on query expansion using the standard.",
        "Our main contribution can be summarised as follows.",
        "• We have contributed to ISO TC37/SC4 activities, by testing and ensuring the portability and applicability of LMF to the development of a description framework for NLP lexicons for Asian languages.",
        "Our contribution includes (1) a package for derivational",
        "morphology, (2) the syntax-semantic interface with the problem of classifiers, and (3) representational issues with the richness of writing systems in Asian languages.",
        "As of October 2008, LMF including our contributions has been approved as the international standard ISO 26413.",
        "• We discussed Data Categories necessary for Asian languages, and exemplified several Data Categories including reduplication, classifier, honorifics and orthography.",
        "We will continue to harmonise our activity with that of ISO TC37/SC4 TDG2 with respect to Data Categories.",
        "• We designed and implemented an evaluation platform of our description framework.",
        "We focused on linguistically motivated query expansion module.",
        "The system works with lexicons compliant with LMF and ontologies.",
        "Its most significant feature is that the system can deal with any language as far as the those lexicons are described according to LMF.",
        "To our knowledge, this is the first working system adopting LMF.",
        "In this project, we mainly worked on three Asian languages, Chinese, Japanese and Thai, on top of the existing framework which was designed mainly for European languages.",
        "We plan to distribute our results to HLT societies of other Asian languages, requesting for their feedback through various networks, such as the Asian language resource committee network under Asian Federation of Natural Language Processing (AFNLP),and the Asian Language Resource Network project.",
