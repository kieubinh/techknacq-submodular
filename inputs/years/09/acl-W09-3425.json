        "Even though the results don't seem much higher than those obtained by JVnSegmenter, given the fact that JVnSegmenter used a manual trained corpus, our result is worth encouragements.",

        "The results so far have shown that this approach has the following benefits:",
        "• From a practical and performance perspective, this approach does not require extended manual effort in building a corpus.",
        "The learning from the training engine, running continuously, discovers new OOV words and feeds them into a normal word segmentation process where it supplies solutions to requesters efficiently.",
        "• The approach discovers new OOV words and disambiguates words.",
        "Additionally, we discovered new proper nouns which are not a part of any dictionaries continuously.",
        "We integrated the finding knowledge from the Vietnamese Wikipedia into our OOV words confirmation process automatically.",
        "This makes the validation of new words much easier as suppose to rely on word adjudicators manually as per O'Neil (2007).",
        "And last, the evaluation result is a better edge when comparing to a popular Vietnamese segmentation tool in all the metrics considered.",
        "This tool has a corpus trained manually.",
        "• Frequently found OOV words identified by our process which are not available in the Vietnamese Wikipedia can be suggested to Wiki authors' communities to create content and make them available for the worldwide audiences for their benefit.",
        "For future works, we would like to look into the possibility of applying grammatical rules in conjunction with our current statistical based system to obtain a higher identification rate.",
        "Spelling suggestion and cross-lingual search are other interesting aspects, as now words can be identified along with their lexical statistics.",
