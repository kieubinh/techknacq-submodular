        "Word form is a form that a lexeme takes when used in a sentence.",

        "Such language-specific word units will be described in section 3.",
        "Principles for word segmentation will set the criteria to validate each word unit, to recognize its internal structure and non-lexical word unit, to be a candidate of lexicon, and other consistency to be necessitated by practical applications for any text in any language.",
        "The meta model of word segmentation will be explained in the processing point of view, and then their principles of word units in the following subsections.",
        "A word unit has a practical unit that will be later used for syntactic processing.",
        "While the word segmentation is a process to identify the longest word unit and its internal structure such that the word unit is not the object to interfere any syntactic operation, \"chunking\" is to identify the constituents but does not specify their internal structure.",
        "Syntactic constituent has a syntactic role, but the word unit is a subset of syntactic constituent.",
        "For example, \"blue sky\" could be a syntactic constituent but not a word unit.",
        "Figure 2 shows the meta model of word segmentation.",
        "[ISO CD 24614-1]",
        "Principles for validating a word unit can be explained by two perspectives: one is linguistic one and the other is processing-oriented practical perspective.",
        "In ISO 24614-1, principles from a linguistic perspective, there are five principles: principles of (1) bound morpheme, (2) lexical integrity, (3) unpredictability, (4) idiomatization, and (5) un-productivity.",
        "First, bound morpheme is something like \"in\" of \" inefficient\".",
        "The principle of bound morpheme says that each bound morpheme plus word will make another word.",
        "Second, principle of lexical integrity means that any syntactic processing cannot refer the internal structure of word (or word unit).",
        "From the principle, we can say that the longest word unit is the maximal meaningful unit before syntactic processing.",
        "Third, another criterion to recognize a word is the principle of unpredictability.",
        "If we cannot infer the real fact from the word, we consider it as a word unit.",
        "For example, we cannot image what is the colour of blackboard because some is green, not black.",
        "[ISO 24614-1] The fourth principle is that the idiom should be one word, which could be a subsidiary principle that follows the principle of unpredictability.",
        "In the last principle, unproductivity is a stronger definition of word; there is no pattern to be copied to generate another word from this word formation.",
        "For example, in \"SIS\" (white vegetable) in Chinese, there is no other coloured vegetable like \" blue vegetable.\"",
        "Another set of principles is derived from the practical perspective.",
        "There are four principles: frequency, Gestalt, prototype and language economy.",
        "Two principles of frequency and language economy are to recognize the frequent occurrence in corpora.",
        "Gestalt and prototype principles are the terms in cognitive science about what are in our mental lexicon, and what are perceivable words.",
        "Principle of language economy is to say about very practical processing efficiency: \"if the inclusion of a word (unit) candidate into the lexicon can decrease the difficulty of linguistic analysis for it, then it is likely to be a word",
        "Gestalt principle is to perceive as a whole.",
        "\"It supports some perceivable phrasal compounds into the lexicon even though they seem to be free combinations of their perceivable constituent parts,\" [ISO/CD 24614-1] where the phrasal compound is frequently used linguistic unit and its meaning is predictable from its constituent elements.",
        "Similarly, principle of prototype provides a rationale for including some phrasal compounds into lexicon, and phrasal compounds serve as prototypes in a productive word formation pattern, like \"apple pie\" with the pattern \"fruit + pie\" into the lexicon.",
        "As a result of word segmentation of sentence, we will get word units.",
        "These principles will describe the internal structure of word unit.",
        "They have four principles: granularity, scope maximization of affixations, scope maximization of compounding, and segmentation for other strings.",
        "In the principle of granularity, a word unit has its internal structure, if necessary for various application of word segmentation.",
        "Principles of scope maximization of affixations and compounding are to recognize the longest word unit as one word unit even if it is composed of stem + affixes or compound of word units.",
        "For example, \"unhappy\" or \"happy\" is one word unit respectively.",
        "\"Next generation Internet\" is one word unit.",

        "Its English literal translation is \"white vegetable and pig meat\", where \"white vegetable\" is an unproductive word pattern and forms one word unit without component word units, and \"pig meat\" in Chinese means one English word \"pork\".",
        "So \"pig meat\" (^^) is the longest word unit in this case.",
        "But in Japanese and Korean, \"pig meat\" in Chinese characters cannot be two word units, because each component character is not used independently.",
