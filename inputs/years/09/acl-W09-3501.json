        "Names play a significant role in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval (IR) systems.",
        "They have a critical role in Cross Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) and Machine Translation (MT) systems as the sys-terns' performances are shown to positively correlate with the correct conversion of names between the languages in several studies (Demner-Fushman and Oard, 2002; Mandl and Womser-Hacker, 2005; Hermjakob et al., 2008; Udupa et al., 2009).",
        "The traditional source for name equivalence, the bilingual dictionaries – whether handcrafted or statistical – offer only limited support as they do not have sufficient coverage of names.",
        "New names are introduced to the vocabulary of a language every day.",
        "All of the above point to the critical need for robust Machine Transliteration technology and systems.",
        "This has attracted attention from the research community.",
        "Over the last decade scores of papers on Machine Transliteration have appeared in the top Computational Linguistics, Information Retrieval and Data Management conferences, exploring diverse algorithmic approaches in a wide variety of different languages (Knight and Graehl, 1998; Li et al., 2004; Zelenko and Aone, 2006; Sproat et al., 2006; Sherif and Kondrak, 2007; Hermjakob et al., 2008; Goldwasser and Roth, and Roth, 2006).",
        "However, there has not been any coordinated effort in calibrating the state-of-the-art technical capabilities of machine transliteration: the studies explore different algorithmic approaches in different language pairs and report their performance in different metrics and tested on different corpora.",
        "The overarching objective of this shared task is to drive the machine transliteration technology forward, to measure and baseline the state-of-theart and to provide a meaningful comparison between the most promising algorithmic approaches in order to stimulate the discussions among the researchers.",
        "The NLP community in Asia is especially interested in transliteration as several major Asian languages do not use Latin script in their native writing systems.",
        "The Named Entity Workshop (NEWS 2009) in ACL-IJCNLP 2009 in Singapore provides an ideal platform for the shared task to take off.",
        "This is precisely what we address in this shared task on machine transliteration that is conducted as a part of the Named Entity Workshop (NEWS-2009), an ACL-IJCNLP 2009 workshop.",
        "The shared task aims at achieving the following objectives:",
        "• Providing a forum to bring together the community of researchers in the area of Machine Transliteration to focus on various research avenues in this important research area.",
        "• Calibrating systems on common hand-crafted corpora, using common metrics, in many different languages, thus creating a reasonable baseline for the state-of-the-art of transliteration systems.",
        "• Analysing the results so that a reasonable comparison of different algorithmic approaches and their trade-offs (such as, transliteration quality vs. generality of approach across languages vs. training data size, etc.)",
        "may be explored.",
        "We believe that a substantial part of what we have set out to achieve has been accomplished, and we present this report as a record of the task process, system participation and results and our findings.",
        "It is our hope that this reporting will generate lively discussions during the NEWS workshop and subsequent research in this important area.",
        "This introduction outlines the purpose of the transliteration shared task conducted as a part of the NEWS workshop.",

        "Section 5 presents the results of the shared task and the analysis of the results.",

        "In this section, we outline the definition of the task, the process followed and the rationale for the decisions.",
        "There exists several terms that are used interchangeably in the contemporary research literature for the conversion of names between two languages, such as, transliteration, transcription, and sometimes Romanisation, especially if Latin scripts are used for target strings (Halpern, 2007).",
        "Our aim is not only at capturing the name conversion process from a source to a target language, but also at its ultimate utility for downstream applications, such as CLIR and MT.",
        "We have narrowed down to three specific requirements for the task, as follows: \"Transliteration is the conversion of a given name in the source language (a text string in the source writing system or orthography) to a name in the target language (another text string in the target writing system or orthography), such that the target language name is:",
        "(i) phonemically equivalent to the source name (ii) conforms to the phonology ofthe target language and (iii) matches the user intuition of the equivalent ofthe source language name in the target language.\"",
        "Given that the phoneme set of languages may not be exactly the same, the first requirement must be diluted to \"close to\", instead of \"equivalent\".",
        "The second requirement is needed to ensure that the target string is a valid string as per the target language phonology.",
        "The third requirement is introduced to produce what a normal user would expect (at least for the popular names), and in order to make it useful for downstream applications like MT or CLIR systems.",
        "Though the third requirement make systems produce target language strings that marginally violate the first or second requirements, it ensures that such transliteration system is of value to downstream systems.",
        "All the above requirements are implicitly enforced by the choice of name pairs used to define the training and test corpora in a given language pair.",
        "In cases where multiple equivalent target language names are possible for a source language name, we include all of them.",
        "After much debate, we have also retained the task name as \"transliteration\", though our definition may be closest to the \"popular transcription\" (Halpern, 2007), due to the popularity of term \"Machine Transliteration\" among the language technology researchers.",
        "The shared task is specified as development of machine transliteration systems in one or more of the specified language pairs.",
        "Each language pair of the shared task consists of a source and a target language, implicitly specifying the transliteration direction.",
        "Training and development data in each of the language pairs have been made available to all registered participants for developing a transliteration system for that specific language pair using any approach that they find appropriate.",
        "At the evaluation time, a standard hand-crafted test set consisting of between 1,000 and 3,000 source names (approximately 10% of the training data size) have been released, on which the participants are required to produce a ranked list of transliteration candidates in the target language for each source name.",
        "The system output is tested against a reference set (which may include multiple correct transliterations for some source names), and the performance of a system is captured in multiple metrics (defined in Section 3), each designed to capture a specific performance dimension.",
        "For every language pair every participant is required to submit one run (designated as a \"standard\" run) that uses only the data provided by the NEWS workshop organisers in that language pair, and no other data or linguistic resources.",
        "This standard run ensures parity between systems and enables meaningful comparison of performance of various algorithmic approaches in a given language pair.",
        "Participants are allowed to submit more runs (designated as \"non-standard\") for every language pair using either data beyond that provided by the shared task organisers or linguistic resources in a specific language, or both.",
        "This essentially may enable any participant to demonstrate the limits of performance of their system in a given language pair.",
        "The shared task timelines provide adequate time for development, testing (approximately 2 months after the release of the training data) and the final result submission (5 days after the release of the test data).",
        "We have had two specific constraints in selecting languages for the shared task: language diversity and data availability.",
        "To make the shared task interesting and to attract wider participation, it is important to ensure a reasonable variety among the languages in terms of linguistic diversity, orthography and geography.",
        "Clearly, the ability of procuring and distributing a reasonably large (approximately 10K paired names for training and testing together) hand-crafted corpora consisting primarily of paired names is critical for this process.",
        "At the end of the planning stage and after discussion with the data providers, we have chosen the set of 7 languages shown in Table 1 for the task (Li et al., 2004; Kumaran and Kellner, 2007;",
        "MSRI, 2009; CJKI, 2009).",
        "For all of the languages chosen, we have been able to procure paired names data between English and the respective languages and were able to make them available to the participants.",
        "In addition, we have been able to procure a specific corpus of about 40K Romanised Japanese names and their Kanji counterparts, and the corresponding language pair (Japanese names from their Romanised form to Kanji) has been included as one of the task language pair.",
        "It should be noted here that each corpus has a definite skew in its characteristics: the names in the Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) language corpora are Western names; the Indic languages (Hindi, Kannada and Tamil) corpora consists of a mix of Indian and Western names.",
        "The Romanised Kanji to Kanji corpus consists only of native Japanese names.",
        "While such characteristics may have provided us an opportunity to specifically measure the performance for forward transliterations (in CJK) and backward transliterations (in Romanised Kanji), we do not highlight such fine distinctions in this edition.",
        "Finally, it should be noted here that the corpora procured and released for NEWS 2009 represent perhaps the most diverse and largest corpora to be used for any common transliteration tasks today."

        "As the standard runs are limited by the use of corpus, most of the systems are implemented under the direct orthographic mapping (DOM) framework (Li et al., 2004).",
        "While the standard runs allow us to conduct meaningful comparison across different algorithms, we recognise that the non-standard runs open up more opportunities for exploiting larger linguistic corpora.",
        "It is also noted that several systems have reported improved performance over any previously reported results on similar corpora.",
        "NEWS 2009 Shared Task represents a successful debut of a community effort in driving machine transliteration techniques forward.",
        "The overwhelming responses in the first shared task also warrant continuation of such an effort in future ACL or IJCNLP events."
