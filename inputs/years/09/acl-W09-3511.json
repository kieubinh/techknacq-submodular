        "To transliterate a foreign name into a target language, a direct instrument is to make use of existing rules for converting text to syllabus, or at least a phoneme base to support such transformation.",
        "Following this path, the well developed noisy channel model used for transliteration usually set an intermediate layer to represent the source and target names by phonemes or phonetic tags (Knight and Graehl, 1998; Virga and Khu-danpur, 2003; Gao et al., 2004).",
        "Having been studied extensively though, the phonemes-based approaches cannot break its performance ceiling for two reasons (Li et al., 2004): (1) Language-dependent phoneme representation is not easy to obtain; (2) The phonemic representation to source and target names usually causes error spread.",
        "Several approaches have been proposed for direct use of parallel texts for performance enhancement (Li et al., 2004; Li et al., 2007; Goldwasser and Roth, 2008).",
        "There is no straightforward mean for grouping characters or letters in the source or target language into better transliteration units for a better correspondence.",
        "There is no consistent deterministic mapping between two languages either, especially when they belong to different language families, such as English and Chinese.",
        "Usually, a single character in a source name is not enough to form a phonetic pattern in a target name.",
        "Thus a better way to model transliteration is to map character sequences between source and target name entities.",
        "The mapping is actually an alignment process.",
        "If a certain quantity of bilingual transliterated entities are available for training, it is a straightforward idea to tackle this transliteration problem with a mature framework such as phrase-based SMT.",
        "It can be considered a general statistical translation task if the character sequences involved are treated like phrases.",
        "In so doing, however, a few points need to be highlighted.",
        "Firstly, only parallel data are required for generating transliteration outputs via SMT, and this SMT translation process can be easily integrated as a component into a general-purpose SMT system.",
        "Secondly, on character sequences, the mapping between source and target name entities can be performed on even larger units.",
        "Consequently, contextual information can be exploited to facilitate the alignment, for a string can be used as a context for every one of its own characters.",
        "It is reasonable to expect such relevant information to produce more precisely statistical results for finding corresponding transliterations.",
        "Thirdly, transliteration as a monotonic word ordering transformation problem allows the alignment to be performed monotonously from the beginning to the end of a text.",
        "Thus its decoding is easy to perform as its search space shrinks this way, for reordering is considered not to be involved, in contrast to the general SMT process.",
        "This paper is intended to present our work on applying phrased-based SMT technologies to tackle transliteration.",
        "The following sections will report how we have carried out our experiments for the NEWS2009 task (Li et al., 2009) and present the experimented results."

      "text": [
        "In order to transliterate effectively via a phrase based SMT process for our transliteration task, we opt for the log-linear framework (Och and Ney, 2002), a straightforward architecture to have several feature models integrated together as",
        "Then the transliteration task is to find the proper source and corresponding target chunks to maximize P(t\\s) as",
        "In (1), hi(s, t) is a feature model formulated as a probability functions on a pair of source and target texts in logarithmic form, and Xi is a parameter to optimize its contribution.",
        "The two most important models in this framework are the translation model (i.e., the transliteration model in our case), and the target language model.",
        "The former is defined as where p(s,t) is p(s\\t) or p(t\\s) according to the direction of training corresponding phrases.",
        "(Och and Ney, 2002) show that p(t\\s) gives a result comparable to p(s\\t), as in the source-channel framework.",
        "(Gao et al., 2004) also confirm on transliteration that the direct model with p(t\\s) performs well while working on the phonemic level.",
        "For our task, we have tested these choices for p(s,t) on all our development data, arriving at a similar result.",
        "However, we opt to use both p(s\\t) and p(t\\s) if they give similar transliteration quality in some language pairs.",
        "Thus we take p(t\\s) for our primary transliteration model for searching candidate corresponding character sequences, and p(s\\t) as a supplement.",
        "In addition to the translation model feature, another feature for the language model can be described as",
        "Usually the n-gram language model is used for its effectiveness and simplicity.",
        "For the purpose of modeling the training data, the characters from both the source and target name entities for training are split up for alignment, and then phrase extraction is conducted to find the mapping pairs of character sequence.",
        "The alignment is performed by expectation-maximization (EM) iterations in the IBM model-4 SMT training using the GIZA++ toolkit.",
        "In some runs, however, e.g., English to Chinese and English to Korean transliteration, the character number of the source text is always more than that of the target text, the training conducted only on characters may lead to many abnormal fertilities and then affect the character sequence alignment later.",
        "To alleviate this, a preprocessing step before GIZA++ training applies unsupervised learning to identify many frequently co-occurring characters as fixed patterns in the source texts, including all available training, development and testing data.",
        "All possible tokens of the source names are considered.",
        "Afterwards, the extraction and probability estimation of corresponding sequences of characters or preprocessed small tokens aligned in the prior step is performed by 'diag-growth-final' (Koehn et al., 2003), with maximum length 10, which is tuned on development data, for both the source-to-target and the target-to-source character alignment.",
        "Then two transliteration models, namely p(t\\s) and p(s\\t), are generated by such extraction for each transliteration run.",
        "Another component involved in the training is an n-gram language model.",
        "We set n = 3 and have it trained with the available data of the target language in question.",
        "Using the development sets for the NEWS2009 task, a minimum error rate training (MERT) (Och, 2003) is applied to tune the parameters for the corresponding feature models in (1).",
        "The training is performed with regard to the mean F-score, which is also called fuzziness in top-1, measuring on average how different the top transliteration candidate is from its closest reference.",
        "It is worth noting that a high mean F-score indicates a high accuracy of top candidates, thus a high mean reciprocal rank (MRR), which is used to quantify the overall performance of transliteration.",
        "a The subscripts 1, 2 and 3 refer to the two transliteration models p(t\\s) and p(s\\t) and another language model respectively, and normalized as J]=1 Ai = 3.",
        "b EnCh stands for English to Chinese run and EnRu for English to Russian run.",
        "c B stands for baseline configuration and O for optimized case.",
        "As shown in Table 1, the optimization of the three major models leads to a significant performance improvement, especially when training data is limited, such as the EnRu run, only 5977 entries of name entities are provided for training.",
        "And, it is also found that the optimized feature weights for other language pairs are similar to these for the two runs as shown in the table above.",
        "Note for the optimization of the parameters, that only the training data is used for construction of models.",
        "For the test, both the training and the development sets are used for training.",
        "The trained source-to-target and target-to-source transliteration models are integrated with the language model as given in (1) for our decoding.",
        "We implement a beam-search decoder to deal with these multiple transliteration models, which takes both the forward-and backward-directional aligned character sequences as factors to contribute to the transliteration probability.",
        "Considering the monotonic transformation order, the decoding is performed sequentially from the beginning to the end of a source text.",
        "No reordering is needed for such transliteration.",
        "As the search space is restricted in this way, the accuracy of matching possible transliteration pairs is not affected when the decoding is maintained at a faster speed than that for ordinary translation.",
        "In addition, another heuristic condition is also used to guide this monotonic decoding.",
        "For those target character sequences found in the training data, their positions in a name entity can help the decoding to find better corresponding transliterations, for some texts appear more frequently at the beginning of a name entity and others at the end.",
        "We use the probabilities for all aligned target character sequences in different positions, and exploit the data as an auxiliary feature model for the generation.",
        "Finally, all possible target candidates are generated by (2) for source names."
