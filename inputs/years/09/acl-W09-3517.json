        "Translation of NEs involves both translation and transliteration.",
        "Transliteration is the method of translating into another language by expressing the original foreign word using characters of the target language preserving the pronunciation in their source language.",
        "Thus, the central problem in transliteration is predicting the pronunciation of the original word.",
        "Transliteration between two languages that use the same set of alphabets is trivial: the word is left as it is.",
        "However, for languages those use different alphabet sets the names must be transliterated or rendered in the target language alphabets.",
        "Transliteration of NEs is necessary in many applications, such as machine translation, corpus alignment, cross-language Information Retrieval, information extraction and automatic lexicon acquisition.",
        "In the literature, a number of transliteration algorithms are available involving English (Li et al., 2004; Vigra and Khudanpur, 2003; Goto et al., 2003), European languages (Marino et al., 2005) and some of the Asian languages, namely Chinese (Li et al., 2004; Vigra and Khu2007; Surana and Singh, 2008)."

        "Three transliteration models have been used that can generate the Hindi transliteration from an English named entity (NE).",
        "An English NE is divided into Transliteration Units (TUs) with patterns C*V*, where C represents a consonant and V represents a vowel.",
        "The Hindi NE is divided into TUs with patterns C+M?, where C represents a consonant or a vowel or a conjunct and M represents the vowel modifier or matra.",
        "The TUs are the lexical units for machine transliteration.",
        "The system considers the English and Hindi contextual information in the form of collocated TUs simultaneously to calculate the plausibility of transliteration from each English TU to various Hindi candidate TUs and chooses the one with maximum probability.",
        "This is equivalent to choosing the most appropriate sense of a word in the source language to identify its representation in the target language.",
        "The system learns the mappings automatically from the bilingual NEWS training set being guided by linguistic features/knowledge.",
        "The system considers the linguistic knowledge in the form of conjuncts and/or diphthongs in English and their possible transliteration in Hindi.",
        "The output of the mapping process is a decision-list classifier with collocated TUs in the source language and their equivalent TUs in collocation in the target language along with the probability of each decision obtained from the training set.",
        "Linguistic knowledge is used in order to make the number of TUs in both the source and target sides equal.",
        "A Direct example base has been maintained that contains the bilingual training examples that do not result in the equal number of TUs in both the source and target sides during alignment.",
        "The Direct example base is checked first during machine transliteration of the input English word.",
        "If no match is obtained, the system uses direct orthographic mapping by identifying the equivalent Hindi TU for each English TU in the input and then placing the Hindi TUs in order.",
        "The transliteration models are described below in which S and T denotes the source and the target words respectively:",
        "This is essentially the joint source-channel model (Hazhiou et al., 2004) where the previous TUs with reference to the current TUs in both the source (s) and the target sides (t) are considered as the context.",
        "This is basically the trigram model where the previous and the next source TUs are considered as the context.",
        "In this model, the previous and the next TUs in the source and the previous target TU are considered as the context.",
        "This is the improved modified joint source-channel model.",
        "For NE transliteration, P(T), i.e., the probability of transliteration in the target language, is calculated from a English-Hindi bilingual database of approximately 961,890 English person names, collected from the web.",

        "It was observed that the number of tokens in the source and target sides mismatched in 22 multi-words and these cases were not considered further.",
