        "Transliteration is defined as phonetic translation of names across languages.",
        "Transliteration of Named Entities is necessary in many applications, such as machine translation, corpus alignment, cross-language information retrieval, information extraction and automatic lexicon acquisition.",
        "The transliteration modeling approaches can be classified into phoneme-based, grapheme-based and hybrid approach of phoneme and grapheme.",
        "Many previous studies are devoted to the phoneme-based approach (Knight and Graehl, 1998; Virga and Khudanpur, 2003).",
        "Suppose that E is an English name and C is its Chinese transliteration.",
        "The phoneme-based approach first converts E into an intermediate phonemic representation p, and then converts p into its Chinese counterpart C. The idea is to transform both source and target names into comparable phonemes so that the phonetic similarity between two names can be measured easily.",
        "The grapheme-based approach has also attracted much attention (Li et al., 2004).",
        "It treats the transliteration as a statistical machine translation problem under monotonic constraint.",
        "The idea is to obtain the bilingual orthographical correspondence directly to reduce the possible errors introduced in multiple conversions.",
        "The hybrid approach attempts to utilize both phoneme and grapheme information for transliteration.",
        "(Oh and Choi, 2006) proposed a way to fuse both phoneme and grapheme features into a single learning process.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",

        "The transliteration process is as follows.",
        "The language model generates a Chinese name C, and the transliteration model converts C into its back-transliteration E. The channel decoder is used to find C that is the most likely to the word C that gives rise to E. C is the result transliteration of E.",
        "The process can be formulated with equation 1.",
        "Since P(E) is constant for the given E, we can rewrite equation 1 as follows: C = argmaxP(C)P(E | C) (2)",
        "The language model P(C) is simplified as n-gram model of Chinese characters and is trained with a Chinese name corpus.",
