        "Often, named entities such as person names or place names from foreign origin do not appear in the dictionary, and such out of vocabulary words are a common source of errors in processing natural languages.",
        "For example, in statistical machine translation (SMT), if a new word occurs in the input source sentence, the decoder will at best drop the unknown word or directly copy the source word to the target sentence.",
        "Transliteration, a method of mapping phonemes or graphemes of source language into those of target language, can be used in this case in order to identify a possible translation of the word.",
        "The approaches to automatic transliteration between English and Korean can be performed through the following ways: First, in learning how to write the names of foreign origin, we can refer to a transliteration standard which is established by the government or some official linguistic organizations.",
        "No matter where the standard comes from, the basic principle of the standard is based on the correct pronunciation of foreign words.",
        "Second, since constructing such rules are very costly in terms of time and money, we can rely on a statistical method such as SMT.",
        "We believe that the rule-based method can guarantee to increase accuracy for known cases, and the statistical method can be robust to handle various exceptions.",
        "In this paper, we present a variety of techniques for English-Korean name transliteration.",
        "First, we use a phrase-base SMT model with some factored translation features for the transliteration task.",
        "Second, we expand the base system by applying Web-based n-best re-ranking of the results.",
        "Third, we apply a pronouncing dictionary-based method to the base system which utilizes the pronunciation symbols which is motivated by linguistic knowledge.",
        "Finally, we introduce a phonics-based method which is originally designed for teaching speakers of English to read and write that language."

        "In order to build our base system, we use MOSES (Koehn et al., 2007), a well-known phrase-based system designed for SMT.",
        "MOSES offers a convenient framework which can be directly applied to machine transliteration experiments.",
        "In this framework, the transliteration can be performed in a very similar process of SMT task except the following changes.",
        "First, the unit of translation is changed from words to characters.",
        "Second, a phrase in transliteration refers to any contiguous block of character sequence which can be directly matched from a source word to a target word.",
        "Also, we do not have to worry about any distortion parameters because decoding can be performed in a totally monotonic way.",

        "The unit can be based on graphemes or phonemes, depending on language pairs or approaches.",
        "In English-Korean transliteration, both grapheme-to-grapheme and grapheme-to-phoneme approaches are possible.",
        "In our method, we select grapheme-to-grapheme approach as a base system, and we apply grapheme-to-phoneme functions in pronouncing dictionary-based approach.",
        "The transliteration between Korean and other languages requires some special preprocessing techniques.",
        "First of all, Korean alphabet is organized into syllabic blocks called Eumjeol.",
        "Korean transliteration standard allows each Eumjeol to consist of either two or three of the 24 Korean letters, with (1) leading 14 consonants, (2) intermediate 10 vowels, and (3) optionally, trailing 7 consonants (out of the possible 14).",
        "Therefore, Korean Eumjeol should be decomposed into letters before performing training or decoding any input.",
        "Consequently, after the letter-unit transliteration is finished, all the letters should be recomposed to form a correct sequence of Eumjeols.",
        "Figure 1 shows the overall architecture of our system.",
        "The alignment between English letter and Korean letter is performed using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003).",
        "We use MOSES decoder in order to search the best sequence of transliteration.",
        "In this paper we focus on describing factored phrase-based training and n-best re-ranking techniques including a Web-based method, a pronouncing dictionary-based method, and a phonics-based method.",
        "Koehn and Hoang (2007) introduces an integration of different information for phrase-based SMT model.",
        "We report on experiments with three factors: surface form, positional information, and the type of a letter.",
        "Surface form indicates a letter itself.",
        "For positional information, we add a BIO label to each input character in both the source words and the target words.",
        "The intuition is that certain character is differently pronounced depending on its position in a word.",
        "For example, 'k' in 'Knight' or 'h' in 'Sarah' are not pronounced.",
        "The type of a letter is used to classify whether a given letter is a vowel or a consonant.",
        "We assume that a consonant in source word would more likely be linked to a consonant in a target word.",
        "Figure 2 shows an example of alignment with factored features.",
        "We re-ranked the top n results of the decoder by referring to how many times both source word and target word co-occur on the Web.",
        "In news articles on the Web, a translation of a foreign name is often provided near the foreign name to describe its pronunciation or description.",
        "To reflect this observation, we use Google's proximity search by restricting two terms should occur within four-word distance.",
        "The frequency is adjusted as relative frequency form by dividing each frequency by total frequency of all n-best results.",
        "Also, we linearly interpolate the n-best score with the relative frequency of candidate output.",
        "To make fair interpolation, we adjust both scores to be between 0 and 1.",
        "Also, in this method, we decide to remove all the candidates whose frequencies are zero.",
        "According to \"Oeraeeo pyogibeop\" (Korean orthography and writing method of borrowed foreign words), the primary principle of English-to-Korean transliteration is to spell according to the mapping table between the international phonetic alphabets and the Korean alphabets.",
        "Therefore, we can say that a pronouncing dictionary-based method is very suitable for this principle.",

        "Phonetic symbols for English words in the dictionaries are transformed to their pronunciation information by using an internal code table.",
        "The internal code table represents mappings from each phonetic symbol to a single character within ASCII code table.",
        "Our pronouncing dictionary includes a list of words and their pronunciation information.",

        "In this research, we modify the phonics in order to connect English sounds to Korean letter because in Korean there is nearly a one-to-one correspondence between sounds and the letter patterns that represent them.",
        "For example, alphabet 'b' can be pronounced to ' h '(bieup) in Korean.",
        "Consequently, we construct about 150 rules which map English alphabet into one or more several Korean graphemes, by referring to the phonics.",
        "Though phonics cannot reveal all of the pronunciation of English words, the conversion from English alphabet into Korean letter is performed simply and efficiently.",
