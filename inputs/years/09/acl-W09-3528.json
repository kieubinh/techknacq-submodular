        "This formulation allows for a target language letters' n-gram model p (t) and a transcription model p(s | t).",
        "Given a sequence of letters s, the argmax function is a search function to output the best target letter sequence.",
        "From the above equation, the best target sequence is obtained based on the product of the probabilities of transcription model and the probabilities of a language model and their respective weights.",
        "The method for obtaining the transcription probabilities is described briefly in the next section.",
        "Determining the best weights is necessary for obtaining the right target language sequence.",
        "The estimation of the models' weights can be done in the following manner.",
        "The posterior probability Pr (t | s) can also be directly modeled using a log-linear model.",
        "In this model, we have a set of M feature functions hm(t,s),m = 1...M .",
        "For each feature function there exists a weight or model parameter Am, m = 1...M. Thus the posterior probability becomes:",
        "with the denominator, a normalization factor that can be ignored in the maximization process.",

        "The parameters which have a major influence on the performance of a phrase-based SMT model are the alignment heuristics, the maximum phrase length (MPR) and the order of the language model (Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "In the context of transliteration, phrase means a sequence of let-ters(of source and target language) mapped to each other with some probability (i.e., the hypothesis) and stored in a phrase table.",
        "The maximum phrase length corresponds to the maximum number oflet-ters that a hypothesis can contain.",
        "Higher phrase length corresponds a larger phrase table during decoding.",
