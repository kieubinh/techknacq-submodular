        "In our non-standard runs, we use a Web-mining module to boost the performance by adding online popularity information of candidate translations.",

        "It is in general difficult for human to translate unfamiliar personal names, place names and names of organizations (Lee et al., 2006).",
        "One reason is the variability in name translation.",
        "In many situations, there is more than one correct translation for the same name.",
        "In some languages, such as Arabic, it can go up to as many as forty (Arbabi et al., 1994).",
        "Even professional translators find it difficult to identify all variations.",
        "For example, when translating \"Phelps\" into Chinese, there are at least 5 different ways to translate this name: \" f?/Klf#T,\" \"i/Kia$T,\" \"lU/KM,\" \"i/KWS,\" and \"i/K#^,\" with some more popular than others.",
        "The variability in translation implies the complexity in name translation that can hardly be addressed in typical machine translation systems.",
        "Machine translation systems are often black boxes where only one translation is provided, which do not offer a solution to variability issue.",
        "The accuracy of a machine translation system, whether statistical or example-based, largely depends on sentence context information.",
        "This context information is often not available with name translation.",
        "Furthermore, emerging names are difficult to capture in regular machine translation systems if they have not been included in training corpus or translation dictionary.",
        "Thus, being able to translate proper names not only has its own application area, it will also enhance the performance of current machine translation systems.",
        "In our previous English-Arabic name transliteration work (Zhou et al., 2008), we proposed a framework for name transliteration using a 2-gram and a 3-gram Hidden Markov Model (HMM).",
        "In this research, we extend our 2-gram and 3-gram HMM to an N-gram HMM where N is the maximum number of prior translation mapping sequence that can be identified in the training corpus.",
        "In our non-standard runs, we also integrated a Web mining module.",
        "The rest of the paper is structured as follows.",
        "Section 2 reviews related work; Section 3 describes our algorithm; Section 4 discusses implementation and evaluation results are provided in Section 5.",
        "Section 6 concludes our work."

        "Research in translating proper names has focused on two strategies: One is to mine translation pairs from bilingual online resources or corpora (Lee et.",
        "al, 2006).",
        "The second approach is a direct translation approach (Chen and Zong, 2008).",
        "The first approach is based on the assumption that the two name equivalents should share similar relevant context words in their languages.",
        "Correct transliteration is then extracted from the closest matching proper nouns.",
        "The second approach, direct translation, is often done by transliteration.",
        "Transliteration is the representation of a word or phrase in the closest corresponding letters or characters of a language with different alphabet so that the pronunciation is as close as possible to the original word or phrase (AbdulJa-leel and Larkey, 2003).",
        "Unlike mining-based approach, transliteration can deal with low-frequency proper names, but may generate ill-formed translations.",
        "Transliteration models can be categorized into rule-based approach and statistical approach.",
        "A rule-based approach maps each letter or a set of letters in the source language to the closest sounding letter or letters in the target language according to predefined rules or mapping tables.",
        "It relies on manual identification of all transliteration rules and heuristics, which can be very complex and time consuming to build (Darwish et al., 2001).",
        "A statistical approach obtains translation probabilities from a training corpus: pairs of transliterated words.",
        "When new words come, the statistical approach picks the transliteration candidate with the highest transliteration probabilities generated as the correct transliteration.",
        "Most statistical-based research used phoneme-based transliteration, relying on a pronunciation dictionary.",
        "Al-Onaizan and Knight showed that a grapheme-based approach outperformed a phoneme-based approach in Arabic-English transliteration (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002)."

        "There are several challenges in transliterating English names into Chinese.",
        "First, written Chinese is a logogram language.",
        "Thus, a phonetic representation of Chinese characters, Pinyin, is used as an intermediate Romanization.",
        "Our process of translating an English name into Chinese consists of two steps: translating English word into Pinyin and then mapping Pinyin into Chinese characters.",
        "Second, Chinese is not only monosyllabic, but the pronunciation of each Chinese character is always composed of one (or none) Consonant unit and one Vowel unit with the Consonant always appears at the beginning.",
        "For example, /EKS/ is one syllable in English but is three syllables in Chinese (/E/ + /KE/ + /SI/).",
        "English syllables need to be processed in a way that can be mapped to Chinese Pinyin."

        "Figure 1 illustrates our name translation framework.",
        "The framework consists of three major components: 1) Training, 2) Hidden Markov Model-based Transliteration, and 3) Web Mining-enhanced ranking.",
        "The training process (Figure 1 Module 1) generates two transliteration probability tables based on a training corpus of English-Pinyin pair and",
        "Pinyin-Chinese name pairs.",
        "Pinyin is not provided in the training corpus, but is easy to obtain from a Chinese Pinyin table.",
        "In order to perform mapping from English names to Chinese Pinyin, an English name is divided into sub-syllables and this process is called Syllabification.",
        "Although many English syllabification algorithms have been proposed, they need to be adjusted.",
        "During syllabification, light vowels are inserted between two continuous consonants and silent letters are deleted.",
        "We use a finite state machine to implement the syllabification process.",
        "For example, \"Phelps\" becomes {/ph/ /e/ /l/ /@/ /p/ /@/ /s/ /@/} with \"@\" being inserted light vowels.",
        "Alignment process maps each sub-syllable in an English name to target Pinyin.",
        "The accuracy of Alignment process largely depends on the accuracy of Syllabification.",
        "Pinyin to Chinese character alignment is more straightforward where each Pinyin syllable (consonant + vowel) is mapped to the corresponding Chinese character.",
        "Once the alignment is done, occurrence of each translation pair can be calculated.",
        "Using this occurrence information, we can derive probabilities under various situations to support probability models.",
        "We use the Hidden Markov Model which is one of the most popular probability models and has been used in speech recognition, the human genome project, consumer decision modeling, etc.",
        "(Rabiner, 1989).",
        "In transliteration, traditional HMM can be viewed as a 2-gram model where the current mapping selection depends on the previous mapping pair.",
        "We expand it to an N-gram model and use the combination of 1-gram, 2-gram, ... , (N-l)-gram and N-gram HMM where N is the maximum number of mapping sequence that can be found in training corpus.",
        "The goal of our model is to find the candidate transliteration with the highest transliteration probabilities:",
        "Where s is the source name to be transliterated, which contains letter string SjS2... s,; t is the target name, which contains letter string tjt2... ti,",
        "In a simple statistical model, or a 1-gram model, transliteration probability is estimated as:",
        "# of timeS St appearS in corpuS",
        "The bigram HMM improves the simple statistical model in that it incorporates context information into a probability calculation.",
        "The transliteration of the current letter is dependent on the transliteration of ONE previous letter (one previous state in HMM).",
        "Transliteration probability is estimated as: (3)",
        "# of times s t translates to tiU oftimes si occurs",
        "# of times si-1 translates to tt-1",
        "The trigram HMM intends to capture even more context information by translating the current letter dependent on the TWO previous letters.",
        "Transliteration probability is estimated as: (4) „, , , # of timessi translatesott given , - > t,, #of timessj-1 translate sott-1",
        "1 and si-2 translates to t,_ # of timeS Si-1 tranSlateS to ti_",
        "This process is continued until the maximum mapping sequence is found in the transliteration corpus.",
        "The final probability estimation is a weighted combination of all N-grams:",
        "FinalTranSliteationScore=",
        "In our submitted results, we applied a1=1, a2=2, ...., an=N such that longer matched sequence has a larger contribution in the final probability.",
        "The rationale is that the longer the prior sequence identified in training data, the higher probability that the translation sequence is the correct tone.",
        "These a parameters can be tuned in the future.",
        "We call this approach Maximum N-gram HMM.",
        "The same process is conducted for Pinyin to Chinese character translation as shown in the lower part of Figure 1 Module 1.",
        "Once the two Maximum N-gram HMM Model are obtained, new incoming names are translated by obtaining a letter sequence that maximizes the overall probability through the HMM (Figure 1 Module 2).",
        "This step uses a modified Viterbi's search algorithm (Viterbi 1967).",
        "The original Viterbi's algorithm only keeps the most optimal path.",
        "To cope with name translation variations, we keep the top-20 optimal paths for further analysis.",
        "To boost the transliteration performance we propose to use the Web mining approach, which analyzes candidates' occurrence on the Web (Figure 1 Module 3).",
        "Each one of the top-20 transliterations obtained from the previous step is sent to a Web search engine using a meta-search program which records the number of documents retrieved, referred to as Web frequency.",
        "By examining the popularity of all possible transliterations on the Internet, bad transliterations can be filtered and their online popularity can serve as an indicator of transliteration correctness.",
        "The popularity is estimated by acquiring the number of documents returned from a search engine using the translation candidate as query.",
        "The final rank of transliterations is derived from a weighted score of the normalized Web frequency and the probability score."
