        "Machine learning, especially supervised learning, has achieved great success in many natural language tasks, such as part-of-speech (POS) tagging, named entity recognition (NER), and parsing.",
        "This approach automatically encodes linguistic knowledge as statistical parameters (models) from large annotated corpora.",
        "In the NER task, which is the focus of this paper, sequential tagging based on statistical models is",
        ":Tags are assigned to each input unit (e.g., word) one by one.",
        "similarly used; studies include Conditional Random Fields (CRFs; Lafferty et al., 2001, Suzuki et al., 2006).",
        "However, the manual costs incurred in creating annotated corpora are extremely high.",
        "On the other hand, Consumer Generated Media (CGM) such as blog texts has attracted a lot of attention recently as an informative resource for information retrieval and information extraction tasks.",
        "CGM has two distinctive features; enormous quantities of new texts are generated day after day, and new vocabularies and topics come and go rapidly.",
        "The most effective approach to keep up with new linguistic phenomena is creating new annotated corpora for model retraining at short intervals.",
        "However, it is difficult to build new corpora expeditiously because of the high manual costs imposed by traditional schemes.",
        "To reduce the manual labor and costs, various learning methods, such as active learning (Shen et al., 2004, Laws and Schütze, 2008), semi-supervised learning (Suzuki and Isozaki, 2008) and bootstrapping (Etzioni, 2005) have been proposed.",
        "Active learning automatically selects effective texts to be annotated from huge raw-text corpora.",
        "The correct answers are then manually annotated, and the model is re-trained.",
        "In active learning, one major issue is data selection, namely, determining which sample data is most effective.",
        "The data units used in conventional methods are sentences.",
        "Automatically creating annotated corpora would dramatically decrease the manual costs.",
        "In fact, there always are some recognition errors in any automatically annotated corpus and the editor has to correct errors one by one.",
        "Since sentences are used as data units, the editor has to pay attention to all tags in the selected sentence because it is not obvious where the recognition error is.",
        "However, it is a waste of manual effort to annotate all tags because most tags must be labeled correctly by the base model.",
        "In this paper, we propose a confidence measure based on tag posterior probability for the NER task.",
        "Our method does not use the confidence of a sentence, but instead computes the confidence of the tag assigned to each word.",
        "The tag confidence measure allows the sentence to which the base model might assign an incorrect tag to be selected automatically.",
        "Active learning becomes more efficient because we correct only those tags that have low confidence (cf. Sec. 4).",
        "We can realize the same effect as active learning if we can automatically correct the selected data based upon our tag confidence measure.",
        "Our proposal \"Semi-Automatically Updating NER\" automatically corrects erroneous data by using a seed NE list generated from other information sources.",

        "We collected 104,296 entries as a seed NE list.",
        "Using this seed list, Updating NER extracted the seed NE and its context from the selected data automatically.",
        "If the system found a match, it extracted the sentence with its tag sequence from the selected data.",
        "The automatically corrected data was then merged with the base data in order to retrain the base model.",

        "This means that not only the NE list but also the contexts are actually needed to retrain the model.",
        "Our Updating NER scheme has the advantage of finding the reliable context of a seed NE list automatically.",
        "Although some manual effort is needed to provide a seed NE list, its associated cost is lower than the cost of annotating the entire training data.",
        "Thus, we regard Updating NER as a promising solution for reducing learning cost in practical NER systems.",
        "As shown in Table 6, neither user dictionary method nor Updating NER improves the accuracy in ORG.",

        "In the seed list selected from the Wikipedia entries, PSN-type is dominant (74%).",

        "In fact, it has no positive and sometimes a negative effect on precision (e.g., ART decreased from 0.666 to 0.619).",
        "This indicates that adding an NE list as a dictionary is not enough to improve the accuracy of a NER system.",
        "This is because the NER system cannot discriminate an NE from surrounding unrelated words.",
        "It simply extracts matched sequences of words, so it overestimates the number of NEs.",

        "This feature actually has a great advantage in the NER task, because the system is capable of determining what the next preferable tag is when a new NE appears which is assigned an O-tag by the base model.",

        "Our Updating NER is similar to bootstrapping in that it extracts new annotated corpora automatically from plain text data starting with a seed NE list.",
