        "Some of the very effective ML approaches used in NER are ME (Borthwick, 1999), CRF (Lafferty et al., 2001) and SVM (Yamada et al., 2002).",

        "3.",
        "Bengali is an inflectional language providing one of the richest and most challenging sets of linguistic and statistical features resulting in long and complex wordforms.",
        "For example, the person name sachin [root] can appear as sa-chiner [inflection:-er], sachInke [inflection:-ke], sachInbAbu [inflection: -bAbu], sachIndA [ inflection:-dA] etc.",

        "We have also used the NE annotated data of 122K wordforms, collected from the NERSSEAL shared task.",

        "Other tags have been mapped to the NNE tags that represent the \"other-than-NE\" category.",
        "In order to properly denote the boundaries of NEs, four NE tags are further divided into the following forms:",
        "B-XXX: Beginning of a multiword NE, I-XXX: Internal of a multiword NE consisting of more than two words, E-XXX: End of a multiword NE, XXX^PER/LOC/ORG/MISC.",

        "The single word NE is tagged as, PER: Person name, LOC: Location name, ORG: Organization name and MISC: Miscellaneous name.",
        "In the output, sixteen NE tags are replaced with the four NE tags.",

        "Two different systems with the SVM model, one using forward parsing (SVM-F) that parses from left to right and other using backward parsing (SVM-B) that parses from right to left, have been developed.",
        "The SVM system has been developed based on (Valdimir, 1995), which perform classification by constructing an N-dimensional hyperplane that optimally separates data into two categories.",
        "We have used YamCha toolkit (http://chasen-org/~taku/software/yamcha), an SVM based tool for detecting classes in documents and formulating the NER task as a sequential labeling problem.",

        "The TinySVM-0.0 classifier has been used for classification.",
        "The C++ based CRF++ package (http://crfpp.sourceforge.net) and the C++ based ME package have been used for NER.",

        "Based on the original training on the labeled corpus, there will be some tags in the unlabeled corpus that the taggers will be very sure about.",

        "The set of features 'F' contains language independent as well as language dependent features.",
        "The set of language independent features includes the context words, fixed length prefixes and suffixes of all the words, dynamic NE information of the previous word(s), first word, length of the word, digit and infrequent word information.",
        "Language dependent features include the set of known suffixes that may appear with the various NEs, clue words that help in predicting the location and organization names, words that help to recognize measurement expressions, designation words that help to identify person names, various gazetteer lists that include the first names, middle names, last names, location names, organization names, function words, weekdays and month names.",
        "We have also used the part of speech (POS) information of the current and/or the surrounding word(s) as the features.",
        "Language independent NE features can be applied for NER in any language without any prior knowledge of that language.",
        "The lists or gazetteers are basically language dependent at the lexical level and not at the morphology or syntax level.",
        "Also, we include the POS information in the set of language dependent features as the POS information depends on some language specific phenomenon such as person, number, tense, gender etc.",

        "Evaluation results have demonstrated that the use of language specific features is helpful to improve the performance of the NER system.",
        "In the resource-constrained Indian language environment, the non-availability of language specific resources acts as a stimulant for the development of such resources for use in NER systems.",

        "We have observed that very short words are most probably not the NEs.",
        "•Infrequent word (binary valued): A cut off frequency has been chosen in order to consider the infrequent words in the training corpus.",
        "This is based on the observation that the infrequent words are rarely NEs.",
        "•Digit features: Several digit features have been considered depending upon the presence and/or the number of digit(s) in a token.",
        "These binary valued features are helpful in recognizing miscellaneous NEs such as time, monetary and date expressions, percentages, numerical numbers etc.",
        "•Position of the word (binary valued): Position of the word (whether last word or not) in a sentence is a good indicator of NEs.",
        "•Part of Speech (POS) Information: We have used an SVM-based POS tagger (Ekbal and Bandyopadhyay, 2008d) that was originally developed with 26 POS tags, defined for the Indian languages.",
