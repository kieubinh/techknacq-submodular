        "Comprehension-based summarization, e.g. Kintsch and Van Dijk (1978) and Brown et al.",
        "(1983), is the most ambitious model of automatic summarization, requiring a complete understanding of the text.",

        "Argumentative Zoning (Teufel, 1999; Teufel and Moens, 2002) attempts to solve this problem by representing the structure of a text using a rhetorically-based schema.",
        "Sentences are classified into one of a small number of non-hierarchical argumentative roles, which can then be used in both the sentence extraction and text generation/fusion phase of automatic summarization.",
        "Argumentative Zoning can enable tailored summarizations depending on the needs of the user, e.g. a layperson versus a domain expert.",
        "The first experiments in Argumentative Zoning used Naive Bayes (nb) classifiers (Kupiec et al., 1995; Teufel, 1999) which assume conditional independence of the features.",
        "However, this assumption is rarely true for the kinds of rich feature representations we want to use for most NLP tasks.",

        "The first three: Background, Other, and Own, are part of the basic schema and represent attribution of intellectual ownership.",

        "The assumption is clearly not always correct, but is a useful approximation nevertheless.",
        "Due to the specific nature of these classifications it is hoped that this will allow for much more robust automatic abstraction generation.",
        "Summaries of a paper could be created specifically for the user, either focusing on the aim of the work, the work's stance in the field (what other works it is based upon or compared with) and so on.",
        "Teufel used Argumentative Zoning to determine the author's use and opinion of other authors they cite in their work and also to create Rhetorical Document Profiles (RDP), a type of summarization used to provide typical information that a new reader may need in a systematic manner.",
        "For the use of Argumentative Zoning in RDPs Teufel (1999) points out that due to the redundancy in language that near perfect accuracy is not required as important pieces of information will be repeated in the paper.",
        "Recognising these salient points once is enough for them to be included in the RDP.",
        "In further tasks, such as the analysis of the function of citations (Teufel et al., 2006) and automatic summarization, higher levels of accuracy are more critical."

        "We scanned the data of about 1.8|DUR year|DUR ( TJDs|DUR 11000-11699|DUR ) and found 30 new GRB-like events .",

        "The LATEX, which the tokenizer split off incorrectly, was then reattached.",
        "Each sentence of the corpus was then annotated using a modified version of the Argumentative Zoning schema.",
        "While the original three zones: Background, Own, Other are used, we have replaced the CARS labels with content labels describing aspects of the work: DAT for data used in the analysis, OBS for observations performed, and TEC for techniques applied.",
        "Only Own and Other are subclassed with the extended schema of Data, Observation and Techniques.",
        "Examples of each zone classification are shown in Figure 1.",
        "Table 8 shows the impact of different feature types on classification accuracy for the Astronomy corpus.",
        "Again, the most important features are the n-grams (although to a slightly lesser extent than for the Computational Linguistics corpus).",
        "The other features make very little contribution at all.",
        "Disappointingly, the (gold-standard) named entity features contribute very little additional information - which is surprising given that the content categories (data and observation) are directly connected with some of the entity types (like telescope).",
        "In the Astronomy corpus, the Markov history features actually have a detrimental effect, which suggests the history is misleading.",
        "This warrants further exploration, but we suspect there may be more changing backwards and forwards between argumentative zones in the Astronomy corpus.",
        "Overall, we can see that the two tasks are of a similar level of difficulty of around 96% F-score.",
        "Table 9 shows the distribution over zones and content labels for the Astronomy corpus.",
        "The Background label is the hardest to reproduce even though it is not split into content sub-types.",
        "The subtypes are relatively rare for Other, so the results should not be considered as reliable.",

        "This paper has presented new models ofArgumen-tative Zoning using Maximum Entropy (me) models.",

        "Further, these task-specific features had very little additional impact on the me model.",
        "Our me model has raised the state-of-the-art in automatic Argumentative Zoning classification from 76% to 96.88% F-score on Teufel's Computational Linguistics conference paper corpus.",
        "To test the wider applicability of Argumentative Zoning, we have annotated a corpus of Astronomy journal articles with a modified zone and content scheme, and achieved a similar level of performance using our maximum entropy classifier.",
        "We found that more sophisticated semantic features, e.g. gold-standard named entities, also had little impact on the accuracy of our classifier.",
        "Now that we have a very accurate Argumentative Zone classifier, we would like to investigate the impact of Argumentative Zones in information retrieval, question answering, and summarization tasks, particularly in the astronomy domain, where we have additional tools such as the named entity recognizer.",
        "In summary, using a maximum entropy classifier with simple unigram and bigram features results in a very accurate classifier for Argumentative Zones across multiple domains."
