        "Practitioners and researchers in all fields face a great challenge in attempting to keep up-to-date with the literature relevant to their work.",
        "In this context, search engines provide a useful tool for information discovery; but search is just one modality for gathering information.",
        "We also regularly read through documents and expect to find additional relevant information in referenced (cited or hyperlinked) documents.",
        "This results in a browsing-based activity, where we explore connections through related documents.",
        "This browsing behaviour is increasingly supported today as publishers of scientific material deliver hyperlinked documents via a variety of media including Adobe's Portable Document Format (PDF) as well as the more conventional web hypertext format.",
        "Given appropriate document databases and knowledge of referencing conventions, it is relatively straightforward to support the automatic downloading of cited documents: such functionality already exists within reference managers such as JabRef and Sente.",
        "This 'blind downloading', however, does not address the question of the relevancy of the linked document for the reader at the time of reading.",
        "Apart from the publication details of the reference and the citation context, readers are provided with very little information on the basis of which to determine whether the cited document is worth exploring more thoroughly.",
        "Given the potentially large number of citations that may be encountered, this results in the following browsing-specific scenario: how can we help a user quickly determine whether the cited document is indeed worth downloading, perhaps paying for, and reading?",
        "In the study presented here, we focussed on the needs of biomedical researchers, who are often time-poor and yet apparently spend 18% of their time gathering and reviewing information (Hersh, 1008).",
        "They regularly search through repositories of online scholarly literature to update their expert knowledge; in this domain, the penalty for not staying up-to-date with the latest advances can be severe, potentially affecting medical experiments.",
        "In our work, we found that two thirds of researchers regularly engaged in browsing scientific literature.",
        "Given the prevalent use of the browsing modality, we believe that novel research tools are needed to help readers make decisions about the relevance of cited material.",
        "To better understand the user's information needs that arise when reading and browsing through academic literature, and to ascertain what NLP techniques we might be able to use to help support them, we conducted a user requirements analysis.",
        "It revealed a number of common problems faced by readers of scientific literature.",
        "These served to focus our efforts in designing and implementing a browsing support tool for scientific literature, referred to here as CSIBS.",
        "CSIBS helps readers decide which cited documents to read by providing them with information which is useful at the point when citations are encountered.",
        "The application provides information about the cited document and identifies important sentences in that document, based on the user's current reading context.",
        "The key observation here is that the reading context can indicate why the reader might be interested in the cited document.",
        "In addition to meta-data about the cited document, and its abstract, a contextualisedpreview is shown within the same browser in which the citing document is being viewed (for example, Adobe Acrobat Reader or a web browser), thus avoiding an interruption to the user's primary reading activity.",
        "This contextualised preview contains important sentences from the cited document that are related to the reading context.",
        "We present related work on understanding information needs in Section 2; we outline our user requirements analysis in the domain of scientific literature in Section 3; and the results of the analysis and our understanding of the browsing-specific information needs are presented in Section 4.",
        "In Section 5, we describe a tool developed to meet the most pressing of these information needs.",

        "We asked participants to view a number of popup previews in order to answer the question: Is the Citation Justified?",
        "This was one of the more difficult questions that researchers found challenging when making a relevancy judgement.",
        "The actual judgements are not important in this evaluation.",
        "Instead, we gauged the reported utility of the prototype based on the participants' self-reported confidence when performing the task.",
        "To capture this information, participants were asked to score their confidence on a 3-point Likert scale.",
        "Three biomedical researchers, all of whom had taken part in our original user requirements analysis, participated in the evaluation.",
        "Each participant was shown nine different passages containing a citation context, each situated in a different FEBS Letters publication (which was also presented in full to the participants).",
        "At each viewing of a citation context, two supporting texts were provided with which the participant was asked to answer the citation justification question.",
        "For all participants, the first supporting text was produced by a baseline system that simply provided the full reference of the citation.",
        "The second was either the abstract or the contextualised preview, which in this evaluation was limited to three sentences.",
        "Meta-data was not presented for this study as we specifically wanted feedback on the citation justification task.",
        "The small sample size does not permit hypothesis testing.",
        "However, we are encouraged by the comparable positive gains in self-reported confidence scores (Abstract: +1.2 versus CSIBS: +2.2) compared to simply showing the full reference.",
        "Since both preview types were positive, we assume that these types of information facilitated the relevance judgements.",
        "Participants also reported that, for the contextualised preview, 2 out of 3 sentences were found to be useful on average.",
        "The qualitative feedback also supported CSIBS.",
        "One participant made some particularly interesting observations regarding selected sentences and the structure of the cited document.",
        "Specifically, useful sentences tended to be located deeper in the cited document, for example in the methods sections This participant suggested that, for an expert user, showing sentences from the earlier sections of a publication was not useful; for the same reason, the abstract might be too general and not helpful in justifying a citation.",
        "Finally, this participant remarked that, in those situations where each document downloaded from a proprietary repository incurs a fee, the citation-sensitive previews would be very useful in deciding whether to download the document."

        "In this paper, we presented an analysis of browsing-specific information needs in the domain of scientific literature.",
        "In this context, users have information needs that are not realised as search queries; rather these remain implicit in the minds of users as they browse through hyperlinked documents.",
        "Our analysis sheds light on these information needs, and the tasks being performed in their pursuit, using a set of scenario-based questions.",
        "The analysis revealed two tasks often performed by participants: the appraisal task and the citation-focused task.",
        "CSIBS was designed to support the underlying needs by providing meta-data information, the abstract, and a contextualised preview for each citation.",
        "The user requirement of search refinement was not directly addressed in this work, but could be met by techniques of query refinement in IR, synonym-based expansion in summarisation, and of course, additional user specified key terms.",
        "In future work, we will explore these possibilities.",
        "Our results to date are encouraging for the use of NLP techniques to support readers prioritise which cited documents to read when browsing through scientific literature."
