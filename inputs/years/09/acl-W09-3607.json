        "The ACL Anthology is one of the most successful initiatives of the ACL.",
        "It was initiated by Steven Bird and is now maintained by Min Yen Kan.",
        "It includes all papers published by ACL and related organizations as well as the Computational Linguistics journal over a period of four decades.",
        "It is available at https://aclweb.org/anthology-new/ .",
        "One fundamental problem with the ACL Anthology, however, is the fact that it is just a collection of papers.",
        "It doesn't include any citation information or any statistics about the productivity of the various researchers who contributed papers to it.",
        "We embarked on an ambitious initiative to manually annotate the entire Anthology in order to make it possible to compute such statistics.",
        "In addition, we were able to use the annotated data for extracting citation summaries of all papers in the collection and we also annotated each paper by the gender of the authors (and are currently in the process of doing similarly for their institutions) in the goal of creating multiple gold standard data sets for training automated systems for performing such tasks."

        "The ACL Anthology includes 13,739 papers (excluding book reviews and posters).",
        "Each of the papers was converted from pdf to text using an OCR tool (www.pdfbox.org).",
        "After this conversion, we extracted the references semi-automatically using string matching.",
        "The above process outputs all the references as a single block so we then manually inserted line breaks between references.",
        "These references were then manually matched to other papers in the ACL Anthology using a \"k-best\" (with k = 5) string matching algorithm built into a CGI interface.",
        "A snapshot of this interface is shown in Figure 1.",
        "The matched references were stored together to produce the citation network.",
        "References to publications outside of the AAN were recorded but not included in the network.",
        "In order to fix the issue of wrong author names and multiple author identities we had to perform a lot of manual post-processing.",
        "The first names and the last names were swapped for a lot of authors.",
        "For example, the author name \"Caroline Brun\" was present as \"Brun Caroline\" in some of her papers.",
        "Another big source of error was the exclusion of middle names or initials in a number of papers.",
        "For example, Julia Hirschberg had two identities as \"Julia Hirschberg\" and \"Julia B. Hirschberg\".",
        "There were a few spelling mistakes, like \"Madeleine Bates\" was misspelled as \"Medeleine Bates\".",
        "Finally, many papers included incorrect titles in their citation sections.",
