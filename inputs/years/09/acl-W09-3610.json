        "In the field of Classics, canonical references are the traditional way established by scholars to cite primary sources within secondary sources.",
        "By primary sources we mean essentially the ancient texts that are the specific research object of Philology, whereas by secondary sources we indicate all the modern publications containing scholarly interpretations about those ancient texts.",
        "This specific characteristic strongly differentiates canonical references from the typical references we usually find within research papers.",
        "Canonical references are used to shortly refer to the research object itself (in this case ancient texts) rather than to the existing literature about a certain topic, as happens with references to other secondary sources.",
        "Given this distinction, canonical references assume a role of primary importance as the main entry point to the information contained in scholarly digital libraries of Classics.",
        "To find a parallel with other research fields, the role played by those references is somewhat analogous with that played by protein names in the medical literature or by notations of chemical compounds in the field of Chemistry.",
        "As was recently shown by Doms and Schroeder (2005) protein names can be used to semantically index documents and thus to enhance the information retrieval from a digital library of texts, provided that they are properly organized by using an ontology or a controlled vocabulary.",
        "Moreover, by analyzing and indexing such references as if they were backlinks (Lester, 2007) from a secondary to a primary source, it is possible to provide quantitative data about the impact of an ancient author for research in a particular disciplinary field, or in relation to a limited corpus of texts (e.g., the papers published by scholarly journals in a given time interval).",
        "In addition to serving as entry points to information, canonical references can also be thought of as a navigation apparatus that allows scholars to browse seamlessly through ancient texts and modern interpretations about them (Crane, 1987).",
        "For every scholar working on the ancient historiographer Herodotus, for instance, it would be extremely useful to be able to easily access all the secondary sources containing references to Herodotus' works.",
        "Therefore, the ability to automatically identify canonical references within unstructured texts is a first and necessary step to provide the users of digital libraries of Classics with a more sophisticated way to access information and to navigate through the texts that are already available to scholars of other fields.",
        "The volume of publicly available digitized books constituting what has been called the Million Book Library (Crane, 2006) has made it essential to develop automatic and scalable tools to automate the process of information extraction from electronic resources.",
        "Furthermore, the obsolescence time for publications is far longer in Classics than in other disciplines, meaning that typically the value of a publication does not decrease drastically after a certain time.",
        "As a result, scholars in Classics may be the most potential beneficiaries of the recent mass digitization initiatives, since they have already started with many materials out of copyright.",
        "In this paper we describe how Conditional Random Fields (Lafferty et al., 2001), the state of the art model in automatic classification, can be suitably applied to provide a scalable solution to this problem."

        "(Smith, 2009) provided an essential contribution to the research concerning the semantics of canonical references.",
        "The Canonical Text Services (CTS) protocol was developed by Smith for Harvard's Center for Hellenic Studies; it is based on URNs and is aimed at providing a machine actionable equivalent to printed canonical references.",
        "This protocol allows us to translate those references into machine actionable URNs that can then be resolved through resolution services against a distributed digital library of texts.",
        "The innovative aspect of the CTS protocol consists of a loose coupling system by which the linking between primary and secondary sources can be realized.",
        "Instead of hard linking a canonical reference to just one electronic edition of a primary source, by embedding the CTS URNs inside (X)HTML pages, it becomes possible to link it to an open ended number of resources as shown by (Romanello, 2007)."

      "text": [
        "Provided that scholars may use canonical references with different abbreviation or citation styles, it is nevertheless possible to identify within canonical references common patterns in terms of token features.",
        "CRF is used to classify a token depending on its features and is suitable to identify those feature patterns (Culotta et al., 2006).",
        "During the training phase, the CRF model learns what features make it more likely for a token to belong to a given category.",
        "Our starting assumption is that it is possible to determine if a sequence of tokens constitute a canonical reference by evaluating (looking at) the features of its tokens.",
        "Each token of a sequence is assigned a category on the basis of a fixed number of features.",
        "Those token categories are in turn used as features to classify the token sequence.",
        "Starting from a dataset of canonical references and applying the above described criteria to assign features to the tokens, we obtain a training dataset where each canonical reference is reduced to a token by removing whitespaces, and it is a assigned as many as features as the category assigned to its tokens.",
        "Finally, in order to classify token sequences as \"references\" or \"non-references\" each canonical reference is assigned a convenient label.",
        "The obtained set of labelled references is used to train a CRF model to identify canonical references within unstructured texts.",
        "For feature extraction phase, it was important to identify both inclusive and exclusive token features.",
        "Indeed, to extract canonical references with a high level of precision, we need to identify not only the characteristic features of tokens occurring within actual references but also those characteristic features for tokens occurring in sequences that we want to be classified as non-references.",
        "Even though the features are quite similar to those used to identify modern bibliographic references (Isaac Councill and Kan, 2008), they were tuned to fit the specific needs of canonical references to primary sources.",
        "We decided to record a total of 9 features for each token, concerning the following aspects:",
        "1.",
        "Punctuation: information about the punctuation concerning the presence of a final dot, hyphen, quotation marks and brackets (either single or paired), and marks used to divide and structure sequences (i.e. comma, colon and semicolon), which are particularly important for sequences of text passages.",
        "2.",
        "Orthographic Case: the orthographic case of a token is an essential piece of information to be tracked.",
        "Author names when abbreviated still keep the initial as an uppercase letter, whereas collections of texts (such as collections of fragments) often present all uppercase or mixed case letters (e.g., \"Tr-",
        "GrFr\",\"CGF\", \"FHG\", etc.",
        ").",
        "3.",
        "Stopwords: given that the main language of the input document is passed as a parameter to the parser, we record in a separate feature information regarding whether a token is a stopword in the input document language.",
        "This feature is particularly important in determining more precisely the actual boundaries of a canonical reference within the text.",
        "4.",
        "Greek Words: since we deal with Unicode UTF-8 text, we distinguish Greek letters and words.",
        "This allows us to identify more precisely those references that contain Greek text such as the above mentioned Homeric references or references to the ancient lexica (e.g., Harpocr., Lex.",
        "s.v.",
        "IIava'dr|vaia) since they contain the lemma of the Greek word referred to, usually preceded by the abbreviation \"s.v.\"",

        "5.",
        "Number: Roman and Arabic numerals combined in several figures are frequently used to indicate the scope of a reference.",
        "Arabic numerals that are used to represent modern dates, however, are distinguished by using a heuristic (for example, consider the problem of a footnote mark which gets appended to a date).",
        "Nevertheless, sequences of both numbers and punctuation marks are assigned a specific value for this feature, since the scope of a reference is commonly expressed by dot and hyphen separated sequences such as \"9.235-255\".",

        "Dictionary matching: two features are assigned if a token matches a dictionary entry.",

        "\"Hom.\"",
        "for Homer or \"Od.\"",
        "for Odyssey) or to another kind of abbreviation, namely the abbreviations used by philologists to shortly refer to pages, lines, verses, etc.",

        "In order to ensure both the scalability and the extensibility of the suggested method to disciplinary fields other than Classics, we did not assign an identity feature to tokens or - in other words - the actual string content is not considered as a token feature.",
        "However, since this decision might decrease the overall precision of the system, we introduced some features to record whether the token string occurs in one or more controlled dictionaries (e.g., list of widely adopted abbreviations).",
        "An analogous consideration is valid also for the dependency of the system from a specific language.",
        "Even though the approach is substantially language independent, the performances of our system in terms of precision were improved by using language specific lists of stopwords in order to identify the actual boundaries of a canonical reference within the text.",
        "Currently we support the most commonly used languages in the field of Classics (English, French, German, Italian, Spanish).",
        "Finally, it is worth noting that the use of italics is a distinctive feature in particular for those tokens that represent abbreviations of work titles.",
        "Since we are dealing with plain text input documents, however, and wish to keep the adopted approach as generalizable as possible, this feature has not been taken into account.",
        "Since the main goal of our parser is to identify canonical references by isolating them from the surrounding context, both positive and negative training examples are needed.",
        "Indeed, provided two token sequences where the first contains just a canonical reference (e.g., \"Od.",
        "9.216-535\") and the second additionally includes some tokens from the context phrase (e.g.,\"Od.",
        "9.216-535, cfr.",
        "p.",
        "29.",
        "\"), without a negative training phrase both token sequences would have the same degree ofsim-ilarity.",
        "When weighted by the CRF model the result would be that both sequences would share the same number of features with one of the references of the positive training.",
        "But since other sequences presenting features from both the positive and negative training were included in the training, and since such sequences were labelled as \"non-references\", the end result is that a token sequence with some tokens from a context phrase will be less similar to a pure canonical reference.",
        "The first step of the training phase is the extraction of token features and the identification of unique patterns of token features.",
        "At this stage the processing units are the tokens of a reference.",
        "Given a dataset of canonical references, each reference is firstly tokenized and each token is then assigned 9 labels containing the values for the above described features (see Section 4.1).",
        "Note that in Tab.",
        "1, 2 the labels and values of features are indicated by the abbreviations given in Tab.",
        "3.",
        "The observed combinations of feature values are then deduplicated and rearranged into unique categories that are used to classify each token (see Tab 1).",
        "These categories correspond to the uniques combinations offeatures assigned to tokens ofref-erences in the training dataset.",
        "Each category is defined by a name such as \"c6\" or \"c50\", where \"c\" simply stands for 'category'\" and \"6\" or \"50\" are unique numeric identifiers.",
        "Besides, a numerical prefix corresponding to the position of the token inside the canonical reference is then added to the category name to form the identifier.",
        "Indeed, the position of each token in the sequence is in itself meaningful information, provided that indications of the reference scope (and other reference components as well) tend to occur at the end of the token sequence.",
        "What we obtain are category identifiers such as \"1_c50\" or \"2_c6\".",
        "The second step is building the training dataset.",

        "In a similar way, a canonical reference parser can be trained on a particular citation style in order to tailor it to a consistent corpus of texts with consequent improvements on the overall performances.",
        "Finally, since the task of automatic extraction of canonical references has never been explored before, we hope that in the future more resources will be available for this task (such as training datasets, golden standards, performance measure to be compared, etc.",
        "), analogous to those already existing for other more common tasks, like named entity recognition or the extraction and labeling of modern bibliographic references.",
