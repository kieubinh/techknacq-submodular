        "It is a big challenge for computational semantics of dialogue that much of the meaning of an utterance is conveyed not just through the compositional meanings of the words themselves, but in relation to the situation in which the utterance is performed, including the background knowledge, common ground, goals, and ontologies of the participants.",
        "A number of pragmatic principles have been proposed to bridge this gap, including Grice's maxims (and the associated concepts of Implicature and Relevance) [6], Accommodation [12] and Bridging [2].",
        "*This work was sponsored by the U.S. Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM).",
        "Statements and opinions expressed do not necessarily reflect the position or the policy of the United States Government, and no official endorsement should be inferred.",
        "While these principles can provide elegant explanations of how meaning can be conveyed between people, they often require fairly strong assumptions about the common knowledge between participants and the ontologies that this knowledge must be organized in.",
        "There are two general problems in developing computational accounts of these phenomena.",
        "First, it is sometimes difficult to specify the required knowledge and relationships in a computational way, such that a reasoner given the input and context can compute a particular, specific meaning as opposed to other possibilities that are not as appropriate.",
        "Second, even if the principles are sufficiently clear so that a computational account can be formulated, there may still be a problem providing a given computational dialogue system with the appropriate knowledge to carry out the inferences in a way that is congruent with human interpretations.",
        "For a hand-constructed limited domain, the system designer will often take shortcuts and represent only the knowledge that is necessary to carry out and understand tasks in that domain.",
        "These limitations often render the dialogue system unable to reason about the domain in as much detail as a knowledgeable human would, but often this characterization is sufficient for the purposes of the conversation.",
        "In this paper we examine one aspect of computational non-compositional meaning: the pragmatic meaning of comparative constructions.",
        "Comparative constructions are common in dialogue, especially in negotiative dialogue where a choice must be made between different options, and options must be evaluated using multiple metrics.",
        "Comparatives explicitly assert a relationship between two elements along a scale, but they may also implicate positions on the scale especially if either information about the position of one of the compared items or constraints on the possible values are present.",
        "Dialogue systems must often understand more from a comparative than the explicit assertion in order to understand why the comparative was uttered; why it is relevant to the dialogue.",
        "In the next section, we present linguistic background on comparatives and conversational implicature.",
        "In section 3, we review some issues of how implicatures play out in dialogue in which multiple participants are involved, and a listener can clarify a lack of understanding.",
        "In section 4, we introduce the computational framework in which the present work is implemented.",
        "In section 5, we present extensions to this framework which provide the computational agents with the ability to understand implicatures arising from comparatives.",
        "In section 6 we evaluate this with respect to the scenario of SASO-EN [15], in which an army captain, a doctor, and a town elder discuss the best location for a medical clinic.",

        "In this section we review some of the previous work on comparatives constructions and conversational implicatures in order to establish the necessary theoretical basis for the discussion on comparative implicatures in the rest of the paper.",
        "In the classical literature on semantics of natural language comparatives (see e.g., [4]), comparative constructions such as (1) are analyzed as a relation between two degrees as in (2).",
        "(1) Downtown is safer than the market.",
        "(2) Degree to which downtown is safe > Degree to which the market is safe.",
        "The problem now, of course, is what a degree is and what are the properties of the relation >.",
        "Abstractly, a degree can be considered just as a collection of objects - the collection of those objects that share the same degree with respect to a given property P. These collections are denned as the equivalence classes of the equivalence relation =p, which in turn is defined in terms of an order >p among objects.",
        "The relation > among degrees is denned as a lifting of >p to the set of equivalent classes of =p.",
        "Finally, scales are denned in terms of degrees, a scale Sp is a sequence of degrees of P ordered by the relation >.",
        "Summing up then, once we know what >p is for a property P we know what degrees of P are and how to compare them on scale Sp.",
        "All is good and well, but this approach assumes the relation >p as given.",
        "Such a strong assumption was already criticized by [9] and certainly cannot be made in a dialogue system where information about the domain of discourse (in particular, any order >p for a given property P) is incomplete and is constructed (and negotiated) during the dialogue.",
        "As dialogue system builders, the issue that interests us is, not so much how to determine the truth value of a particular comparative utterance, but mainly how comparatives contribute to the construction of the information about the domain.",
        "So, for our task it is crucial to figure out \"where do scales come from?\"",
        "Modelling how listeners draw inferences from what they hear is a basic problem for the theories of understanding natural language.",
        "An important part of the information conveyed is inferred, as in the following classical example by Grice [6]:",
        "(3) A: I am out of petrol.",
        "B: There is a garage around the corner.",
        "~> B thinks that the garage is open and has petrol to sell.",
        "B's answer conversationally implicates information that is relevant to A.",
        "In Grice's terms, B made a relevance implicature, he would be flouting Grice's maxim of relevance unless he believes that the garage is open.",
        "A conversational implicature (CI) is different from an entailment in that it is cancelable without contradiction (B can append material that is inconsistent with the CI -\"but I don't know whether it's open\").",
        "Since the CI can be cancelled, B knows that it does not necessarily hold and then both B or A are able to reinforce it (or negotiate it) without repetition.",
        "CIs are non-conventional, they are not part of the conventional meaning of the words but calculable from their utterance in context given the nature of conversation as a goal-oriented enterprise.",
        "Scalar implicatures are a type of CI that are particularly relevant to this paper since they involve the use of scales, as comparatives do.",
        "These implicatures are inferred on the basis of the assumption that the speaker is trying to make his utterance sufficiently informative for the current purposes of the exchange.",
        "A typical example is:",
        "(4) A is hungry (and B knows it).",
        "A: Did somebody eat the brownies that I bought this morning?",
        "B: Fred ate some of them.",
        "~> B thinks that Fred didn't eat all of them, there are some left.",
        "Theories of scalar implicature have been deeply influenced by Horn's dissertation work [8].",
        "A Horn scale is an ordered sequence of expressions such as (some, many, most, all) and (warm, hot, scalding).",
        "The recipe to calculate the scalar implicature is the following.",
        "The use of a weaker word in the scale (such as some) implicates that (the speaker believes that) the stronger form (such as all) is not the case, as exemplified in (4).",
        "However, there are cases in which such a recipe does not apply, such as in (5).",
        "(5) A realizes that the brownies were injected with strychnine and suspects that somebody may have eaten from them (and B knows it).",
        "A: Did somebody eat the brownies that I bought this morning?",
        "B: Fred ate some of them.",
        "In this example the scalar implicature is (at the very least) less likely to arise, it's not relevant for the current purposes of the exchange; it doesn't matter how many brownies Fred ate, he needs medical attention.",
        "Comparing (4) and (5) we can see that conversational implicatures are affected by the conversational goals.",
        "We believe this to be an starting point for answering the question left open in Section 2.1: \"Where do scales come from?\"",

        "In this Section we are going to introduce comparative implicatures and to develop two lines of thought introduced in the previous section, but now in the context of dialogue.",
        "First, we relate the cancellability and negotiability of CIs and clarification requests in dialogue.",
        "It's often controversial whether something is actually a CI or not (people sometimes have different intuitions).",
        "Dialogue provide us with an extra tools for identifying the participants' beliefs about implicatures: feedback and negotiation of CIs.",
        "Listeners can give both positive (e.g. acknowledgements) and negative (e.g. clarification requests) feedback about their understanding and the acceptability of utterances, which can shed light on how they interpret CIs.",
        "Moreover, speakers can negotiate whether something is really implicated, or whether an implicature is meant by the speaker.",
        "We also investigate the fact that conversational implicatures change when the conversational goals change.",
        "Conversational goals establish structure on the information that is being discussed, determining which distinctions are relevant and which are not for the a given interaction.",
        "In dialogue, a useful way to spot content that was meant but not actually said is to look at the kinds of dialogue feedback that is given.",
        "Clarification requests are one important part of this - focusing on cases where the initial listener is not sure of what the speaker means.",
        "Here we use the phrase clarification requests in its broad sense, including all those questions that would not make sense without the previous utterance in the dialogue.",
        "Many times the clarification requests make the implicatures explicit, this is illustrated by the fact that the clarification request in (6) can follow Grice's example in (3).",
        "Here we present clarifications as a test that helps us identify not only the potential conversational implicatures but also the presuppositions in a dialogue.",
        "(7) is an example of a well studied case of inferrable content: the presupposition triggered by definite descriptions.",
        "In this exchange, A might believe that the intended referent is salient for different reasons: because it was mentioned before, because it's bigger, etc.",
        "If such a piece of information is available to B then he will be able to infer the presupposition and add it to the conversational record.",
        "Otherwise, B might well signal A that the presupposition did not get through, like in (7).",
        "(7) There are 100 cups on a table.",
        "A: Pick up THE cup.",
        "B: Which cup?",
        "(I don't know which one you are referring to.)",
        "The presence of a conversational implicature must be capable of being worked out, so the hearer might well inquire about them.",
        "The speaker will have to answer and support the implicature if he wants to get it added to the common ground.",
        "In [13], the authors present a study of the different kinds of clarification requests (CRs) found in a dialogue corpus.",
        "Their results show that the most frequent CRs in their corpus (51.74%) are due to problems with referring expressions (such as example (7)) and the second most common (22.17%) are examples like the following.",
        "(8) A: Turn it on.",
        "B: By pushing the red button?",
        "Here, the CR made explicit a potential requirement for the performance of the requested action.",
        "By saying \"Turn it on\" A meant that B had to push the red button but this was not explicitly mentioned in the command uttered by A.",
        "Such an implicature can be inferred from knowledge about the task (or in Clark terms, from knowledge about the interaction level of joint action [3]).",
        "From this examples it should be clear that implicated content is a rich source of CRs.",
        "As described in Section 2, comparative sentences explicitly claim an ordering of two items on a relevant scale.",
        "However, with more context, a comparative can implicate degrees on a scale as well.",
        "If we know the degree of one of the items then we have a fixed range for the other item.",
        "If this range contains only one possible degree, then the comparative also sets the degree for this item.",
        "In the simplest possible scale in which a comparative could be applied, there are only two degrees, and a comparative indicates the degrees of each item even without more knowledge of the degrees of either item.",
        "For example, consider (9) inspired by [5]:",
        "(9) B is drawing and A is giving instructions to B: A: Draw two squares, one bigger than the other.",
        "B: Done.",
        "A: Now, paint the small square blue and the big one red.",
        "~> A thinks that one of the squares can be described as small and the other as big.",
        "The question remains, however, of how the scales are selected?",
        "These are not generalized implicatures that always arise.",
        "Every time we say \"Fred is taller than Tom\" we don't mean that \"Fred is tall\" and \"Tom is short\".",
        "As discussed in Section 2, conversational implicatures are affected by conversational goals.",
        "We believe that this is the path that we have to follow in order to explain comparative implicatures as particularized implicatures.",
        "Predicates such as tall and small are vague in that they can refer to different ranges of a scale and in fact different scales.",
        "Small refers to size, which as a default we might think of as a continuous scale measure, however, as in the example above, we might prefer to use a simpler scale.",
        "This phenomena was already noticed by [7] who says:",
        "There is a range of structures we can impose on scales.",
        "These map complex scales into simpler scales.",
        "For example, in much work in qualitative physics the actual measurement of some parameter may be anything on the real line, but this is mapped into one of three values - positive, zero, and negative.",
        "How are such structures over scales denned?",
        "The intuitive idea is that the structure only distinguishes those values that are relevant for the goals of the agent; that is when the attribute takes a particular value, it plays a causal role in deciding whether some agent's goal can be achieved or not.",
        "In the example above, we have only small and big as relevant values for size, and a comparative in this context will implicate that we are using this binary scale as well as the degrees that each of the items of comparison have."

        "Our implementation captures the intuition that the relevant values of the properties in a domain are those that are causally related to the agent's goals.",
        "This is used in order to construct or locate appropriate scales and infer useful implicatures that interact with the dialogue structure in different ways.",
        "However, not all the predictions achieved by such an implementation are explainable and further refinement is needed.",
        "Consider the following dialogue:",
        "(21) C: Downtown is safer than the market C: The US base is safer than downtown",
        "If we apply the inference rules developed in Section 5 to this exchange, which implicature gets through will depend on the order in which the utterances in (21) are said.",
        "If they are said in the order shown in (21) then the implicature that downtown is safe will get through; if they are uttered in the opposite order, then the implicature that downtown is not safe will get through.",
        "We leave the study of these kinds of interactions to further work.",
        "It is clear that treating conversational implicatures in dialogue is a complex problem, and that it interacts in relevant ways with other key features of dialogue, namely positive and negative evidence of understanding.",
        "It is important that the theory of implicatures acknowledges the fact that conversational implicatures are a phenomena that arises in conversation and that then needs to be studied in its environment to be fully understood.",
        "This paper starts by motivating this big picture, and then relates it to the semantic theory of comparatives and the pragmatic theory of implicatures in order to address the practical problem of comparative implicatures that arises in an implemented dialogue agent."
