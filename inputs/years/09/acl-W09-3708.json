        "There are two problems in extracting and understanding mental states.",

        "Second, mental states extracted from natural language need to be encoded in some representation form and can be retrieved for further inference.",
        "There exists many systems that implements nested evolving beliefs (e.g. [1]), but they generally lacked the ability to draw inference directly from natural language.",
        "In this paper, we propose an approach to extract and represent mental states based on different mental contexts such as one's belief, intention and supposition.",
        "Our approach utilizes the mental spaces theory [4] in cognitive linguistics.",
        "Our goal for the mental state extraction step is to identify space-builders that establish new mental contexts (or spaces) or the ones that refer to an existing mental context.",

        "Regarding these goals, Scone provides default reasoning with exceptions.",
        "As we have shown, Scone can be viewed as a semantic network representation, with nodes representing entities and links representing relations or statements tied to these entities.",
        "At a higher level, the types in Scone may be viewed as frames or descriptions.",
        "A multi-context and context activation mechanism is designed into Scone using the marker-passing algorithm [3].",
        "In this paper, a context is used to represent the state of mental attitudes.",
        "In Scone, the context nodes are treated as the other nodes in that they are also tied into their own inheritance hierarchy using \"sub-context\" links.",
        "However, the \"sub-context\" relation represented by inheritance is a mechanical one.",
        "The relation between the two contexts is neither \"is-a\" nor \"part-of\", but something more like \"is a clone of, modulo explicit changes\".",
        "Contexts can also be used to represent the state of a changing world at different times.",
        "Each of the contexts represents a mental attitude at a specific time; it begins as a clone of the state in the previous time-step, and then we can add or remove a few items if necessary.",
        "In general, the mental context model tracks the changes of the mental state [2].",
        "At each time point, it builds a mental context network that represents nested mental states.",

        "The complex semantics of a psych-term is factored into a set of atomic operations on single mental contexts through semantic decomposition.",
        "These contexts are organized into a hierarchical structure, which constitutes a simplified representation of human memory.",
        "The semantics of psych-terms are projected onto the context network through semantic decomposition.",
        "For example, one sense of the word \"pretend\" can be represented as \"X is not present in reality and person Pi's belief, but PI wants person P2 to believe it\" (these semantic definitions are restricted to mental contexts).",
        "This example involves several contexts: the reality, the belief of PI, the intention of PI, the belief of P2 under the intention of PI, as well as the before context and the after context of \"pretend\".",
        "Note that the mental operations are higher order, so there can be other psych-terms (e.g. \"want\") embedded the definition of \"pretend\".",
        "Mental operations update the mental context network in two aspects.",

        "For example, in the \"Little Red-Cap\" story, little redcap has different belief contexts at different time.",
        "By default, each of the newly updated versions of one's belief would inherit from his/her most recent belief.",

        "The second column (\"argument error\") gives the percentage of incorrect question-answer pairs caused by wrong arguments in the mental operations.",

        "For example, when given sentence \"Dig for it if you want the gold\", our system would only look at \"you want the gold\" and treat it as a valid statement, without noticing that it is embedded in an if-clause which indicates another mental space.",
        "Ambiguity error (the fifth column) refers to errors cause by the lexical ambiguity of psych-terms (e.g. the word \"will\" indicates future tense in \"Pilly will go to school tomorrow\", but not in \"Some sharks will eat just about anything\").",
        "Negation error (the sixth column) occurs when there is a negation that has been neglected (this results in an incorrect answer).",
        "For example \"It will do him no good, neither will it help anybody else\" means \"It will not help anybody else\".",
