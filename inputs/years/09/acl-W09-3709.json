        "questions.",

        "Procedural texts follow a number of structural criteria, whose realization may depend on the author's writing abilities, on the target user, and on traditions associated with a given domain.",
        "Procedural texts can be regulatory, procedural, programmatory, prescriptive or injunctive.",
        "We have developed a quite detailed analysis of procedural texts from a manual corpus analysis, identifying their main basic components as well as their global structure.",
        "For that purpose, we have defined two levels: a segmentation level that basically identifies structures considered as terminal structures (titles, instructions, prerequisites, connectors, etc.)",
        "and a grammar level that binds these terminal structures to give a global structure to procedural texts (Delpech et al.",
        "2008) (Fontan et al.",
        "2008).",
        "This structure is textual and dedicated only to elements relevant to procedurality.",
        "Our study was carried out on a development corpus of 1700 French texts taken from the Web from most of the areas cited above, and extracted from our more global corpus of 8000 texts.",
        "Procedural texts are complex structures, they often exhibit a quite complex rational (the instructions) and 'irrational' structure which is mainly composed of advices, conditions, preferences, evaluations, user stimulations, etc.",
        "They form what we call the explanation structure, which motivates and justifies the goal-instructions structure, viewed as the backbone of procedural texts.",
        "A number of these elements are forms of argumentation, they appear to be very useful, sometimes as important as instructions: they provide a strong and essential internal cohesion and coherence to procedural texts.",
        "They also indicate, among other things, the consequences on the target goal of an incorrect or incomplete execution of the associated instruction.",
        "A conceptual and operational semantics for procedural texts can be derived from these considerations, where, in fact, what is essential is to model the complexity of a procedure, the risks, and a series of indicators of the difficulty to reach the goal.",
        "As an illustration, consider the cooking receipe extract in Figure 1 (our work is realized on French, with English glosses), describing the preparation of a pizza, arguments are in italics.",
        "As the reader can note, warnings and advices operate at various levels, some are general recommendations, while others clearly indicate the risks of a failure, complete or partial, if the instruction is not correctly carried out."

        "Add 1 cup of flour to the mixture and whisk in until fully dissolved, otherwise you'll get lumps later .",
        "Add the second cup of flour and whisk it in until the mixture is smooth, alternatively, you can add the flour gradually.",

        "Be patient, folding the dough mixture in on itself, over and over again.",
        "to one of its main language realizations: procedural texts.",
        "Since argumentation is a major feature of procedural texts it will play a major role in our modelling.",
        "We then develop the main facets of a conceptual semantics for procedural texts, with a focus on the measure of the success in reaching a goal, based on arguments.",
        "This leads us to investigate measures of instructions complexity and expliciteness.",
        "The second part of the paper is an experiment showing how complexity and expliciteness can be dealt with in order to guarantee a higher success rate to the procedure using textual integration.",
        "Roughly, argumentation is a process that allows speakers to construct statements for or against another statement called the conclusion.",
        "These former statements are called supports.",
        "The general form of an argument is : Conclusion 'because' Support (noted as C because S).",
        "In natural language, conclusions usually appear before the support, but they may also appear after, to stress the support.",
        "A conclusion may receive several supports, possibly of different natures (advices and warnings): don't add natural fertilizer, this may attract insects, which will damage your young plants.",
        "Arguments may be more or less strong, they bear in general a certain weight, mostly induced from the words they contain or from their syntactic construction (Anscombre et al.",
        "1981), (Moeschler 1985), (Amgoud et ali.",
        "2001).",
        "In natural contexts, this weight is somewhat vague and therefore quite difficult to precisely evaluate.",
        "In procedural texts, arguments are associated with instructions or groups of related instructions (that we call instructional compounds).",
        "Contrary to works in artificial intelligence, arguments appear here in isolation, they do not attack each other, they simply contribute to the success of the goal the procedure encodes.",
        "Let G be a goal which can be reached by the sequence of instructions Ai, i G [l,n].",
        "We will not go here into the details of their exact temporal structure, which is often basically sequential.",
        "A correct execution of all the instructions guarantees the success of the goal G.",
        "Let us then assume that any Ai is associated with a support Si (possibly not realized).",
        "The absence of an explicit support does not mean that the instruction is not important, but simply that failing to realize it has obvious consequences on the goal G. A procedure is then a temporally ordered sequence of Ai Si.",
        "Let us next associate with every instruction Ai Si (or, instructional compound, no distinction is made in this paper) a vector (pi, §i, di, U) where:",
        "• pi is the associated penalty when the user, for a given execution, partly or fully fails to realize Ai,",
        "• §i is the gain associated with Af.",
        "there is a gain only in case where Ai is an advice, aimed at improving the quality of G,",
        "• di is the intrinsic difficulty of the instruction Ai,",
        "• ti is the degree of explicitness of Ai.",
        "These parameters are obviously quite difficult to elaborate.",
        "This is developed in the next subsections.",
        "Let us concentrate here on the realization of the goal G, and on measuring its success, given a certain execution U by a user.",
        "It is important to note that failing to properly realize an instruction does not necessarily mean that the goal cannot be reached, but the result of the procedure won't be as nice as it could have been.",
        "In the natural language expressions of conclusions (the Aj) as well as of supports, there are many modals or classes of verbs (like risk verbs) that indeed modulate those consequences on G, contrast for example:",
        "use professional products to clean your leathers, they will give them a brighter aspect, with:",
        "carefully plug in your mother card vertically, otherwise you will most likely damage its connectors.",
        "In the latter case, the goal 'mounting your own PC' is likely to fail if the instruction is not correctly realized (the instruction at stake will be assigned a high penalty), whereas in the former, the goal 'cleaning your leathers' will just be less successful in a certain sense, where there is an explicit gain associated if professional products are used.",
        "These parameters and their language realizations are studied in (Fontan et al.",
        "2008).",
        "Given a certain realization by a user, the success of a goal G can be evaluated by the sum of the gains on the one hand, and the sum of the penalties on the other hand.",
        "Gains and penalties a priori do not compensate each other: they operate at different levels.",
        "Since any Ai is in fact realized successfully to a certain degree by the user for a given an execution U, gains and penalties need to be weighted for that execution, i.e. paired with a success measure for each instruction.",
        "Let us introduce respectively Hi and Ti for gains and penalties on Ai, each of these weights being included in [0,1].",
        "Then, for a given execution of the goal G, we have:",
        "gain(G) = Yh=i 9i x V>u penalty(G) = Yh=i Pi x r* 3.3 Elaborating penalties and gains",
        "A penalty is equal to 0 when the action is correctly realized.",
        "Otherwise it has a positive value.",
        "Gains are also positive values and are only associated with advices (optional instructions), therefore, gains are positive only when advice are executed, otherwise they are null.",
        "The difficulty is to elaborate a model that can describe in a simple way the form penalties may have.",
        "For that purpose, and as a first experimentation, we introduce a three place vector representing three types of execution levels, to which penalty costs can be associated.",
        "The vector represents penalities according to three levels of success for an instructions: (good execution, average, failure).",
        "To make it representative of the various importance of the instructions in a procedure, we introduce four levels of importance:",
        "- Essential action, with vector: (0, N, infinite), - Optionnal action : (0,0,0).",
        "The value of N remains a parameter that needs to be adjusted experimentally.",
        "In case of an essential action, failure entails the goal failure, since the value of the penalty is infinite.",
        "The four levels of importance of actions is a parameter quite frequently encountered in experimental psychology, didactics and cognitive ergonomy when users have to evaluate the importance of a task, e.g. in emergency stituations.",
        "For each instruction, the level of importance can be estimated from the terms in the instruction (illocutionary force captured in warnings) or be specified by the author of the text, e.g. via appropriate devices like icons, which abound in large public procedural texts.",
        "We can have a similar characterization for gains:",
        "- No advice (0, 0, 0).",
        "The value of N needs also to be experimentally elaborated.",
        "It is of much interest to be able to measure the inherent complexity or difficulty of an instruction.",
        "This notion obviously depends on the reader, and may be somewhat dependent on the other actions around it.",
        "Nevertheless, we think that some features introduce in any situation some inherent difficulties.",
        "We give here some elements found in procedures identified as introducing some complexity, independently of the domain at stake.",
        "Those elements are essentially structures like verbs, PPs and adverbs.",
        "Considering that procedural texts must limit as much as possible the distance between the text and the action (they are oriented towards action, not inferencing), we have identified elements inducing complexity by asking users to indicate and possibly comment every indication in instructions for which they had to make an elaboration (imagine a gesture, identify a tool among a set of closely related tools, evaluate a manner (slowly, cautiously), etc.).",
        "The protocol is simple and informal, but nevertheless gives interesting indications for parameters inducing complexity.",
        "The most frequently encountered parameters are, informally:",
        "• presence of 'complex' manners (e. g. very slowly), by complex we mean",
        "either a manner which is inherently difficult to realize or a manner reinforced by an adverb of intensity,",
        "• technical complexity of the verb or the verb compound used: if most instructions include a verb which is quite simple, some exhibit quite technical verbs, metaphorical uses, or verbs applied to unexpected situations, for which an elaboration is needed.",
        "This is for example relatively frequent in cooking (with specialised verbs like 'réserver' which have a different meaning than the standard one), or in do-it-yourself texts written by technicians of the domain.",
        "• duration of execution as specified in the instruction (the longer the more difficult),",
        "• synchronization between actions, in particular in instructional compounds,",
        "• uncommon tools, or uncommon uses of basic tools (open the box with a sharp knife),",
        "• presence of evaluation statements or resulting states, for example to indicate the termination of the action (as soon as the sauce turns brown add flour).",
        "At the moment, we have lists of a priori complex verbs and manners for each domain collected from our development corpus.",
        "The task is to organize these terms by increasing complexity, via the design of adequate scales.",
        "Manners are relatively limited and have been ordered manually quite easily.",
        "For larger groups of terms, we can also simply form groups of terms classified according to complexity, without introducing scales and accurate order analysis.",
        "Obviously, these observations allow us to introduce a very preliminary measure of complexity, since more empirical measures need to be realized.",
        "To be able to have an indicative evaluation, each of the points above counts for 1, independently of its importance or strength in the text.",
        "Complexity c therefore ranges from 0 to 6.",
        "The complexity rate di of instruction i is c/6 to keep it in the [0,1] range.",
        "It is important to note that the higher the difficulty di is, the more risky the instruction is in terms of failure.",
        "Since it is not in general easy to decompose a difficult action into several simpler ones, a strategy to limit risks is to enrich a difficult instruction as much as possible so that all the details are given: this can be measured by the expliciteness criteria.",
        "Expliciteness characterizes the degree of accuracy of an instruction.",
        "Several marks, independently of the domain, contribute to making more explicit an instruction:",
        "• when appropriate: existence of means or instruments,",
        "• pronominal references as minimal as possible, and predicate argument constructions as comprehensive as possible,",
        "• length of action explicit when appropriate (stir during 10 minutes),",
        "• list of items to consider as explicit and low level as possible (mix the flour with the sugar, eggs and oil),",
        "• presence of an argument, advice or warning,",
        "• presence of some help elements like images, diagrams, or elaborations, variants, etc.",
        "Those criteria may be dependent on the domain, for example length of an action is very relevant in cooking, somewhat in do-it-yourself, and much less in the society domain.",
        "Similarly as for d, each item counts for 1 at the moment, expliciteness e therefore ranges from 0 to 6.",
        "The expliciteness rate is ti = e/6 to keep it in the [0,1] range.",
        "Note also that the higher ti is, the more chances the instruction has to succeed since it is very explicit and has a lot of details.",
        "Now, if we consider the product di x (1 – ti), the more it tends towards 1, the higher the risk is for the action to fail.",
        "Therefore, when di is high, it is also necessary that U is high to compensate the difficulty.",
        "Given that di remains unchanged (if the instruction cannot be simplified), the strategy is then to increase U as much as possible."

        "We will concentrate here on the first, which is probably the less complex.",
        "By adding information, we mean in particular adding a role not specified so far (e.g. instrument, duration) or updating an already existing data (e.g. cheese + mozarella – > 'cheese, e.g. mozarella', the symbol '+' being in this paper the integration operator).",
        "In this section, we focus on texts which are prototypically procedural such as cooking receipes, do-it-yourself, gardening, etc... We propose some criteria to select a reference procedure among a choice of procedures related to the same goal.",

        "We defined them from thematic roles and stabilized their definition and scope from a number observations over manual annotations.",

        "They can also be persons in the social relation domain.",
        "Manner: indicates how the action is carried out, it does not modify the theme, but indicates the way the instruction must be realized (serrez la poigne d'un demi tour., turn the handle of half a tour).",
        "Means: identifies the entity via which the action is realized, this entity is in general an element that interacts with the theme in some way, e.g. to form a whole with it (arroser les endives avec jus, put sauce on the endives).",
        "Instrument: the object used to realize an action, controlled by the agent, and that participates at various degrees to the sucess of the action.",
        "Goal: refers to the abstract or concrete objective towards which the action is directed.",
        "Result: refers to the expression that characterizes the consequence of the action (make notes of your expenses to be able to evaluate how much you spend over a week).",
        "Condition: expression that indicates the constraints under which the action can be realized or should be considered.",
        "Localization: source, fixed or destination applied to time or space, possibly to abstract entities.",

        "The other roles are quite difficult to compare in the cooking domain and are so far kept in level 3.",
        "For each tagged role which is comparable, a mark is given that takes into account the level of the tag (1 to 3 above).",
        "The mark we get per aligned argument (k) in instructions Ar^ (the instruction from the referent text) and Aej (the one from the enriching text) is: m-k = f(AR^k, AEjyk) where /(Ar^, AEj,k) is the metrics that assigns a similarity measure for the argument k, as indicated above.",
        "The global rate associated with n arguments successfully aligned between the two instructions is: MAi = £?=i Pi x rrn where p is the weight that corresponds to the three categories of roles given in the paragraph above.",
        "The global alignement rate is then: rate(AR>i,AE,j) = axVAi + P x MAi/n.",
        "where a and (3 encode respectively the relative importance of verbs and the arguments in the alignment.",
        "These parameters need to be adjusted experimentally.",
        "At the moment, they are both equal to 1, meaning that the verb and the arguments in total have the same weight in the alignment rate.",
        "As can be noted, we do not take into account at this level the possible negative effects of arguments not aligned, since they may contain, in fact, useful information to add to the reference text.",
        "All the instructions in R and E that can potentially align are compared, independently of the temporal relations in the texts.",
        "As a result a matrix containing all the alignement rates is produced.",
        "For each instruction in R, the best rate, if it is above a certain minimal threshold, is considered and the corresponding instruction in E is considered for information integration.",
        "In the case where there are several instructions in E which can be aligned with an instruction in R, then two factors are considered, in the following priority order:",
        "- whether these instructions also have good alignement rates with other instructions in R, in which case, they may be selected for alignement with one of these other instructions, - whether they temporally coincide in the sequence of instructions in R and",
        "E. It should however be noted that, although procedural texts have a strong, but simple, temporal structure, we observed many permutations which make this criteria less strong than it could have been.",
        "At this stage, it is quite difficult to evaluate the accuracy of the aligne-ment strategy since we do not cover all the cases, which may entail errors.",
        "However, considering just the cases where we have a one-to-one aligne-ment strategy, over cooking and gardening domains, tested on 14 reference-enriching pairs of texts (with an average of 18 instructions for reference texts), we get a recall of about 74% for a precision of about 90%.",
        "Those results are quite encouraging, but we need to analyze the reasons of errors.",
        "We observed more complex cases where alignement must be realized on the basis of patterns, i.e. groups of instructions (possibly discontinuous) and not single, isolated instructions.",
        "This is in particular the case with iterative structures (stir again for one minute) which are repeated with variants.",
        "We have not explored these situations, but it is clear that the detection of such patterns is an important aspect.",
        "Given two aligned instructions, the next step is to add information to the reference document instruction Ar.",
        "The verb in Ar is kept, while the information which is added is basically the tagged elements, which are arguments or adjuncts.",
        "All the tagged elements in the enriching document instruction (Ae) are considered, even if Ar already has an element based on the same tag.",
        "Let us define an integration operator, noted as '+', composed of a left context element, fragment of Ar, and a right context, fragment of Ae- The result is an enriched instruction.",
        "This operation is monotonic: the amount of information resulting from one or more applications of information integration is always increasing.",
        "Adding information follows a strategy with two main aspects:",
        "(1) parameterized adjunction: of missing elements (tags not present in Ar), according to two parameters:",
        "- information explicity requested by the user (if this possibility is offered), such as instruments, - information a priori essential to a domain: for example adding tools, manners and durations is important in cooking to make instructions more explicit, and therefore less difficult to realize.",
        "Duration may be less relevant in do-it yourself texts.",
        "(2) integrating already existing information: in Ar, where the three following points are treated so far:",
        "- disjunctive knowledge integration: add (soya milk + rice milk) – > add soya or rice milk.",
        "- exemplification: add (cheese + mozarella) – > add cheese, for example mozarella.",
        "- blocking ill-formed configurations: for example, in the case of incorporation: (butter the bread + with butter – > butter the bread) 'with butter' is not included because the noun butter is already incorporated into the verb.",
        "Let us now consider the surface realization of the resulting enriched instruction.",
        "For the first aspect above, this process starts from the tagged elements so that a correct linguistic realization can be produced.",
        "We do not just copy and paste the additional information to Ar, but, based on the annotated elements, we introduce insertion rules, that indicate where the information must be inserted into the proposition.",
        "For example, [stir manner: gently duration: for 4 minutes] + [theme: the sauce] must be realized as:",
        "[stir manner: gently theme: the sauce duration: for 4 minutes] where the theme is inserted between the manner and the duration.",
        "The resulting instruction is then:",
        "Stir gently the sauce during 4 minutes.",
        "This is realized by an insertion rule that says:",
        "Verb (mannenX duration:Y) + (theme:Z) – > Verb mannenX theme:Z duration^.",
        "From the needs in terms of integration and from the observation of the structure of instructions, we have defined at the moment 19 insertion rules.",
        "These are now being generalized so that more generic situations can be captured.",
        "In particular, we rephrased these rules in terms well-formedness conditions essentially based on thematic linear precedence, a widely used approach in language generation:",
        "instrument < duration, meaning that any instrument always precedes a duration expression.",
        "Similarly, we have: theme < instrument, duration, localization.",
        "In this approach, we keep the 'base' form used in most instructions since there is almost never any syntactic alternation.",
        "These precedence specifications are very close to thematic role hierarchies, except that we deal here also with a number of adjuncts (goals, manners, etc.)",
        "that may occupy a large number of positions in the instruction.",
        "These adjuncts are however subject to constraints, e.g.: goal, condition < manner, means, result.",
        "Finally, we apply the 'heavy-NP shift' movement when the argument is large, for example a long theme will be moved at the end of the instruction.",
        "At the visualization level, integrated information is underlined so that the user knows that it has been imported, and may consider it with some care or may get the original enriching instruction."
