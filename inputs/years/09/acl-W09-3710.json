        "Textual inference plays an important role in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as question answering [7].",
        "In recent years, the recognizing textual entailment (RTE) [4] challenge, which focuses on detecting semantic inference, has attracted a lot of attention.",
        "Given a text T (several sentences) and a hypothesis H (one sentence), the goal is to detect if H can be inferred from T.",
        "Studies such as [3] attest that lexical substitution (e.g. synonyms, antonyms) or simple syntactic variation accounts for the entailment only in a small number of pairs.",
        "Thus, one essential issue is to identify more complex expressions which, in appropriate contexts, convey the same (or similar) meaning.",
        "More generally, we are also interested in pairs of expressions in which only a unidirectional inference relation holds.",
        "A typical example is the following RTE pair in which accelerate to in H is used as an alternative formulation for reach speed of in T.",
        "T: The high-speed train, scheduled for a trial run on Tuesday, is able to reach a maximum speed of up to 430 kilometers per hour, or 119 meters per second.",
        "H: The train accelerates to 430 kilometers per hour.",
        "One way to deal with textual inference is through rule representation, such as X wrote Y w X is author of Y.",
        "However, manually building collections of inference rules is time-consuming and it is unlikely that humans can exhaustively enumerate all the rules encoding the knowledge needed in reasoning with natural languages.",
        "Instead, an alternative is to acquire these rules automatically from large corpora.",
        "Furthermore, given such a rule collection, how to successfully use it in NLP applications is the next step to be focused on.",
        "For the first aspect, we extend and refine an existing collection of inference rules acquired based on the Distributional Hypothesis (DH).",
        "One of the main advantages of using DH is that the only input needed is a large corpus of (parsed) text.",
        "For this purpose, a hand-crafted lexical resource is used for augmenting the original inference rule collection and excluding some of the incorrect rules.",
        "For the second aspect, we focus on applying these rules to the RTE task.",
        "In particular, we use a structure representation derived from the dependency parse trees of T and H, which aims to capture the essential information they convey.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the inference rule collection we use, based on the Discovery of Inference Rules from Text (henceforth DIRT) algorithm; we also discuss previous work on applying it to the RTE task.",
        "Section 3 presents our analyses on the RTE data and discusses two issues: the lack of rules and the difficulty of finding proper ways of applying them.",
        "Section 4 proposes methods to extend and refine the rule collection aiming at the former issue.",
        "To address the latter issue, Section 5 describes the structure representation we use to identify the appropriate context for the rule application.",
        "The experiments will be presented in Section 6, followed by an error analysis and discussions in Section 7.",
        "Finally, Section 8 will conclude the paper and point out some future work."

        "A number of automatically acquired inference rule/paraphrase collections are available, such as [14].",
        "In our work we use the DIRT collection because it is the largest one and it has a relatively good accuracy (in the 50% range, [13]).",
        "In this section, we describe the DIRT algorithm for acquiring inference rules.",
        "Following that, we will overview the RTE systems which take DIRT as an external knowledge resource.",
        "The DIRT algorithm has been introduced by [10] and it is based on what is called the Extended Distributional Hypothesis.",
        "The original DH states that words occurring in similar contexts have similar meaning, whereas the extended version hypothesizes that phrases occurring in similar contexts are similar.",
        "An inference rule in DIRT is a pair of binary relations ( pattern\\(X, Y), pattern2(X, Y) ) which stand in an inference relation, patterrii and pattern are chains in Minipar [9] dependency trees while X and Y are placeholders for nouns at the end of the chains.",
        "The two patterns will constitute a candidate paraphrase if the sets of X and Y values exhibit relevant overlap.",
        "An example is the pair (X <-prevent – ► Y, X <-provide – ► protection -► against-► Y).",
        "Such rules can be denned [13] as directional relations between two text patterns with variables.",
        "The left-hand-side pattern is assumed to entail the right-hand-side pattern in certain contexts, under the same variable instantiation.",
        "The definition relaxes the intuition of inference, as we only require the entailment to hold in some but not all contexts, motivated by the fact that such inferences occur often in natural text.",
        "Intuitively such inference rules should be effective for recognizing textual entailment.",
        "However, only a small number of systems have used DIRT as a resource in the RTE-3 challenge, and the experimental results have not shown its great contribution.",
        "In [3] 's approach, semantic parsing in clause representation is performed and true entailment is decided only if every clause in the semantic representation of T semantically matches some clause in H. The only variation allowed consists of rewritings derived from WordNet and DIRT.",
        "Given the preliminary stage of this system, the overall results show very low improvement over a random classification baseline.",
        "[1] implement a proof system using rules for generic linguistic structures, lexical-based rules, and lexical-syntactic rules (which were obtained with the DIRT algorithm applied to the first CD of the Reuters RCV1 corpus).",
        "Given a premise p and a hypothesis h, the lexical-syntactic component marks all lexical noun alignments.",
        "For every pair of alignments, the paths between the two nouns are extracted, and the DIRT algorithm is applied to obtain a similarity score.",
        "If the score is above a threshold, the rule will be applied.",
        "However, these lexical-syntactic rules are only used in about 3% of the attempted proofs and for most cases there is no lexical variation.",
        "[8] use DIRT in a more relaxed manner.",
        "A DIRT rule is employed in the system if at least one of the anchors match in T and H, i.e. they use them as unary rules.",
        "However, the analysis of the system shows that the DIRT component is the least relevant one (adding 0.4% to the precision).",
        "In [11]'s system, a paraphrase substitution step is added on top of a system based on a tree alignment algorithm.",
        "The basic paraphrase substitution method follows several steps.",
        "Initially, the two patterns of a rule are matched in T and H (instantiations of the anchors X, Y do not have to match).",
        "The T tree is transformed by applying the paraphrase substitution.",
        "Following that, the transformed T tree and H tree are aligned.",
        "The coverage (proportion of aligned content words) is computed and if above some threshold, the entailment holds.",
        "The paraphrase component adds 1.0% to the result on the development set and only 0.5% to the test set, but a more detailed analysis on the interaction of this component with other components of the system is not given."

        "In this section our goal is to investigate the causes for which a resource such as DIRT fails to bring clear improvements to RTE.",
        "The issues we have encountered can be divided into two categories.",
        "Firstly, given a collection of correct inference rules, making full use of the knowledge encoded in it is not a trivial task.",
        "Secondly, some of the needed rules still lack even in a very large collection such as DIRT.",
        "Section 4 will tackle the latter issue first while Section 5 will focus on the former one.",
        "To Address this first issue, we begin with a straightforward experiment to discover the number of pairs in the RTE data which contain rules present in DIRT .",
        "Following the definition of an entailment rule, we identify RTE pairs in which patter n\\{wl,w2) and pattern2(wl,w2) are matched, one in T and the other one in H, and thus, (patterni(X,Y),pattern2(X,Y)) is an inference rule.",
        "The pair below is an example of this.",
        "T: The sale was made to pay Yukos US$ 27.5 billion tax hill, Yuganskneftegaz was originally sold for US$ 9.4 billion to a little known company Baikalfinans-group which was later bought by the Russian state-owned oil company Rosneft.",
        "H: Baikalfinansgroup was sold to Rosneft.",
        "On average, only 2% of the pairs in the RTE data are subject to such inference rules.",
        "Out of these, approximately 50% are lexical rules (one verb entailing the other) and in the rest, around 50% are present in WordNet as a synonym, hypernym or sister relation.",
        "However, given the small number of inference rules identified this way, we performed another analysis.",
        "This aims at determining an upper bound of the number of pairs featuring entailment phrases present in a collection.",
        "Given DIRT and the RTE data, we compute that in how many pairs two patterns of a paraphrase can be matched irrespectively of their anchor values.",
        "An example is the following pair,",
        "T: Libyas case against Britain and the US concerns the dispute over their demand for extradition of Libyans charged with blowing up a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie in 1988.",
        "H: One case involved the extradition of Libyan suspects in the Pan Am Lockerbie bombing.",
        "This is a case in which the rule is correct and the entailment is positive.",
        "In order to determine this, a system will have to know that Libya's case against Britain and the US in T entails one case in H. Similarly, in this context, the dispute over their demand for extradition of Libyans charged with blowing up a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie can be replaced with the extradition of Libyan suspects in the Pan Am Lockerbie bombing.",
        "Altogether X, founded in Y X launch Y X represent Z X faces menace from Y X, peace agreement for Y X, opened in Y X produce Y X work for Y X endangered by Y X is formulated to end war in Y in around 25% of the pairs, patterns of a rule can be found in this way, and many times more than one rule in a pair.",
        "However, in many of these pairs, finding out the patterns of an inference rule does not imply that the rule is truly present in that pair.",
        "Making use of the knowledge encoded with such rules is therefore, not a trivial task.",
        "If rules are used strictly in concordance with their definition, their utility is limited to a very small number of pairs.",
        "For this reason, 1) instead of forcing the anchor values to be identical as most previous works, we allow flexible rule matching (similar to [11]) and 2) furthermore, we control the rule application process using a structure representation derived from the dependency tree (Section 5).",
        "Apart from the issues underlined in the previous section, looking at the data, we find it quite clear that DIRT lacks rules that many entailment pairs require.",
        "Table 1 gives a selection of rules that are needed in some entailment pairs.",
        "The first three rows contain rules which are not structurally complex.",
        "These, however, are missing from both DIRT and also other hand-crafted resources such as WordNet (i.e. there is no short path connecting them).",
        "This is to be expected as they are rules which hold in some specific contexts, but difficult to be captured by a sense distinction of the lexical items involved.",
        "The more complex rules are even more difficult to be captured by a DIRT-like algorithm.",

        "The idea behind this is that a combination of various lexical resources is needed in order to cover the vast variety of phrases which humans can judge to be in an inference relation.",
        "In the example above, we consider the DIRT rule X face threat of Y – > X, at risk of Y (Table 2).",
        "Of course at this moment due to the lack of sense disambiguation, our method introduces lots of rules that are not correct.",
        "As one can see, expressions such as front scourge do not make any sense, therefore any rules containing this will be incorrect.",
