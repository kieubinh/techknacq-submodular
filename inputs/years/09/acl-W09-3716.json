        "In this paper, we introduce a methodology for annotating compositional operations in natural language text.",
        "Most annotation schemes encoding \"propositional\" or predicative content have focused on the identification of the predicate type, the argument extent, and the semantic role (or label) assigned to that argument by the predicate (see Palmer et al., 2005, Ruppen-hofer et al., 2006, Kipper, 2005, Burchardt et al., 2006, Ohara, 2008, Subirats, 2004).",
        "The emphasis here will be on identifying the nature of the compositional operation rather than merely annotating the surface types of the entities involved in argument selection.",
        "Consider the well-known example below.",
        "The distinction in semantic types appearing as subject in (1) is captured by entity typing, but not by any sense tagging from, e.g., FrameNet (Ruppenhofer et al., 2006) or PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005).",
        "(1) a. Mary called yesterday.",
        "b.",
        "The Boston office called yesterday.",
        "While this has been treated as type coercion or metonymy in the literature (cf. Hobbs et al., 1993 , Pustejovsky, 1991, Nunberg, 1979, Egg, 2005), the point here is that an annotation using frames associated with verb senses should treat the sentences on par with one another.",
        "Yet this is not possible if the entity typing given to the subject in (1a) is HUMAN and that given for (1b) is ORGANIZATION.",
        "The SemEval Metonymy task (Markert and Nissim, 2007) was a good attempt to annotate such metonymic relations over a larger data set.",
        "This task involved two types with their metonymic variants:",
        "(2) i.",
        "Categories for Locations: literal, place-for-people, place-for-event, place-for-product; ii.",
        "Categories for Organizations: literal, organization-for-members, organization-for-event, organization-for-product, organization-for-fa-cility.",
        "One of the limitations with this approach, however, is that, while appropriate for these specialized metonymy relations, the annotation specification and resulting corpus are not an informative guide for extending the annotation of argument selection more broadly.",
        "In fact, the metonymy example in (1) is an instance of a much more pervasive phenomenon of type shifting and coercion in argument selection.",
        "For example, in (3) below, the sense annotation for the verb enjoy should arguably assign similar values to both (3a) and (3b).",
        "(3) a. Mary enjoyed drinking her beer .",
        "b. Mary enjoyed her beer.",
        "The consequence of this, however, is that, under current sense and role annotation strategies, the mapping to a syntactic realization for a given sense is made more complex, and is, in fact, perplexing for a clustering or learning algorithm operating over subcategorization types for the verb.",
        "The theoretical foundations for compositional operations within the sentence have long been developed in considerable detail.",
        "Furthermore, type shifting and type coercion operations have been recognized as playing an important role in many formal descriptions of language, in order to maintain compositionality (cf. Partee and Rooth, 1983; Chierchia, 1998; Groe-nendijk and Stokhof, 1989; Egg, 2005; Pinkal, 1999; Pustejovsky, 1995, and many others).",
        "The goal of the present work is to: (a) create a broadly applicable specification of the compositional operations involved in argument selection; (b) apply this specification over a corpus of natural language texts, in order to encode the selection mechanisms implicated in the compositional structure of the language.",
        "The creation of a corpus that explicitly identifies the \"compositional history\" associated with argument selection will be useful to computational semantics in several respects: (a) the actual contexts within which type coercions are allowed can be more correctly identified and perhaps generalized; (b) machine learning algorithms can take advantage of the mapping as an additional feature in the training phase; and (c) some consensus might emerge on the general list of type-changing operations involved in argument selection, as the tasks are revised and enriched.",
        "For the purpose of this annotation task, we will adopt the general approach to argument selection within Generative Lexicon, as recently outlined in Pustejovsky (2006) and Asher and Pustejovsky (2006).",
        "We can distinguish the following modes of composition in natural language:",
        "(4) a.",
        "PURE SELECTION (Type Matching): the type a function requires is directly satisfied by the argument; b. ACCOMMODATION: the type a function requires is inherited by the argument; c. TYPE COERCION: the type a function requires is imposed on the argument type.",
        "This is accomplished by either:",
        "i.",
        "Exploitation: taking a part of the argument's type; ii.",
        "Introduction: wrapping the argument with the required type.",
        "Each of these will be identified as a unique relation between the predicate and a given argument.",
        "In this annotation effort, we restrict the possible relations between the predicate and a given argument to selection and coercion.",
        "A more fine-grained typology of relations may be applied at a later point.",
        "Furthermore, qualia structure values are identified in both argument selection and modification contexts.",
        "The rest of this document proceeds as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we describe our general methodology and architecture for GL annotation.",
        "Section 3 gives an overview of each of the annotation tasks as well as some details on the resulting GLML markup.",

        "In this section, we describe the set of tasks for annotating compositional mechanisms within the GL framework.",
        "The current GL markup will include the following tasks, each of which is described below in Section 3.",
        "(5) a. Mechanisms of Argument Selection: Verb-based Annotation b. Qualia in Modification Constructions c. Type Selection in Modification of Dot Objects",
        "Each GLML annotation task involves two phases: the data set construction phase and the annotation phase.",
        "The first phase consists of (1) selecting the target words to be annotated and compiling a sense inventory for each target, and (2) data extraction and preprocessing.",
        "The prepared data is then loaded into the annotation interface.",
        "During the annotation phase, the annotation judgments are entered into the database, and the adjudicator resolves disagreements.",
        "The resulting database representation is used by the exporting module to generate the corresponding XML markup, stand-off annotation, or GL logical form.",
        "These steps will differ slightly for each of the major GLML annotation tasks.",
        "For example, Task 1 focuses on annotating compositional processes between the verbs and their arguments.",
        "The first step for this task involves (1) selecting the set of target verbs, (2) compiling a sense inventory for each target, and (3) associating a type template or a set of templates with each sense.",
        "Since the objective of the task is to annotate coercion, our choices must include the verbs that exhibit the coercive behavior at least in some of their senses.",
        "At the next step, the data containing the selected target words is extracted from a corpus and preprocessed.",
        "Since the GLML annotation is intra-sentential, each extracted instance is a sentence.",
        "Sentences are parsed to identify the relevant arguments, adjuncts or modifiers for each target.",
        "The data is presented to the annotatator with the target word and the headword of the relevant phrase highlighted.",
        "Due to the complexity of the GLML annotation, we chose to use the task-based annotation architecture.",
        "The annotation environment is designed so that the annotator can focus on one facet of the annotation at a time.",
        "Thus, in Task 1, the verbs are disambiguated by the annotator in one sub-task, and the annotation of the actual compositional relationship is done in another subtask.",
        "Figure 1 shows an example of the interface for the verb-based annotation task .",
        "The type system we have chosen for annotation is purposefully shallow, but we also aimed to include types that would ease the complexity of the annotation task.",
        "The type system is not structured in a hierarchy, but rather it is presented as a set of types.",
        "For example, we include both human and animate in the type system along with physical obiect.",
        "While human is a subtype of both animate and physical object, the annotator does not need to be concerned with this.",
        "This allows the annotator to simply choose the human type when necessary rather than having to deal with type inheritance.",
        "While the set of types for GLML annotation can easily be modified, the following list is currently being used:",
        "(6) HUMAN, ANIMATE, PHYSICAL OBJECT, ARTIFACT, ORGANIZATION, EVENT, PROPOSITION, INFORMATION, SENSATION, LOCATION, TIME PERIOD, ABSTRACT ENTITY, ATTITUDE, EMOTION, PROPERTY, OBLIGATION, AND RULE"

        "In this paper, we focus on the task descriptions rather than an in depth review of the annotation interface and the resulting GLML markup.",
        "The general methodology for each task is as follows: 1) Select a target set of words and compile a sense inventory for each one, 2) Select a set of sentences for each target, 3) Disambiguate the sense of the target in a given sentence, and 4) Answer questions specific to the annotation task in order to create the appropriate GLML link.",
        "This annotation task involves choosing which selectional mechanism is used by the predicate over a particular argument.",
        "The possible relations between the predicate and a given argument will, for now, be restricted to selection and coercion.",
        "In selection, the argument NP satisfies the typing requirements of the predicate, as in The child threw the stone (physical object).",
        "Coercion encompasses all cases when a type-shifting operation (exploitation or introduction) must be performed on the complement NP in order to satisfy selectional requirements of the predicate, as in The White House (location – > human) denied this statement.",
        "An initial set of verbs and sentences containing them has been selected for annotation.",
        "For each sentence, the compositional relationship of the verb with every argument and adjunct will be annotated.",
        "The target types for each argument are provided in a type template that is associated with the sense of the verb in the given sentence.",
        "For example, one of the senses of the verb deny (glossed as \"State or maintain that something is untrue\") would have the following type template: HUMAN deny PROPOSITION.",
        "In the first subtask, the annotator is presented with a set of sentences containing the target verb and the chosen grammatical relation.",
        "The annotator is asked to select the most fitting sense of the target verb, or to throw out the example (pick the \"N/A\" option) if no sense can be chosen either due to insufficient context, because the appropriate sense does not appear in the inventory, or simply no disambiguation can be made in good faith.",
        "Next, the annotator is presented with a list of sentences in which the target verb is used in the same sense and is asked to determine whether the argument in the specified grammatical relation belongs to the type specified in the corresponding template.",
        "If the argument belongs to the appropriate type, the \"yes\" box is clicked, generating a CompLink with comp-Type=\"SELECTION\".",
        "If \"no\" is selected, a type selection menu pops up below the first question, and the annotator is asked to pick a type from a list of shallow types which is usually associated with the argument.",
        "Consequently, a CompLink with compType=\"COERCION\" is created with the corresponding source and target type.",
        "The following example of GLML markup is generated from the database:",
        "Sir Nicholas Lyell, Attorney General, denies a cover-up.",
        "<SELECTOR sid=\"s1\">denies</SELECTOR> a <NOUN nid=\"n1\">cover-up</NOUN> .",

        "For this task, the relevant semantic relations are defined in terms of the qualia structure.",
        "We examine two kinds of constructions in this task: adjectival modification of nouns and nominal compounds.",
        "This task involves annotating how particular noun qualia values are bound by the adjectives.",
        "Following Pustejovsky (2000), we assume that the properties grammatically realized as adjectives \"bind into the qualia structure of nouns, to select a narrow facet of the noun's meaning.\"",
        "For example, in the NP \"a sharp metal hunting knife\", sharp refers to the knife as a physical object, its FORMAL type, metal is associated with a material part of the knife (CONSTITUTIVE), and hunting is associated with how the knife is used (TELIC).",
        "Similarly, forged in \"a forged knife\" is associated with the creation of the knife (AGENTIVE).",
        "The task begins with sense disambiguation of the target nouns.",
        "Questions are then used to help the annotator identify which qualia relations are selected.",
        "For example, the TELIC question for the noun table would be \"Is this adjective associated with the inherent purpose of table?\"",
        "These questions will change according to the type associated with the noun.",
        "Thus, for natural types such as woman, the TELIC question would be \"Is this adjective associated with a specific role of woman?\"",
        "Similarly, for the AGENTIVE role, the question corresponding to the PHYSICAL OBJECT-denoting nouns refers to the \"making or destroying\" the object, while for the EVENT-denoting nouns, the same question involves \"beginning or ending\" of the event.",
        "QLinks are then created based on the annotator's answers, as in the following example:",
        "The walls and the wooden table had all been lustily scrubbed.",

        "This task explores the semantic relationship between elements in nominal compounds.",

        "Warren's comprehensive work (Warren, 1978) is a valuable resource for differentiating relation types between compound elements.",
        "The class distinction in compound types in language can be broken down into three forms (Spencer, 1991): endocentric compounds, exocen-tric compounds, and dvandva compounds.",
        "Following Bisetto and Scalise (2005), however, it is possible to distinguish three slightly differently constructed classes of compounds, each exhibiting endocentric and exocentric behavior: subordinating, attributtive, and coordinate.",
        "We will focus on the two classes of subordinating and attributive compounds.",
        "Within each of these, we will distinguish between synthetic and non-synthetic compounds.",
        "The former are deverbal nouns, and when acting functionally (subordinating), take the sister noun as an argument, as in bus driver and window cleaner.",
        "The non-synthetic counterparts of these include pastry chef and bread knife, where the head is not deverbal in any obvious way.",
        "While Bisetto and Scalise's distinction is a useful one, it does little to explain how non-relational sortal nouns such as chef and knife act functionally over the accompanying noun in the compound, as above.",
        "This construction has been examined within GL by Johnston and Busa (1999).",
        "We will assume much of that analysis in our definition of the task described here.",
        "Our basic assumption regarding the nature of the semantic link between both parts of compounds is that it is generally similar to the one present in adjectival modification.",
        "The only difference is that in nominal compounds, for instance, the qualia of a head noun are activated or exploited by a different kind of modifier, a noun.",
        "Given this similarity, the annotation for this task is performed just as it is for the adjectival modification task.",
