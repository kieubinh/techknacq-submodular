        "Suppose you wanted to have a system that could provide advice about what you should and should not eat if you suffer from various common medical conditions.",
        "You might expect, at the very least, to be able to have dialogues like (1).",
        "(1) a.",
        "User: I am allergic to eggs.",
        "Computer: OK User: Should I eat pancakes",
        "Computer: No, because pancakes contain eggs, and eating things which contain eggs will make you ill if you are allergic to eggs.",

        "User: My son is very fat.",
        "Computer: OK",
        "User: Should he go swimming.",

        "c. User: I have scurvy.",
        "Computer: OK",
        "User: Is eating berries good for me?",
        "Computer: Yes, because berries contain vitamin C and eating fruit which contains vitamin C is good for people who scurvy.",
        "These are comparatively simple dialogues, requiring a very limited amount of knowledge about foods and medical conditions.",
        "As we will see, however, dealing with them does require a remarkable amount of knowledge about language.",
        "The framework we are using makes a number of very basic assumptions about how you design a system to deal with such dialogues.",
        "• To give appropriate answers to these questions you have to consider whether the available information supports or contradicts the queried proposition.",
        "• In order to see whether the available information supports or contradicts a proposition you need a body of domain knowledge, and you need to be able to reason with it.",
        "• Natural languages provide numerous ways of saying almost identical things.",
        "There is, for instance, almost no difference between 'I am allergic to eggs' and 'I have an allergy to eggs'.",
        "You therefore have to have a way of dealing with paraphrases.",
        "We will explore each of these issues in turn below.",
        "2 Answering questions",
        "We will concentrate here on polar (YES/NO) questions.",
        "We also take the very simple view that when someone asks a polar question it is because they want to know whether the proposition encoded in the question is true or not.",
        "Someone who asks 'Is it safe for me to eggs?'",
        "wants to be told 'Yes' if it is and 'No' if it is not.",
        "We have explored the nature of WH-questions elsewhere (Ramsay & Seville, 2001), and we have discussed situations where people use language in indirect ways (Ramsay & Field, 2008), but for the moment just trying to answer polar questions will pose enough problems to keep us occupied.",
        "In order to answer such a question by saying 'Yes' you have to see whether 'It is safe for the speaker to eat eggs' follows from what you know about the speaker and your general knowledge.",
        "You cannot, however, say 'No' simply because your attempted proof that it is safe failed.",
        "If you failed to prove that it is safe you should then see whether you can prove that it is not.",
        "If, and only if, you can then you should say 'no'.",
        "In general, then, answering a polar question may involve two attempted proofs-one aimed at showing that the proposition under discussion is true and then possibly a second aimed at showing that it is false.",
        "If you are lucky you might discover evidence that the proposition is false while you are trying to show that it is true, but in general you may have to attempt two proofs.",
        "In order to carry out proofs you need an inference engine.",
        "Inference engines come in all sorts of shapes and sizes-fast or slow, sound or unsound, complete or incomplete-and they can be applied to a variety of knowledge representation schemes.",
        "The choice of representation scheme, and of the inference engine that you apply to it, will depend on what you want to do with it.",
        "For our current task we assume that soundness is crucial, since you really would not want a medical advice system to give wrong advice; and that the representation scheme has to be highly expressive, since the relations involved are subtle and need to be represented very carefully.",
        "This leads us to a very classical architecture: we construct formal paraphrases (logical forms, LFs) of the user's statements and questions, and we use a theorem prover to investigate the status of the propositions encoded in the user's questions.",
        "We are, in particular, not following the pattern matching path taken in most 'textual entailment' systems, since the informal rules used in such systems are not guaranteed to be sound.",
        "We use 'property theory' (Turner, f 987; Chierchia & Turner, 1987) as our formal language.",
        "There are very strong grounds for believing that natural language is inherently intensional (we will see some examples below, but the simple presence of verbs of propositional attitude is hard to cope with unless you allow some degree of intensionality).",
        "There are a number of logics which allow for a degree of intensionality-the typed logic used by Montague (Montague, 1974; Dowty et al., 1981), the notion of non-well-founded sets (Aczel, 1988) used in situation semantics (Barwise & Perry, 1983), Bealer (1989)'s intensional logic, and so on.",
        "We choose property theory because one of Turner's axiomatisations draws a very strong analogy with modal logic which in turn suggests ways of adapting standard first-order theorem proving techniques for it.",
        "We have developed a theorem prover for a constructive version of property theory along these lines (Ramsay, 1995; Cryan & Ramsay, 1997), and have shown that it is sound (Ramsay, 2001).",
        "No theorem prover for a logic with this degree of expressive power can be complete-property theory, like default logic, is worse than first-order logic in this respect, in that it is not even recursively enumerable.",
        "Practical systems for first-order logic, however, do not proceed by enumerating all the theorems.",
        "They do their best, and if they cannot find an answer within a reasonable period of time then they give up.",
        "This the only sensible thing to do, and it is just as sensible when reasoning with more expressive languages.",
        "We do not, however, just want to find out whether the answer to the user's question is 'Yes' or 'No'.",
        "We would also like to provide them with some explanation of how we arrived at our conclusion.",
        "It is much better to answer 'Should I eat pancakes?'",
        "with 'No, because pancakes contain eggs, and eating things which contain eggs will make you ill if you are allergic to eggs.'",
        "than just by saying 'No'.",
        "The user will be more likely to accept the system's answer if it comes with some supporting explanation, and they may also be able to generalise from the explanation to cover other cases.",
        "Where might we get such explanatory material from?",
        "The obvious place to look is in the trace of the proof that led to the conclusion.",
        "The proof tree contains the facts and rules that the system used in arriving at its conclusion.",
        "Showing these facts and rules to the user would let them see why the system believes that the queried proposition is true or false, and lets them judge the trustworthiness of what the system says.",
        "There are two difficult problems to be addressed here.",
        "The first is that the proof tree will contain a mixture of things that the user themselves said, things are blindingly obvious and things that the system suspects that the user might not know.",
        "The explanation should probably concentrate on things that the user might not have been aware of, so we should be looking for items in the proof tree that the system believes the user may not know.",
        "In other words, we need an epistemic version of property theory, and we need to be able to inspect facts and rules to see who has access to them.",
        "We will not discuss this further here, except to note that in the concrete examples below we are not doing this, so that the support for the system's conclusions currently includes material that the user would actually already be aware of.",
        "The second problem is that it is extremely difficult to generate natural language text from arbitrary logical expressions.",
        "We use standard compositional techniques to build our logical forms on the basis of the form of the input text (van Genabith & Crouch, f997; Konrad et al., 1996).",
        "However, as with virtually any practical theorem prover, we then perform a number of transformations (Skolemisation, distribution of negation, splitting rules with conjunctive heads) to our logical forms in order to make them amenable to the theorem prover.",
        "By the time we have done this there is very little hope of using the compositional semantics in reverse to generate natural language text from elements of the proof tree.",
        "There is, in particular, no chance of using head-driven generation (Shieber et al., 1990) to produce text from elements of the logical form, since this approach requires that the elements of the logical form be unifiable with the meanings of lexical items in order to drive the selection and combination of words.",
        "This is just not feasible with the elements of a proof tree.",
        "Where do the facts and rules that appear in the proof tree come from?",
        "We clearly have to specify them in advance in some form.",
        "Some of this information comes from the user, in the form of statements about their conditions, but most of it will have to provided explicitly.",
        "We can do this in a variety of ways.",
        "We could try to use some existing resource-WordNet, CYC, some medical ontology.",
        "It turns out that these resources, or at least the publicly available ones, lack a great deal of what we need.",
        "Very few such resources contain the kind of rules you need for answering questions such as the ones in (f).",
        "Lexical resources contain information about relations between words.",
        "WordNet, for instance, provides hypersensitivity reaction, hypersensitivity, sensitivity, susceptibility, condition, state, attribute, abstraction, entity as hypernyms of 'allergy '-all perfectly sensible hypernyms, but not all that useful for answering (fa).",
        "Likewise the only mention of allergy or allergic in the ontology in OpenGalen (version 7, downloaded 09/10/08) says that an allergy is a kind of pathology, and SnoMed has 'propensity to adverse reactions' and disease as hypernyms, and a variety of links to special types of allergies and other related conditions.",
        "This is not, of course, an exhaustive search of all potentially relevant ontologies, but it does suggest that the kind of information stored in a typical ontology is not what we require for answering our questions.",
        "It is, however, extremely interesting to note that WordNet contains an English gloss for 'allergy' as 'hypersensitivity reaction to a particular allergen; symptoms can vary greatly in intensity', OpenGalen contains the text 'Hypersensitivity caused by exposure to a particular antigen (allergen) resulting in a marked increase in reactivity to that antigen upon subsequent exposure sometimes resulting in harmful immunologic consequences.'",
        "and SnoMed provides very brief English glosses.",
        "It seems as though when ontology designers want to say what a term really means, they resort to natural language.",
        "It also seems as though this kind of ontology fails to include 'common-sense' knowledge, e.g. that if you are allergic to a foodstuff then you should not eat it.",
        "We need this kind of information in order to answer questions.",
        "The prevalence of natural language glosses in ontological resources of this kind, suggests that expressing it in natural language might be a good idea.",
        "Using natural language to express the knowledge that we need has a number of advantages:",
        "• It is comparatively easy.",
        "Most people (even logicians and semanti-cists!)",
        "generally find it easiest to express themselves in their native language.",
        "It is much easier to write 'If you are allergic to something",
        "then eating it will make you ill' than to express the same rule in some formal language.",
        "• Linking knowledge that has been expressed in natural language with facts and queries that have been expressed in natural language obviates the need for a set of terminological mappings between domain knowledge and natural language.",
        "The vocabularies used in terminological databases tend to have a superfical resemblance to words in natural languages, but the mapping is seldom exact, and indeed the types associated with such terms are often quite different.",
        "If all your knowledge is expressed in natural language then this kind of problem can be avoided.",
        "• Finally, it makes it much easier to generate answers.",
        "If we keep a link between surface text and logic we can retrieve the surface text from the proof tree.",
        "This does not entirely solve the problem of producing coherent natural language answers, but it does make it much simpler."
