        "Quantifier scope ambiguities may engender several interpretations of an NL sentence.",
        "For instance, (l.a) has two readings that, in standard Generalized Quantifier (GQ) approach, can be represented as in (l.b-c).",
        "(l.b) iff a particular sound was heard by every man., while (l.c) is true iff each man has heard a (potentially different) sound.",
        "(1) a.",
        "Every man heard a mysterious sound.",
        "In order to deal with quantifier scope ambiguities, two main problems have to be taken into account.",
        "First, the number of available readings tends to degenerate into a combinatorial explosion when the number of quantifiers increases.",
        "Second, in many real cases the knowledge needed to disambiguate is not fully available during the processing of the sentence.",
        "In such cases, all readings must be somehow stored, and, afterwards, when new world knowledge becomes available, sequentially checked in order to remove the inconsistent ones.",
        "In order to provide a flexible solution to semantic ambiguities, Underspecified formalisms have been recently proposed.",
        "In underspecified semantics, semantic ambiguities are seen as instances of unspecified meaning that can adopt a more restricted sense depending on the preferences grounded in the syntactic structure, world-knowledge, topic/focus distinctions and so forth, underspecified logics allow to encapsulate scope ambiguities in a single structure.",
        "Surveys in underspecified semantics may be found in [8] and [11].",
        "The first underspecified logic that has been proposed is perhaps the algorithm of Hobbs and Shieber [13], which has subsequently evolved into Quasi Logical Form [1].",
        "In this proposal, the underspecified representation is a partial formula <J> that may contain underspecified terms, called complex terms, in the form <q, v, r> where q is a GQ, v an individual variable and r, the restriction of q, another partial formula.",
        "In order to obtain the disambiguated formulae, complex terms must be solved.",
        "This is done by \"pulling out\" and \"unstoring\" the complex terms one by one.",
        "Depending on the order in which they are solved, different readings are obtained.",
        "For instance, the underspecified representation of (l.a) is shown in (2.a).",
        "By solving the complex term <V, x, man'(x)>, we get the partially solved formula in (2.b), from which, by solving the other complex term <3, y, mystSound'(x)>, we get reading (l.a).",
        "Conversely, by solving the two complex terms in the opposite order, we get (l.c).",
        "A more recent approach to underspecified semantics is grounded in dominance constraints between some kind of scope-bearers and some kind of scope-arguments.",
        "Underspecified Discourse Representation Theory [19], Hole Semantics [5], the approach of [25], Constraint Language for Lambda Structures (CLLS) [12], and Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS) [10], belong to this approach.",
        "In MRS, the underspecified formula of (1) is",
        "This representation is a triple whose second element is a flat set of labelled subformulae called EPs.",
        "Each label {hi, h2, etc.)",
        "is called an 'handle'.",
        "The EP associated with a quantifier contains a handle for its restriction and one for its body.",
        "The third element of the triple is a set of constraints in the form hx=qhy, specifying that the EP handled by hy must occur in the scope of hx.",
        "Two disambiguations are then possible in (3): {ho = hi, hi2 = h2, h22 = ^5}, which leads to (l.b), and {ho = h2, h22 = hi, hi2 = h^\\, which leads to (l.c).",
        "A new approach to underspecification of quantifier scope ambiguities has been recently proposed in [20], and implemented into a new formalism called Dependency Tree Semantics (DTS).",
        "In DTS, disambiguation is performed by explicitly showing the dependencies between involved sets, i.e. by achieving a sort of underspecified 'Skolemization'.",
        "DTS is presented in detail in section 3.",
        "Before presenting DTS, however, we will discuss in section 2 three main linguistic phenomena that reduce the level of ambiguity of NL sentences, namely Nested Quantification, Island Constraints and logical Redundancy.",
        "Those constraints have to be somehow carried out in an underspecified logic, in order to avoid readings not available in NL.",
        "We will briefly discuss the alternatives proposed in the aforementioned formalisms and in DTS.",
        "Section 4 contains the core of the research presented here.",
        "It proposes to add in DTS two new constructs that implement the three mentioned constraints in terms of allowed/disallowed dependencies, in a uniform and modular way.",
        "These constructs, called positive/negative arcs, make DTS expressively complete, i.e. able to underspecify any possible subset of available readings.",
        "As argued by [11], although expressive completeness is a desider-able property for underspecified logics, unfortunately it is in trade-off with spatial/temporal complexity, which, in DTS, turns out to be exponential in the number d of NPs.",
        "The last section, however, presents a small experiment on the Turin University Treebank (TUT) [6], whose results seem to indicate that, in real cases, the three examined constraints strongly contribute to keep d, and hence the overall computational time, low.",
        "We will then conclude by claiming that the exponential asymptotic behaviour of the complexity function is a price worth paying for devising a disambiguation process based on allowed/disallowed dependencies."

        "In this paper, we presented an extension of DTS where allowed/disallowed dependencies are explicitly specified by inserting new arcs called positive/negative arcs.",
        "We believe that positive/negative arcs provide a scalable and modular solution for the management of constraints coming from heterogeneous sources.",
        "For instance, we showed that positive/negative arcs needed to manage Nested Quantification, Island Constraints, and logical Redundancy may be independently denned.",
        "Unfortunately, positive/negative arcs lead to a computational complexity which is exponential in the worst cases.",
        "Nevertheless, we performed a rough experiment on the Turin University Treebank, whose results indicate that those worst cases are very rare in real sentences.",
        "It seems then that the computational complexity is not really a problem.",
        "In a real system, in case the number of possible readings is too high, the system may decide to inspect the context in order to detect allowed/disallowed dependencies to be removed or added in the representation, thus reducing the number of readings.",
