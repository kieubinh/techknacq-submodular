        "Finally, it is instinctively associated with several very clear discourse markers, such as e.g. however, although and but.",
        "However, there is a lack of consensus about whether or not there are qualitatively different Contrast relations: RST (Rhetorical Structure Theory) recognizes three different types: Contrast proper, Antithesis and Concession, Wolf and Gibson [2005] recognize two, denial of expectation and contrast, and Segmented Discourse Representation Theory (SDRT, Asher and Lascarides 2003) recognizes one: Contrast.",
        "In this paper we use the annotated RST corpus [Carlson et al., 2003] and simple lexical cooccurrance statistics to determine if intuitive discourse markers of contrast reliably identify Contrast from Cause-Effect relations and if the markers also distinguish between the three-way distinction made in RST.",
        "The distribution of markers shows that intuition can be surprisingly wrong, e.g. however was not a reliable marker of Contrast.",
        "We also found that the different RST Contrast relations can be distinguished by their markers.",
        "These results illustrate the need for empirically testing intuitively identified rhetorical relation markers, and argue against collapsing the Contrast distinctions, as has been done in many discourse annotation schemes."

        "As mentioned above, Wolf and Gibson [2005] recognize two Contrast relations among the 11 relations they distinguish between, 'violated expectation' and 'contrast', a distinction which seems to have been inherited from Hobbs [1985], who may have in turn taken it from Lakoff [1971].",

        "Taboada [2006] used the RST corpus and a corpus of task oriented dialogues that she annotated with RST relations to identify the most frequently used discourse markers for a number of RST relations.",
        "Most relevant for the current work are her results for unembedded concession relations.",
        "In the RST corpus she found that 90.35% of the relations were marked with some recognisable discourse marker, with the words but and although contributing to 50% of the marked relations.",
        "Other markers she identified were though, despite, while, even though, however, still, even if, even when, even yet, whether and whereas.",
        "Another relevant result concerns the distribution of discourse markers across nuclei and satellites.",
        "She found that for concession, the markers were equally likely to occur in the nucleus or satellite.",
        "The main problem with this study is that it relies on intuition for the initial identification of the concession markers, and then the frequency with which they intuitively seem to be signaling contrast is used as evidence of the correctness of the initial intuition.",
        "But this means that relevant markers might be missed.",
        "An even greater problem is that the method does not insure that identified markers are actually characteristic of the relation; they might very well occur just as frequently in other relations.",
        "The frequency with which but and although occur in the concession relations and intuition makes a strong case for considering these markers of concession, but markers like e.g. while, might be just as likely to occur with a Result or a Cause relation.",
        "Marcu and Echihabi [2002] used machine learning to develop an automatic classifier for a number of super categories of discourse relations, including Contrast, Cause-Explanation-Evidence, Condition and Elaboration.",
        "First, they made a set of patterns based on intuitively identified discourse markers for each discourse relation.",
        "They then used these markers to automatically extracted large numbers of examples from two corpora totally more than 42 million English sentences.",
        "For example, sentences with a sentence-initial but were considered Contrast examples, and sentences with because as Cause-Explanation-Evidence.",
        "For training, all discourse markers were removed and the stripped sentences were used to train a family of Naive Bayes classifiers.",
        "One reported results was that the classifier that distinguished between Cause-Explanation-Evidence and Contrast had an accuracy of 87.1%.",
        "The level of accuracy is impressive, and surely supports the authors' claim that automatical extraction is a reliable method for finding large number of examples of certain coherence relations.",
        "On the other hand, it is not clear what could be achieved, and making more fine-grained distinctions might require less noisy data.",
        "For such investigations, intuitively identified discourse markers might not be reliable enough.",
        "Sporleder and Lascarides [2008] compared the performance of rhetorical relation classifiers trained on data with marked and unmarked discourse relations.",
        "They chose a subset of five discourse relations including Contrast, Result, Summary, Explanation and Continuation and a total of 55 discourse markers that according to them unambiguously indicated each of the relations.",
        "For example, but, although, however, whereas and yet were considered to be unambiguous markers of Contrast because following SDRT definition Sporleder and Lascarides [2008] assumed that there is only one type of Contrast.",
        "The choice of discourse markers was based on Oates [2000] and authors' introspection of randomly extracted examples.",
        "What is relevant to our research is that both studies (Marcu and Echihabi 2002 and Sporleder and Lascarides 2008) extracted explicitly marked rhetorical relations using a set of discourse markers selected by intuition, without any empirical evidence that the markers are reliable.",
        "In addition, no fine-grained distinctions between types of relations (e.g. Concession vs Antithesis) were made.",
        "One way to determine if discourse markers are reliable indicators of the relations we assume they mark is to see if the qualitative difference postulated between the Contrast relations seems to manifest in a distributional difference in the discourse markers used in Contrast relations.",
        "An immediate potential objection to this methods is the fact that the RST corpus annotation manual lists a number of intuitively identified discourse markers as potential indicators for many of the relations, including the Contrast relations.",
        "For example, it says that the discourse markers although and despite are discourse markers for concession and Antithesis, while however is a discourse marker for Antithesis and Contrast.",
        "Indeed, if we only find evidence that these markers pattern with the mentioned relations, then we cannot determine if this is because the relations themselves are best marked with these markers, or if the annotators were simply influenced by the manual.",
        "If, however, we do find some other consistent pattern of discourse markers correlating with each of the Contrast relations, then this would be evidence that these qualitative distinctions are real, rather than merely stipulated by the coding scheme.",
        "A final note, RST allows relations to be embedded in other relations, a feature that seems to be unique to RST, and the RST corpus among other discourse annotated corpora.",
        "We think it is important to look both at simple relations and at embedded relations, but in this we depart from much of the earlier work done on studying discourse markers.",
        "This has a disadvantage in that it can inflate the counts, because a discourse marker inside a Contrast relation that is in turn embedded inside another Contrast relation will be counted twice as marking Contrast relations.",

        "Table 6: Antithesis compared with Contrast lexical marking choices than nuclearity and/or symmetry.",
        "This is also in line with the two way distinction in the theoretical linguistics.",
        "Note also that the reliable discourse markers differ from those suggested in the annotation manual: although and despite are only reliable markers of concession, not Antithesis, and however doesn't characterize Contrast relations at all.",
        "A second result is that by using % statistics to identify discourse markers we have a reliable and fairly automatic alternative method to the intuitive identification of markers made by much of the existing research.",
        "This method can be applied to other discourse relations and may find some surprising results, such as e.g. our finding that however is not a reliable unambiguous marker of Contrast when compared with Cause-Effect relations.",
        "Of course, it is entirely possible that however is a good indicator of Contrast when distinguishing Contrast from e.g.",
        "Narration.",
        "Ideally, we should compare all combinations to derive an exhaustive and data derived list of reliable discourse markers for all relations, but we limit our discussion to a small set of lexical items and only compare Contrast with Cause-Effect relations because of time and space constraints, but this is an obvious next step in our inquiry.",
        "Our results have implications for data oriented approaches using intuition to identify markers to extract examples of coherence relations.",
        "Marcu and Echihabi [2002] for example relied solely on discourse markers to extract training data, necessarily so because the method they used requires more data than could feasibly be manually annotated.",
        "But our results show that careful testing of the reliability of the discourse markers could improve the quality of the extracted relations.",
        "Further, the number of Contrast relations recognized has to be carefully considered.",
        "Treating all Contrast relations as one supercategory, collapsing the RST distinctions as Marcu and Echihabi [2002] and many others have done, may lead to worse results than retaining the distinctions; we know from part of speech tagging for example, that while too many distinctions may make tagging harder, too few can do the same.",
        "The results also show that even a modest amount of annotated data can be useful for improving extracted data.",
        "Finally, one of the most obvious problems with all the studies (including this one) on automatically identifying discourse relations is that they only work with marked discourse relations.",
        "Our results won't help much in identifying unmarked Contrast relations, yet these relations are very frequent.",
        "Carlson et al.",
        "[2003] have shown that in the corpus of Rhetorical Structure trees only 61 out of 238 contrast relations were marked by a discourse marker.",
        "This means that contrastive markers would help to identify only 25% of contrast relations in that corpus.",
        "Similarly, Taboada [2006] looked at the RST corpus and a task-oriented dialogue corpus and concluded that most of the relations (between 60-70%) were not signaled by any discourse markers.",
        "Finding a solution to these problems will be a challenge for future work."
