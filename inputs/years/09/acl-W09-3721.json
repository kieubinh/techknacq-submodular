        "Since the early days of the vector space model, it has been debated whether it is a proper carrier of meaning of texts [23], arguing if distributional similarity is an adequate proxy for lexical semantic relatedness [3].",
        "With the statistical, i.e. devoid of word semantics approaches there is generally no way to improve both precision and recall at the same time, increasing one is done at the expense of the other.",
        "For example, casting a wider net of search terms to improve recall of relevant items will also bring in an even greater proportion of irrelevant items, lowering precision.",
        "In the meantime, practical applications in information retrieval and text classification have been proliferating, especially with developments in kernel methods in the last decade [9, 4].",
        "Ordering of terms based on semantic relatedness seeks an answer to the simple question, can statistical term weighting be eclipsed?",
        "Namely, variants of weighting schemes based on term occurrences and co-occurrences dominate the information retrieval and text classification scenes.",
        "However, they also have a number of limitations.",
        "The connection between statistics and word semantics is in general not understood very well.",
        "In other words, a systematic discussion of mappings between theories of word meaning and modeling them by mathematical objects is missing for the time being.",
        "Further, enriching weighting schemes by importing their sense content from lexical resources such as WordNet lacks a theoretical interpretation in terms of lexical semantics.",
        "Combining co-occurrence and lexical resource-based approaches for term weighting and term expansion may offer further theoretical insights, as well as performance benefits.",
        "Using vectors in the vector space model as such mathematical objects for the representation of term, document or query meaning necessarily expresses content mapped on form as a set of coordinates.",
        "These coordinates, at least in the case of the tfidf scheme, are corpus-specific, i.e. term weights are neither constant over time nor database independent.",
        "Introducing a semantic ordering of terms, hence loading a coordinate with semantic content, reduces the dependence on a specific corpus.",
        "In what follows, we will argue that:",
        "• By assigning specific scalar values to terms in an ontology, terms represented by sets of geometric coordinates can be outdone;",
        "• Such values result from a one-dimensional ordering based on the idea of a sense-preserving distance between terms in a conceptual hierarchy;",
        "• Sense-preserving distances mapped onto a line condense lexical relations and express them as a kind of within-language referential meaning pertinent to individual terms, quasi charging their occurrences independent of their occurrence rates, i.e. from the outside;",
        "• This linear order can be used to assist term expansion and term weighting.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 discusses the most important measures for semantic relatedness with regard to the major linguistic theories.",
        "Section 3 introduces an algorithm that creates a linear semantic order of terms of a corpus, and Section 4 both offers first results in text classification and discusses some implications.",
        "Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper."

        "Several methods have been proposed for measuring similarity.",
        "One of such early proposals was the semantic differential which analyzes the affective meaning of terms into a range of different dimensions with the opposed adjectives at both ends, and locates the terms within semantic space [20].",
        "Semantic similarity as proposed by Miller and Charles is a continuous variable that describes the degree of synonymy between two terms [16].",
        "They argue that native speakers can order pairs of terms by semantic similarity, for example ship-vessel, ship-watercraft, ship-riverboat, ship-sail, ship-house, ship-dog, ship-sun.",
        "This concept may be extended to quantify relations between non-synonymous but closely related terms, for example airplane-wing.",
        "Semantic distance is the inverse of semantic similarity [17].",
        "Semantic relatedness is defined between senses of terms.",
        "Given a relatedness formula rel(si,S2) between two senses s\\ and S2, term relatedness between two terms t\\ and t2 can be calculated as where sen(i) is a set of senses of term t [3].",
        "Automated systems assign a score of semantic relatedness to a given pair of terms calculated from a relatedness measure.",
        "The absolute score itself is typically irrelevant on its own, what is important is that the measure assigns a higher score to term pairs which humans think are more related and comparatively lower scores to term pairs that are less related [17].",
        "The best known theories of word semantics fall in three major groups:",
        "1.",
        "\"Meaning is use\" [30]: habitual usage provides indirect contextual interpretation of any term.",
        "In accord with Carnap, frequency of use expresses aspects of a conceptual hierarchy.",
        "In terms of logical semantics, one regards document groups as value extensions (classes) and index terms as value intensions (properties) of a (semantic) function 'f'.",
        "Extensions and intensions are inverse proportional: the more properties defined, the less entities they apply to - there are more flowers in general than tulips in particular, for instance.",
        "2.",
        "\"Meaning is change\": the stimulus-response theory by Bloomfield and the biological theory of meaning by von Uexkull both stress that the meaning of any action is its consequences.",
        "3.",
        "\"Meaning is equivalence\": referential or ostensional theories of meaning suggest that 'X = Y for/as long as Z' [22].",
        "Point 2 refers to theories which assign a temporal structure to word meaning, they are not discussed here.",
        "Measures that rely on distributional measures (Point 1) and those that use knowledge-rich resources (Point 3) both exist, and they have been individually shown to good quantifiers of term similarity each [17], These theories have been individually shown to be good, therefore their combination must be a valid research alternative.",
        "A lexical resource in computer science is a structure that captures semantic relations among terms.",
        "Such a resource necessarily entails some sort of world view with respect to a given domain.",
        "This is often conceived as a set of concepts, their definitions and their inter-relationships; this is referred to as a conceptualization.",
        "The following types of resources are commonly used in measuring semantic similarity between terms: dictionary [12], semantic networks, such as WordNet [5], thesauri modeled on Roget's Thesaurus [19].",
        "All approaches to measuring semantic relatedness that use a lexical resource regard the resource as a network or a directed graph, making use of the structural information embedded in the graph [8, 3].",
        "Distributional similarity, as studied by language technology, covers an important kind of theories of word meaning and can be hence seen as contributing to semantic document indexing and retrieval.",
        "Its predecessors go back a long way, building on the notion of term dependence and structures derived therefrom [2, 18].",
        "Also called the contextual theory of meaning (see [15] for the historical development of the concept), the underlying distributional hypothesis is often cited for explaining how word meaning enters information processing [10], and basically equals the claim \"meaning is use\" in language philosophy.",
        "Before attempts to utilize lexical resources for the same purpose, this used to be the sole source of word semantics in information retrieval, inherent in the exploitation of term occurrences (tfidf) and term co-occurrences [7, 21, 27], including multiple-level term co-occurrences [11].",
        "Statistical techniques typically suffer from the sparse data problem: they perform poorly when the terms are relatively rare, due to the scarcity of data.",
        "Hybrid approaches attempt to address this problem by supplementing sparse data with information from a lexical database [24, 8].",
        "In a semantic network, to differentiate between the weights of edges connecting a node and all its child nodes, one needs to consider the link strength of each specific child link.",
        "This is a situation in which corpus statistics can contribute.",
        "Ideally the method chosen should be both theoretically sound and computationally efficient [8].",
        "Following the notation in information theory, the information content (IC) of a concept c can be quantified as follows.",
        "where P(c) is the probability of encountering an instance of concept c. In the case of the hierarchical structure, where a concept in the hierarchy subsumes those ones below it, this implies that P{c) is monotonie as one moves up in the hierarchy.",
        "As the node's probability increases, its information content or its informativeness decreases.",
        "If there is a unique top node in the hierarchy, then its probability is 1, hence its information content is 0.",
        "Given the monotonie feature of the information content value, the similarity of two concepts can be formally defined as follows.",
        "where Sup(ci,C2) is the set of concepts that subsume both c\\ and C2- To maximize the representativeness, the similarity value is the information content value of the node whose IC value is the largest among those higher order classes.",
        "The information content method requires less information on the detailed structure of a lexical resource and it is insensitive to varying link types [24].",
        "On the other hand, it does not differentiate between the similarity values of any pair of concepts in a sub-hierarchy as long as their lowest superordinate class is the same.",
        "Moreover, in the calculation of information content, a polysemous term will have a large content value if only term frequency data are used.",
        "The distance function between two terms can be written as follows: d(h, t2) = IC(ci) + IC(c2) - 2IC(LSuper(ci, c2)), where LSuper(cl, c2) denotes the lowest superordinate of c\\ and c2 in a lexical resource.",
        "This distance measure also satisfies the properties of a metric [8]."
