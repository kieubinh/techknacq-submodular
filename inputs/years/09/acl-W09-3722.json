        "Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is the problem of determining which sense of a word is used when a word appears in a particular context.",
        "In fact, WSD is an important component in many information organization tasks, and fundamentally consists in a classification problem: given some word-contexts corresponding to some possible senses, the WSD system has to classify an occurrence of the word into one of its possible senses.",
        "In the approach presented in this paper, a vector representation is used for training and testing word cases and the Singular Value Decomposition of matrices is applied in order to reduce the dimension of the representation.",
        "In particular, Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) [2] is used to make the dimension reduction.",
        "This technique compresses vectors representing word related contexts into vectors of a lower-dimensional space and has shown to have the ability to extract the relations among features representing words by means of their context of use.",
        "We present a multiclassifier [8] based approach which uses different training databases.",
        "These databases are obtained from the original training dataset by random subsampling.",
        "The implementation of this approach is made by a model inspired in bagging [3], and the fc-NN classification algorithm [4] is used to make sense predictions for testing words.",
        "For experimentation, a previous tuning phase was performed to training data in order to automatically set some system parameters to their optimal values.",
        "Four are the parameters to be optimized, and the combination of all of them gives the possibility to perform the complete disambiguation process by f440 different ways for each of the fOO words to be disambiguated.",
        "The tuning phase has been performed in a sound manner with the aim to improve our previous work [10].",
        "Although the computational payload is high, it is a systematic way to fix the optimal values for parameters.",
        "The aim of this article is to give a brief description of our approach to deal with the WSD task and to show the results achieved.",
        "In Section 2, our approach is presented.",
        "In Section 3, the experimental setup is introduced.",
        "The experimental results are presented and discussed in Section 4, and finally, Section 5 contains some conclusions and future work."

        "In this section, our approach is presented and the techniques used are briefly reviewed.",
        "First the dataset used in our experiments is described and previous results are presented.",
        "Next, the data preparation is explained in more detail.",
        "A short introduction to the SVD theory and to the fc-NN classification algorithm is given afterwards.",
        "Finally, the multiclassifier construction is shown.",
        "The dataset we use in the experiments was obtained from the 4th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluations (SemEval-2007) web page, task 17, subtask 1: Coarse-grained English Lexical Sample WSD.",
        "This task consists of lexical sample style training and testing data for 100 lemmas (35 nouns and 65 verbs) of different degree of polysemy (ranging from 1 to 13) and number of instances annotated (ranging from 19 instances in training for the word grant to 2536 instances at share).",
        "The average inter-annotator agreement for these lemmas is over 90%.",
        "In [9] task organizers describe the results achieved by the participating systems.",
        "They define a baseline for the task based on giving the most frequent sense in training (F-score: 78.0%).",
        "The best system performance (89.1%) was closely approaching the inter-annotator agreement but still below it.",
        "Once we downloaded the training and testing datasets, some features were extracted and vector representations were constructed for each training and testing case.",
        "The features were extracted by [1] and are local collocations (bigrams and trigrams formed with lemmas, word-forms or PoS tags around the target), syntactic dependencies (using relations like object, subject, noun modifier, preposition and sibling) and Bag-of-words features.",
        "This way, the original training and testing databases were converted to feature databases.",
        "The SVD technique consists in factoring term-document matrix M into the product of three matrices, M = UYJVT where E is a diagonal matrix of singular values, and U and V are orthogonal matrices of singular vectors (term and document vectors, respectively).",
        "Being k the number of singular values in matrix E and selecting the p highest singular values p < k, a vector representation for the training and testing cases can be calculated in the reduced dimensional vector space Rp.",
        "In our experiments we construct one feature-case matrix for each of the 100 words using the corresponding feature training dataset.",
        "Each of the columns in this matrix gives a vector representation to each of the training cases.",
        "As the number of training cases varies among different words, the number of columns present in the matrices is different; consequently, the number of singular values changes as well.",
        "Taking this in consideration, we calculate the SVD of each matrix and obtain the reduced vector representations for training and testing cases for different p values.",
        "In order to calculate the SVD of the matrices, we use Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) [5], which has been successfully used for classification purposes [7],",
        "fc-NN is a distance based classification approach.",
        "According to this approach, given an arbitrary testing case, the fc-NN classifier ranks its nearest neighbors among the training cases [4].",
        "In the approach presented in this article, the training and testing cases for each word are represented by vectors in each reduced dimensional vector space.",
        "The nearest to a testing case are considered to be the vectors which have the smallest angle with respect to it, and thus the highest cosine.",
        "That is why the cosine is usually calculated to measure the similarity between vectors.",
        "The word senses associated with the k top-ranking neighbors are used to make a prediction for the testing case.",
        "Parameter k was optimized for each word during tuning phase.",
        "The combination of multiple classifiers has been intensively studied with the aim of improving the accuracy of individual components [8].",
        "A widely used technique to implement this approach is bagging [3], where a set of training databases TDi is generated by selecting n training cases drawn randomly with replacement from the original training database TD of n cases.",
        "When a set of ri\\ < n training cases is chosen from the original training collection, the bagging is said to be applied by random subsampling.",
        "In our work, we construct a multiclassifier by applying random sub-sampling for each word.",
        "As the number n of training cases is different for each word, we optimize via tuning the parameter ri\\ for each multiclassifier constructed.",
        "This way, we work with training databases TDi of different sizes.",
        "Moreover, the number of training databases TDi to create for each multiclassifier, is also optimized via tuning.",
        "Once the multiclassifiers are constructed, and given a testing case q for a word, the corresponding multiclassifier will make a word-sense label prediction & based on each one of the training databases TDi.",
        "In order to calculate these confidence values, word-sense predictions are made for training cases and the accuracies obtained give the confidence values which indicate the accuracy level that may be expected when a prediction is made for a testing case based on each training database TDi and word-sense Cj to be predicted.",
        "The way we combine such predictions is by applying Bayesian voting [6], where a confidence value cv*.",
        "is calculated for each training database TDi and word-sense Cj to be predicted.",
        "In testing phase, confidence values obtained for the testing cases are summed by sense; the sense Cj that gets the highest value is finally proposed as a prediction for the testing case q.",
        "This process is repeated for every testing case.",
        "In Fig. 1 an illustration of the experiment performed for each one of the 100 words can be seen.",
        "First, vectors in the original Vector Space are projected to the reduced space using SVD; next, random subsampling is applied to the training database TD to obtain different training databases TD^ afterwards, the fc-NN classifier is applied for each TDi to make sense label predictions; finally, Bayesian voting scheme is used to combine predictions, and c will be the final sense label prediction for testing case q."

        "This is the first parameter we tuned.",
        "As it was previously mentioned in Section 2.3, the dimension p of the reduced dimensional vector space Rp to which training and testing cases are projected varies for different words.",
        "The reason for that is the difference in the number of cases present in the dataset for each word.",

        "The number of classifiers, or TDi to create for each word is also a parameter that needs to be tuned.",
        "This is because the number of cases present for each word is quite variable, and this fact may have some influence in the number of TDi to construct.",
        "In our work, we experimented with 6 different values for parameter i = 3, 5,10,20,30,40.",
