        "The second crucial point of departure is how Alexandersson and Becker understand to exploit the information inherent to an inheritance hierarchy and henceforward to transfer Carpenter's notion to a very effective and sound way to specify CDU, which stands in contrast to the formalization by (Grover, Brew, Manandhar, & Moens, 1994) that suffers from theoretical and computational drawbacks.",
