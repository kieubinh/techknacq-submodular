        "A novel approach to mapping FrameNet lexical units to WordNet synsets",
        "Tonelli, Emanuele Pianta Abstract",
        "In this paper we present a novel approach to mapping FrameNet lexical units to WordNet synsets in order to automatically enrich the lexical unit set of a given frame.",
        "While the mapping approaches proposed in the past mainly rely on the semantic similarity between lexical units in a frame and lemmas in a synset, we exploit the definition of the lexical entries in FrameNet and the WordNet glosses to find the best candidate synset(s) for the mapping.",
        "Evaluation results are also reported and discussed."

        "The FrameNet database [1] is a lexical resource of English describing some prototypical situations, the frames, and the frame-evoking words or expressions associated with them, the lexical units (LU).",
        "Every frame corresponds to a scenario involving a set of participants, the frame elements, that are typically the syntactic dependents of the lexical units.",
        "The FrameNet resource is corpus-based, i.e. every lexical unit should be instantiated by at least one example sentence, even if at the moment the definition and annotation step is still incomplete for several LUs.",
        "FrameNet has proved to be useful in a number of NLP tasks, from textual entailment to question answering, but its coverage is still a major problem.",
        "In order to expand the resource, it would be a good solution to acquire lexical knowledge encoded in other existing resources and import it into the FrameNet database.",
        "WordNet [4], for instance, covers the majority of nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs in the English language, organized in synonym sets called synsets.",
        "Mapping FrameNet LUs to WordNet synsets would automatically increase the number of LUs per frame by importing all synonyms from the mapped synset, and would allow to exploit the semantic and lexical relations in WordNet to enrich the information encoded in FrameNet.",
        "Several experiments have been carried out in this direction.",
        "Johansson and Nugues [5] created a feature representation for every WordNet lemma and used it to train an SVM classifier for each frame that tells whether a lemma belongs to the frame or not.",
        "Crespo and Buitelaar [3] carried out an automatic mapping of medical-oriented frames to WordNet synsets, trying to select synsets attached to a LU that were statistically significant in a given reference corpus.",
        "De Cao et al.",
        "[2] proposed a method to detect the set of suitable WordNet senses able to evoke the same frame by exploiting the hypernym hierarchies that capture the largest number of LUs in the frame.",
        "For all above mentioned approaches, a real evaluation on randomly selected frames is missing, and accuracy was mainly computed over the new lexical units obtained for a frame, not on a gold standard where one or more synsets are assigned to every lexical unit in a frame.",
        "Besides, it seems that the most common approach to carry out the mapping relies on some similarity measures that perform better on richer sets of lexical units."

      "heading": "2. The mapping algorithm",
      "text": [
        "We propose a mapping algorithm that is independent of the number of LUs in a frame and from the example sentences available.",
        "In fact, we believe that under real-usage conditions, the automatic expansion of LUs is typically required for frames with a smaller LU set, especially for those with only one element.",
        "In the FrameNet database (v. 1.3), 33 frames out of 720 are described only by one lexical unit, and 63 are described by two.",
        "Furthermore, almost 3000 lexical units are characterized only by the lexicographic definition and are not provided with example sentences.",
        "For this reason, we suggest an alternative approach that makes use of usually unexploited information collected in the FrameNet database, namely the definition associated with every lexical unit.",
        "Since both WordNet glosses and FrameNet definitions are manually written by lexicographers, they usually show a high degree of similarity, and sometimes are even identical.",
        "For example, the definition of thicken in the Change_oficonsistency frame is \"become thick or thicker\", which is identical to the WordNet gloss of synset n. v#00300319.",
        "The thicken lemma occurs in three WordNet synsets, and in each of them it is the only lemma available, so no synonymy information could be exploited for the sense disambiguation.",
        "We tried to devise a simple method to map a FrameNet Lexical Unit (LU) into one or more WordNet synsets.",
        "Given a LU L from a frame F, we first find the set of all synsets containing L (L candidate set, LCandSet).",
        "If LCan-dSet contains only one synset, this is assigned to L. Otherwise, we look for the synsets in LCandSet whose WN gloss has the highest similarity with the FrameNet definition of L. We tried two baseline similarity algorithms based respectively on stem overlap and on a modified version of the Levenshtein algorithm taking stems as comparison unit instead of characters.",
        "Stem overlap turned out to perform definitely better than Levehnstein.",
        "Then we tried to improve on simple stem overlap baseline by considering also the other LUs in F. To this extent, we calculate the set of all synsets linked to any LU in F (FCandSet).",
        "This is exploited in two ways.",
        "First, we boost the similarity score of the synsets in LCandSet with the largest number of links to other LUs in F (according to FCandSet).",
        "Secondly we assign to F the most common WordNet Domain in FCandSet, and then boost the similarity score of LCandSet synsets belonging to the most frequent WordNet-Domain in F. We discard any candidate synset with a similarity score below a MIN threshold; on the other side, we accept more than one candidate synset if they have a similarity score higher than a MAX threshold."
