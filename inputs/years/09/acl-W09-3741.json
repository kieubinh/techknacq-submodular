        "In the context of the MUSING R&D European project, which is dedicated to the development of Business Intelligence (BI) tools and modules founded on semantic-based knowledge and content systems, we are investigating among others the integration of semantic web and human language technologies for enhancing the technological foundations of knowledge acquisition and reasoning in BI applications.",
        "In the first phase of the project many efforts have been dedicated to the manual creation of domain related ontologies and their integration in upper level ontologies.",
        "The creation of those ontologies was guided by domain experts, who were submitting so-called competency questions to the ontology engineers in order to support they work on ontology design and implementation.",
        "Since this approach to ontology creation is very time and resource consuming, we wanted to investigate the possible automation of ontology building directly from textual documents, with a special focus on the financial domain."

      "heading": "2. The Approach",
      "text": [
        "We consider the semi-automatic ontology derivation from text as a linguistic rule-based approach, which on the basis of lexical and syntactic properties",
        "xSee www.musing.eu for more details",
        "can suggest potential ontology classes and properties that can be used for building an ontology.",
        "We suggest a multi-layered approach, which starts with a very shallow analysis of certain lexical properties of words or very short combination of words, going from there to Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging and morphological analysis, before using, in a next step, deeper syntactic analysis and taking into account larger parts of text, up to the level of sentences or even paragraphs.",
        "The idea behind this: at the shallow level it is possible to detect possible classes and relations, which can then be consolidated, refined or rejected at further stages of textual analysis, with the help of domain experts and ontology engineers.",
        "Our final goal is to clearly state what kind of ontological resource can be extracted from financial documents (annual reports of companies, financial newspapers) at various level of textual processing.",
        "As a data source we work first with a corpus of economical news articles from the German newspaper Wirtschaftswoche."

    },
    {
      "heading": "3. String-Based Processing",
      "text": [
        "As a first step in the task of extracting ontology concepts and relations from (German) textual documents, we decided to look in the corpus for words occurring alone (and starting with a capital letter) and in the context of larger strings (which we assume to be mostly nominal compounds).",
        "We call the words that show this property \"anchor-words\".",
        "We consider them potential labels of ontology classes and the compounds, in which they occur, as expressing potential relations for the labels of ontology classes.",
        "Take for example the anchor-word konzern (corporation), which is also occurring as part of the compound medienkonzern (media corporation).",
        "At this very shallow and pattern-based processing level, we tentatively derive that from the compound construction PREFIX + ANCHOR we can extract medienkonzern ISA_SUBCLASS_OF konzern.",
        "Another example of compound is konzernverwaltung (corporation management).",
        "Here we derive from the compound construction ANCHOR + SUFFIX the relation: konzern HAS verwaltung (corporation HAS management);",
        "Although the examples demonstrate that a string analysis can to some extent propose some guidelines for ontology extraction, there are for sure major limitations, due to the lack of well-defined domain and range specifications in the proposed relations, the constraint relative to the number of extracted relations and classes, the multiple appearance of morphological variations, the lack of textual context etc.",
        "In order to reduce the limitations just mentioned, we started by looking for alternative formulations of the compounds, which can help in establishing some filters and validation steps for relation extraction.",
        "So for example the expression Chef vom Konzern (chief of the corporation) is validating the property relation Konzern HAS Chef (corporation HAS chief ), due to the meaning we can associate with the preposition von (part-of, belonging-to).",
        "Concerning compound reformulations expressed by genitive post modification, like mitarbeiter einer deutschen bank (employees of a german bank), we can see that they validate the relation extracted from the corresponding compounds, since the genitive constructions have here a part-of/belonging-to meaning."

      "heading": "4. Morphology and Lexical Semantics for Ontology Derivation",
      "text": [
        "A way to reduce some of the limitations described in Section 3 lies in the use of morpho-syntactic information.",
        "So for example the word Firmenchef (the boss of the firm) would be analyzed as follows:",
        "This annotation is to read like this: the word Firmenchef has the stem chef, has POS noun, is the result of combining the word Firmen and the word Chef, and has certain morphological properties (here encoded with numbers).",
        "We can then describe certain morphological constraints for filtering out some suggested relations from Section 3.",
        "For example, Chemiekonz-ern is introducing a subclass relation between Chemiekonzern and Konzern, whereas for Grosskonzern (large corporation) the subclass relation between Grosskonzern and Konzern does not apply.",
        "The constraint proposed for solving this kind of ambiguities is: the compound should consists of two nouns.",
        "Lexical semantics can also improve the quality of relation extraction.",
        "For the compound Chefdenker (chief thinker), we want to ensure that no HAS-relation between an ontology class labeled by chief and thinker is suggested.",
        "For this purpose we use lexical semantic resources, like WordNet, and formulate a rule that states that if the word occurring in the prefix position of a compound is a person, and the second part of the compound is also denoting a person, then the HAS-relation can not be derived.",
        "Despite of the improvements made possible by morphology and lexical semantics a major limitation remains: ontology extraction is proposed only on the basis of word analysis and not on the basis of phrases and sentences, which offer more context."

        "For further improvement we need to consider both the linguistic context and some information available in ontologies so far.",

        "For the \"shallowest\" parts of our suggested approach we could see that proposed labels for ontology classes and relations seem to be appropriate.",
