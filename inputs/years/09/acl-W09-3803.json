        "Automatic annotation adaptation for sequence labeling (Jiang et al., 2009) aims to enhance a tagger with one annotation standard by transferring knowledge from a source corpus annotated in another standard.",
        "It would be valuable to adapt this strategy to parsing, since for some languages there are also several treebanks with different annotation standards, such as Chomskian-style Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) and HPSG LinGo Redwoods Treebank (Oepen et al., 2002) for English.",
        "However, we are not content with conducting annotation adaptation between existing different treebanks, because it would be more valuable to boost the parsers also for the resource-scarce languages, rather than only for the resource-rich ones that already have several treebanks.",
        "Although hand-annotated treebanks are costly and scarce, it is not difficult for many languages to collect large numbers of bilingual sentence-pairs aligned to English.",
        "According to the word alignment, the English parses can be projected across to their translations, and the projected trees can be leveraged to boost parsing.",
        "Many efforts are devoted to the research on projected treebanks, such as (Lu et al., 2002), (Hwa et al., 2005) and (Ganchev et al., 2009), etc.",
        "Considering the fact that a projected treebank partially inherits the English annotation standard, some handwritten rules are designed to deal with the divergence between languages such as in (Hwa et al., 2002).",
        "However, it will be more valuable and interesting to adapt this divergence automatically and boost the existing parsers with this projected treebank.",
        "In this paper, we investigate the automatic annotation adaptation strategy for Chinese dependency parsing, where the source corpus for adaptation is a projected treebank derived from a bilingual corpus aligned to English with word alignment and English trees.",
        "We also propose a novel, error-tolerant tree-projecting algorithm, which dynamically searches the project Chinese tree that has the largest consistency with the corresponding English tree, according to an alignment matrix rather than a single alignment.",
        "Experiments show that when the target corpus is smaller, the projected Chinese treebank, although with inevitable noise caused by non-literal translation and word alignment error, can be successfully utilized and result in significant improvement over the baseline model trained on the target corpus only.",
        "In the rest of the paper, we first present the tree-projecting algorithm (section 2), and then the annotation adaptation strategy (section 3).",
        "After discussing the related work (section 4) we show the experiments (section 5)."

        "Here we propose a more robust algorithm for dependency tree projection.",

        "The automatic annotation adaptation strategy for sequence labeling (Jiang et al., 2009) aims to strengthen a tagger trained on a corpus annotated in one annotation standard with a larger assistant corpus annotated in another standard.",
        "We can define the purpose of the automatic annotation adaptation for dependency parsing in the same way.",
        "Similar to that in sequence labeling, the training corpus with the desired annotation standard is called the target corpus while the assistant corpus annotated in a different standard is called the source corpus.",
        "For training, an intermediate parser, called the source parser, is trained directly on the source corpus and then used to parse the target corpus.",
        "After that a second parser, called the target parser, is trained on the target corpus with guide features extracted from the source parser's parsing results.",
        "For testing, a token sequence is first parsed by the source parser to obtain an intermediate parsing result with the source annotation standard, and then parsed by the target parser with the guide features extracted from the intermediate parsing result to obtain the final result.",
        "The design of the guide features is the most important, and is specific to the parsing algorithm of the target parser.",
        "In this work we adopt the maximum spanning tree (MST) algorithm (McDonald et al., 2005; McDonald and Pereira, 2006) for both the source and the target parser, so the guide features should be defined on dependency edges in accordance with the edge-factored property of MST models.",
        "In the decoding procedure of the target parser, the degree of a dependency edge being supported can be adjusted by the relationship between this edge's head and modifier in the intermediate parsing result of the source parser.",
        "The most intuitionistic relationship is whether the dependency between head and modifier exists in this intermediate result.",
        "Such a bi-valued relationship is similar to that in the stacking method for combining dependency parsers (Martins et al., 2008; Nivre and McDonald, 2008).",
        "The guide features are then defined as this relationship itself as well as its combinations with the lexical features of MST models.",
        "Furthermore, in order to explore more detailed knowledge from the source parser, we redefine the relationship as a four-valued variable which covers the following situations: parent-child, child-parent, siblings and else.",
        "With the guide features, the parameter tuning procedure of the target parser will automatically learn the regularity of using the source parser's intermediate result to guide its decision making."

        "We can see that the source parsers, directly trained on the source corpora of projected trees, performs poorly on both CTB test sets (which are in fact the same).",
        "This is partly due to the noise in the projected treebank, and partly due to the heterogeneous between the CTB trees and the projected trees.",
        "On the contrary, automatic annotation adaptation effectively transfers the knowledge to the target parsers, achieving improvement on both target corpora.",
        "Especially on CTB 1.0, an accuracy increment of 1.3 points is obtained over the baseline parser.",
        "We observe that for the much larger CTB 5.0, the performance of annotation adaptation is much lower.",
