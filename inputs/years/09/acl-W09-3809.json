        "An Interaction Grammar (IG) (Guillaume and Per-rier, 2008) is a lexicalized grammatical formalism that primarily focuses on valency, explicitly expressed using polarities decorating syntagms.",
        "These polarities and the use of underspecified structures naturally lead parsing to be viewed as a constraint-solving problem - for example (Bonfante et al.)",
        "reduce the parsing problem to a graph-rewriting problem in (2003).",
        "However, in this article we depart from this approach and present an algorithm close to (Earley, 1970) for context-free grammars.",
        "We introduce this algorithm using the standard framework ofde-ductive parsing (Shieber et al., 1995).",
        "This article is organised as follows: we first present IGs (section 2), then we describe the algorithm (section 3).",
        "Finally we discuss some technical points and conclude (sections 4 and 5)."
