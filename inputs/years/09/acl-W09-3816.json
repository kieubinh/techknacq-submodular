        "Machine learning techniques for automatically acquiring processing models from a data collection and traditional methods of eliciting linguistic knowledge from human experts are usually considered as two alternative roadmaps towards natural language processing solutions.",
        "Since the resulting components exhibit quite different performance characteristics with respect to coverage, robustness and output quality, they might be able to provide some kind of complementary information, which could even lead to a notable degree of synergy between them when combined within a single system solution.",
        "For the task of dependency parsing, the high potential for such a synergy has indeed been demonstrated already (e.g. Zeman and Zabokrtsky (2005), Foth and Menzel (2006)).",
        "A popular approach for combining alternative decision procedures is voting (Zeman and Zabokrtsky, 2005).",
        "It makes use of a symmetric architecture, where a meta component chooses from among the available candidate hypotheses by means of a (weighted) voting scheme.",
        "Such an approach not only requires the target structures of all components to be of the same kind, but in case of complex structures like parse trees also requires sophisticated decision procedures which are able to select the optimal hypotheses with respect to additional global constraints (e.g. the tree property).",
        "Since this optimization problem has to be solved by the individual parser anyhow, an asymmetric architecture suggests itself as an alternative.",
        "In asymmetric architectures, a master component, i.e. a full fledged parser, is solely in charge of deciding on the target structure, whilst the others (so called helper or predictor components) provide additional evidence which is integrated into the global decision by suitable means.",
        "Such a scheme has been extensively investigated for the Weighted Constraint Dependency Grammar, WCDG (Foth, 2006).",
        "External evidence from the predictor components is integrated by means of constraints, which check for compatibility between a local structure and a prediction, and penalize this hypothesis in case of a conflict.",
        "So far, however, all the additional information sources which have been considered in this research differed considerably from the master component: They either focused on particular aspects of the parsing problem (e.g. POS tagging, chunking, PP attachment), or used a simplified scheme for structural annotation (e.g. projective instead of non-projective trees).",
        "This paper takes one step further by investigating the same architecture under the additional condition that (1) the helper component provides the very same kind of target structure as the master, and (2) the quality levels of each of the components in isolation are considered.",
        "As a helper component MSTParser (McDonald, 2006), a state-of-the-art dependency parser for non-projective structures based on a discriminative learning paradigm, is considered.",
        "The accuracy of MSTParser differs insignificatly from that of WCDG with all the previously used helper components active.",
        "Section two introduces WCDG with a special emphasis on the soft integration of external evidence while section three describes MSTParser which is used as a new predictor component.",
        "Since parsing results for these systems have been reported in quite different experimental settings we first evaluate them under comparable conditions and provide the results of using MSTParser as a guiding predictor for WCDG in section four and discuss whether the expected synergies have really materialized.",
        "Section five concentrates on a comparative error analysis.",
        "The formalism of a Constraint Dependency Grammar was first introduced by Maruyama (1990) and suggests modeling natural language with the help of constraints.",
        "Schroder (2002) has extended the approach to Weighted Constraint Dependency Grammar, WCDG, where weights are used to further disambiguate between competing structural alternatives.",
        "A WCDG models natural language as labeled dependency trees and is entirely declarative.",
        "It has no derivation rules – instead, constraints license well-formed tree structures.",
        "The reference implementation of WCDG for the German language used for the experiments described below contains about 1,000 manually compiled constraints.",
        "Every constraint of the WCDG carries a weight, also referred to as a penalty, in the interval from zero to one, a lower value of the weight reflects its greater importance.",
        "Constraints having zero weights are referred to as hard and are used for prohibitive rules.",
        "Constraints with a weight greater than zero, also called defeasible, may express universal principles or vague preferences for language phenomena.",
        "Attempts have been made to compute the weights of a WCDG automatically by observing which weight vectors perform best on a given corpus, but the computations did not bring any significant improvements to the manually assigned scored (Schroder et al., 2001).",
        "Empirically, the absolute values of defeasible constraints usually do not matter greatly as long as the relative importance of the rules remains preserved so that typical constructions are preferred, but seldom variations are also allowed.",
        "Thus, the values of weights of the WCDG constraints have to be determined by the grammar writer experimentally.",
        "If a set of dependency edges in a parse found by the system violates any of the constraints, it is registered as a constraint violation between the structure and the rules of the language.",
        "The score of an analysis is the product of all the weights for constraint violations occurring in the structure.",
        "It becomes possible to differentiate between the quality of different parse results: the analysis with a higher score is considered preferable.",
        "Although, under these conditions, an analysis having only a few grave conflicts may be preferred by the system against another one with a great number of smaller constraint violations, but it ensures that an analysis which violates any of the hard constraints always receives the lowest possible score.",
        "The parsing problem is being treated in the WCDG system as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem.",
        "While a complete search is intractable for such a problem, transformation-based solution methods provide a reliable heuristic alternative.",
        "Starting with an initial guess about the optimal tree, changes of labels, subordinations, or lexical variants are applied, with constraint violations used as a control mechanism guiding the transformation process (Foth et al., 2000).",
        "A transformation-based search cannot guarantee to find the best solution to the constraint satisfaction problem.",
        "Compared to the resource requirements of a complete search, however, it is not only more efficient, but can also be interrupted at any time.",
        "Even if interrupted, it will always return an analysis, together with a list of constraint violations it was not able to remove.",
        "The algorithm terminates on its own if no violated constraints with a weight above a predefined threshold remain.",
        "Alternatively, a timeout condition can be imposed.",
        "The same kind of constraints that describe grammar rules, can also be used as an interface to external predictor components.",
        "Thus, the formalism turned out to be flexible enough to incorporate other sources of knowledge into the decision process on the optimal structural interpretation.",
        "Foth and Menzel (2006) have reported about five additional statistical components that have been successfully integrated into WCDG: POS tagger, chunker, supertagger, PP attacher and a shift-reduce oracle parser.",
        "They have also shown that the accuracy improves if multiple components interact and consistent predictions no longer can be guaranteed.",
        "Even thought previously integrated predictor components have an accuracy that is mostly – with the exception of the tagger – below that of the parser itself, WCDG not only avoids error propagation successfully, it also improves its results consistently with each component added."

        "It processes the input in two separate stages.",
        "In the first, the dependency structure is determined, labeling is applied to it successively in the second.",
        "The reasons of its efficiency lie in the successful combination of discriminative learning with graph-based solution methods for the parsing problem.",
        "In this edge-factored graph-based model, each edge of the dependency graph is assigned a real-valued score by its linear model.",
        "The score of the graph is defined as the sum of its edge scores.",
        "If a scoring function for edges is known, the parsing problem becomes equivalent to finding the highest scoring directed spanning tree in the complete graph over the given sentence, and the correct parse can be obtained by searching the space of valid dependency graphs for a tree with a maximum score.",
        "This formalism allows to find efficient solutions for both projective and non-projective trees.",
        "When only features over single edges are taken into account, the complexity falls to O(n) (McDonald et al., 2005).",
        "Not only a single edge, but also adjacent edges may be included into the scoring function.",
        "As a result, intractability problems arise for the non-projective algorithm, but an efficient approximate algorithm based on exhaustive search is provided for this case (McDonald et al., 2006).",

        "The parsing model of MSTParser has the advantage that it can be trained globally and eventually be applied with an exact inference algorithm.",

        "To avoid complexity problems, the scores (and the feature representations) are restricted to a single edge or adjacent edges.",

        "One of the constraints checks the attachment point being the same, while the other takes care of the dependency label.",
        "To properly adjust the weights of these constraints, it has to be determined how valuable the information of the predictor is relative to the information already present in the system.",
        "This gradation is needed to establish a balance between the influence of the grammar and the predictor.",
        "According to the scoring principles of WCDG, a low weight strongly deprecates all deviations from the prediction, thus forcing the system to follow them almost without exception.",
        "Higher weights, on the other hand, enable the grammar to override a prediction.",
        "This, however, also means that predictions have less guiding effect of the transformation process.",
        "Typically for WCDG, the best suitable weights have to be tuned on development data.",
        "To determine the best constraint weights the WCDG grammar has been extended with three additional constraints similar to those used for the shift-reduce predictor in the previous experiments (Foth, 2006).",
        "Two of them advise WCDG on the structural information available from the MSTParser result and one fetches the edge label predicted.",
        "As a result of these experiments, the optimum weight for the attachment predictions has been adjusted to 0.75.",
        "Compared to a weight of 0.9 for the shift-reduce parser, this is a rather strong influence, which also reflects the differences in the reliability of these two information sources.",

        "Evaluation",
        "The most common general measures for the quality of dependency trees are structural accuracy that points out the percentage of words correctly attached to their head word, and labeled accuracy which is the ratio of the correctly attached words which also have the correct label.",
        "Still, it is difficult to directly compare the results reported for different parsers, as the evaluation results are influenced by the data used during the experiment, the domain of the data, and different annotation guidelines.",
        "Moreover, the particular kind of POS information might be relevant, which either can be obtained from the manual annotations or be provided by a real tagger.",
        "Even such a condition as the treatment of punctuation has not yet become a standard.",
        "Following the evaluation procedure in the CoNLL-X shared task (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006), we will not include punctuation into the performance measures, as was done in previous WCDG experiments (Foth and Menzel, 2006).",
        "The source of POS tagging information will need to be specified in each individual case.",
        "All the evaluations were performed on a thousand sentences (18,602 - 19,601) from the NEGRA treebank, the same data set that was previously used in the performance evaluations of treebank is a collection of newspaper articles; in the original, it stores phrase structure annotations.",
        "These have been automatically translated into dependency trees and then manually corrected to bring them in accord with the annotation guidelines of WCDG.",
        "The major difference consists in a different treatment of non-projectivity, where WCDG only allows non-projectivity in the attachment of verbal arguments, relative clauses and coordinations, i.e., the cases where it helps to decrease ambiguity.",
        "Furthermore, corrections were applied when the annotations of NEGRA itself turned out to be inconsistent (usually in connection with coordinated or elliptical structures, adverbs and subclauses).",
        "Unfortunately, these manually corrected data were only available for a small part (3,000 sentences) of the NEGRA corpus, which is not sufficient for training MSTParser on WCDG-conforming tree structures.",

        "E.g., during the CoNLL-X shared task 39,216 sentences from the TIGER Treebank (Brants et al., 2002) were used.",

        "Driven by the requirements of the particular application (speech-to-speech translation), the focus was not only on parse selection, but also on combining incomplete results.",
        "However, no quantitative evaluation of the results has been published.",

      "text": [
        "Integrating MSTParser as a full predictor with WCDG is beneficial for both of them.",
        "Since these systems take their decisions based on completely different sources of knowledge, combining both helps avoid many mistakes each of them commits in isolation.",
        "Altogether, with a real POS tagger, an accuracy level of 92.9%/91.3% has been reached (the last row in Table 2 (C)), which is higher than what any of the parsers achieved alone.",
        "With POS tagging from the gold standard, the accuracy has been at 93.3%/92.0% (the last row in Table 1).",
        "To the knowledge of the authors, these accuracy values are also better than any previous parsing results on the NEGRA test set.",
        "WCDG can profit from the combination not only with ancillary predictors for specific parsing subtasks, but also with another full parser.",
        "This result was achieved even though the second parser is very similar to WCDG with respect to both the richness and the accuracy of its target structures.",
        "The probable reason lies in the considerable difference in the error profiles of both systems as regards specific linguistic phenomena.",
        "WCDG was also used as a diagnostic tool for the errors of",
        "MSTParser.",
        "Possibly, a higher degree of synergy could be achieved if a stronger coupling of the components were established by also using the scores of MSTParser as additional information for WCDG, reflecting the intuitive notion of preference or plausibility of the predictions.",
        "This could be done for the optimal parse tree alone as well as for the complete hypothesis space.",
        "Alternatively, the output of MSTParser can be used as a initial state for the transformation procedure of WCDG.",
        "Vice versa, MSTParser could be enriched with additional features based on the output ofWCDG, similar to the feature-based integration of data-driven parsers evaluated by Nivre and McDonald (2008).",
        "At the moment, the integration constraints treats all attachment and label predictions as being uniformly reliable.",
        "To individualize them with respect to their type or origin could not only make the system sensitive to qualitative differences between predictions (for instance, with respect to different labels).",
        "It would also allow the parser to accommodate multiple oracle predictors and to carefully distinguish between typical configurations in which one prediction should be preferred over an alternative one.",
        "MaltParser (Nivre et al., 2006) is certainly a good candidate for carrying out such experiments."
