        "In this paper, we propose two methods for analyzing errors in parsing.",
        "One is to classify errors into categories which grammar developers can easily associate with defects in grammar or a parsing model and thus its improvement.",
        "The other is to discover interdependencies among errors, and thus grammar developers can focus on errors which are crucial for improving the performance of a parsing model.",
        "The first method uses patterns of errors to associate them with categories of causes for those errors, such as errors in scope determination of coordination, PP-attachment, identification of antecedent of relative clauses, etc.",
        "On the other hand, the second method, which is based on re-parsing with one of observed errors corrected, assesses interdependencies among errors by examining which other errors were to be corrected as a result if a specific error was corrected.",
        "Experiments show that these two methods are complementary and by being combined, they can provide useful clues as to how to improve a given grammar."

        "In any kind of complex systems, analyzing causes of errors is a crucial step for improving its performance.",
        "In recent sophisticated parsing technologies, the step of error analysis has been becoming more and more convoluted and time-consuming, if not impossible.",
        "While common performance evaluation measures such as F-values are useful to compare the performance of systems or evaluate improvement of a system, they hardly give useful clues as to how to improve a system.",
        "Evaluation measures usually assume uniform units such as the number of correctly or incorrectly recognized constituent boundaries and their labels, or in a similar vein, dependency links among words and their labels, and then compute single values such as the F-value.",
        "These values do not give any insights as to where the weaknesses exist in a parsing model.",
        "As a result, the improvement process takes the form of time consuming trial-error cycles.",
        "Once grammar developers know the actual distribution of errors across different categories such as PP-attachment, complement/adjunct distinction, gerund/participle distinction, etc., they can think of focused and systematic improvement of a parsing model.",
        "Another problem of the F-value in terms of uniform units is that it does not take interdependencies among errors into consideration.",
        "In particular, for parsers based on grammar formalisms such as LFG (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1995), HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1994), or CCG (Steed-man, 2000), units (eg.",
        "single predicate-argument links) are interrelated through hierarchical structures and structure sharing assumed by these formalisms.",
        "Single errors are inherently propagated to other sets oferrors.",
        "This is also the case, though to a lesser extent, for parsing models in which shallow parsing is followed by another component for semantic label assignment.",
        "In order to address these two issues, we propose two methods in this paper.",
        "One is to recognize cause categories of errors and the other is to capture interdependencies among errors.",
        "The former method defines various patterns of errors to identify categories of error causes.",
        "The latter method re-parses a sentence with a single target error corrected, and regards the errors which are corrected in re-parse as errors dependent on the target.",
