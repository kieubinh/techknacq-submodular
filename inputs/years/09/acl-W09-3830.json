        "Chunking is a frequent segmentation step in many processing types : robust parsers, parsers of linear complexity (Vergne, 2000), computing stress groups and linking them in tts systems, to compute macro-prosody (Vannier et al., 1999), in automatic indexing, the chunk as another indexed grain above the word in the grain hierarchy, and in sub-sentential alignment, the chunk as an aligned grain.",
        "The method we propose is based on the properties of the functions length and frequency of words on the syntagmatic axis.",
        "These two functions are correlated : integer, periodic, synchronous, in phase opposition, and their period allows to define the chunk.",
        "On a period, the length function is non-decreasing, and the frequency function is non-increasing.",
        "These concepts continue in Zipfs direction : minimizing the communication effort drives the speaker to shorten frequent words (Zipf, 1949).",
        "The length metrics defined by Zipf is not the number of letters, but the number of syllables or the number of phonemes of the written form (Zipf, 1935); the metrics of our method is also the number of syllables, or more precisely the number of vowel nuclei, computable from the written form; this metrics takes its root into the oral origin of the chunk.",
        "The word frequency is measured in the segmented text.",
        "This method of segmentation into chunks is based on digital properties, and is valid on languages with alphabetic script.",

        "While characterizing the chunk in a purely digital way, from properties of length et frequency functions of words on the syntagmatic axis, this original method consists in calculations on the text to segment; it has the advantage to be applied to a great number of languages, with the same algorithm, without any monolingual resource : languages with alphabetic script, with a written word which separates function words from content words (it is not the case in Finnish), and compatible with a structure model of the chunk where function words generally are before content words; the method is promising for the 22 languages of the European Community.",
        "http : //www .info.unic aen .fr/~j vergne/chunking_mu ltilingue_endogene/",
        "This method can be applied in automatic indexing, for search-engines (as Exalead does, to be able to output the most frequent terms associated to the documents of the answer), and in sub-sentential alignment, to constraint the statistical alignment (as in Similis, the alignment software of Lingua et Machina, but this software uses monolingual resources for every language).",
        "The interesting feature of this method is not to need any resource for a new language to processS.",
        "As it is independent from specificities of each language, this method is not \"multilanguage\", neither \"multi-monolanguage\", but as it exploits generic properties of natural languages, that is properties of language, as an abstraction of natural languages, we could perhaps simply call it a \"linguistic\" method.",
