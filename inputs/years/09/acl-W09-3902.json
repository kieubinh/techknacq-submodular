        "Human spoken dialogue is highly interactive, including feedback on the speech of others while the speech is progressing (so-called \"backchannels\" (Yngve, 1970)), monitoring of addressees and other listener feedback (Nakano et al., 2003), fluent turn-taking with little or no delays (Sacks et al., 1974), and overlaps of various sorts, including collaborative completions, repetitions and other grounding moves, and interruptions.",
        "Interruptions can be either to advance the new speaker's goals (which may not be related to interpreting the other's speech) or in order to prevent the speaker from finishing, which again can be for various reasons.",
        "Few of these behaviors can be replicated by current spoken dialogue systems.",
        "Most of these behaviors require first an ability to perform incremental interpretation, and second, an ability to predict the final meaning of the utterance.",

        "Incremental interpretation enables more rapid response, since most of the utterance can be interpreted before utterance completion (Skantze and Schlangen, 2009).",
        "It also enables giving early feedback (e.g., head nods and shakes, facial expressions, gaze shifts, and verbal backchannels) to signal how well things are being perceived, understood, and evaluated (Allwood et al., 1992).",
        "For some responsive behaviors, one must go beyond incremental interpretation and predict some aspects of the full utterance before it has been completed.",
        "For behaviors such as complying with the evocative function (Allwood, 1995) or intended perlocutionary effect (Sadek, 1991), grounding by demonstrating (Clark and Schaefer, 1987), or interrupting to avoid having the utterance be completed, one must predict the semantic content of the full utterance from a partial prefix fragment.",
        "For other behaviors, such as timing a reply to have little or no gap, grounding by saying the same thing at the same time (called \"chanting\" by Hansen et al.",
        "(1996)), performing collaborative completions (Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986), or some corrections, it is important not only to predict the meaning, but also the form of the remaining part of the utterance.",
        "We have begun to explore these issues in the context of the dialogue behavior of virtual human (Rickel and Johnson, 1999) or embodied conversational agent (Cassell et al., 2000) characters for multiparty negotiation role-playing (Traum et al., 2008b).",
        "In these kinds of systems, human-like behavior is a goal, since the purpose is to allow a user to practice this kind of dialogue with the virtual humans in training for real negotiation dialogues.",

        "Figure A-1 in the appendix shows a sample dialogue from this domain.",
        "The system has a fairly typical set of processing components for virtual humans or dialogue systems, including ASR (mapping speech to words), NLU (mapping from words to semantic frames), dialogue interpretation and management (handling context, dialogue acts, reference and deciding what content to express), NLG (mapping frames to words), non-verbal generation, and synthesis and realization.",
        "The doctor and elder use the same ASR and NLU components, but have different modules for the other processing, including different models of context and goals, and different output generators.",
        "In this paper, we will often refer to the characters with various terms, including \"virtual humans\", \"agents\", or \"the system\".",
        "In this paper, we are focusing on the NLU component, looking at incremental interpretation based on partial speech recognition results, and the potential for using this information to change the dialogue strategy where warranted, and provide responses before waiting for the final speech result.",
        "The NLU output representation is an attribute-value matrix (AVM), where the attributes and values represent semantic information that is linked to a domain-specific ontology and task model (Hartholt et al., 2008).",
        "Figure 2 shows an example representation, for an utterance such as \"we can provide you with power generators\".",
        "The AVMs are linearized, using a path-value notation, as shown in Figure 3.",
        "To develop and test the new incremental/prediction models, we are using a corpus of",

        "In contrast with Figure A-1, which is a dialogue with one of the system designers who knows the domain well, dialogues with naive users are generally longer, and often have a fairly high word error rate (average 0.54), with many out of domain utterances.",
        "The system is robust to these kinds of problems, both in terms of the NLU approach (Leuski and Traum, 2008; Sagae et al., 2009) as well as the dialogue strategies (Traum et al., 2008a).",
        "This is accomplished in part by approximating the meaning of utterances.",

        "Our NLU module, mxNLU (Sagae et al., 2009), is based on maximum entropy classification (Berger et al., 1996), where we treat entire individual frames as classes, and extract input features from ASR.",
        "The training data for mxNLU is a corpus of approximately 3,500 utterances, each annotated with the appropriate frame.",
        "These utterances were collected from user sessions with the system, and the corresponding frames were assigned manually.",
        "Out-of-domain utterances (about 15% of all utterances in our corpus) could not be mapped to concepts in our ontology and task model, and were assigned a \"garbage\" frame.",
        "For each utterance in our corpus, we have both a manual transcription and the output of ASR, although only ASR is used by mxNLU (both at training and at runtime).",
        "Each training instance for mxNLU consists of a frame, paired with a set of features that represent the ASR output for user utterances.",
        "The specific features used by the classifier are: each word in the input string (bag-of-words representation of the input), each bigram (pairs of consecutive words), each pair of any two words in the input, and the number of words in the input string.",
        "In the 3,500-utterance training set, there are 136 unique frames (135 that correspond to the semantics of different utterances in the domain, plus one frame for out-of-domain utterances).",
        "The NLU task is then framed as a multiclass classification approach with 136 classes, and about 3,500 training examples.",
        "Although mxNLU produces entire frames as output, we evaluate NLU performance by looking at precision and recall of the attribute-value pairs (or frame elements) that compose frames.",
        "Precision represents the portion of frame elements produced by mxNLU that were correct, and recall represents the portion of frame elements in the gold-standard annotations that were proposed by mxNLU.",
        "By using precision and recall of frame elements, we take into account that certain frames are more similar than others and also allow more meaningful comparative evaluation with NLU modules that construct a frame from subelements or for cases when the actual frame is not in the training set.",
        "The precision and recall of frame elements produced by mxNLU using complete ASR output are 0.78 and 0.74, respectively, for an F-score (harmonic mean of precision and recall) of0.76.",
        "The simplest way to perform NLU of partial ASR results is simply to process the partial utterances using the NLU module trained on complete ASR output.",
        "However, better results may be obtained by training separate NLU models for analysis of partial utterances of different lengths.",
        "To train these separate NLU models, we first ran the audio of the utterances in the training data through our ASR module, recording all partial results for each utterance.",
        "Then, to train a model to analyze partial utterances containing N words, we used only partial utterances in the training set containing N words (unless the entire utterance contained less than N words, in which case we simply used the complete utterance).",

        "We have implemented a specific approach to this assessment which views an utterance as understood \"well enough\" if the agent would not understand the utterance any better than it currently does even if it were to wait for the user to finish their utterance (and for the ASR to finish interpreting the complete utterance).",
        "Concretely, Figure 5 shows that after the entire 2800ms utterance has been processed by the ASR, mxNLU achieves an F-score of 0.91.",
        "However, in fact, mxNLU already achieves this maximal F-score at the moment it interprets the partial ASR result elder do you agree to move the at 1800ms.",

        "Of course the agent does not automatically realize that it has achieved a maximal F-score at 1800ms.",
        "To enable the agent to make this assessment, we have trained a classifier, which we call MAXF, that can be invoked for any specific partial ASR result, and which uses various features of the ASR result and the current mxNLU output to estimate whether the NLU F-score for the current partial ASR result is at least as high as the mxNLU F-score would be if the agent were to wait for the entire utterance.",
        "To facilitate the construction of our MAXF classifier, we identified a range of potentially useful features that the agent could use at runtime to assess its confidence in mxNLU's output for a given partial ASR result.",
        "These features are exemplified in the appendix in Figure A-2, and include: K, the number of partial results that have been received from the ASR; N, the length (in words) of the current partial ASR result; Entropy, the entropy in the probability distribution mxNLU assigns to alternative output frames (lower entropy corresponds to a more focused distribution); Pmax, the probability mxNLU assigns to the most probable output frame; NLU, the most probable output frame (represented for convenience as fl, where I is an integer index corresponding to a specific complete frame).",
        "We also define MAXF (GOLD), a boolean value giving the ground truth about whether mxNLU's F-score for this partial is at least as high as mxNLU's F-score for the final partial for the same utterance.",
        "In the example, note that MAXF (GOLD) is true for each partial where mxNLU's F-score (F(K)) is > 0.91, the value achieved for the final partial (elder do you agree to move the clinic downtown).",
        "Of course, the actual F-score F(K) is not available at run-time, and so cannot serve as an input feature for the classifier.",
        "Our general aim, then, is to train a classifier, MAXF, whose output predicts the value of MAXF (GOLD) as a function of the input features.",
        "To create a data set for training and evaluating this classifier, we observed and recorded the values of these features for the 6068 partial ASR results in a corpus of ASR output for 449 actual user utterances.",
        "We chose to train a decision tree using Weka's J48 training algorithm (Witten and Frank, 2005).To assess the trained model's performance, we carried out a 10-fold cross-validation on our data set.We present our results in the next section.",
        "We will present results for a trained decision tree model that reflects a specific precision/recall tradeoff.",
        "In particular, given our aim to enable an agent to sometimes initiate overlapping speech, while minimizing the chance of making a wrong assumption about the user's meaning, we selected a model with high precision at the expense of lower recall.",
        "Various precision/recall tradeoffs are possible in this framework; the choice of a specific tradeoff is likely to be system and domain-dependent and motivated by specific design goals.",
        "We evaluate our model using several features which are exemplified in the appendix in Figure A-3.",

        "FALSE) for each partial; Kmaxf, the first partial number for which MAXF (PREDICTED) is",
        "TRUE; AF(K) = F(K) - F(Kfinal), the \"loss\" in F-score associated with interpreting partial K rather than the final partial Kfinal for the utterance; T(K), the remaining length (in seconds) in the user utterance at each partial.",
        "We begin with a high level summary of the trained MAXF model's performance, before discussing more specific impacts of interest in the dialogue system.",
        "We found that our trained model predicts that MAXF = TRUE for at least one partial in 79.2% of the utterances in our corpus.",
        "For the remaining utterances, the trained model predicts MAXF = FALSE for all partials.",
        "The precision/recall/F-score of the trained MAXF model are 0.88/0.52/0.65 respectively.",
        "The high precision means that 88% of the time that the model predicts that F-score is maximized at a specific partial, it really is.",
        "On the other hand, the lower recall means that only 52% of the time that F-score is in fact maximized at a given partial does the model predict that it is.",
        "For the 79.2% of utterances for which the trained model predicts MAXF = TRUE at some point, Figure 6 shows the amount of time in seconds, T(Kmaxf), that remains in the user utterance at the time partial Kmaxf becomes available from the ASR.",
        "The mean value is 1.6 seconds; as the figure shows, the time remaining varies from 0 to nearly 8 seconds per utterance.",
        "This represents a substantial amount of time that an agent could use strategically, for example by immediately initiating overlapping speech (perhaps in an attempt to improve communication efficiency), or by exploiting this time to plan an optimal response to the user's utterance.",

        "We have presented a framework for interpretation of partial ASR hypotheses of user utterances, and high-precision identification of points within user utterances where the system already understands the intended meaning.",
        "Our initial implementation of an utterance completion ability for a virtual human serves to illustrate the capabilities of this framework, but only scratches the surface of the new range of dialogue behaviors and strategies it allows.",
        "Immediate future work includes the design of policies for completions and interruptions that resuit in natural conversational behavior.",
        "Other applications of this work include the generation of paraphrases that can be used for grounding, in addition to extralinguistic behavior during user utterances, such as head nods and head shakes."
