        "In order to understand what is going on in a meeting, it is important to know who is talking, what is being said, and who is being addressed (talked to).",
        "Here, we focus on the question of whom the speech is addressed to.",
        "We present results obtained in developing a classifier for real-time addressee prediction to be used in an assistant for a remote participant in a hybrid meeting, a meeting where a number of participants share a common meeting room and one or more others take part via teleconferencing software.",
        "It is obvious that in order to effectively participate in a meeting, participants need to know who is being addressed at all times.",
        "For remote participants in hybrid meetings, understanding the course of the conversation can be difficult due to the fact that it is hard to figure out who is being",

        "But it is not only meeting participants who are interested in addressees.",
        "The question who is being addressed has long been of interest for science: group therapists (Bales, 1950), small group research, or outside observers who analyse recorded meetings.",
        "How speakers address listeners, what kind of procedures speakers use to designate their audience and to make clear whom they address has been the focus of conversational analysis, sociolinguistics and ethnomethodology for quite some time.",
        "An analysis of addressee selection is presented in (Lerner, 1996).",
        "Addressing as a special type of multi-modal interactional referring expression generation behavior is considered in (op den Akker and Theune, 2008).",
        "The problem of automatic addressee detection is one of the problems that come up when technology makes the move from two-party man-machine natural dialogue systems to systems for multiparty conversations.",
        "In this context the addressing problem was raised by Traum (2004).",
        "Since Jovanovic (2004), presented her research on addressee prediction in meetings at SigDial, quite a few publications on the topic appeared.",
        "Jo-vanovic used a number of multi-modal meeting corpora developed in the European projects M4 and AMI.",
        "In (Jovanovic et al., 2006b) the first multi-modal multi-party corpus containing hand labeled addressee annotations was presented.",
        "The public release of the multi-modal AMI meeting corpus (Carletta, 2007; McCowan et al., 2005), a hour annotated corpus of small group meetings has already shown to be an important achievement for research; not only for conversational speech recognition and tracking of visual elements",
        "pecial Interest Group in Discourse and Dialogue, pages 21-28, Â©2009 Association for Computational Linguistics",
        "but also for automatic multi-modal conversational scene analysis.",

        "Addressee detection in robot-human interaction is studied in (Katzen-maier et al., 2004) and in multi-party dialogue systems in (Knott and Vlugter, 2008; van Turn-hout et al., 2005; Bakx et al., 2003; Rickel et al., 2002).",
        "Addressing in face-to-face conversations is achieved by multi-modal behavior and addressee detection is thus a multi-modal recognition task.",
        "This task requires not only speech recognition but also gaze and gesture recognition, the recognition of deictic references, and, ideally, the understanding of the \"what's going on\" in the meeting.",
        "It requires the detection of who is involved in current (parallel) activities.",
        "Speakers show explicit addressing behavior when they are not confident that the participants they want to address are paying attention to their words.",
        "Analysis of the remote meetings recorded in the EC project AMIDA reinforces our experiences that this happens more in remote meetings than in small group face-to-face meetings.",
        "In AMIDA, the European follow-up project of AMI, the two new research goals are: (1) real-time processing (real-time speech recognition (Hain et al., 2008), focus of attention recognition (Ba and Odobez, 2009), real-time dialogue act labeling (Germesin et al., 2008) and addressee detection); and (2) technology for (remote) meeting support.",
        "Technology based on the analysis of how people behave and converse in meetings is now going to reshape the meetings, and hopefully make them more effective and more engaging.",
        "Social interaction graphs that show who is talking to whom and how frequently in a meeting may help the group by mirroring its interpersonal relations, dominance, and group dynamics, and understand social mechanisms as possible causes of ineffectiveness.",
        "Although, feedback about the social interactions may also be useful during meetings, it doesn't require the prediction of the speaker's addressees in real-time.",
        "A participant in a meeting, however, needs to know who is being addressed by the speaker at \"the time of speaking\".",
        "This holds for humans as well as for an artificial partner, a robot or a virtual Embodied Conversational Agent in a multi-party conversation.",
        "The problem of addressee prediction comes in different flavors, depending on the relations that the subject who is in need of an answer, has with the event itself.",
        "Time is one of the aspects that play a role here: whether the subject needs to know the addressee of an utterance in real-time or offline.",
        "But it is not only time that plays a role.",
        "The addressing problem is an interactional problem, meaning that it is determined by the role that the subject has in the interaction itself; if and how the speaker and others communicate with each other and with the subject.",
        "Is he himself a possible addressee of the speaker or is he an outside observer?",
        "What type of communication channels are available to the subject and which channels of communication are available to the conversational partners in the meeting?",
        "It is often harder to follow a face-to-face discussion on the radio than to follow a radio broadcasted multi-party discussion that was held via a point-to-point telephone connection.",
        "What speakers do to make clear whom they are addressing depends on the status and capacities of the communication lines with their interlocutors.",
        "Discussion leaders in TV shows are aware of their TV audience.",
        "Every now and then, they explicitly address their virtual audience at home.",
        "They also design their questions so as to make clear to the TV viewer whom their questions are addressed to.",
        "Outside observers in the form of a video camera will, however, not affect the way speakers make clear whom they address as long as the camera is not considered as a participant interested in the speaker's intention.",
        "Because remote participants are often out of sight, speakers in the meeting room do not take them into account when they converse to others in the meeting room.",
        "Remote participants become a kind of outside observers and share the same problems that annotators have when they watch video recordings of meetings to see what is happening in the meeting and who is being addressed by the speaker.",
        "In section 2 we will specify the particular type of addressing problem that we are trying to tackle here.",
        "We make clear how our problem and approach differ from those of other researchers and what this means for the applicability of previous results and available data.",
        "In section 3 we present the data we used for testing and training.",
        "We set a baseline for the performance of our classifiers as well as a hypothesized maximum value, or ceiling, based on the complexity of the task at hand.",
        "In section 4 we discuss the experiments, for selecting the optimal features, classifiers, and parameters.",
        "In section 5 we present the experimental results.",

        "In training and testing the classifiers we alternately take up the position in the meeting of one of the participants, who is treated as the target for addressee prediction.",

        "For a more detailed analysis refer to (op den Akker, 2009).",
        "Because of the large number of features and classifiers used, the various classifier hyper parameters have largely been kept to their default values.",
        "Where it was deemed critical (Neural Network training epochs and number of trees in Ran-domForest classifier) these parameters were varied afterwards to make sure that the performance did not deviate too much from using the default values.",
        "It didn't.",
        "The lexical and context based classifier uses features that can be derived from words and dialogue acts only.",
        "A total of 14 features were defined, 7 of which say something about the dialogue act (type, number of words, contains 1st person singular personal pronoun, and so on) and 7 of which say something about the context of the dialogue act (how often was I addressed in the previous 6 dialogue acts, how often did I speak in the previous 5 dialogue acts, and so on).",
        "Of these 14 features, the optimal feature subset was selected by trying out all the subsets.",

        "The optimal time interval in which to measure who is looking at you was extensively researched by trying out different intervals around the start of a dialogue act, and training and testing a classifier on the feature.",
        "These optimal interval values differ for every feature, but is usually somewhere between a few seconds before the start of the dialogue act, to 1 second into the dialogue act.",

        "This shows, that when looking at VFOA information, one should take into account the participant's gaze before the dialogue act, instead of looking at the utterance duration as in (Jovanovic, 2007; Frampton et al., 2009).",
        "The representation of feature values was also varied by either normalizing to the duration of the window or using the raw values.",

        "We tried three different methods of combining the results of the LexCont and VFOA classifiers.",
        "First we tried to train a classifier using all the features (14 lexical, 8 vfoa) which exploded the feature subset search space to over 4 million possibilities.",

        "The OR-rule (if either of the two classifiers thinks the DA is addressed to you, the outcome is 'yes') performed the best (91.19% accuracy).",
        "But the best results were achieved by training a rule based (Ridor) classifier on the output of the first two.",
        "For these experiments the test-set of the previous two classifiers was split again into a new train (3080 instances) and test set (1540 instances).",

        "For this task, 35 classifiers have been trained with the best results coming from the Ridor classifier: 92.53 accuracy.",
        "The results of all the different techniques for combining the classifiers can be seen in Table 4.",
        "The baseline score for this smaller test set is 89.87, so given the HMS of 92.47, this result can be seen as 102% of what can be achieved.",
        "Note that this is not 'impossible', because the Hypothesized Maximum Score is merely an indication of how humans perform on the task, not an absolute ceiling.",

        "The a-priori probability of you being addressed as industrial designer in the entire corpus is 13%.",
