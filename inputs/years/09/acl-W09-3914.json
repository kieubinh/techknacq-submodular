        "Since linguistic cues are rarely found, it is obvious that this marking has to be realized by prosodic features.",

        "In the speaker's turn several prosodic cues are presumed to indicate to the listener whether the speaker wants to keep or end the turn.",
        "At points with high speaker switch potential noticeable gestural and mimic cues can be found.",

        "He classified the signals as turn-yielding, turn-demanding (listener), attempt-suppressing, and back-channel-communication (listener response).",
        "We focused on turn-yielding as those signals are easy to locate, and because most found prosodic and non-verbal cues belong to this class.",
        "Beattie (1981) and Orestrom (1983) showed that a noticeable rising or falling movement of fundamental frequency acts as a prosodic turn-yielding cue.",
        "According to Orestrom (1983), the final syllable of the turn is lengthened and sometimes the syllable frequency is increased.",
        "Duncan (1972) and Orestrom (1983) documented a decrease of intensity at the end of a turn.",
        "In addition, non-verbal cues for turn-yielding have been suggested.",
        "Kendon (1967) noticed that a speaker often doesn't look at the listener during an utterance but does so at the end of the turn.",
        "An explanation is that at those points of the conversation visual contact is required.",
        "Exline (1965) discovered that participants in a conversation look at their dialogue partner more often while they are listening.",
        "Duncan (1972) found several non-verbal cues in the behaviour of a speaker as turn-yielding signals: Relaxation of a tensed hand-position, completion of a gesture, regression of the torso, and relaxation of the facial expression."

        "To examine whether turn-yielding signals are intensified in the condition without sight, we constituted the criterion that a cue has to appear in one of the conditions for at least three of the speakers to be considered.",
        "For those cues we developed a comparison chart in which qualitative and quantitative changes between condition 1 and 2 (with and without sight) were inscribed (Table 2).",
        "Qualitative differences could only occur if a speaker shows the signal in both conditions.",
        "They are treated dichotomous (as increased and decreased).",
        "Quantitative differences are marked as added or omitted signals for each speaker.",
        "Table 2 shows that none of the signals undergoes changes of the same direction for more than two speakers.",
        "For syllable frequency there's no change between the conditions at all.",
        "For intensity of topic units, F0-mean of sustain, and last level-tone of fall there's only a quantitative change for one speaker.",
        "That is, one more speaker added this signal in condition 2, while one or more speaker use it in both conditions, without qualitative shades.",
        "Only the last level-tone of rise/fall and the difference of intensity between final and non-final syllable groups show changes for more than one speaker.",
        "But while the difference of intensity between final and non-final syllable groups is increased in condition 2 for the conversation partners in group 1, it is decreased for group 2.",
        "The results cancel each other.",
        "Only the last level-tone of rise/fall was modified in condition 2 by more than one speaker without being modified by other speakers in the contrary way.",
        "That is, it was added.",
        "For the mean FO and the FO-range one speaker omitted the signals in condition 2 and one speaker increased their distinctive function.",
        "Taking a look at the sum of shown signals, we recognize that for none of the speakers there's a remarkable raise in the total number of shown signals in condition 2.",
        "Finally, every increased distinctive function of a signal, which could be judged as compensation, has a negative counterpart like decrease or omission.",
        "Based on the results of this study one can't assume, that the analyzed prosodic cues compensate if the optical feedback channel is missing.",
        "This leaves the question whether optical cues are necessary signals or just added as redundant indicators to intensify the effect of the prosodic cues.",
