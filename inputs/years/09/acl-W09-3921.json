        "Considerable research has now demonstrated that human dialog partners exhibit lexical and syntactic convergence; that is, that in a human-human conversation the participants become more similar in their use of language over time (Brennan and Clark, 1996; Lockridge and Brennan, 2002; Pickering and others, 2000; Reitter et al., 2006).",
        "Several Wizard-of-Oz studies have also shown evidence of convergence in human-computer dialog (Branigan and others, 2003; Brennan, 1996; Gustafson and others, 1997).",
        "In recent work, we examined user adaptationto the system's choice of verb and preposition using the deployed Let's Go!",
        "spoken dialog system (Stoyanchev and Stent, 2009a).",
        "This was the first study to look at convergence with real users of a real dialog system and examined user adaptation to verbs and prepositions.",
        "The study described in this paper is a follow-on to our previous study.",
        "Here we look at user adaptation to the system's choice of realization of task-related concepts.",
        "In this paper, we: (1) Confirm our previous results showing that users adapt to the system's choice of words, using transcribed data rather than ASR output; (2) Show that adaptation can persist over time; and (3) Show that user adaptation is strengthened by perceived system adaptation.",
        "In addition to providing further evidence of convergence in human-computer dialog, our results have implications for dialog system design.",
        "Currently, much dialog systems research is devoted to improving ASR accuracy, because this is a significant contributor to task success rates and to dialog length.",
        "One way to improve ASR accuracy is to use targeted language models.",
        "Since users adapt to the system's choices of realization for task-related concepts, we can predict the user's choice of realization and use this to adjust the ASR's language model, improving ASR accuracy specifically on concept words.",
        "Another way to improve ASR accuracy is to guide the user into using words that are likely to be recognized correctly (Hockey and others, 2003; Sheeder and Balogh, 2003; Tomko and",
        "Rosenfeld, 2006).",
        "Our results imply that if the designer of a dialog system wants to improve ASR accuracy, system prompts should be designed to use word choices that are more recognizable; and, when, possible, to be adaptive to the user's choice of form for task-related concepts."

        "We conclude that there is user adaptation to system time form in the SYS.TIME condition.",
        "POD We did not find statistically significant differences in Usr:POD forms for the different system conditions in either the Unprimed, First After or All After data.",
        "Because this is the long unambiguous form, users may have felt that it would not be recognized or that it would be inefficient to produce it.",
        "Figures 2 illustrates the effect of user adaptation on time form for the SYS_APM and SYS_TIME conditions.",
        "Sometimes the user happens to use the same form in their initial specification of time that the system uses in its confirmation prompt.",
        "This gives the illusion that the system is adapting its choice of time form to the user.",
        "We examined whether users' perception of system adaptation affected user adaptation in First After confirmation utterances.",
        "For this analysis we used only the dialogs in the SYS.APM and SYS.TIME conditions since the POD form is rare in the Unprimed utterances.",
        "We distinguish between three possible user actions following the system's confirmation prompt: 1) keep - use the same form as in the unprimed utterance; 2) adapt - switch to the same form as in the system's confirmation prompt; and 3) switch switch to a different form than the one used in the system's confirmation prompt or in the unprimed utterance.",
        "Table 3 shows the proportions for each possible user action.",
        "In the adaptive condition users are twice as likely to keep the time form than in the non-adaptive condition (81.8% vs. 37.5%).",
        "This difference is statistically significant (p < .001).",
        "In the non-adaptive system condition users who change time form are slightly more likely to switch (35.4%) than to adapt (29.1%).",
        "These results suggest that when the system does not adapt to the user, the user's choice is unpredictable.",
        "However, if the system adapts to the user, the user is likely to keep the same form.",
        "This means that if the system can adapt to the user when the user chooses a form that is more likely to be recognized correctly, that provides positive reinforcement, making the user more likely to use that felicitous form in the future.",
        "Furthermore, if the system does adapt to the user then it may be possible with high accuracy to predict the user's form for subsequent utterances, and to use this information to improve ASR accuracy for subsequent utterances (Stoyanchev and Stent, 2009b).",
