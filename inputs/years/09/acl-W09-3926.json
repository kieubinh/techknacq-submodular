        "Spoken Dialog Systems (SDSs) are now widely used, and are becoming more complex as a result of the increased solidity of advanced techniques, mainly in the realm of natural language understanding (Steimel et al.",
        "2008).",
        "At the same time, the evaluation of such systems increasingly demands for testing the entire system, as components for speech recognition, language understanding and dialog management are interacting more deeply.",
        "For example, the system might search for web content on the basis of meaning extracted from an n-best list, and generate the reply and speech recognition grammars depending on the content found (Wootton et al.",
        "2007).",
        "The performance of single components strongly depends on each other component in this case.",
        "While performance parameters become less meaningful in such a system, the system's overall quality, which can only be measured by asking the user (Jekosch 2005), gains interest for the evaluation.",
        "Typically, users fill out questionnaires after the interaction, which cover various perceptional dimensions such as efficiency, dialog smoothness, or the overall evaluation of the system (Hone and Graham, 2001; ITU-T Rec.",
        "P.851, 2003; Moller 2005a).",
        "Judgments of the system's overall quality can be used to compare systems with respect to a single measure, which however comprises all relevant aspects of the interaction.",
        "Thus, the complexity of the evaluation task is reduced.",
        "In addition, user simulation is increasingly used to address the difficulty of foreseeing all possible problems a user might encounter with the system (e.g. Ai and Weng, 2008; Engelbrecht et al., 2008a; Chung, 2004; Lopez-Cozar et al., 2003).",
        "In order to evaluate results from such simulations, some approaches utilize prediction models of user judgments (e.g. Ai and Weng, 2008; Engelbrecht et al., 2008a).",
        "Currently, prediction models for user judgments are based on the PARADISE framework introduced by Walker et al.",
        "(1997).",
        "PARADISE assumes that user satisfaction judgments describe the overall quality of the system, and are causally related to task success and dialog costs, i.e. efficiency and quality of the dialog.",
        "Therefore, a linear regression function can be trained with interaction parameters describing dialog costs and task success as predictors, and satisfaction ratings as the target.",
        "The resulting equation can then be used to predict user satisfaction with unseen dialogs.",
        "In follow-up studies, it could be shown that such models are to some degree generalizable (Walker et al., 2000).",
        "However, also limitations of the models in predicting judgments for other user groups, or for systems with different levels of ASR performance, were reported (Walker et al., 1998).",
        "In the same study, prediction functions for user satisfaction were proposed to serve as optimization function in a system adapting its dialog strategy during the interaction.",
        "This idea is taken up by Rieser and Lemon (2008).",
        "The prediction accuracy of PARADISE functions typically lies around an R of 0.5, meaning that 50% of the variance in the judgments is explained by the model.",
        "While this number is not absolutely satisfying, it could be shown that mean values for groups of dialogs (e.g. with a specific system configuration) can be predicted more accurately than single dialogs with the same models (Engelbrecht and Möller, 2007).",
        "Low R for the predictions of ratings of individual dialogs seems to be due to inter-rater differences at least to some degree.",
        "Such differences have been described, and may concern the actual perception of the judged issue (Guski, 1999), or the way the perception is described by the participant (Okun and Weir, 1990; Engelbrecht et al., 2008b)",
        "We have tested the PARADISE framework extensively, using different classifier models and interaction parameters.",
        "Precise and general models are hard to achieve, even if the set of parameters describing the interaction is widely extended (Möller et al., 2008).",
        "In an effort to improve such prediction models, we developed two ideas:",
        "• Predict the distribution of ratings which can be expected for a representative group of users given the same stimulus.",
        "This takes into account that in most cases the relevant user characteristics determining the judgment cannot be tracked, or even are unknown.",
        "• Consider the time relations between events by modeling user opinion as a variable evolving over the course of the dialog.",
        "This way, time relations like cooccurrence of events, which affect quality perception, attention, or memory can be modeled most effectively.",
        "In this paper, we present a new modeling approach considering these ideas.",
        "In Section 2, we introduce the topology of the model.",
        "Following this, we report how training data for the model were obtained from user tests in Section 3.",
        "Evaluation results are presented in Section 4 and discussed in Section 5, before we conclude with some remarks on follow-up research."

        "Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are often used for classifying sequential stochastic processes, e.g. in computational linguistics or bio-informatics.",
        "An HMM models a sequence of events as a sequence of states, in which each state emits certain symbols with some probability.",
        "In addition, the transitions between states are probabilistic.",
        "The model is defined by a set of state symbols, a set of emission symbols, the probabilities for the initial state, the state transition matrix, and the emission matrix.",
        "The transition matrix contains the probabilities for transitions from each state to each other state or itself.",
        "The emission matrix contains the probabilities for each emission symbol to occur at each state.",
        "While the sequence of emissions can be observed, the state sequence is hidden.",
        "However, given an emission sequence, standard algorithms defined for the HMM allow to calculate the probability of each state at each point in the sequence.",
        "The probability for the model to be in a state is dependent on the previous state and the emissions observed at the current state.",
        "As illustrated by Figure 1, the development of the users' opinions can be modelled as an HMM.",
        "The user judgment about the dialog is modelled as states, each state representing a specific judgment (think of it as \"emotional states\").",
        "A prediction is made at each dialog turn.",
        "In the model depicted, the user judgment can either be \"bad\" or \"good\".",
        "Each judgment has a probabilistic relation to the current events in the dialog.",
        "In the picture, the events are described in the form of understanding errors and confirmation types, i.e. there are two features which can take a number of different values, each with a certain probability.",
        "Although the judgments do not \"emit\" the events at each turn (the causal relation is opposite), the probabilistic relation between them can be captured and evaluated with the HMM and the associated algorithms.",
        "Apart from the dialog events, the current judgment is also determined by the previous judgment.",
        "For example, we expect that the judgments are varying smoothly, i.e. the probability for a transition becomes lower with increasing (semantic) distance between the state labels.",
        "Although events in previous turns cannot impact the current judgment given this model topology, it is possible to incorporate dialog history by creating features with a time lag.",
        "E.g., a feature could represent the understanding error in the previous turn.",
        "Also, simultaneity of different events affecting the quality perception can be evaluated by calculating probabilities for each judgment given the observed combination of features.",
        "If the features are interacting (i.e. the probability of one feature changes in dependence of another feature), this is modelled by directly specifying the emission probabilities for each combination of features.",
        "We call this a layer of emissions.",
        "Additional layers with other features can be created.",
        "In this case, the likelihood of each judgment given probabilities from each layer can be calculated by multiplication of the probabilities from each layer.",
        "For the calculation of state probabilities, we can use forward recursion (Rabiner, 1989).",
        "The algorithm proceeds through the observed sequence, and at each step calculates the probability for each state given the probabilities of the observation, the probabilities of each state at the previous step, and the transition probabilities.",

        "Data Collection",
        "In order to train the model, data is needed in which the association between dialog events and judgments at each turn is represented.",
        "Therefore, we conducted an experiment in which users interacted with an SDS and judged the interaction after each dialog turn.",
        "In addition, all users followed the same five dialogs, which was possible by using the Wizard-of-Oz technique (Fraser and Gilbert 1991) and relatively strict scenario descriptions.",
        "As the interactions were predefined, care was taken that a representative sample of relevant usability problems were passed in the interactions.",
        "Such problems were collected in a brainstorming session, and comprise understanding errors, task failure, prompt wording issues (such as incomplete information), missing control options, or not being able to input one of the criteria specified in the scenario description.",
        "As further features of the dialog, which might impact the quality judgment, the number of concepts which can be specified, as well as the confirmation strategy, should vary along the interactions.",
        "We then designed a dialog system with a consistent strategy, which however allowed for the quality-relevant issues mentioned above to occur in the dialogs.",
        "The system was derived from the BoRIS restaurant information system (Möller 2005b), which enables the search of restaurants in the German city Bochum according to the criteria day, time, location, type of cuisine and pricing.",
        "For our system, we simplified the dialog strategy to system initiative, however, at the first turn, the users could say both day and time.",
        "If both were recognized, explicit confirmation was requested.",
        "If just one constraint was understood, confirmation was implicit.",
        "The last constraint specified (pricing) was not confirmed, and instead the restaurant information was output directly.",
        "If no restaurant was found according to the specified criteria, the user could change one of the constraints.",
        "Table 1 shows an example of a dialog with the system.",
        "We also reformulated some prompts to fit the changed dialog strategy, and partly to incorporate potential wording problems.",

        "In addition to the foreseen prompts, the wizard had at hand no-input and help prompts in case the user would behave unexpectedly.",

        "In this paper, we presented a new approach to the prediction of user judgments about SDSs, using HMMs.",
        "The approach allows predicting the users' judgments at each step of a dialog.",
        "In predicting the distribution of ratings of many users, the approach takes into account differences between the users' judgment behaviors.",
        "This increases the usefulness of the model for a number of applications.",
        "E.g., in adaptive systems, the decision process can take into account differences between the users which cannot be attributed to user characteristics known to the system.",
        "If the model is applied to automatically generated dialogs, e.g. in the MeMo workbench (Engelbrecht et al., 2008a), a more detailed prediction of user satisfaction is enabled, allowing analysis on a turn-by-turn basis.",
        "In addition, the approach facilitates the analysis of models and features affecting the quality ratings, as results can be compared to the empirical ratings with more detail.",
        "We hope to gain further insight into the relations between interaction parameters and user judgments by running simulations under different assumptions of relations between these entities.",
        "A drawback of the approach is the generation of training data.",
        "The models presented in this paper cannot be assumed to be general, and in particular are lacking important parameters reflecting the timing in the dialogs.",
        "Therefore, as a next step the acquisition of judgments should be improved to be less disruptive for the interaction.",
        "In addition, it would be interesting to find a method for deriving the correct distributions of ratings at each dialog turn from a corpus of different dialogs, e.g. by grouping situations which are comparable.",
        "At the moment, we are also investigating if judgments can be acquired after the interactions without a loss in validity.",
        "After all, the results we achieved with the model suggest that HMMs are suitable for modeling the users' quality perception of dialogs with SDSs.",
        "Further research on the topic will hopefully show if the dialog history has to be considered to a wider degree than in our present models.",
        "Concerning dialog features and their relation to the judgments, the role of understanding errors in combination with the confirmation type could be established so far.",
        "More rich data are needed to work towards a general model for judgment predictions, including all relevant parameters.",
        "If judgments can be acquired after the interactions, we will be able to easily get the data needed for a better (and maybe complete) model.",
        "In any case, we are confident that the approach taken will allow a deeper analysis of the quality judgment process, which will enable progress by more analytical methods, such as formulating and testing hypotheses about this process."
