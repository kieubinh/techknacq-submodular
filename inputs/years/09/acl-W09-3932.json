        "Conversational interfaces including dialogue systems and conversational agents have been typically used as a single interface to a single user (Zue et al., 1994; Allen et al., 2001; Cassell et al., 2000).",
        "On the other hand, a new area of research in conversational interfaces is dealing with multi-party interaction (Traum and Rickel, 2002; Liu and Chee, 2004; Zheng et al., 2005).",
        "Multiparty conversational interfaces have been applied to such tasks as training decision-making in team activities (Traum and Rickel, 2002), collaborative learning (Liu and Chee, 2004), and coordinating and facilitating interaction in a casual social group (Zheng et al., 2005).",
        "The advantage of such multi-party dialogues over two-party cases is that the multi-party case encourages group interaction and collaboration among human users.",
        "This advantage can be exploited to foster such human activities as student learning in more social settings and to build and maintain social relationships among people.",
        "However, unless users actively engage in the interaction, these multi-party dialogue qualities cannot be adequately exploited.",
        "Our objective is to stimulate human communication in multi-party dialogues between multi-users and multi-agents by raising user willingness to engage in the interaction and increasing the number of user utterances.",
        "As the first step toward this objective, we exploit a new style of dialogue called thought-evoking dialogue and experimentally investigate the impact of a peer agent's presence and agent emotional expressions on communication activation in thought-evoking multi-party dialogues.",
        "A thought-evoking dialogue, an interaction in which agents act on the willingness of users to provoke user thinking and encourage involvement in the dialogue, has the potential to activate interaction among participants in multi-party dialogues.",
        "Previous work proposed a quiz-style information presentation dialogue system (hereafter quiz-style dialogue system) (Higashinaka et al., 2007a) that is regarded as a kind of thought-evoking dialogue system.",
        "This system conveys contents as biographical facts of famous people through quizstyle interaction with users by creating a \"Who is this?\"",
        "quiz and individually presenting hints.",
        "The hints are automatically created from the biographical facts of people and ordered based on the difficulty naming the people experienced by the users (Higashinaka et al., 2007b).",
        "Since the user has to consider the hints to come up with reasonable answers, the system stimulates user thinking.",
        "This previous work reported that, for interaction between a single user and a computer, a quiz-style dialogue improved user understanding and willingness to engage in the interaction.",
        "In this paper, we focus on a quiz-style information presentation multi-party dialogue (hereafter quiz-style multi-party dialogue) as an example of a thought-evoking multi-party dialogue.",
        "A peer agent acts as a peer of the users and participates in the interactions in the same way that the users do.",
        "We are interested in the peer agent's role in quiz-style multi-party dialogues since the positive effects of a peer agent on users have been shown in the educational domain (Chou et al., 2003; Maldonado et al., 2005), which is a promising application area for quiz-style dialogues.",
        "In the educational domain, a user could benefit not only from direct communication with a peer agent but also from overhearing dialogues between a peer agent and a tutor.",
        "Learning by observing others who are learning is called vicarious learning and positively affects user performance (Craig et al., 2000; Stenning et al., 1999).",
        "To the best of our knowledge, detailed experimental investigations on the effect of a peer agent on communication activation have not been reported in multi-party dialogues between multi-users and multi-agents, which are our main concern in this paper.",
        "The topic of emotion has gained widespread attention in human-computer interaction (Bates, 1994; Picard, 1997; Hudlicka, 2003; Prendinger and Ishizuka, 2004).",
        "The impact of an agent's emotional behaviors on users has also recently been studied (Brave et al., 2005; Maldonado et al., 2005; Prendinger et al., 2005).",
        "However, these previous studies addressed scenario-based interaction in which a user and an agent acted with predetermined timing.",
        "In this paper, we investigate the impact of agent emotional expressions on users in multi-party dialogues in which multiple users and agents can make utterances with more flexible timing.",
        "Resembling work by Brave et al.",
        "(2005), we classify agent emotional expressions into empathic and self-oriented ones and investigate their impact on users in a thought-evoking multi-party dialogue system.",
        "As stated above, Brave et al.",
        "(2005) addressed scenario-based Blackjack interaction, but we deal with multi-party dialogues that enable more flexible turn-taking.",
        "Previous studies (Bickmore and Picard, 2005; Higashinaka et al., 2008) showed that agent empathic expressions have a positive psychological impact upon users, but they only examined two-party cases.",
        "Although Traum et al.",
        "(2002) and Gebhard et al.",
        "(2004) exploited the role of agent emotion in multi-party dialogues, they did not adequately examine the effects of agent emotion on communication activation by experiment.",
        "In this work, we deal with disembodied agents and focus on their linguistic behaviors.",
        "We believe that our results are useful for designing embodied conversational agents using other modalities.",
        "This paper presents an experimental study that analyzes how agents stimulate human communication in quiz-style multi-party dialogues between two users and two agents.",
        "We are especially interested in how the presence of a peer agent and agent emotional expressions improve user satisfaction, enhance user opinions about the peer agent, and increase the number of user utterances.",
        "Our findings will be useful for stimulating human communication in various applications such as educational agents and community facilitators.",
        "In the following, Section 2 shows an overview of our quiz-style multi-party dialogue system.",

        "This paper experimentally analyzed how conversational agents stimulate human communication in thought-evoking multi-party dialogues between multi-users and multi-agents.",
        "As an example of such multi-party dialogue, we focused on quizstyle multi-party dialogues between two users and two agents.",
        "We investigated how a peer agent's presence and agent emotional expressions influenced user satisfaction, the user ratings of the peer agent, and the number of user utterances.",
        "The user ratings of the peer agent included user's perceived closeness, likability and caring from the peer agent, and the user's feeling of being supported by the peer agent.",
        "The experiment results showed that the peer agent's presence significantly improved user satisfaction and increased the number of user utterances.",
        "We also found significant effects that agent empathic expressions improved user satisfaction and user positive ratings of the peer agent and that they further increased the number of user utterances.",
        "These results indicate that employing a peer agent and agent empathic behaviors in thought-evoking multi-party dialogues will stimulate interaction among people in computer-mediated communication.",
        "Our findings will be useful for a broader class of applications such as educational agents and community facilitators.",
        "Many directions for future work remain.",
        "First, we plan to extend our work to deal with various modalities such as speech, gestures, body posture, facial expressions, and the direction of eye gazes to investigate the effects of agent representation (embodied or disembodied) and other modalities in thought-evoking multi-party dialogues.",
        "Second, we will analyze how agent behaviors influence users and dialogues in more detail and develop a more sophisticated dialogue management method based on our detailed analysis.",
        "Learning optimal dialogue management strategies in multi-party dialogues is a challenging research topic.",
        "Third, examining the relationship between user personality traits and the impact of agents on users is valuable.",
        "Previous work reported that the effect of embodiment depended on user personalities (Lee et al., 2006).",
        "This direction is important to the stimulation of multi-party interaction for therapeutic and emotional support."
