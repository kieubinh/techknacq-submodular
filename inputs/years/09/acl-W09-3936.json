        "We examine a number of objective, automatically computable turn-yielding cues – distinct prosodic, acoustic and syntactic events in a speaker's speech that tend to precede a smooth turn exchange – in the Columbia Games Corpus, a large corpus of task-oriented dialogues.",
        "We show that the likelihood of occurrence of a turn-taking attempt from the interlocutor increases linearly with the number of cues conjointly displayed by the speaker.",
        "Our results are important for improving the coordination of speaking turns in interactive voice-response systems, so that systems can correctly estimate when the user is willing to yield the conversational floor, and so that they can produce their own turn-yielding cues appropriately."

        "Users of state-of-the-art interactive voice response (IVR) systems often find interactions with these systems to be unsatisfactory.",
        "Part of this reaction is due to deficiencies in speech recognition and synthesis technologies, but some can also be traced to coordination problems in the exchange of speaking turns between system and user (Ward et al., 2005; Raux et al., 2006).",
        "Users are not sure when the system is ready to end its turn, and systems are not sure when users are ready to relinquish theirs.",
        "Currently, the standard method for determining when a user is willing to yield the conversational floor is to wait for a silence longer than a prespecified threshold, typically ranging from 0.5 to 1 second (Ferrer et al., 2003).",
        "However, this strategy is rarely used by humans, who rely instead on cues from sources such as syntax, acoustics and prosody to anticipate turn transitions (Yngve, 1970).",
        "If such TURN-YIELDING CUES could be modeled and incorporated in iVR systems, it should be possible to make faster, more accurate turn-taking decisions, thus leading to a more fluent interaction.",
        "Additionally, a better understanding of the mechanics of turn-taking could be used to vary the speech output of IVR systems to (i) produce turn-yielding cues when the system is finished speaking and the user is expected to speak next, and (ii) avoid producing such cues when the system has more things to say.",
        "In this paper we examine the existence of turn-yielding cues in a large corpus of task-oriented dialogues in Standard American English (SAE).",
        "The question of what types of cues humans exploit for engaging in synchronized conversation has been addressed by several studies.",
        "Duncan (1972, inter alia) conjectures that speakers display complex signals at turn endings, composed of one or more discrete turn-yielding cues, such as the completion of a grammatical clause, or any phrase-final intonation other than a plateau.",
        "Duncan also hypothesizes that the likelihood of a turn-taking attempt by the listener increases linearly with the number of such cues conjointly displayed by the speaker.",
        "Subsequent studies have investigated some of these hypotheses (Ford and Thompson, 1996; Wennerstrom and Siegel, 2003).",
        "More recent studies have investigated how to improve IVR system's the turn-taking decisions by incorporating some of the features found to correlate with turn endings (Ferrer et al., 2003; Atterer et al., 2008; Raux and Eskenazi, 2008).",
        "All of these models are shown to improve over silence-based techniques for predicting turn endings, motivating further research.",
        "In this paper we present results of a large, corpus-based study of turn-yielding cues in the Columbia Games Corpus which verifies some of Duncan's hypotheses and adds additional cues to turn-taking behavior."

        "The materials for our study are taken from the Columbia Games Corpus (Gravano, 2009), a collection of 12 spontaneous task-oriented dyadic conversations elicited from 13 native speakers of SAE.",
        "In each session, two subjects were paid to play a series of computer games requiring verbal communication to achieve joint goals of identifying and moving images on the screen, while seated in a soundproof booth divided by a curtain to ensure that all communication was verbal.",
        "The subjects' speech was not restricted in any way, and the games were not timed.",
        "The corpus contains 9 hours of dialogue, which were orthographically transcribed; words were time-aligned to the source by hand.",
        "Around 5.4 hours have also been intonationally transcribed using the ToBI framework (Beckman and Hirschberg, 1994).",
        "We automatically extracted a number of acoustic features from the corpus using the Praat toolkit (Boersma and Weenink, 2001), including pitch, intensity and voice quality features.",
        "Pitch slopes were computed by fitting least-squares linear regression models to the Fo track extracted from given portions of the signal.",
        "Part-of-speech (POS) tags were labeled automatically using Rat-naparkhi's maxent tagger trained on a subset of the Switchboard corpus in lower-case with all punctuation removed, to simulate spoken language transcripts.",
        "All speaker normalizations were calculated using z-scores: z = (x – p)/a, where x is a raw measurement, and /x and a are the mean and standard deviation for a speaker.",
        "For our turn-taking studies, we define an inter-pausal unit (IPU) as a maximal sequence of words surrounded by silence longer than 50 ms. A turn then is defined as a maximal sequence of IPUs from one speaker, such that between any two adjacent IPUs there is no speech from the interlocutor.",
        "Boundaries of IPUs and turns are computed automatically from the time-aligned transcriptions.",
        "Two trained annotators classified each turn transition in the corpus using a labeling scheme adapted from Beattie (1982) that identifies, inter alia, SMOOTH SWITCHES – transitions from speaker A to speaker B such that (i) A manages to complete her utterance, and (ii) no overlapping speech occurs between the two conversational turns.",
        "Additionally, all continuations from one IPU to the next within the same turn were labeled automatically as hold transitions.",
        "The complete labeling scheme is shown in the Appendix.",
        "Our general approach consists in contrasting IPUs immediately preceding smooth switches (S) with IPUs immediately preceding holds (H).",
        "(Note that in this paper we consider only non-overlapping exchanges.)",
        "We hypothesize that turn-yielding cues are more likely to occur before S than before H. It is important to emphasize the optionality of all turn-taking phenomena and decisions: For H, turn-yielding cues – whatever their nature – may still be present; and for S, they may sometimes be absent.",
        "However, we hypothesize that their likelihood of occurrence should be much higher before S. Finally, note that we do not make claims regarding whether speakers consciously produce turn-yielding cues, or whether listeners consciously perceive and/or use them to aid their turn-taking decisions."

        "Figures 1 and 2 show the speaker-normalized mean of a number of objective, automatically computed variables for IPUs preceding S and H. In all cases, one-way anova and Kruskal-Wallis tests reveal significant differences (at p < 0.001) between the two groups.",
        "We we discuss these results in detail below.",
        "The literature contains frequent mention of the propensity of speaking turns to end in any intonation contour other than a plateau (a sustained pitch level, neither rising nor falling).",
        "We first analyze the categorical prosodic labels in the portion of the Columbia Games Corpus annotated using the ToBI annotations.",
        "We tabulate the phrase accent and boundary tone labels assigned to the end of each IPU, and compare their distribution for the S and H turn exchange types, as shown in Table 1.",
        "A chi-square test indicates that there is a significant departure from a random distribution (x = 1102.5, df = 5, p w0).",

        "The high counts for the falling contour preceding a hold (24.7%) may be explained by the fact that, as discussed above, taking the turn is optional for the listener, who may choose not to act despite hearing some turn-yielding cues.",
        "It is not entirely clear what the role is of the low-rising contour (L-H%), as it occurs in similar proportions before S and before H.

        "Next, we examine four objective acoustic approximations of this perceptual feature: the absolute value of the speaker-normalized Fo slope, both raw and stylized, computed over the final 200 and 300 ms of each IPU.",
        "The case of a plateau corresponds to a value of Fo slope close to zero; the other case, of either a rising or a falling pitch, corresponds to a high absolute value of Fo slope.",
        "As shown in Figure 1, we find that the final slope before S is significantly higher than before H in all four cases.",
        "These findings provide additional support to the hypothesis that turns tend to end in falling and high-rising final intonations, and provide automatically identifiable indicators of this turn-yielding cue.",
        "Duncan (1972) hypothesizes a \"drawl on the final syllable or on the stressed syllable of a terminal clause\" [p. 287] as a turn-yielding cue, which would probably correspond to a noticeable decrease in speaking rate.",
        "We examine this hypothesis in our corpus using two common definitions of speaking rate: syllables per second and phonemes per second.",
        "Syllable and phoneme counts were estimated from dictionary lookup, and word durations were extracted from the manual orthographic alignments.",
        "Figure 1 shows that both measures, computed over either the whole IPU or its final word, are significantly higher before S than before H, which indicates an increase in speaking rate before turn boundaries rather than Duncan's hypothesized drawl.",
        "Furthermore, the speaking rate is, in both cases (before S and before H), significantly slower on the final word than over the whole IPU, a finding that is in line with phonological theories that predict a segmental lengthening near prosodic phrase boundaries (Wightman et al., 1992).",
        "This finding may indeed correspond to the drawl or lengthening described by Duncan before turn boundaries.",
        "However, it seems to be the case – at least for our corpus – that the final lengthening tends to occur at all phrase final positions, not just at turn endings.",
        "In fact, our results indicate that the final lengthening is more prominent in turn-medial IPUs than in turn-final ones.",
        "In the Columbia Games Corpus, we find that turn-final IPUs tend to be significantly longer than turnmedial ones, both when measured in seconds and in number of words (Figure 1).",
        "This suggests that IPU duration could function as a turn-yielding cue, supporting similar findings in perceptual experiments by Cutler and Pearson (1986).",
        "We also find that IPUs followed by S have a mean intensity significantly lower than those followed by H (computed over the IPU-final 500 and 1000 ms, see Figure 2).",
        "Also, the differences increase when moving towards the end of the IPU.",
        "This suggests that speakers tend to lower their voices when approaching potential turn boundaries, whereas they reach turn-internal pauses with a higher intensity.",
        "Phonological theories conjecture a declination in the pitch level, which tends to decrease gradually within utterances, and across utterances within the same discourse segment, as a consequence of a gradual compression of the pitch range (Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg, 1990).",
        "For conversational turns, then, we would expect to find that speakers tend to lower their pitch level as they reach potential turn boundaries.",
        "This hypothesis is verified by the dialogues in our corpus, where we find that IPUs preceding S have a significantly lower mean pitch than those preceding H (Figure 2).",
        "In consequence, pitch level may also work as a turn-yielding cue.",
        "Next we examine three acoustic features associated with the perception of voice quality: jitter, shimmer and noise-to-harmonics ratio (NHR) (Bhuta et al., 2004), computed over the IPU-final 500 and 1000 ms (Figure 2).",
        "We compute jitter and shimmer only over voiced frames for improved robustness.",
        "For all three features, the mean value for IPUs preceding S is significantly higher than for IPUs preceding H, with the difference increasing towards the end of the IPU.",
        "Therefore, voice quality seems to play a clear role as a turn-yielding cue.",
        "Stereotyped expressions such as you know or I think have been proposed in the literature as lexical turn-yielding cues.",
        "However, in the Games Corpus we find that none of the most frequent IPU-final unigrams and bigrams, both preceding S and H, correspond to such expressions (see Table A.1 in the Appendix).",
        "Instead, such unigrams and bigrams are specific to the computer games in which the subjects participated.",
        "For example, the game objects tended to be spontaneously described by subjects from top to bottom and from left to right, as shown in the following excerpt (pauses are indicated with #):",
        "A: I have a blue lion on top # with a lemon in the bottom left # and a yellow crescent moon in # i # in the bottom right",
        "In consequence, bigrams such as lower right and bottom right are common before S, while on top or bottom left are common before H. These are all task-specific lexical constructions and do not constitute stereotyped expressions in the traditional sense.",
        "Also very common among the most frequent IPU-final expressions are affirmative cue words – heavily overloaded words, such as okay or yeah, that are used both to initiate and to end discourse segments, among other functions (Gravano et al., 2007).",
        "The occurrence of these words does not constitute a turn-yielding or turnholding cue per se; rather, additional contextual, acoustic and prosodic information is needed to disambiguate their meaning.",
        "While we do not find clear examples of lexical turn-yielding cues in our task-oriented corpus, we do find two lexical turn-holding cues: word fragments (e.g., incompl-) and filled pauses (e.g., uh, um).",
        "Of the 8123 IPUs preceding H, 6.7% end in a word fragment, and 9.4% in a filled pause.",
        "By constrast, only 0.3% of the 3246 IPUs preceding S end in a word fragment, and 1% in a filled pause.",
        "These differences suggest that, after either a word fragment or a filled pause, the speaker is much more likely to intend to continue holding the floor.",
        "This notion of disfluencies functioning as a turn-taking cue has been studied by Goodwin (1981), who shows that they may be used to secure the listener's attention at turn beginnings.",
        "Several authors (Duncan, 1972; Ford and Thompson, 1996; Wennerstrom and Siegel, 2003) claim that some form of syntactic or semantic completion, independent of intonation and interactional import, functions as a turn-yielding cue.",
        "Although some call this syntactic completion, since all authors acknowledge the need for semantic and discourse information in judging it, we choose the more neutral term textual completion for this phenomenon.",
        "We annotated a portion of our corpus with respect to textual completion and trained a machine learning (ML) classifier to automatically label the whole corpus.",
        "From these annotations we then examined how textual completion labels relate to turn-taking categories in the corpus.",
        "3.5.1.",
        "Manual labeling: In conversation, listeners judge textual completion incrementally and without access to later material.",
        "To simulate these conditions in the labeling task, annotators were asked to judge the textual completion of a turn up to a target pause from the written transcript alone, without listening to the speech.",
        "They were allowed to read the transcript of the full previous turn by the other speaker (if any), but they were not given access to anything after the target pause.",
        "These are two sample tokens:",
        "A: the lion's left paw our front B: yeah and it's th- right so the",
        "A: and then a tea kettle and then the wine B: okay well I have the big shoe and the wine",
        "We selected 400 tokens at random from the Games Corpus; the target pauses were also chosen at random.",
        "Three annotators labeled each token independently as either complete or incomplete according to these guidelines: Determine whether you believe what speaker B has said up to this point could constitute a complete response to what speaker A has said in the previous turn/segment.",
        "Note: If there are no words by A, then B is beginning a new task, such as describing a card or the location of an object.",
        "To avoid biasing the results, annotators were not given the turn-taking labels of the tokens.",
        "Inter-annotator reliability is measured by Fleiss' k at 0.814, which corresponds to the 'almost perfect' agreement category.",
        "The mean pairwise agreement between the three subjects is 90.8%.",
        "For the cases in which there is disagreement between the three annotators, we adopt the majority label as our gold standard; that is, the label chosen by two annotators.",
        "3.5.2.",
        "Automatic classification: Next, we trained a ML model using the 400 manually annotated tokens as training data to automatically classify all IPUs in the corpus as either complete or incomplete.",
        "For each IPU we extracted a number of lexical and syntactic features from the current turn up to the IPU itself: lexical identity of the IPU-final word (w); POS tags and simplified POS tags (N, V, Adj, Adv, Other) of w and of the IPU-final bigram; number of words in the IPU; a binary flag indicating if w is a word fragment; size and type of the biggest (bp) and smallest (sp) phrase that end in w; binary flags indicating if each of bp and sp is a major phrase (NP, VP, PP, ADjP, ADVP); binary flags indicating if w is the head of each of bp and sp.",
        "We chose these features in order to capture as much lexical and syntactic information as possible from the transcripts.",
        "The syntactic features were computed using two different parsers: the Collins statistical parser (Collins, 2003) and CASS, a partial parser especially designed for use with noisy text (Abney, 1996).",
        "We experimented with the learners listed in Table 2, using the implementations provided in the Weka ML toolkit (Witten and Frank, 2000).",
        "Table 2 shows the accuracy of the majority-class baseline and of each classifier, using 10-fold cross validation on the 400 training data points, and the mean pairwise agreement by the three human labelers.",
        "The linear-kernel support-vector-machine (SVM) classifier achieves the highest accuracy, significantly outperforming the baseline, and approaching the mean agreement of human labelers.",
        "3.5.3.",
        "Results: First we examine the tokens that were manually labeled by the human annotators.",
        "Of the 100 tokens followed by S, 91 were labeled textually complete, a significantly higher proportion than the 42% followed by H that were labeled complete (x=51.7, df=1, pw0).",
        "Next, we used our highest performing classifier, the linear-kernel SVM, to automatically label all IPUs in the corpus.",
        "Of the 3246 IPUs preceding S, 2649 (81.6%) were labeled textually complete, and about half of all IPUs preceding H (4272/8123, or 52.6%) were labeled complete.",
        "The difference is also significant (x = 818.7, df = 1, p w 0).",
        "These results suggest that textual completion as defined above constitutes a necessary, but not sufficient, turn-yielding cue."

        "We have examined seven turn-yielding cues – i.e., seven measurable events that take place with a significantly higher frequency on IPUs preceding smooth turn switches than on IPUs preceding hold transitions.",
        "These events may be summarized as follows: (i) a falling or high-rising intonation at the end of the IPU; (ii) an increased speaking rate; (iii) a lower intensity level; (iv) a lower pitch level; (v) a longer IPU duration; (vi) a higher value of three voice quality features: jitter, shimmer, and NHR; and (vii) a point of textual completion.",
        "We have also shown that, when several turn-yielding cues occur simultaneously, the likelihood of a subsequent turn-taking attempt by the interlocutor increases in an almost linear fashion.",
        "We propose that these findings can be used to improve some turn-taking decisions of state-of-the-art IVR systems.",
        "For example, if a system wishes to yield the floor to a user, it should include in its output as many of the described cues as possible.",
        "Conversely, when the user is speaking, the system may detect appropriate moments to take the turn by estimating the presence of turnyielding cues at every silence.",
