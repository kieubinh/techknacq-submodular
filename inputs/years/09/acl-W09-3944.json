        "Resolving second-person references in dialogue is far from trivial.",
        "Firstly, there is the referentiality problem: while we generally conceive of the word you as a deictic addressee-referring pronoun, it is often used in non-referential ways, including as a discourse marker (1) and with a generic sense (2).",
        "Secondly, there is the reference problem: in addressee-referring cases, we need to know who the addressee is.",
        "In two-person dialogue, this is not so difficult; but in multi-party dialogue, the addressee could in principle be any one of the other participants (3), or any group of more than one (4):",
        "(1) It's not just, you know, noises like something hitting.",
        "(2) Often, you need to know specific button sequences to get certain functionalities done.",
        "(3) I think it's good.",
        "You've done a good review.",
        "(4) I don't know if you guys have any questions.",
        "This paper extends previous work (Gupta et al., 2007; Frampton et al., 2009) in attempting to automatically treat both problems: detecting referential uses, and resolving their (addressee) reference.",
        "We find that accuracy can be improved by the use of lexical features; we also give the first results for treating both problems simultaneously, and find that there is an advantage to treating them as separate (but connected) problems via cascaded classifiers, rather than as a single joint problem."

        "(2007) examined the referentiality problem, distinguishing generic from referential uses in multi-party dialogue; they found that 47% of uses were generic and achieved a classification accuracy of 75%, using various discourse features and discriminative classifiers (support vector machines and conditional random fields).",
        "They attempted the reference-resolution problem, using only discourse (non-visual) features, but accuracy was low (47%).",
        "Addressee identification in general (i.e. independent of the presence of you) has been approached in various ways.",
        "Traum (2004) gives a rule-based algorithm based on discourse structure; van Turnhout et al.",
        "(2005) used facial orientation as well as utterance features; and more recently Jovanovic (2006; 2007) combined discourse and gaze direction features using Bayesian networks, achieving 77% accuracy on a portion of the AMI Meeting Corpus (McCowan et al., 2005) of 4-person dialogues.",
        "In recent work, therefore, Frampton et al.",
        "(2009) extended Gupta et al.",
        "'s method to include multi-modal features including gaze direction, again using Bayesian networks on the AMI corpus.",
        "This gave a small improvement on the referentiality problem (achieving 79% accuracy), and a large improvement on the reference-resolution task (77% accuracy distinguishing singular uses from plural, and 80% resolving singular individual addressee reference).",
        "However, they treated the two tasks in isolation, and also broke the addressee-reference problem into two separate subtasks (singular vs. plural reference, and singular addressee reference).",
        "A full computational you-resolution module would need to treat all tasks (either simultaneously as one joint classification problem, or as a cascaded sequence) - with inaccuracy at one task necessarily affecting performance at another - and we examine this here.",
        "In addition, we examine the effect of lexical features, following a similar insight to Katzenmaier et al.",
        "(2004); they used language modelling to help distinguish between user-and robot-directed utterances, as people use different language for the two - we expect that the same is true for human participants."

        "We used Frampton et al.",
        "(2009)'s AMI corpus data: 948 \"you\"-containing utterances, manually annotated for referentiality and accompanied by the AMI corpus' original addressee annotation.",
        "The very small number of two-person addressee cases were joined with the three-person (i.e. all non-speaker) cases to form a single \"plural\" class.",
        "49% of cases are generic; 32% of referential cases are plural, and the rest are approximately evenly distributed between the singular participants.",
        "While Frampton et al.",
        "(2009) labelled singular reference by physical location relative to the speaker (giving a 3-way classification problem), our lexical features are more suited to detecting actual participant identity - we therefore recast the singular reference task as a 4-way classification problem and recalculate their performance figures (giving very similar accuracies).",
        "Discourse Features We use Frampton et al.",
        "(2009)'s discourse features.",
        "These include simple durational and lexical/phrasal features (including mention of participant names); AMI dialogue act features; and features expressing the similarity between the current utterance and previous/following utterances by other participants.",
        "As dialogue act features are notoriously hard to tag automatically, and \"forward-looking\" information about following utterances may be unavailable in an on-line system, we examine the effect of leaving these out below.",
        "Visual Features Again we used Frampton et al.",
        "(2009)'s features, extracted from the AMI corpus manual focus-of-attention annotations which track head orientiation and eye gaze.",
        "Features include the target of gaze (any participant or the meeting whiteboard/projector screen) during each utterance, and information about mutual gaze between participants.",
        "These features may also not always be available (meeting rooms may not always have cameras), so we investigate the effect of their absence below.",
        "Lexical Features The AMI Corpus simulates a set of scenario-driven business meetings, with participants performing a design task (the design of a remote control).",
        "Participants are given specific roles to play, for example that of project manager, designer or marketing expert.",
        "It therefore seems possible that utterances directed towards particular individuals will involve the use of different vocabularies reflecting their expertise.",
        "Different words or phrases may also be associated with generic and referential discussion, and extracting these automatically may give benefits over attempting to capture them using manually-defined features.",
        "To exploit this, we therefore added the use of lexical features: one feature for each distinct word or n-gram seen more than once in the corpus.",
        "Although such features may be corpus-or domain-specific, they are easy to extract given a transcript."

        "We first examine the effect of lexical features on the individual tasks, using 10-way cross-validation and comparing performance with Frampton et al.",
        "(2009).",
        "Table 1 shows the results for the referen-tiality task in terms of overall accuracy and per-class Fl-scores; 'MC Baseline' is the majority-class baseline; results labelled 'EACL' are Frampton et al.",
        "(2009)'s figures, and are presented for all features and for reduced feature sets which might be more realistic in various situations: '-V' removes visual features; '-VFD' removes visual features, forward-looking discourse features and dialogue-act tag features.",
        "As can be seen, adding lexical features ('+words' adds single word features, '+3grams' adds n-gram features of lengths 1-3) improves the performance significantly - accuracy is improved by 8.5% absolute above the best EACL results, which is a 40% reduction in error.",
        "Robustness to removal of potentially problematic features is also improved: removing all visual, forward-looking and dialogue act features makes little difference.",
        "In fact, using only lexical n-gram features, while reducing accuracy by 2.6%, still performs better than the best EACL classifier.",
        "Table 2 shows the equivalent results for the singular-plural reference distinction task; in this experiment, we used a correlation-based feature selection method, following Frampton et al.",
        "(2009).",
        "Again, performance is improved, this time giving a 8.8% absolute accuracy improvement, or 38% error reduction; robustness to removing visual and dialogue act features is also very good, even improving performance.",
        "For the individual reference task (again using feature selection), we give a further 'NS baseline' of taking the next speaker; note that this performs rather well, but requires forward-looking information so should not be compared to '-F' results.",
        "Results are again improved (Table 3), but the improvement is smaller: a 1.4% absolute accuracy improvement (7% error reduction); we conclude from this that visual information is most important for this part of the task.",
        "Robustness to feature unavailability still shows some improvement: excluding all visual, forward-looking and dialogue-act features has less effect than on the EACL system (60.7% vs. 56.6% accuracy), and a system using only n-grams and the next speaker identity gives a respectable 74.5%.",
        "Feature Analysis We examined the contribution of particular lexical features using Information Gain methods.",
        "For the referentiality task, we found that generic uses of you were more likely to appear in utterances containing words related to the main meeting topic, such as button, channel, or volume (properties of the to-be-designed remote control).",
        "In contrast, words related to meeting management, such as presentation, email, project and meeting itself, were predictive of referential uses.",
        "The presence of first person pronouns and discourse and politeness markers such as okay, please and thank you was also indicative of refer-entiality, as were n-grams capturing interrogative structures (e.g. do you).",
        "For the plural/singular distinction, we found that the plural first person pronoun we correlated with plural references of you.",
        "Other predictive n-grams for this task were you mean and you know, which were indicative of singular and plural references, respectively.",
        "Finally, for the individual reference task, useful lexical features included participant names, and items related to their roles.",
        "For instance, the n-grams sales, to sell and make money correlated with utterances addressed to the \"marketing expert\", while utterances containing speech recognition and technical were addressed to the \"industrial designer\".",
        "Discussion The best F-score of the three subtasks is for the generic/referential distinction; the worst is for the detection of plural reference (Fplurin Table 2).",
        "This is not surprising: humans find the former task easy to annotate - Gupta et al.",
        "(2007) report good inter-annotator agreement (k = 0.84) - but the latter hard.",
        "In their analysis of the AMI addressee annotations, Reidsma et al.",
        "(2008) observe that most confusions amongst annotators are between the group-addressing label and the labels for individuals; whereas if annotators agree that an utterance is addressed to an individual, they also reach high agreement on that addressee's identity.",
