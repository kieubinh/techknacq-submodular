        "Dialogue acts (DA) are linguistic abstractions that are commonly accepted and employed by the the dialogue community.",
        "In the framework of dialogue systems, they can be helpful to identify and model user intentions and system answers by the dialogue manager.",
        "Furthermore, in other dialogue modules such as the automatic speech recognizer or speech synthesiser, DA information may be also used to increase their performance.",
        "Many researchers have studied automatic DA labelling using different techniques.",
        "However, in most of this work it is common to assume that the dialogue turns are already segmented into separate utterances, where each utterance corresponds to just one DA label, as in (Stolcke et al. (2000); Ji and Bilmes (2005); Webb et al. (2005)).",
        "This is not a realistic situation because the segmentation of turns into utterances is not a trivial problem.",
        "There have been many previous approaches to segmentation of turns prior to DA labelling, beginning with (Stolcke and Shriberg (1996)).",
        "Typically some combination of words and part of speech (POS) tags is used to predict segmentation boundaries.",
        "In this work we make use of a statistical model to solve both the DA labelling task and the segmentation task simultaneously, following (Ang et al. (2005); Martmez-Hinarejos et al. (2006)).",
        "Our aim is to see whether going beyond the word n-gram models can improve accuracy, using syntactic information (constituent structure) obtained from the dialogue transcriptions.",
        "We examine whether this information can improve the segmentation of the dialogue turns into DA segments.",
        "Intuitively, it seems logical to believe that most of these segments must coincide with particular syntactic structures, and that segment boundaries would respect constituent boundaries."

        "All this corpus has been manually annotated at the dialogue act level using the SWBD-DAMSL scheme, (Jurafsky et al. (1997)), consisting of 42 different labels.",

        "The third row is the input for the parser.",
        "One of the main problems we face when we try to syntactically analyse a corpus transcribed from spontaneous speech by different people such as SWBD corpus, is the inconsistency of annotation conventions for spontaneous speech phenomena and punctuation marks.",
        "This can be problematic for parsers, as they work at the sentence level.",
        "Some of the dialogue turns of the SWBD corpus are not transcribed using consistent punctuation conventions.",

        "• Most general syntactic category that starts with a word, (MGSS), i.e., the root of the current subtree of the syntactic analysis, (e.g. in Figure 2, \"CC\" is the MGSS of the first word of the second segment, \"and\").",
        "• Most general syntactic category that ends with a word, (MGSE), i.e., the root of the",
        "subtree of the syntactic analysis that ends with that word, (e.g. in Figure 2, \"S\" is the MGSE of last word of the first segment, \"here\").",
        "Using these features, we have analysed the syntactic categories of boundary words of segments.",
        "Particularly, it seems interesting to study MGSE of last word of the segment and MGSS of irst word of the segment, because it indicates which syntactic structure ends before the segment boundary and which one starts after it.",
        "As there is always the beginning of a segment with the first word of the turn and the end of a segment with the last word of the turn, we are ignoring these for the analysis, because we are looking for intra-turn segments.",
