        "Nigel Crook, Ramon Granell, and Stephen Pulman",
        "In recent years Dialogue Acts have become a popular means of modelling the communicative intentions of human and machine utterances in many modern dialogue systems.",
        "Many of these systems rely heavily on the availability of dialogue corpora that have been annotated with Dialogue Act labels.",
        "The manual annotation of dialogue corpora is both tedious and expensive.",
        "Consequently, there is a growing interest in unsupervised systems that are capable of automating the annotation process.",
        "This paper investigates the use of a Dirichlet Process Mixture Model as a means of clustering dialogue utterances in an unsupervised manner.",
        "These clusters can then be analysed in terms of the possible Dialogue Acts that they might represent.",
        "The results presented here are from the application of the Dirichlet Process Mixture Model to the Dihana corpus."

        "Dialogue Acts (DAs) are an important contribution from discourse theory to the design of dialogue systems.",
        "These linguistics abstractions are based on the illocutionary force of speech acts (Austin, 1962) and try to capture and model the communicative intention of human or machine utterances.",
        "In recent years, several dialogue systems have made use of DAs for modelling discourse phenomena in either the Dialogue Manager (Keizer et al., 2008), Automatic Speech Recogniser (Stolcke et al., 2000) or the Automatic Speech Synthesiser (Zovato and Romportl, 2008).",
        "Additionally, they have been used also in other tasks such as summarisation, (Murray et al., 2006).",
        "Therefore, a correct DA classification of dialogue turns can bring benefits to the performance of these modules and tasks.",
        "Many machine learning approaches have been used to automatically label DAs.",
        "They are usually based on Supervised Learning techniques involving combinations of Ngrams and Hidden Markov Models (Stolcke et al., 2000; Martlnez-Hinarejos et al., 2008), Neural Networks (Garfield and Wermter, 2006) or Graphical Models (Ji and Bilmes, 2005).",
        "Relatively few approaches to DA classification have been based on unsupervised learning methods.",
        "Some promising results were reported by Anderach et al. (Andernach et al., 1997; Andernach, 1996) who applied Kohonen Self Organising Maps (SOMs) to the problem of DA classification.",
        "Although the SOM is nonpara-metric in the sense that it doesn't require that the number of clusters to be found in the data be a parameter of the SOM that is specified before clustering begins, it's capacity to detect clusters is limited to the size of the two-dimensional lattice onto which the clusters are projected, and the size of this lattice is determined prior to clustering.",
        "This paper investigates the use of an unsupervised, non-parametric Bayesian approach to automatic DA labelling: namely the Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (DPMM).",
        "Specifically, the paper reports results from applying the Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP), a popular approach to DPMMs, to the automatic labelling of DAs in the Dihana corpus.",
        "The Dihana corpus (J.M.Benedl et al., 2006) has previously been used for the same task but with a supervised learning approach (Martlnez-Hinarejos et al., 2008).",
        "The results reported here indicate that, treating each utterance as a bag of words, the CRP is capable of automatically clustering most utterances according to speaker, level 1 and in some cases level 2 DA annotations (see below)."

        "The Dihana corpus consists of human-computer spoken dialogues in Spanish about queuing information of train fares and timetables.",
        "The acquisition was performed using the Wizard of Oz (WoZ) technique, where a human simulates the system following a prefixed strategy.",
        "User and system utterances are different in nature, user utterances are completely spontaneous speech whereas system utterances are based on pre-written patterns that the WoZ selected according to what the user said in the previous turn, the current dialogue state and the WoZ strategy.",
        "There is a total of 900 dialogues with a vocabulary of 823 words.",
        "However, after applying a process of name entity recognition (cities, times, number, ...) and making the distinction between system and user words there are 964 different words.",
        "The same process of name entity recognition was also used by Martinez Hinare-jos (Martinez-Hinarejos et al., 2008)",
        "Dialogues were manually annotated using a dialogue act annotation scheme based on three levels (see Table 1).",
        "The first level corresponds to the general intention of the speaker (speech act), the second level represents the implicit information that is referred to in the first level and the third level is the specific data provided in the utterance.",
        "Using these three levels and making the distinction between user and system labels, there are 248 different labels (153 for the user and 95 for the system).",
        "Combining only first and second level there are 72 labels (45 for user and 27 for system), and with only first level there are 16 labels (7 for user and 9 for system).",
        "Annotation was done at utterance level.",
        "That is, each dialogue turn was divided (segmented) into utterances such that each one corresponds to a unique DA label.",
        "An example of the segmentation and annotation of two turns of a dialogue can be seen in Figure 1"

        "This run finds only 44 clusters but has a much lower value for S' than was found in the random clustering, showing a significant increase in the similarity between utterances within each cluster.",
        "Surprisingly, the value for S\" is also reduced, showing that the differentiation between the clusters formed at this stage is even lower than there was with the random clustering.",
        "E and E\" show suitable reductions indicating that the classification errors are being reduced by the inference process.",
        "The third row of values show that after 1500K epochs 54 clusters have been found, intra-cluster similarity is increased beyond that for the random clustering, but the classification errors remain essentially the same as for the 1500K run.",
        "Although the 1500K epoch run found only 54 clusters, it was able to clearly distinguish between system and user utterances: with 30 clusters containing system utterances only, 22 clusters containing user utterances only and 2 clusters containing instances of both.",
        "Given that the system utterances in the Dihana corpus are generated from a restricted set of sentences, it is not surprising that these were easy to cluster and differentiate from user utterances.",
        "However, the CRP was also able to cluster user utterances well, which is more of a challenge.",
        "Table 2 shows the clusters that have specialised on user utterances, with the counts of the level 1 annotations in each case.",
        "The largest cluster for each level 1 annotation is shown in bold typeface.",
        "From here it can be seen that cluster 15 has specialised on both Closing and Rejection.",
        "It is not surprising that these fall within the same cluster since the words used in each are often the same (e.g. \"No thank you\" can act as either a closing statement or a rejection statement).",
        "Clusters 14, 22, 29, 28 and 41 have specialised to the Answering annotation, whilst clusters 4, 12 49, 51 and 53 have specialised to Asking.",

        "Cluster 14, for example, specialises on the Answering:Day pair, whilst 22 specialises on Answering:Destination pair.",
        "These initial results show that, at least for the Dihana corpus, the DPMM can successfully cluster utterances into Speaker, Level 1, and Level2 classes.",
