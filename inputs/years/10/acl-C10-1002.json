        "Multi-word expressions (MWEs) are notoriously hard to define.",
        "They span a range of constructions, from completely frozen, semantically opaque idiomatic expressions, to frequent but morphologically productive and semantically compositional collocations.",
        "Various linguistic processes (orthographic, morphological, syntactic, semantic, and cognitive) apply to MWEs in idiosyncratic ways.",
        "Notably, MWEs blur the distinction between the lexicon and the grammar, since they often have some properties of words and some of phrases.",
        "In this work we define MWEs as expressions whose linguistic properties (morphological, syntactic or semantic) are not directly derived from the properties of their word constituents.",
        "This is a functional definition, driven by a practical motivation: any natural language processing (NLP)",
        "Shuly Wintner",
        "application that cares about morphology, syntax or semantics must consequently store MWEs in the lexicon.",
        "MWEs are numerous and constitute a significant portion of the lexicon of any natural language.",
        "They are a heterogeneous class of constructions with diverse sets of characteristics.",
        "Morphologically, some MWEs allow some of their constituents to freely inflect while restricting (or even preventing) the inflection of other constituents.",
        "MWEs may allow constituents to undergo non-standard morphological inflections that they would not undergo in isolation.",
        "Some MWEs contain words that never occur outside the context of the MWE.",
        "Syntactically, some MWEs appear in one rigid pattern (and a fixed order), while others permit various syntactic transformations.",
        "Semantically, the compositionality of MWEs (i.e., the degree to which the meaning of the whole expression results from combining the meanings of its individual words when they occur in isolation) is gradual.",
        "These morphological, syntactic and semantic idiosyncrasies make MWEs a challenge for NLP applications (Sag et al., 2002).",
        "They are even more challenging in languages with complex morphology, because of the unique interaction of morphological and orthographic processes with the lexical specification of MWEs (Oflazer et al., 2004; Alegria et al., 2004).",
        "Because the idiosyncratic features of MWEs cannot be predicted on the basis of their component words, they must be stored in the lexicon of NLP applications.",
        "Handling MWEs correctly is beneficial for a variety of applications, including information retrieval, building ontologies, text alignment, and machine translation.",
        "Automatic identification and corpus-based extraction of MWEs is thus crucial for such (and several other) applications.",
        "In this work we describe an approach that leverages the morphological and syntactic idiosyncrasy of a certain class of Hebrew MWEs, namely noun compounds, to help identify such expressions in texts.",
        "While the main contribution of this work is a system that can distinguish between MWE and non-MWE instances of a particular construction in Hebrew, thereby facilitating faster and more accurate integration of MWEs in a large-coverage lexicon of the language, we believe that it carries added value to anyone interested in MWEs.",
        "The technique that we propose here should be applicable in principle to any language in which MWEs exhibit linguistically idiosyncratic behavior.",
        "We describe the properties of Hebrew noun-noun constructions in Section 2, and specify the irregularities exhibited by compounds.",
        "Section 3 presents the experimental setup and the main results.",
        "Compared with the best (collocation-based) baseline, our approach reduces over 30% of the errors, yielding accuracy of over 80%.",
        "We discuss related work in Section 4 and conclude with suggestions for future research."

        "When a NNC is definite, the definite article is expressed on its modifier (Wintner, 2000).",
        "In the examples below, we explicitly indicate construct-state nouns by the morpheme '.CONST' in the gloss; and definite nouns are indicated by the morpheme 'the-'.",

        "Several works address the lexical fixedness or syntactic fixedness of (certain types of) MWEs in order to extract them from texts.",
        "An expression is considered lexically fixed if replacing any of its constituents by a semantically (and syntactically) similar word generally results in an invalid or literal expression.",
        "Syntactically fixed expressions prohibit (or restrict) syntactic variation.",
        "For example, Van de Cruys and Villada Moiron (2007) use lexical fixedness to extract Dutch Verb-Noun idiomatic combinations (VNICs).",
        "Bannard (2007) uses syntactic fixedness to identify English VNICs.",
        "Another work uses both the syntactic and the lexical fixedness of VNICs in order to distinguish them from non-idiomatic ones, and eventually to extract them from corpora (Fa-zly and Stevenson, 2006).",
        "While these approaches are in line with ours, they require lexical semantic resources (e.g., a database that determines semantic similarity among words) and syntactic resources (parsers) that are unavailable for Hebrew (and many other languages).",
        "Our approach only requires morphological processing, which is more readily-available for several languages.",
        "Another unique feature of our work is that it computationally addresses Hebrew (and, more generally, Semitic) MWEs for the first time.",
        "Berman and Ravid (1986) define the dictionary degree of noun compounds in Hebrew as their closeness to a single word from a grammatical point of view, as judged by the manner in which they are grasped by language speakers.",
        "A group of 120 Hebrew speakers were asked to assign a dictionary degree (from 1 to 5) to a list of 30 noun compounds.",
        "An analysis of the questionnaire results revealed that language speaker share a common dictionary, where the highest degree of agreement was achieved on the ends of the dictionary degree spectrum.",
        "Another conclusion is that both the pragmatic uses of the noun compound and the semantic relation between its constituents define the dictionary degree of the compound.",
        "Not having access to semantic and pragmatic knowledge, we are trying to approximate it using morphology.",
        "Attia (2005) proposes methods to process fixed, semi-fixed, and syntactically-flexible Arabic MWEs (adopting the classification and the terminology of Sag et al.",
        "(2002)).",
        "Fabri (2009) provides an overview of the different types of compounds (14 in total) in present-day Maltese, focusing on one type of compounds consisting of an adjective followed by a noun.",
        "He also provides morphological, syntactic, and semantic properties of this group which distinguishes them from other non-compound constructions.",
        "Automatic identification of MWEs is not addressed in either of these works."

        "We described a system that can identify Hebrew noun compounds with high accuracy, distinguishing them from non-idiomatic noun-noun constructions.",
        "The methodology we advocate is based on careful examination of the linguistic peculiarities of the construction, followed by corpus-based approximation of these properties via a general machine learning algorithm that is fed with features based on the linguistic properties.",
        "While our application is limited to a particular construction in a particular language, we are confident that it can be equally well applied to other constructions and other languages, as long as the targeted MWEs exhibit a consistent set of irregular features (especially in the morphology).",
        "This work can be extended in various directions.",
        "Addressing other constructions is relatively easy, and requires only a theoretical linguistic investigation of the construction.",
        "We are currently interested in extending the system to cope also with Adjective-Noun, Noun-Adjective and Verb-Preposition constructions in Hebrew.",
        "The accuracy of MWE acquisition systems can be further improved by combining our morphological and syntactic features with semantically informed features such as translational entropy computed from a parallel corpus (Villada Moiron and Tiedemann, 2006), or features that can capture the local linguistic context of the expression using latent semantic analysis (Katz and Gies-brecht, 2006).",
        "We are currently working on the former direction (Tsvetkov and Wintner, 2010b), utilizing a small Hebrew-English parallel corpus (Tsvetkov and Wintner, 2010a).",
        "Finally, we are interested in evaluating the methodology proposed in this paper to other languages with complex morphology, in particular to Arabic.",
        "We leave this direction to future research."
