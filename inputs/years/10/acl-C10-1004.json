        "Following the terminology proposed by (Wiebe et al., 2005), subjectivity and sentiment analysis focuses on the automatic identification of private states, such as opinions, emotions, sentiments, evaluations, beliefs, and speculations in natural language.",
        "While subjectivity classification labels text as either subjective or objective, sentiment or polarity classification adds an additional level of granularity, by further classifying subjective text as either positive, negative or neutral.",
        "To date, a large number of text processing applications have used techniques for automatic sentiment and subjectivity analysis, including automatic expressive text-to-speech synthesis (Alm et al., 1990), tracking sentiment timelines in on-line forums and news (Balog et al., 2006; Lloyd et al., 2005), and mining opinions from product reviews (Hu and Liu, 2004).",
        "In many natural language processing tasks, subjectivity and sentiment classification has been used as a first phase filtering to",
        "Janyce Wiebe",
        "generate more viable data.",
        "Research that benefited from this additional layering ranges from question answering (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003), to conversation summarization (Carenini et al., 2008), and text semantic analysis (Wiebe and Mi-halcea, 2006; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006a).",
        "Although subjectivity tends to be preserved across languages - see the manual study in (Mihalcea et al., 2007), (Banea et al., 2008) hypothesize that subjectivity is expressed differently in various languages due to lexicalization, formal versus informal markers, etc.",
        "Based on this observation, our research seeks to answer the following questions.",
        "First, can we reliably predict sentence-level subjectivity in languages other than English, by leveraging on a manually annotated English dataset?",
        "Second, can we improve the English subjectivity classification by expanding the feature space through the use of multilingual data?",
        "Similarly, can we also improve the classifiers in the other target languages?",
        "Finally, third, can we benefit from the multilingual subjectivity space and build a high-precision subjectivity classifier that could be used to generate subjectivity datasets in the target languages?",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "We introduce the datasets and the general framework in Section 2.",
        "Sections 3, 4, and 5 address in turn each of the three research questions mentioned above.",
        "Section 6 describes related literature in the area of multilingual subjectivity.",
        "Finally, we draw our conclusions in Section 7."

      "heading": "2. Multilingual Datasets",
      "text": [
        "Corpora that are manually annotated for subjectivity, polarity, or emotion, are available in only select languages, since they require a considerable amount of human effort.",
        "Due to this impediment, the focus of this paper is to create a method for extrapolating subjectivity data developed in a source language and to transfer it to other languages.",
        "Multilingual feature spaces are generated to create even better subjectivity classifiers, outperforming those trained on the individual languages alone.",
        "We use the Multi-Perspective Question Answering (MPQA) corpus, consisting of 535 English-language news articles from a variety of sources, manually annotated for subjectivity (Wiebe et al., 2005).",
        "Although the corpus is annotated at the clause and phrase levels, we use the sentence-level annotations associated with the dataset in (Wiebe and Riloff, 2005).",
        "A sentence is labeled as subjective if it has at least one private state of strength medium or higher.",
        "Otherwise the sentence is labeled as objective.",
        "From the approximately 9700 sentences in this corpus, 55% of them are labeled as subjective, while the rest are objective.",
        "Therefore, 55% represents the majority baseline on this corpus.",
        "(Wiebe and Riloff, 2005) apply both a subjective and an objective rule-based classifier to the MPQA corpus data and obtain the results presented in Table 1.",
        "In order to generate parallel corpora to MPQA in other languages, we rely on the method we proposed in (Banea et al., 2008).",
        "We experiment with five languages other than English (En), namely Arabic (Ar), French (Fr), German (De), Romanian (Ro) and Spanish (Es).",
        "Our choice of languages is motivated by several reasons.",
        "First, we wanted languages that are highly lexicalized and have clear word delimitations.",
        "Second, we were interested to cover languages that are similar to English as well as languages with a completely different etymology.",
        "Consideration was given to include Asian languages, such as Chinese or Japanese, but the fact that their script without word-segmentation preprocessing does not directly map to words was a deterrent.",
        "Finally, another limitation on our choice of languages is the need for a publicly available machine translation system between the source language and each of the target languages.",
        "We construct a subjectivity annotated corpus for each of the five languages by using machine translation to transfer the source language data into the target language.",
        "We then project the original sentence level English subjectivity labeling onto the target data.",
        "For all languages, other than Romanian, we use the Google Translate service,a publicly available machine translation engine based on statistical models.",
        "The reason Romanian is not included in this group is that, at the time when we performed the first experiments, Google Translate did not provide a translation service for this language.",
        "Instead, we used an alternative statistical translation system called Lan-guageWeaver, which was commercially available, and which the company kindly allowed us to use for research purposes.",
        "The raw corpora in the five target languages are available for download at http://lit.csci.unt.edu/index.php/Downloads, while the English MPQA corpus can be obtained from http://www.cs.pitt.edu/mpqa.",
        "Given the specifics of each language, we employ several preprocessing techniques.",
        "For Romanian, French, English, German and Spanish, we remove all the diacritics, numbers and punctuation marks except - and The exceptions are motivated by the fact that they may mark contractions, such as En: it's or Ro: s-ar (may be), and the component words may not be resolved to the correct forms.",
        "For Arabic, although it has a different encoding, we wanted to make sure to treat it in a way similar to the languages with a Roman alphabet.",
        "We therefore use a library that maps Arabic script to a space of Roman-alphabet letters supplemented with punctuation marks so that they can allow for additional dimensionality.",

        "Multiple datasets that cover all possible combinations of six languages taken one through six (a total of 63 combinations) are generated.",
        "These datasets feature a vector for each sentence present in MPQA (approximately 9700).",
        "The vector contains only unigram features in one language for a monolingual dataset.",
        "For a multilingual dataset, the vector represents a cumulation of monolingual unigram features extracted from each view of the sentence.",

        "We perform tenfold cross validation and train Naive Bayes classifiers with feature selection on each dataset combination.",
        "The top 20% of the features present in the training data are retained.",
        "For datasets resulting from combinations of all languages taken one, the classifiers are monolingual classifiers.",
        "All other classifiers are multilingual, and their feature space increases with each additional language added.",
        "Expanding the feature set by encompassing a group of languages enables us to provide an answer to two problems that can appear due to data sparseness.",
        "First, enough training data may not be available in the monolingual corpus alone in order to correctly infer labeling based on statistical measures.",
        "Second, features appearing in the monolingual test set may not be present in the training set and therefore their information cannot be used to generate a correct classification.",
        "Both of these problems are further explained through the examples below, where we make the simplifying assumption that the words in italics are the only potential carriers of subjective content, and that, without them, their surrounding contexts would be objective.",
        "Therefore, their association with an either objective or subjective meaning imparts to the entire segment the same labeling upon classification.",
        "To explore the first sparseness problem, let us consider the following two examples extracted from the English version of the MPQA dataset, followed by their machine translations in German:",
        "\"En 1: rights group Amnesty International said it was concerned about the high risk of violence in the aftermath\" \"En 2: official said that US diplomats to countries concerned are authorized to explain to these countries\" \"De 1: Amnesty International sagte, es sei besorgt über das hohe Risiko von Gewalt in der Folgezeit\" \"De 2: Beamte sagte, dass US-Diplomaten betroffenen Lander berechtigt sind, diese Lander zu erklaren\"",
        "We focus our discussion on the word concerned, which in the first example is used in its subjective sense, while in the second it carries an objective meaning (as it refers to a group of countries exhibiting a particular feature defined earlier on in the context).",
        "The words in italics in the German contexts represent the translations of concerned into German, which are functionally different as they are shaped by their surrounding context.",
        "By training a classifier on the English examples alone, under the data sparseness paradigm, the machine learning model may not differentiate between the word's objective and subjective uses when predicting a label for the entire sentence.",
        "However, appending the German translation to the examples generates additional dimensions for this model and allows the classifier to potentially distinguish between the senses and provide the correct sentence label.",
        "For the second problem, let us consider two other examples from the English MPQA and their respective translations into Romanian:",
        "\"En 3: could secure concessions on Taiwan in return for supporting Bush on issues such as antiterrorism and\" \"En 4: to the potential for change from within America.",
        "Supporting our schools and community centres is a \"Ro 3: ar putea asigura concesii cu privire la Taiwan, în schimb pentru sustinerea lui Bush pe probleme cum ar fi anti-terorismului §i\" \"Ro 4: la potentialul de schimbare din interiorul Americii.",
        "Sprijinirea §colile noastre §i centre de comunitate este un",
        "In this case, supporting is used in both English examples in senses that are both subjective; the word is, however, translated into Romanian through two synonyms, namely sustinerea and sprijinirea.",
        "Let us assume that sufficient training examples are available to strengthen a link between supporting and sustinerea, and the classifier is presented with a context containing sprijinirea, unseen in the training data.",
        "A multilingual classifier may be able to predict a label for the context using the cooccurrence metrics based on supporting and extrapolate a label when the context contains both the English word and its translation into Romanian as sprijinirea.",
        "For a monolingual classifier, such an inference is not possible, and the feature is discarded.",
        "Therefore a multilingual classifier model may gain additional strength from co-occurring words across languages."

        "It is interesting to note that the highest precision meta-classifier for groups of two languages includes German, while for groups with more than three languages, both Arabic and German are always present in the top performing combinations.",
        "English only appears in the highest precision combination for one, five and six languages, indicating the fact that the predictions based on Arabic and German are more robust.",

        "English corpora manually annotated for subjectivity or sentiment such as MPQA (Wiebe et al., 2005), or the multi-domain sentiment classification corpus (Blitzer et al., 2007) were subjected to experiments in Spanish, Romanian, or Chinese upon automatic translation by (Banea et al., 2008; Wan, 2009).",
        "Furthermore, tools developed for English were used to determine sentiment or subjectivity labeling for a given target language by transferring the text to English and applying an English classifier on the resulting data.",

        "While this work proves that leveraging cross-lingual information improves sentiment analysis in Chinese over what could be achieved using monolingual resources alone, there are several major differences with respect to the approach we are proposing here.",
        "First, our training set is based solely on the automatic translation of the English corpus.",
        "We do not require an in-domain dataset available in the target language that would be needed for the co-training approach.",
        "Our method is therefore transferable to any language that has an English-to target language translation engine.",
        "Further, we focus on using multilingual data from six languages to show that the results are reliable and replicable across each language and that multiple languages aid not only in conducting subjectivity research in the target language, but also in improving the accuracy in the source language as well.",
        "Finally, while (Wan, 2009) research focuses on polarity detection based on reviews, our work seeks to determine sentence-level subjectivity from raw text."

      "heading": "7. Conclusion",
      "text": [
        "Our results suggest that including multilingual information when modeling subjectivity can not only extrapolate current resources available for English into other languages, but can also improve subjectivity classification in the source language itself.",
        "We showed that we can improve an English classifier by using out-of-language features, thus achieving a 4.90% error reduction in accuracy with respect to using English alone.",
        "Moreover, we also showed that languages other than English can achieve an F-measure in subjectivity annotation of over 75%, without using any manually crafted resources for these languages.",
        "Furthermore, by combining the predictions made by monolingual classifiers using a majority vote learner, we are able to generate sentence-level subjectivity annotated data with a precision of 83% and a recall level above 50%.",
        "Such high-precision classifiers may be later used not only to create subjectivity-annotated data in the target language, but also to generate the seeds needed to sustain a language-specific bootstrapping.",
        "To conclude and provide an answer to the question formulated in the title, more languages are better, as they are able to complement each other, and together they provide better classification results.",
        "When one language cannot provide sufficient information, another one can come to the rescue."
