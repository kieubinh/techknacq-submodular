      "text": [
        "Translation quality is often described in terms of fluency and adequacy.",
        "Fluency reflects the 'na-tiveness' of the translation while adequacy indicates how well a translation captures the meaning of the original text (Ma and Cieri, 2006).",
        "From a purely utilitarian view, adequacy should be more important than fluency.",
        "But fluency and adequacy are subjective and not easy to tease apart (Callison-Burch et al., 2009; Vilar et al., 2007).",
        "There is a human tendency to rate less fluent translations as less adequate.",
        "One explanation is that errors in grammar cause readers to be more critical.",
        "A related phenomenon is that the nature of translation errors changes as fluency improves so that any errors in fluent translations must be relatively subtle.",
        "It is therefore not enough to focus solely on adequacy.",
        "SMT systems must also be fluent if they are to be accepted and trusted.",
        "It is possible that the reliance on automatic metrics may have led SMT researchers to pay insufficient attention to fluency: BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), TER (Snover et al., 2006), and METEOR (Lavie and Denkowski, 2009) show broad correlation with human rankings of MT quality, but are incapable of fine distinctions between fluency and adequacy.",
        "There is concern that the fluency of current SMT is inadequate (Knight, 2007b).",
        "SMT is robust, in that a translation is nearly always produced.",
        "But unlike translators who should be skilled in at least one of the languages, SMT systems are limited in both source and target language competence.",
        "Fluency and accuracy therefore tend to suffer together as translation quality degrades.",
        "This should not be the case.",
        "Ideally, an SMT system should never be any less fluent than the best stochastic text generation system available in the target language (Oberlander and Brew, 2000).",
        "What is needed is a good way to enhance the fluency of SMT hypotheses.",
        "The maximum likelihood (ML) formulation (Brown et al., 1990) of translation of source language sentence F to target language sentence E makes it clear why improving SMT fluency is a difficult modelling problem.",
        "The language model P (E), the closest thing to a 'fluency component' in the original formulation, only affects candidates likely under the translation model P (F |E).",
        "Given the weakness of current translation models this is a severe limitation.",
        "It often happens that SMT systems assign P (F |E) = 0 to a correct reference translation E of F (see the discussion in Section 9).",
        "The problem is that in ML decoding the language model can only encourage the production of fluent translations; it cannot easily enforce constraints on fluency or introduce new hypotheses.",
        "In Hiero (Chiang, 2007) and syntax-based SMT (Knight and Graehl, 2005; Knight, 2007a), the primary role of syntax is to drive the translation process.",
        "Translations produced by these systems respect the syntax of their translation models, but this does not force them to be grammatical in the way that a typical human sentence is grammatical; they produce many translations which are not fluent.",
        "The problem is robustness.",
        "Generating fluent translations demands a tightly constraining target language grammar but such a grammar is at odds with broad-coverage parsing needed for robust translation.",
        "We have described two problems in translation fluency: (1) SMT may fail to generate fluent hypotheses and there is no simple way to introduce them into the search; (2) SMT produces many translations which are not fluent but enforcing constraints to improve fluency can hurt robustness.",
        "Both problems are rooted in the ML decoding framework in which robustness and fluency are conflicting objectives.",
        "We propose a novel framework to improve the fluency of any SMT system, whether syntactic or phrase-based.",
        "We will perform Minimum Bayes-risk search (Kumar and Byrne, 2004) over a space of fluent hypotheses H:",
        "In this approach the MBR evidence space E is generated by an SMT system as a k-best list or lattice.",
        "The system runs in its best possible configuration, ensuring both translation robustness and good baselines.",
        "Rather than decoding in the output of the baseline SMT system, translations will be sought among a collection of fluent sentences that are close to the top SMT hypotheses as determined by the loss function L(E, E').",
        "Decoupling the MBR hypothesis space from first-pass translation offers great flexibility.",
        "Hypotheses in H may be arbitrarily constrained according to lexical, syntactic, semantic, or other considerations, with no effect on translation robustness.",
        "This is because constraints on fluency do not affect the production of the evidence space by the baseline system.",
        "Robustness and fluency are no longer conflicting objectives.",
        "This framework also allows the MBR hypothesis space to be augmented with hypotheses produced by an NLG system, although this is beyond the scope of the present paper.",
        "This paper focuses on searching out fluent strings amongst the vast number ofhypotheses encoded in SMT lattices.",
        "Oracle BLEU scores computed over k-best lists (Och et al., 2004) show that many high quality hypotheses are produced by first-pass SMT decoding.",
        "We propose reducing the difficulty of enhancing the fluency of complete hypotheses by first identifying regions of high-confidence in the ML translations and using these to guide the fluency refinement process.",
        "This has two advantages: (1) we keep portions of the baseline hypotheses that we trust and search for alternatives elsewhere, and (2) the task is made much easier since the fluency of sentence fragments can be refined in context.",
        "In what follows, we use posterior probabilities over SMT lattices to identify useful subsequences in the ML translations (Sections 2 & 3).",
        "These subsequences drive the segmentation and transformation of lattices into smaller subproblems (Sections 4 & 5).",
        "Subproblems are mined for fluent strings (Section 6), resulting in improved translation fluency (Sections 7 & 8).",
        "Our results show that, when guided by the careful selection of subproblems, fluency can be improved with no real degradation of the BLEU score."

        "We have described a general framework for improving SMT luency.",
        "Decoupling the hypothesis space from the evidence space allows for much greater lexibility in lattice MBR search.",
        "We have shown that high path posterior probability n-grams in the ML translation can be used to guide the segmentation of a lattice into regions of high and low confidence.",
        "Segmenting the lattice simplifies the process of refining the hypothesis space since low confidence regions can be refined in the context of their high confidence neighbours.",
        "This can be done independently before reassembling the refined regions.",
        "Lattice segmentation facilitates the application of post-processing and rescoring techniques targeted to address particular deficiencies in ML decoding.",
        "The techniques we presented are related to consensus decoding and system combination forSMT (Matusov et al., 2006; Sim et al., 2007), and to segmental MBR for automatic speech recognition (Goel et al., 2004).",
        "Mohit et al.",
        "(2009) describe an alternative approach to improving specific portions of translation hypotheses.",
        "They use an SVM classifier to identify a single phrase in each source language sentence that is \"difficult to translate\"; such phrases are then translated using an adapted language model estimated from parallel data.",
        "In contrast to their approach, our approach is able to exploit large collections of monolingual data to refine multiple low confidence regions using posterior probabilities obtained from a high-quality evidence space of first-pass translations.",
        "We applied hypothesis space constraints based on monolingual coverage to low confidence regions resulting in improved luency with no real degradation in BLEU score relative to unconstrained LMBR decoding.",
        "This approach is limited by the coverage of sublattices using monolingual text.",
        "We expect this to improve with larger text collections or in tightly focused scenarios where in-domain text is less diverse.",
        "However, fluency will be best improved by integrating more sophisticated natural language generation.",
        "NLG systems capable of generating sentence fragments in context can be incorporated directly into this framework.",
        "If the MBR hypothesis space H contains a generated hypothesis E for which P (F \\E) = 0, E could still be produced as a translation, since it can be 'voted for' by nearby hypotheses produced by the underlying system.",
        "Table 3 shows the proportion of NIST testset sentences that can be aligned to any of the reference translations using our high quality baseline hierarchical decoder with a powerful grammar.",
        "The low level of reachability suggests that NLG may be required to achieve high levels of translation quality and fluency.",
        "Other rescoring approaches (Kumar et al., 2009; Li et al., 2009) may also benefit from NLG when the baseline is incapable of generating the reference.",
        "We note that our approach could also be used to improve the luency of ASR, OCR and other language processing tasks where the goal is to produce luent natural language output."
