        "In the last years, information extraction has become more important in domains like context-aware systems (e.g. Nexus (Dürr et al., 2004)) that need a rich knowledge base to make the right decisions in different user contexts.",
        "Geospatial data are one of the key features in such systems and need to be represented on different levels of detail.",
        "Data providers do not cover all these levels completely.",
        "To overcome this problem, finegrained information extraction (IE) methods can be used to acquire the missing knowledge.",
        "We define fine-grained IE as methods that recognize entities at a finer grain than standard categories like person, location, and organization.",
        "Furthermore, the quality of the data in context-aware systems plays an important role and updates by an information extraction component can increase the overall user acceptance.",
        "For both issues an information extraction system is required that can handle fine-grained relations, e.g., \"X is a suburb of Y\" or \"the river X is a tributary of Y\" - as opposed to simple containment.",
        "The World Wide Web offers a wealth of information about geospatial data and can be used as source for the extraction task.",
        "The extraction component can be seen as a kind of sensor that we call text senor (Blessing et al., 2006).",
        "In this paper, we address the problem of developing a flexible system for the acquisition of relations between entities that meets the above desiderata.",
        "We concentrate on geospatial entities on a fine-grained level although the approach is in principle applicable to any domain.",
        "We use a supervised machine learning approach, including several features on different linguistic levels, to build our system.",
        "Such a system highly depends on the quality and amount of labeled data in the training phase.",
        "The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of self-annotation, a novel approach that allows us to eliminate manual labeling (although training set creation also involves costs other than labeling).",
        "Self-annotation is based on the fact that Word Wide Web sites like Wikipedia include, in addition to unstructured text, structured data.",
        "We use structured data sources to automatically annotate unstructured texts.",
        "In this paper, we use German Wikipedia data because it is a good source for the information required for our context-aware system and show that a system created without manual labeling has good performance.",
        "Our trained model only uses text, not the structured data (or any other markup) of the input documents.",
        "This means that we can train an information extractor on Wikipedia and then apply it to any text, regardless of whether this text also contains structured information.",
        "In the first part of this paper, we discuss the challenges of self-annotation including some heuristics which can easily be adapted to different relation types.",
        "We then describe the architecture of the extraction system.",
        "The components we develop are based on the UIMA (Unstructured Information Management Architecture) framework (Hahn et al., 2008) and include two linguistic engines (OpenNLP, FSPar).",
        "The extraction task is performed by a supervised classifier; this classifier is also implemented as a UIMA component and uses the ClearTK framework.",
        "We evaluate our approach on two types of fine-grained relations."

        "To simplify the self-annotation process we restrict the first argument of the relation to the main entity of the Wikipedia article.",
        "As we are building text sensors for a context aware system, relations between geospatial entities are of interest.",

        "Then we automatically find the corresponding sentences in the text and annotate the relations (see section 4).",
        "All other not yet marked binary relations between the main entity and geospatial entities are annotated as negative samples.",
        "The result of this step is a self-annotated training set.",
        "In the second step of our task, the self-annotated training set is used to train the extraction model.",
        "The model only takes textual features as input and can be applied to any free text.",
        "Our relation extraction task is modeled as a classification task which considers a pair of named entities and decides whether they occur in the requested relation or not.",
        "The classifier uses extracted features for this decision.",
        "Features belong to three different classes.",
        "The first class contains token-based features and their linguistic labels like part-of-speech, lemma, stem.",
        "In the second class, we have chunks that aggregate one or more tokens into complex units.",
        "Dependency relations between the tokens are represented in the third class.",
        "Our classifier is applicable to a wide spectrum of geospatial relation types.",

        "We use all articles that belong to the following categories: Rivers by country, Mountains by country, Valleys by country, Islands by country, Mountain passes by country, Forests by country and Settlements by country.",
        "For the annotation task we use the structural content of Wikipedia articles.",
        "Most articles belonging to the same categories use similar templates to represent structured information.",
        "One type of template is the infobox, which contains pairs of attributes and their values.",

        "Wu and Weld (2007) observed schema drift in their work: Wikipedia authors do not not use infobox attributes in a consistent manner.",
        "However, we did not find schema drift to be a large problem in our experiments.",
        "The variation we found can easily be handled with a small number of rules.",
        "This can be due to the fact that the quality of Wikipedia articles improved a lot in the last years through the introduction of automatic maintenance tools like bots.",
        "Nevertheless, the development of self-annotation for a new relation type requires some manual work.",
        "The developer has to check the quality of the extraction relations in the infoboxes.",
        "This can lead to some additional adaptation work for the used attributes such as merging or creating rules.",
        "However, a perfect coverage is not required because the extraction system is only used for training purposes; we only need to find a sufficiently large number of positive training instances and do not require exhaustive labeling of all articles.",
        "It is important to note that considering partially found relations as negative samples has to be avoided.",
        "Wrong negative samples have a generally unwanted impact on the performance of the learned extraction model.",
        "A developer has to be aware of this fact.",
        "In one experiment, the learned classifiers were applied to the training data and returned a number of false positive results - 40 in case of the river-bodyOfWater relation.",
        "31 of these errors were not actual errors because the self-annotation missed some true instances.",
        "Nevertheless, the trained model recognizes these samples as correct; this could perhaps be used to further improve the quality of self-annotation.",
        "Manually labeled data also includes noise and the benefit of self-annotation is substantial when the aim is to build a fine-grained relation extraction system in a fast and cheap way.",
        "The difference of the results between OpenNLP and FSPar engines are smaller than expected.",
        "Although sentence splitting is poorly done by OpenNLP the effect on the extraction result is rather low.",
        "Another crucial point is that the lexicon-based named entity recognizer of the FS-Par engine that was optimized for named entities used in Wikipedia has no significant impact on the overall performance.",
        "Thus, a basic set of NLP components with moderate error rates may be sufficient for effective self-annotation."

        "Only some manual work has to be done to find the right attributes in the infoboxes.",
