        "In general, the accompanying words form a context vector of the target word, or a probability distribution of the context words.",
        "For example, under the unigram bag-of-words assumption, this means building p(x\\t) = count(x t)^ wnere count(x, t) is the count of co-occurrences of word x with the target word t under a certain criterion.",
        "In most studies, x and t should co-occur within a window of up to k words or sentences.",
        "The bounds are usually selected in an ad-hoc fashion to maximize system performance.",
        "Occurrences inside the window often weight the same without regard to their position.",
        "This is counterintuitive.",
        "Indeed, a word closer to the target word generally has a greater semantic constraint on the target word than a more distant word.",
        "It is however difficult to define the optimal weighting function manually.",
        "To get around this, some systems add positional features for very close words.",
        "In information retrieval, to model the strength of word relations, some studies have proposed non-uniform weighting methods of context words, which decrease the importance of more distant words in the context vector.",
        "However, the weighting functions are defined manually.",
        "It is unclear that these functions can best capture the impact of the context words on the target word.",
        "In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method to automatically learn the optimal weight of a word according to its distance to the target word.",
        "The general principle used to determine such weight is that, if we randomly determine two sets of windows containing the target word from the same corpus, the meaning - or mixture of meanings for polysemic words - of the target word in the two sets should be similar.",
        "As the context model - a probability distribution for the context words - determines the meaning of the target word, the context models generated from the two sets should also be similar.",
        "The weights of context words at different distance are therefore determined so as to maximize the similarity of context models generated from the two sets of samples.",
        "In this paper, we propose a gradient descent method to find the optimal weights.",

        "Modeling the distribution of words around one target word, which we call context model, has many uses.",
        "For instance, one can use it to define a co-occurrence-based stemmer (Xu and Croft, 1998), which uses window co-occurrence statistics to calculate the best equivalence classes for a group of word forms.",
        "In the study of Xu and Croft, they suggest using windows of up to 100 words.",
        "Context models are also widely used in WSD.",
        "For example, top performing systems on English WSD tasks in Semeval-2007, such as NUS-ML (Cai et al., 2007), all made use of bag-of-words features around the target word.",
        "In this case, they found that the best results can be achieved using a window size of 3.",
        "Both systems limit the size of their windows for different purposes.",
        "The former uses a large size in order to model the topic of the documents containing the word rather than the word's meaning.",
        "The latter would limit the size because bag-of-words features further from the target word would not be sufficiently related to its meaning (Ide and Véro-nis, 1998).",
        "We see that there is a compromise between taking fewer, highly related words, or taking more, lower quality words.",
        "However, there is no principled way to determine the optimal size of windows.",
        "The size is determined by trial and error.",
        "A more questionable aspect in the above systems is that for bag-of-words features, all words in a window are given equal weights.",
        "This is counterintuitive.",
        "One can easily understand that a context word closer to the target word generally imposes a stronger constraint on the meaning of the latter, than a more distant context word.",
        "It is then reasonable to define a weighting function that decreases along with distance.",
        "Several studies in information retrieval (IR) have proposed such functions to model the strength of dependency between words.",
        "For instance, Gao et al.",
        "(2002) proposed an exponential decay function to capture the strength of dependency between words.",
        "This function turns out to work better than the uniform weighting in the IR experiments.",
        "Song and Bruza (2003) used a fixed-size sliding window to determine word co-occurrences.",
        "This is equivalent to define a linear decay function for context words.",
        "The context vectors defined this way are used to estimate similarity between words.",
        "A use of the resulting similarity in query expansion in IR turned out to be successful (Bai et al., 2005).",
        "In a more recent study, Lv and Zhai (2009) evaluated several kernel functions to determine the weights of context words according to distance, including Gaussian kernel, cosine kernel, and so on.",
        "As for the exponential and linear decaying functions, all these kernel functions have fixed shapes, which are determined manually.",
        "Notice that the above functions have only been tested in IR experiments.",
        "It is not clear how these functions perform in WSD.",
        "More importantly, all the previous studies have investigated only a limited number of weighting functions for context words.",
        "Although some improvements using these functions have been observed in IR, it is not clear whether the functions can best capture the true impact of the context words on the meaning of the target word.",
        "Although the proposed functions comply with the general principle that closer words are more important than more distant words, no principled way has been proposed to determine the particular shape of the function for different languages and collections.",
        "In this paper, we argue that there is indeed a hidden weighting function that best capture the impact of context words, but the function cannot be defined manually.",
        "Rather, the best function should be the one that emerges naturally from the data.",
        "Therefore, we propose an unsupervised method to discover such a function based on the following principle: the context models for a target word generated from two random samples should be similar.",

        "This may be due to differences in the segmentation parameters of our external corpus: we used the human-checked segmentation found in the Semeval data for classification, but used a parser to segment our external corpus for weight learning.",
        "We are positive that the Chasen parser with the UniDic dictionary was used to create the initial segmentation in the Semeval data, but there may be differences in versions and the initial segmentation results were further modified manually.",
        "Another reason for the results could be that the systems use almost the same weights: Uniform NB and SVM both used windows of size 1, and the Japanese curve is steeper than the English one, making the context model account to almost only immediately adjacent words.",
        "So, even if our context model contains more context words at larger distances, their weights are very low.",
        "This makes all context model quite similar.",
        "Nevertheless, we still observe some gain in WSD accuracy.",
        "These results show that the curves work as expected even in different languages.",
        "However, the weighting curve is strongly language-dependent.",
        "It could also be collection-dependent - we will investigate this aspect in the future, using different collections.",

        "The definition of context vector and context model is critical in WSD.",
        "In previous studies in IR, decaying weight along with distance within a text window have been proposed.",
        "However, the decaying functions are defined manually.",
        "Although some of the functions produced better results than the uniform weighting, there is no evidence showing that these functions best capture the impact of the context words on the meaning of the target word.",
        "This paper proposed an unsupervised method for finding optimal weights for context words according to their distance to the target word.",
        "The general idea was to find the weights that best fit the data, in such a way that the context models for the same target word generated from two random windows samples become similar.",
        "It is the first time that this general principle is used for this purpose.",
        "Our experiments on WSD in English and Japanese suggest the validity of the principle.",
        "In this paper, we limited context models to bag-of-words features, excluding additional features such as POS-tags.",
        "Despite this simple type of feature and the use of a simple Naïve Bayes classifier, the WSD accuracy we obtained can rival the other state-of-the-art systems with more sophisticated features and classification algorithms.",
        "This result indicates that a crucial aspect in WSD is the definition of an appropriate context model, and our weighting method can generate more reasonable weights of context words than using a predefined decaying function.",
        "Our experiments also showed that the optimal weighting function is language-dependent.",
        "We obtained two different functions for English and Japanese, although their general shapes are similar.",
        "In fact, the optimal weighting function reflects the linguistic properties: as dependent words in Japanese can be further away from the target word due to its linguistic structure, the optimal weighting quickly decays, meaning that we can rely less on distant context words.",
        "This also shows a limitation of this study: distance is not the sole criterion to determine the impact of a context word.",
        "Other factors, such as POS-tag and syntactic dependency, can play an important role in the context model.",
        "These additional factors are complementary to the distance criterion and our approach can be extended to include such additional features.",
        "This extension is part of our future work.",
        "Another limitation of straight window distance is that all words introduce the same distance, regardless of their nature.",
        "In our experiments, to make the distance a more sensible metric, we merged consecutive stop words in one placeholder token.",
        "The idea behind this it that some words, such as stop words, should introduce less distance than others.",
        "On the opposite, we can easily understand that tokens such as commas, full stops, parentheses and paragraph should introduce a bigger distance than regular words.",
        "We could therefore use a congruence score for a word, an indicator showing on average how much what comes before is similar to what comes after the word.",
        "Also, we have combined our weighting schema with NB classifier.",
        "Other classifiers such as SVM could lead to better results.",
        "The utilization of our new weighting schema with SVM is another future work.",
        "Finally, the weights computed with our method has been used in WSD tasks.",
        "The weights could be seen as the expected strength of relation between two words in a document according to their distance.",
        "The consideration of word relationships in documents and queries is one of the endeavors in current research in IR.",
        "The new weighting schema could be easily integrated with a dependency model in IR.",
        "We plan to perform such integration in the future."
