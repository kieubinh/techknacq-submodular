        "Coreference resolution is the task of grouping mentions of entities into sets so that all mentions in one set refer to the same entity.",
        "Most recent approaches to coreference resolution divide this task into two steps: (1) a classification step which determines whether a pair of mentions is corefer-ent or which outputs a confidence value, and (2) a clustering step which groups mentions into entities based on the output of step 1.",
        "The classification steps of most approaches vary in the choice of the classifier (e.g. decision tree classifiers (Soon et al., 2001), maximum entropy classification (Luo et al., 2004), SVM classifiers (Rahman & Ng, 2009)) and the number of features used (Soon et al. (2001) employ a set of twelve simple but effective features while e.g., Ng & Cardie (2002) and Bengtson & Roth (2008) devise much richer feature sets).",
        "The clustering step exhibits much more variation: Local variants utilize a closest-first decision (Soon et al., 2001), where a mention is resolved to its closest possible antecedent, or a best-first decision (Ng & Cardie, 2002), where a mention is resolved to its most confident antecedent (based on the confidence value returned by step 1).",
        "Global variants attempt to consider all possible clustering possibilites by creating and searching a Bell tree (Luo et al., 2004), by learning the optimal search strategy itself (Daumé III & Marcu, 2005), by building a graph representation and applying graph clustering techniques (Nicolae & Nicolae, 2006), or by employing integer linear programming (Klenner, 2007; Denis & Baldridge, 2009).",
        "Since these methods base their global clustering step on a local pairwise model, some global information which could have guided step 2 is already lost.",
        "The twin-candidate model (Yang et al., 2008) replaces the pairwise model by learning preferences between two antecedent candidates in step 1 and applies tournament schemes instead of the clustering in step 2.",
        "There is little work which deviates from this two-step scheme.",
        "Culotta et al. (2007) introduce a first-order probabilistic model which implements features over sets of mentions and thus operates directly on entities.",
        "In this paper we describe a novel approach to coreference resolution which avoids the division into two steps and instead performs a global decision in one step.",
        "We represent a document as a hypergraph, where the vertices denote mentions and the edges denote relational features between mentions.",
        "Coreference resolution is performed globally in one step by partitioning the hypergraph into subhypergraphs so that all mentions in one subhy-pergraph refer to the same entity.",
        "Our model outperforms two strong baselines, Soon et al. (2001) and Bengtson & Roth (2008).",
        "Soon et al. (2001) developed an end-to-end coreference resolution system for the MUC data, i.e., a system which processes raw documents as input and produces annotated ones as output.",
        "However, with the advent of the ACE data, many systems either evaluated only true mentions, i.e. mentions which are included in the annotation, the so-called key, or even received true information for mention boundaries, heads of mentions and mention type (Culotta et al., 2007, inter alia).",
        "While these papers report impressive results it has been concluded that this experimental setup simplifies the task and leads to an unrealistic surrogate for the coreference resolution problem (Stoythe field should move towards a realistic setting using system mentions, i.e. automatically determined mention boundaries and types.",
        "In this paper we report results using our end-to-end coref-erence resolution system, COPA, without relying on unrealistic assumptions."

        "However, since they not only change the clustering strategy but also the features for step 1, it is not clear whether the improvements are due to the graph-based clustering technique.",

        "Most previous attempts to solve the coreference resolution task globally have been hampered by employing a local pairwise model in the classification step (step 1) while only the clustering step realizes a global approach, e.g. Luo et al. (2004), Nicolae & Nicolae (2006), Klenner (2007), Denis & Baldridge (2009), lesser so Culotta et al. (2007).",
        "It has been also observed that improvements in performance on true mentions do not necessarily translate into performance improvements on system mentions (Ng, 2008).",
        "In this paper we describe a coreference resolution system, COPA, which implements a global decision in one step via hypergraph partitioning.",
        "COPA looks at the whole graph at once which enables it to outperform two strong baselines (Soon et al., 2001; Bengtson & Roth, 2008).",
        "COPA's hypergraph-based strategy can be taken as a general preference model, where the preference for one mention depends on information on all other mentions.",
        "We follow Stoyanov et al. (2009) and argue that evaluating the performance of coreference resolution systems on true mentions is unrealistic.",
        "Hence we integrate an ACE mention tagger into our system, tune the system towards the real task, and evaluate only using system mentions.",
        "While Ng (2008) could not show that superior models achieved superior results on system mentions, COPA was able to outperform Bengtson & Roth (2008)'s system which has been claimed to achieve the best performance on the ACE 2004 data (using true mentions, Bengtson & Roth (2008) did not report any comparison with other systems using system mentions).",
        "An error analysis revealed that there were some cluster-level inconsistencies in the COPA output.",
        "Enforcing this consistency would require a global strategy to propagate constraints, so that constraints can be included in the hypergraph partitioning properly.",
        "We are currently exploring constrained clustering, a field which has been very active recently (Basu et al., 2009).",
        "Using constrained clustering methods may allow us to integrate negative information as constraints instead of combining several weak positive features to one which is still weak (e.g. our Agreement feature).",
        "For an application of constrained clustering to the related task of database record linkage, see Bhattacharya & Getoor (2009).",
        "Graph models cannot deal well with positional information, such as distance between mentions or the sequential ordering of mentions in a document.",
        "We implemented distance as weights on hyperedges which resulted in decent performance.",
        "However, this is limited to pairwise relations and thus does not exploit the power of the high degree relations available in COPA.",
        "We expect further improvements, once we manage to include positional information directly.",
