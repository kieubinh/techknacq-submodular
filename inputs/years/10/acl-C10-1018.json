        "Relation extraction (RE) is the task of detecting and characterizing semantic relations expressed between entities in text.",
        "For instance, given the sentence \"Cone, a Kansas City native, was originally signed by the Royals and broke into the majors with the team.",
        "\", one of the relations we might want to extract is the employment relation between the pair of entity mentions \"Cone\" and \"Royals\".",
        "RE is important for many NLP applications such as building an ontology of entities, biomedical information extraction, and question answering.",
        "Prior work have employed diverse approaches towards resolving the task.",
        "One approach is to build supervised RE systems using sentences annotated with entity mentions and predefined target relations.",
        "When given a new sentence, the RE system has to detect and disambiguate the presence of any predefined relations that might exist between each of the mention pairs in the sentence.",
        "In building these systems, researchers used a wide variety of features (Kambhatla, 2004; Zhou et al., 2005; Jiang and Zhai, 2007).",
        "Some of the common features used to analyze the target sentence include the words appearing in the sentence, their part-of-speech (POS) tags, the syntactic parse of the sentence, and the dependency path between the pair of mentions.",
        "In a related line of work, researchers have also proposed various kernel functions based on different structured representations (e.g. dependency or syntactic tree parses) of the target sentences (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005; Zhou et al., 2007; Zelenko et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2006).",
        "Additionally, researchers have tried to automatically extract examples for supervised learning from resources such as Wikipedia (Weld et al., 2008) and databases (Mintz et al., 2009), or attempted open information extraction (IE) (Banko et al., 2007) to extract all possible relations.",
        "In this work, we focus on supervised RE.",
        "In prior work, the feature and kernel functions employed are usually restricted to being defined on the various representations (e.g. lexical or structural) of the target sentences.",
        "However, in recognizing relations, humans are not thus constrained and rely on an abundance of implicit world knowledge or background information.",
        "What quantifies as world or background knowledge is rarely explored in the RE literature and we do not attempt to provide complete nor precise definitions in this paper.",
        "However, we show that by considering the relationship between our relations of interest, as well as how they relate to some existing knowledge resources, we improve the performance of RE.",
        "Specifically, the contributions of this paper are the following:",
        "• When our relations of interest are clustered or organized in a hierarchical ontology, we show how to use this information to improve performance.",
        "By defining appropriate constraints between the predictions of relations at different levels of the hierarchy, we obtain globally coherent predictions as well as improved performance.",
        "• Coreference is a generic relationship that might exists among entity mentions and we show how to exploit this information by assuming that co-referring mentions have no other interesting relations.",
        "We capture this intuition by using coreference information to constraint the predictions of a RE system.",
        "• When characterizing the relationship between a pair of mentions, one can use a large encyclopedia such as Wikipedia to infer more knowledge about the two mentions.",
        "In this work, after probabilistically mapping mentions to their respective Wikipedia pages, we check whether the mentions are related.",
        "Another generic relationship that might exists between a pair of mentions is whether they have a parent-child relation and we use this as additional information.",
        "• The sparsity of features (especially lexical features) is a common problem for supervised systems.",
        "In this work, we show that one can make fruitful use of unlabeled data, by using word clusters automatically gathered from unlabeled texts as a way of generalizing the lexical features.",
        "• We combine the various relational predictions and background knowledge through a global inference procedure, which we formalize via an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) framework as a constraint optimization problem (Roth and Yih, 2007).",
        "This allows us to easily incorporate various constraints that encode the background knowledge.",
        "Roth and Yih (2004) develop a relation extraction approach that exploits constraints among entity types and the relations allowed among them.",
        "We extend this view significantly, within a similar computational framework, to exploit relations among target relations, background information and world knowledge, as a way to improve relation extraction and make globally coherent predictions.",
        "In the rest of this paper, we first describe the features used in our basic RE system in Section 2.",
        "We then describe how we make use of background knowledge in Section 3.",
        "In Section 4, we show our experimental results and perform analysis in Section 5.",

        "Since there are a lot more fine-grained relation types than coarse-grained relation types, we propose using the coarse-grained predictions which should intuitively be more reliable, to improve the fine-grained predictions.",

        "Due to space limitations, we refer interested readers to the papers for more information on the CCM framework.",
        "By doing this, not only are the predictions of both classifiers coherent with each other (thus obtaining better predictions from both classifiers), but more importantly, we are effectively using the (more reliable) predictions of the coarse-grained classifier to constrain the predictions of the finegrained classifier.",

        "In their work, the authors irst identify phrases or mentions that could be mapped.",
        "The correct Wikipedia article for each mention is then probabilistically predicted using a combination of features based on Wikipedia hyperlink structure, semantic coherence, etc.",
        "The authors' own evaluation results indicate that the performance of their system ranges from 70-80%.",

        "The interpretation of Amj (mi) is similar.",
        "We introduce a new feature into the RE system by combining wi(mi, mj) with mi; mj E-maintype (defined as in Table 1).",
        "The second feature based on Wikipedia is as follows.",
        "It will be useful to check whether there is any parent-child relationship between two mentions.",
        "Intuitively, this will be useful for recognizing several relations such as physical part-whole (e.g. a city is part of a state), subsidiary (a company is a child-company of another), citizenship (a person is a citizen of a country), etc.",
        "Given a pair of mentions mi and m j, we use a Parent-Child system (Do and Roth, 2010) to predict whether they have a parent-child relation.",
        "To achieve this, the system irst gathers all Wikipedia articles that are related to mi and m j.",
        "It then uses the words in these pages and the category ontology of Wikipedia to make its parent-child predictions, while respecting certain deined constraints.",
        "In this work, we use its prediction as follows:",
        "where we combine w2(mi,mj) with mi,mj- E-maintype, introducing this as a new feature into our RE system.",
        "An inherent problem faced by supervised systems is that of data sparseness.",
        "To mitigate such issues in the lexical features, we use word clusters which are automatically generated from unlabeled texts.",
        "In this work, we use the Brown clustering algorithm (Brown et al., 1992), which has been shown to improve performance in various NLP applications such as dependency parsing (Koo et al., 2008), named entity recognition (Ratinov and Roth, 2009), and relation extraction (Boschee et al., 2005).",
        "The algorithm performs a hierarchical clustering of the words and represents them as a binary tree.",
        "Each word is uniquely identified by its path from the root and every path is represented with a bit string.",
        "Figure 1 shows an example clustering where the maximum path length is 3.",
        "By using path preixes of different lengths, one can obtain clusterings at different granularity.",
        "For instance, using preixes of length 2 will put apple and pear into the same cluster, Apple and IBM into the same cluster, etc.",
        "In our work, we use clusters generated from New York Times text and simply use a path preix of length 10.",
        "When Brown clusters are used in our system, all lexical features consisting of single words will be duplicated.",
        "For instance, for the feature hw ofm1, one new feature which is the length-10 bit string path representing the original lexical head word of m1, will be introduced and presented to the classiier as a string feature."
