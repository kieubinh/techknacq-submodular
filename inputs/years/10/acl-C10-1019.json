        "Semantic role labeling aims at identifying the relations between predicates in a sentence and their associated arguments.",
        "Word sense disambiguation is the process of identifying the correct meaning, or sense of a word in a given context.",
        "For example, for the sentence in Figure 1, we can find out that the predicate token \"hitting\" at position 3 has sense \"cause to move by striking\" and the sense label is \"hit.01\".",
        "The argument headed by the token \"cat\" at position 1 with sense \"feline mammal\" (cat.01) is referring to the player (A0), and the argument headed by the token \"ball\" at position 5 with sense",
        "The cat is hitting a ball",
        "\"round object that is hit in games\" (ball.01) is referring to the game object (A1) being hit.",
        "Normally, semantic role labeling and word sense disambiguation are regarded as two independent tasks, i.e., the word sense information is rarely used in a semantic role labeling system and vice versa.",
        "A few researchers have used semantic roles to help the verb sense disambiguation (Dang and Palmer, 2005).",
        "More people used predicate senses in semantic role labeling (Hajic et al., 2009; Surdeanu et al., 2008).",
        "However, both of the pipeline methods ignore possible dependencies between the word senses and semantic roles, and can result in the error propagation problem.",
        "The same problem also appears in other natural language processing tasks.",
        "In order to make different natural language processing tasks be able to help each other, jointly modeling methods become popular recently, such as joint Chinese word segmentation and part-of-speech tagging (Kruengkrai et al., 2009; Zhang and Clark, 2008; Jiang et al., 2008), joint lemma-tization and part-of-speech prediction (Toutanova and Cherry, 2009), joint morphological segmentation and syntactic parsing (Goldberg and Tsarfaty, 2008), joint text and aspect ratings for sentiment summarization (Titov and McDonald, 2008), and joint parsing and named entity recognition (Finkel and Manning, 2009).",

        "(2009) proposed a method to maximize the joint probability of the semantic role of preposition phrases and the preposition sense.",
        "In order to do better joint learning, a novel statistical relational learning framework, Markov logic (Domingos and Lowd, 2009) was introduced to join semantic role labeling and predicate senses (Meza-Ruiz and Riedel, 2009).",
        "Markov logic combines the first order logic and Markov networks, to develop a joint probability model over all related rules.",
        "Global constraints (introduced by Punyakanok et al.",
        "(2008)) among semantic roles can be easily added into Markov logic.",
        "And the more important, the jointly modeling can be realized using Markov logic naturally.",
        "Besides predicates and prepositions, other word senses are also important information for recognizing semantic roles.",
        "For example, if we know \"cat\" is an \"agent\" of the predicate \"hit\" in a sentence, we can guess that \"dog\" can also be an \"agent\" of \"hit\", though it does not appear in the training data.",
        "Similarly, the semantic role information can also help to disambiguate word senses.",
        "In addition, the predicate sense and the argument sense can also help each other.",
        "In the sentence \"The cat is hitting a ball.",
        "\", if we know \"hit\" here has a game related sense, we can guess that the \"ball\" should have the sense \"is a round object in games\".",
        "In the same way, the correct \"ball\" sense can help to disambiguate the sense of \"hit\".",
        "The joint probability, that they are disambiguated correctly simultaneously will be larger than other abnormalities.",
        "The release of OntoNotes (Hovy et al., 2006) provides us an opportunity to jointly model all word senses disambiguation and semantic role labeling.",
        "OntoNotes is a large corpus annotated with constituency trees (based on Penn Treebank), predicate argument structures (based on Penn PropBank), all word senses, etc.",
        "It has been used in some natural language processing tasks, such as joint parsing and named entity recognition (Finkel and Manning, 2009), and word sense disambiguation (Zhong et al., 2008).",
        "In this paper, we first propose some pipeline systems which exploit automatic all word sense disambiguation into semantic role labeling task and vice versa.",
        "Then we present a Markov logic model which can easily express useful global constraints and jointly disambiguate all word senses and label semantic roles.",
        "Experiments on the OntoNotes 3.0 corpus show that (1) the automatic all word sense disambiguation and semantic role labeling tasks can help each other when using pipeline approaches, and more important, (2) the joint approach using Markov logic leads to higher accuracy for word sense disambiguation and performance (Fi) for semantic role labeling than pipeline approaches."
