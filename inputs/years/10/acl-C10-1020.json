        "With the advent of Web2.0, many online collaborative tools, e.g., weblogs and discussion forums are being developed to allow Internet users to express their perspectives on a wide variety of topics via Web documents.",
        "One benefit is that the Web has become an invaluable knowledge base for Internet users to learn about a topic comprehensively.",
        "Since the essence of Web2.0 is knowledge sharing, collaborative tools are generally designed with few constraints so that users will be motivated to contribute their knowledge.",
        "As a result, the number of topic documents on the Internet is growing exponentially.",
        "Research subjects, such as topic threading and timeline mining (Nallapati et al., 2004; Feng and Allan, 2007; Chen and Chen, 2008), are thus being studied to help Internet users comprehend numerous topic documents efficiently.",
        "A topic consists of a sequence of related events associated with a specific time, place, and person(s) (Nallapati et al., 2004).",
        "Topics that involve bipolar (or competitive) viewpoints are often attention-getting and attract a large number of topic documents.",
        "For such topics, identifying the polarity of the named entities, especially person names, in the topic documents would help readers learn the topic efficiently.",
        "For instance, for the 2008 American presidential election, Internet users can find numerous Web documents about the Democrat and Republican parties.",
        "Identifying important people in the competing parties would help readers form a balanced view of the campaign.",
        "Existing works on topic content mining focus on extracting important themes in topics.",
        "In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach that identifies bipolar person names in a set of topic documents automatically.",
        "We employ principal component analysis (PCA) (Smith, 2002) to discover bipolar word usage patterns of important person names in a set of topic documents, and show that the signs of the entries in the principal eigenvector of PCA partition the person names in bipolar groups spontaneously.",
        "In addition, we present two techniques, called off-topic block elimination and weighted correlation coefficient, to reduce the effect of data sparseness on person name bipolarization.",
        "The results of experiments based on two topic document sets written in English and Chinese respectively demonstrate that the proposed PCA-based approach is effective in identifying bipolar person names.",
        "Furthermore, the approach is language independent."

        "The authors observed that most conjoined adjectives (77.84%) have the same orientation, while conjunctions that use but generally connect adjectives of different orientations.",

        "The authors employed a bootstrap strategy to collect training datasets for the sentiments and trained eight sentiment classifiers to assign sentiment scores to a synset.",
        "Kanayama and Nasukawa (2006) posited that polar clauses with the same polarity tend to appear successively in contexts.",

        "To identify the polarity of a comparative word (e.g., longer) with a product feature (e.g., battery life), the authors collected phrases that describe the Pros and Cons of products from Epinions.com and proposed one-side association (OSA), which is a variant of PMI.",
        "OSA assigns a positive (negative) orientation to the comparative-feature combination if the synonyms of the comparative word and feature tend to co-occur in the Pros (resp.",

        "Our research differs from existing approaches in three respects.",
        "First, most works identify the polarity of adjectives and adverbs because the syntactic constructs generally express sentimental semantics.",
        "In contrast, our method identifies the polarity of person names.",
        "Second, to the best of our knowledge, all existing polarity identification methods require external information sources (e.g., WordNet, manually selected polarity words, or training corpora).",
        "However, our method identifies bipolar person names by simply analyzing person name usage patterns in topic documents without using external information.",
        "Finally, our method does not require any language constructs, such as conjunctions; hence, it can be applied to different languages."

        "It is an m-dimensional vector whose j'th entry, denoted as by, is the frequency of u in bi.",
        "In addition, a row in A, denoted as ui, represents a textual unit i; and it is an n-dimensional vector whose j'th entry, denoted as ui,j, is the frequency of ui in bj.",

        "In our research, it identifies the most important unit pattern in the topic blocks by first constructing an mxm unit relation matrix R, in which the (i,j)-entry (denoted as ri,j) denotes the correlation coefficient of ui and uj.",
        "The correlation is computed as follows:",
        "where u1~=1/nj]nk=1ui:k and uj~=1/nj]nk=1uj:k are the average frequencies of units i and j respectively.",
        "The range of ry- is within [-1,1] and the value represents the degree of correlation between uiand u under the decomposed blocks.",
        "If ri:J = 0, we say that ui and Uj are uncorrelated; that is, occurrences of unit ui and unit Uj in the blocks are independent of each other.",
        "If rij > 0, we say that units ui and Uj are positively correlated.",
        "That is, Ui and Uj tend to co-occur in the blocks; otherwise, both tend to be jointly-absent.",
        "If rij < 0, we say that ui and Uj are negatively correlated; that is, if one unit appears, the other tends not to appear in the same block simultaneously.",
        "Note that if ri:J- 4 0, \\riJ\\ scales the strength of a positive or negative correlation.",
        "Moreover, since the correlation coefficient is commutative, ri j will be identical to r]]i such that matrix R will be symmetric.",
        "A unit pattern is represented as a vector v of dimension m in which the i'th entry vi indicates the weight of i'th unit in the pattern.",
        "Since matrix R depicts the correlation of the units in the topic blocks, given a constituent of v, vTRv computes the variance of the pattern to characterize the decomposed blocks.",
        "A pattern is important if it characterizes the variance of the blocks specifically.",

        "vTV = 1.",
        "Without specifying any constraint on v, the objective function becomes arbitrarily large with large entry values of v. Constraint vTv = 1 limits the search space within the set of length-normalized vectors.",
        "Chen and Chen (2008) show that the desired v for the above constrained optimization problem is the eigenvector of R with the largest eigenvalue.",
        "Furthermore, as R is a symmetric matrix, such an eigenvector always exists (Spence et al., 2000) and the optimization problem is solvable.",
        "PCA is not the only method that identifies important textual patterns in terms of eigenvectors.",
        "For instance, Gong and Liu (2001), Chen and Chen (2008) utilize the eigenvectors of symmetric matrices to extract salient concepts and salient themes from documents respectively.",
        "The difference between PCA and other eigenvector-based approaches lies in the way the unit relation matrix is constructed.",
        "PCA calculates ri j by using the correlation coefficient, whereas the other approaches employ the inner product or cosine formula (Manning et al., 2008) to derive the relationship between textual units.",
        "Specifically, the correlation coefficient is identical to the cosine formula if we normalize each unit with its",
        "corr(ui, Uj)",
        "where u* = U - uf[1,1,...,1]T; uj* = Uj \" U;~[1, 1,^,1]T; and are the mean-normalized vectors of Ui and Uj, respectively.",
        "Conceptually, the mean normalization process is the only difference between PCA and other eigenvector-based approaches.",
        "Since the eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix form an orthonormal basis of Rm, they may contain negative entries (Spence et al., 2000).",
        "Even though Kleinberg (1999) and Chen and Chen (2008) have shown experimentally that negative entries in an eigenvector are as important as positive entries for describing a certain unit pattern, the meaning of negative entries in their approaches is unexplainable.",
        "This is because textual units (e.g., terms, sentences, and documents) in information retrieval are usually characterized by frequency-based metrics, e.g., term frequency, document frequency, or TFIDF (Manning et al., 2008), which can never be negative.",
        "In PCA, however, the mean normalization process of the correlation coefficient gives bipolar meaning to positive and negative entries and that helps us partition textual units into bipolar groups in accordance with their signs in v.",
        "1 The right singular vectors of a matrix A used by Gong and Liu (2001) are equivalent to the eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix ATA whose entries are the inner products of the corresponding columns of A.",

        "The synthesized example in Figure 1 illustrates the effect of the normalization process.",
        "In this example, we are only interested in textual units u1 and u2; the corpus consists of ten blocks.",
        "Graphically, each block can be represented as a point in a 2-dimensional vector space.",
        "The mean normalization process moves the origin of the 2-dimensional vector space to the centroid of the blocks that makes negative unit values explainable.",
        "A negative unit of a block in this normalized vector space indicates that the number of occurrences of the unit in the block is less than the unit's average; by contrast, a positive unit means that the number of occurrences of the unit in a block is above the average.",
        "In the figure, the most important unit pattern v <-0.707, 0.707> calculated by PCA is represented by the dashed line.",
        "The signs of v's entries indicate that the occurrence of u1 will be lower than the average if u2 occurs frequently in a block.",
        "In addition, as the signs of entries in an eigenvector are invertible (Spence et al., 2000), the constituent of v also claims that if u1 occurs frequently in a block, then the probability that we will observe u2 in the same block will be lower than expected.",
        "The instances of bipolar word usage behavior presented in v are consistent with the distribution of the ten blocks.",
        "As mentioned in Section 2, Ka-nayama and Nasukawa (2006) validated that polar text units with the same polarity tend to appear together to make contexts coherent.",
        "Consequently, we believe that the signs in PCA's principal eigenvector are effective in partitioning textual units into bipolar groups.",
        "A major problem with employing PCA to process textual data is the sparseness of textual units.",
        "To illustrate this problem, we collected 411 news documents about the 2009 NBA Finals from Google News and counted the frequency that each person name occurred in the documents.",
        "We also evaluate the documents in the experiment section to determine if the proposed approach is capable of bipolarizing the person names into the teams that played in the finals correctly.",
        "We rank the units according to their frequencies and list the frequencies in descending order in Figure 2.",
        "The figure shows that the frequency distribution follows Zipf s law (Manning et al., 2008); and for most units, the distribution in a block will be very sparse.",
        "We observe that a unit will not to occur in a block in the following three scenarios.",
        "1) The polarity of the block is the opposite of the polarity of the unit.",
        "For instance, if the unit represents a player in one team and the block narrates information about the other team, the block's author would not mention the unit in the block to ensure that the block's content is coherent.",
        "2) Even if the polarity of a block is identical to that of the unit; the length of the block may not be sufficient to contain the unit.",
        "3) The block is off-topic so the unit will not appear in the block.",
        "In the last two scenarios, the absence of units will impact the estimation of the correlation coefficient.",
        "To alleviate the problem, we propose two techniques, the weighted correlation coefficient and off-block elimination, which we describe in the following sub-sections.",
        "Weighted Correlation Coefficient",
        "The so-called data sparseness problem in scenario 2 affects many statistical information retrieval and language models (Manning et al., 2008).",
        "For units with the same polarity, data sparseness could lead to underestimation of their correlations because the probability that the units will occur together is reduced.",
        "Conversely, for uncorrelated units or units with opposite polarities, data sparseness may lead to overestimation of their correlations because they are frequently jointly-absent in the decomposed blocks.",
        "While smoothing approaches, such as Laplace's law (also known as adding-one smoothing), have been developed to alleviate data sparseness in language models (Manning et al., 2008), they are not appropriate for PCA.",
        "This is because the correlation coefficient of PCA measures the divergence between units from their means, so adding one to each block unit will not change the divergence.",
        "To summarize, data sparseness could influence the correlation coefficient when units do not co-occur.",
        "Thus, for two units ui and Uj, we separate B into co-occurring and non-co-occurring parts and apply the following weighted correlation coefficient:",
        "corrw(ui, Uj) =",
        "where corrw(uhuj) represents the weighted correlation coefficient between units i and j; and co(ij) denotes the set of blocks in which units and j co-occur.",
        "The range of parameter a is within [0,1].",
        "It weights the influence of non-co-occurring blocks when calculating the correlation coefficient.",
        "When a = 0.5, the equation is equivalent to the standard correlation coefficient; and when a = 0, the equation only considers the blocks in which units i and j co-occur.",
        "Conversely, when a = 1, only non-co-occurring blocks are employed to calculate the units' correlation.",
        "In the experiment section, we will examine the effect of a on bipolar person name identification.",

        "Including off-topic blocks in PCA will lead to overestimation of the correlation between units.",
        "This is because units are usually jointly-absent from off-topic blocks that make uncorrelated or even negatively correlated units positively correlated.",
        "To eliminate the effect of off-topic blocks on unit bipolarization, we construct a centroid of all the decomposed blocks by averaging bi s. Then, blocks whose cosine similarity to the centroid is lower than a predefined threshold ß are excluded from calculation of the correlation coefficient."

        "It is noteworthy that the chairs of the DPP and the KMT, who are Ing-wen Tsai and Ying-jeou Ma respectively, are correctly bipolarized.",
        "We observed that, during the campaign, the chairs repeatedly helped their respective party's candidates gain support from the public.",
        "As the names of the chairs and the candidates often co-occur in the documents, they can be bipolarized accurately.",
        "We also found that our approach bipolarized two candidates incorrectly if the competition between them was fierce.",
        "For instance, Kun-cheng Lai and Lichen Kuang campaigned intensively for a single legislative position.",
        "As they often commented on each other during the campaign, they tend to co-occur in the topic documents.",
        "PCA therefore misclassifies them as positively correlated and incorrectly groups Kun-cheng Lai with the KMT party.",
        "KMT (BRf )",
        "Figure 5 shows that off-topic block elimination is effective in person name bipolarization.",
        "However, the weighted correlation coefficient only improves the bipolarization performance slightly.",
        "We have investigated this problem and believe that the evaluated person names in the documents are frequent enough to prevent the data sparseness problem.",
        "While the weighted correlation coefficient does not improve the bi-polarization performance significantly, the proposed PCA-based approach can still identify the bipolar parties of important persons accurately.",
        "Unlike the results in the last section, the accuracy rate in this experiment does not decrease as a decreases.",
        "This is because the topic documents generally report news about a single party.",
        "As the documents rarely recap the activities of parties, the co-occurrence blocks accurately reflect the bipolar relationship between the persons.",
        "Hence, a small a value can identify bipolar person names effectively.",
        "The evaluations of the NBA and the election datasets demonstrate that the proposed PCA-based approach identifies bipolar person names in topic documents effectively.",
        "As the writing styles of topic documents in different domains vary, the weighted correlation coefficient may not always improve bipolarization performance.",
        "However, because we eliminate off-topic blocks, a large a value always produces superior bipola-rization performances.",
        "Conclusion",
        "In this paper, we have proposed an unsupervised approach for identifying bipolar person names in topic documents.",
        "We show that the signs of the entries in the principal eigenvector of PCA can partition person names into bipolar groups spontaneously.",
        "In addition, we introduce two techniques, namely the weighted correlation coefficient and off-topic block elimination, to address the data sparseness problem.",
        "The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed approach identifies bipolar person names of topics successfully without using any external knowledge; moreover, it is language independent.",
        "The results also show that off-topic block elimination along with a large a value for the weighted correlation coefficient generally produce accurate person name bipolarization.",
        "In the future, we will integrate text summarization techniques with the proposed bipolarization method to provide users with polarity-based topic summaries.",
        "We believe that summarizing important information about different polarities would help users gain a comprehensive knowledge of a topic.",
