        "Text-based emotion processing has been a center of attention in the NLP field in the past few years.",
        "Most previous researches have focused on detecting the surface information of emotions, especially emotion classes, e.g., \"happiness\" and \"anger\" (Mihalcea and Liu 2006, Strapparava and Mihalcea 2008, Abbasi et al., 2008, Tokuhisa et al.",
        "2008).",
        "Although most emotion theories recognize the important role of causes in emotion analysis (Descartes, 1649; James, 1884; Plutchik 1980, Wierzbicka 1999), very few studies explore the interactions between emotion and causes.",
        "Emotion-cause interaction is the eventive relation which potentially yields the most crucial information in terms of information extraction.",
        "For instance, knowing the existence of an emotion is often insufficient to predict future events or decide on the best reaction.",
        "However, if the emotion cause is known in addition to the type of emotion, prediction of future events or assessment of potential implications can be done more reliably.",
        "In other words, when emotion is treated as an event, causal relation is the pivotal relation to discover.",
        "In this paper, we explore one of the crucial deep level types of information of emotion, i.e. cause events.",
        "Our study focuses on explicit emotions in which emotions are often presented by emotion keywords such as \"shocked\" in \"He was shocked after hearing the news\".",
        "Emotion causes are the explicitly expressed propositions that evoke the presence of the corresponding emotions.",
        "They can be expressed by verbs, nomi-nalizations, and nominals.",
        "Lee et al.",
        "(2010a) explore the causes of explicit emotions by constructing a Chinese emotion cause corpus.",
        "Based on this corpus, we formalize the emotion cause detection problem through extensive data analysis.",
        "We find that ~14% emotion causes are complicated events containing multi-clauses, to which previous cause detection systems can hardly be applied directly.",
        "Most previous cause detection systems focus on the causal relation between a pair of small-size text units, such as clauses or phrases.",
        "They are thus not able to detect emotion causes that are multi-clauses.",
        "In this paper, we formalize emotion cause detection as a multi-label classification task (i.e. each instance may contain more than one label), which allows us to capture long-distance information for emotion cause detection.",
        "In term of feature extraction, as emotion cause detection is a case of cause detection, some typical patterns used in existing cause detection systems, e.g., \"because\" and \"thus\", can be adopted.",
        "In addition, various linguistic cues are examined which potentially indicate emotion causes, such as causative verbs and epistemic markers (Lee at al.",
        "2010a).",
        "Then some linguistic patterns of emotion causes are manually generalized by examining the linguistic context of the empirical data (Lee et al., 2010b).",
        "It is expected that these manually generalized patterns often yield a low-coverage problem.",
        "Thus, we extracted features which enable us to automatically capture more emotion-specific constructions.",
        "Experiments show that such an integrated system with various linguistic features performs promisingly well.",
        "We believe that the present study should provide the foundation for future research on emotion analysis, such as the detection of implicit emotion or cause.",

        "Most previous studies on textual emotion processing focus on emotion recognition or classification given a known emotion context (Mihal-cea and Liu 2006, Strapparava and Mihalcea 2008, Abbasi et al., 2008, Tokuhisa et al.",
        "2008).",
        "However, the performance is far from satisfactory.",
        "One crucial problem in these works is that they limit the emotion analysis to a simple classification and do not explore the underlying information regarding emotions.",
        "Most theories conclude that emotions are often invoked by the perception of external events.",
        "An effective emotion recognition model should thus take this into account.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, little research has been done with respect to emotion cause detection.",
        "Lee et al.",
        "(2010a) first investigate the interactions between emotions and the corresponding causes from a linguistic perspective.",
        "They annotate a small-scale emotion cause corpus, and identify six groups of linguistic cues facilitating emotion cause detection.",
        "Based on these findings, they develop a rule-based system for automatic emotion cause detection (Lee et al., 2010b).",
        "Emotion cause detection can be considered as a kind of causal relation detection, which has been intensively studied for years.",
        "Most previous cause detection studies focus on a specific domain, such as aviation (Persing and Ng, 2009) and finance (Low, et al., 2001).",
        "Few works (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002; Girju, 2003; Chang and Choi, 2005) examine causal relation for open domains.",
        "In recognizing causal relations, most existing systems involve two steps: 1) cause candidate identification; 2) causal relation detection.",
        "To simplify the task, most systems omit the step of identifying cause candidates.",
        "Instead, they often predefine or filter out possible causes based on domain knowledge, e.g., 14 kinds of cause types are identified for aviation incidents (Persing and Ng, 2009).",
        "For events without specific domain information, open-domain systems choose to limit their cause candidate.",
        "For example, the cause-effect pairs are limited to two noun two clauses connected with fixed conjunction words (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002).",
        "Given pairs of cause-effect candidates, causal relation detection is considered as a binary classification problem, i.e. \"causal\" vs. \"non-causal\".",
        "In general, there are two kinds of information extracted to identify the causal relation.",
        "One is patterns or constructions expressing a cause-effect relation (Chang and Choi, 2005; Girju, 2003), and the other is semantic information underlying in a text (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002; Persing and Ng, 2009), such as word pair probability.",
        "Undoubtedly, the two kinds of information usually interact with each other in a real cause detection system.",
        "In the literature, the three common classification methods, i.e. unsupervised, semi-supervised, and supervised, have all been used for cause detection systems.",
        "Marcu and Echihabi (2002) first collected a cause corpus using an unsupervised approach with the help of several conjunction words, such as \"because\" and \"thus\", and determined the causal relation for a clause pair using the word pair probability.",
        "Chang and Choi (2005) used a semi-supervised method to recursively learn lexical patterns for cause recognition based on syntactic trees.",
        "Bethard and Martin (2008) put various causal information in a supervised classifier, such as the temporal information and syntactic information.",
        "For our emotion cause detection, several practical issues need to be investigated and resolved.",
        "First, for the identification of cause candidates, we need to define a reasonable span of a cause.",
        "Based on our data analysis, we find that emotion causes often appear across phrases or even clauses.",
        "Second, although in emotion cause detection the effect is fixed, the cause is open-domain.",
        "We also notice that besides the common patterns, emotion causes have their own expression patterns.",
        "An effective emotion cause detection system should take them into account."

        "Moreover, the cause type is also identified, which is either a nominal event or a verbal event (a verb or a nominalization).",
        "Lee at al.",
        "(2010a) notice that 72% of the extracted entries express emotions, and 80% of the emotional entries have a cause.",
        "To have a deeper understanding of emotion cause detection, we take a closer look at the emotion cause distribution, including the distribution of emotion cause occurrence and the distribution of emotion cause text.",
        "The occurrence of emotion causes: According to most emotion theories, an emotion is generally invoked by an external event.",
        "The corpus shows that, however, 20% of the emotional entries have no cause.",
        "Entries without causes explicitly expressed are mainly due to the following reasons:",
        "i) There is not enough contextual information, for instance the previous or the suffix sentence is interjections, e.g., en heng \"aha\";",
        "ii) When the focus sentence is the beginning or the ending of a paragraph, no prefix sentence or suffix sentence can be extracted as the context.",
        "In this case, the cause may be beyond the context;",
        "iii) The cause is obscure, which can be very abstract or even unknown reasons.",

        "It is generally assumed that a proposition has a verb which optionally takes a noun occurring before it as the subject and a noun after it as the object.",
        "However, a cause can also be expressed as a nominal.",
        "In other words, both the predicate and the two arguments are optional provided that at least one of them is present.",
        "Thus, the fundamental issue in designing a cause detection system is the definition of the span of a cause text.",
        "As mentioned, most previous studies on causal relations choose to ignore the identification of cause candidates.",
        "In this paper, we first analyze the distribution of cause text and then determine the cause candidates for an emotion.",
        "Based on the emotion cause corpus, we find that emotion causes are more likely to be expressed by verbal events than nominal events (85% vs. 15%).",
        "Although a nominalization (a kind of verbal events) is usually a noun phrase, a proposition containing a verb plays a salient role in the expressions of emotion causes, and thus a cause candidate are more likely to be a clause-based unit.",
        "In addition, the actual cause can sometimes be too long and complicated, which involves several events.",
        "In order to explore the span of a cause text, we do the following analysis.",
        "Firstly, for each emotion keyword, an entry is segmented into clauses with four punctuations (i.e. commas, periods, question marks and exclamation marks), and thus an entry becomes a list of cause candidates.",
        "For example, when an entry has four clauses, its corresponding list of cause candidates contains five text units, i.e. <left_2, left_1, left_0, right_0, right_1>.",
        "If we assume the clause where emotion keyword locates is a focus clause, 'left_2' and 'left_1' are previous two clauses, and 'right_1' is the following one.",
        "'left_0' and 'right_0' are the partial texts of the focus clause, which locate in the left side of and the right side of the emotion keyword, respectively.",
        "Moreover, a cause candidate must contain either a noun or a verb because a cause is either a verbal event or a nominal event; otherwise, it will be removed from the list.",
        "Secondly, we calculate whether a cause candidate overlaps with the real cause, as shown in Table 1.",
        "We find that emotion causes are more likely to occur in the left of emotion keyword.",
        "This observation is consistent with the fact that an emotion is often trigged by an external happened event.",
        "Thirdly, for all causes occurring between 'left_2' and 'right_1', we calculate whether a cause occurs across clauses, as in Table 2.",
        "We observe that most causes locate within the same clause of the representation of the emotion (85.57%).",

        "Thus, the evaluation scores for binary classification based on three common measures, i.e. precision, recall and F-score, are chosen.",
        "According to the distribution in Table 1, we design a naive baseline to allow feature analysis.",

        "If the candidate contains a noun or verb, consider this clause as a cause and stop.",
        "We run the multi-label system with different groups of features and the performances are shown in Table 5.",

        "Since the 'N' tag is overwhelming, we report only the Mac average scores for both 'Y' and 'N' tags.",
        "In Table 5, we first notice that the performances achieve significant improvement from the baseline to the final system (~17%).",
        "This indicates that our linguistic features are effective for emotion cause detection.",
        "In addition, we observe that LP and LFC are the best two effective features, whereas LCC and GAE have slight contributions.",
        "This shows that our feature extraction has a strong capability to detect local causal constructions, and is yet unable to detect the long-distance or semantic causal information.",
        "Here, 'local' refers to the information in the focus clause.",
        "We also find that incorporating LFC, which is a pure local feature, generally improves the performances of all cause candidates, i.e. ~5% improvement for 'left_1'.",
