        "Wikipedia has over 260 versions in different languages, but the great disparity in their scope and quality is hindering the effective spread of knowledge.",
        "The English version is currently the dominant one with over 3 million articles while the Chinese version, for example, has only one tenth the amount.",
        "Most Chinese articles suffer from content incoherence and lack of details compared to their English counterparts.",
        "Some of these articles are human-authored translation of the English version with varying degrees of accuracy and completeness, and others are ill-arranged combinations of excerpts directly adapted from external sources.",
        "The former takes considerable human effort and the latter tends to produce fragmented and incomplete texts.",
        "The intuitive solution of machine translation is also not feasible because it hardly provides satisfactory readability.",
        "These problems call for a synthesis approach.",
        "In order to present the information conveyed by an English article in Chinese, instead of literally translate it, we build a topic-template expressed by the keywords extracted from the English article.",
        "Machine-translation of these keywords helps to yield the topic-template in Chinese.",
        "Using the topic-template in Chinese, we form a pool of candidate excerpts by retrieving Chinese documents from the Internet.",
        "These online documents are usually human-authored and have optimal readability and coherence.",
        "Candidate excerpts are further split into segments as synthesis unit.",
        "For segment selection, we propose an iterative ranking function that aims to maximize textual similarity, keywords coverage, and content coherence, while penalizes information redundancy.",
        "A feature of our approach is the use of bilingual resources throughout the synthesis process.",
        "We calculate similarity scores of two texts based on both English and Chinese versions of them, which forms a more precise measure than using either version alone.",
        "For the sake of clarity, we will use English and Chinese as examples of source and target language respectively when describing the methodology.",
        "Nonetheless, our approach is not constrained to any specific language pair and supports both direction of synthesis."

        "2006) investigated two approaches to identify similarity between articles in different languages for automatic generation of parallel corpus, including a machine-translation based approach and one using a bilingual lexicon derived from the hyperlink structure underlying Wikipedia articles.",
        "Both methods rely on pairwise comparisons made at the sentential level, which hardly account for similarity or coherence in the paragraph scope.",
        "Besides it is not a generative algorithm and thus inapplicable to our problem where comparable sentences in Chinese are simply not available.",
        "A generative approach was proposed by (Sauper and Barzilay, 2009) to create highly-structured Wikipedia articles (e.g. descriptions of diseases) composed of information drawn from the Internet.",
        "It uses an automatically-induced domain-specific template, and the perceptron algorithm augmented with a global integer linear programming (ILP) formulation to optimize both local fit of information into each section and global coherence across the entire article.",
        "This method works only for specific domains where articles have obviously separable sections (e.g.",
        "Causes and Symptoms) and it requires a training corpus for each domain to induce the template.",
        "Moreover, the synthesis units they use are complete excerpts rather than individual sentences as in our approach.",
        "Their choice is based on the assumption that texts on the Internet appear in complete paragraphs, with structure strictly adhere to the fixed training templates, which may be true for specific domains they test on, but fails to hold for domain-independent application.",
        "Instead, our algorithm aims to synthesize the article in the sentential level.",
        "We select sentences to fit the source content at run time, regardless to whether a predetermined structural template exists or not.",
        "Therefore the requirement on the structures of source articles becomes very flexible, enabling our system to work for arbitrary domain.",
        "In a sense, rather than being a structure-aware approach, our algorithm performs in a content-aware manner.",
        "This also makes maintaining coherence throughout article a lot more challenging.",

        "The Chinese keywords are then combined with the translated subject term and section title to form queries that are used to retrieve online Chinese documents by Google search.",
        "The returned Chinese documents are clustered and filtered based on both their format and content.",
        "The remaining candidate excerpts are further split using the TextTiling algorithm (Hearst, 1997) into segments that constitutes the text units for synthesis.",
        "This unit size ensures both semantic completeness within each unit and flexibility of combining multiple units into coherent paragraphs.",
        "Segments are chosen according to scores computed iteratively by a variant of the MMR-MD scoring function that considers not only the relevance of an individual segment to the source section but also its impact on the provisional synthesized section as a whole.",

        "Each pair of words occurring in the same sentence share an edge between them and all word vertices have initial weights of 1.",
        "Unlike tf-idf which considers only word-specific values and tends to give higher weights for rare words, TextRank uses global information about how a word is used in its context to induce its importance and has the advantage of highlighting keywords that are relatively common but highly relevant.",

        "We basically seeks named-entity strings from online documents that are in the format of „CHINESE (ENGLISH)' and extracts the Chinese transliteration from the pattern using regular expression combined with a Pinyin (Chinese Romanization) /English pronunciation lookup table.",
        "Since Chinese words are not spaced in documents, the Pinyin/English lookup is helpful to determine the boundary of the Chinese transliteration based on the fact that most Chinese transliterations start with characters pronounced similar to the initial syllables in corresponding English names.",

        "For the subject \"Chekhov/MW^\", a keyword with two transliterations \"Taganrog/J^r^^flr/ilrT%?$r \" and another keyword with two transliterations \"father/ SS\" will result in two query pairs: \"Chekhov OR Taganrog OR CT^fè OR îg=F^fâ\" and \"Chekhov OR MW% OR SS\".",
        "The retrieved excerpts are filtered first by criteria on format include text length and the percentage of white-space and non-Chinese characters.",

        "For Chinese excerpts, English similarity is computed by first translating them into English by Google Translate and taking tf-idf as token weights.",
        "Similar procedure works for computing Chinese similarity for English excerpts, except that Chinese texts need to be segmented first and weights are based on tf only.",
        "These machine translations do not require grammatical correctness since they are essentially used as bags of words in both cosine similarity and Jaccard index.",

        "Based on the idea that the 'goodness' of a segment should be evaluated both on its individual relevance to the source and the overall impact on the synthesized section, we summarize four factors for scoring a segment: (1) Intuitively a segment scores higher if it has higher similarity to the source section; (2) A segment makes positive contribution to synthesized section if it introduces some keywords mentioned in the source; (3) A segment tends to improve the coherence of synthesized section if it comes from the same excerpts as the other segments in synthesized section; (4) A sentence should be penalized if its content is redundant with the synthesized section.",
