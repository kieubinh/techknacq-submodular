        "Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) Extraction refers to an automatic extraction of the interactions between multiple protein names from natural language sentences using linguistic features such as lexical clues and syntactic structures.",
        "A sentence may contain multiple protein names and relations, i.e., multiple PPIs.",
        "For example, the sentence in Fig.1 contains a total of six protein names of varying word lengths and three explicit interactions (relations).",

        "They include word feature kernels, parse tree kernels, and graph kernels.",
        "One of the benefits of using a kernel method is that it can keep the original formation of target objects such as parse trees, not requiring extensive feature engineering for learning algorithms (Zelenko et al., 2003).",

        "Linguistic approaches involve constructing special grammars capable of syntactically expressing the interactions in sentences and then applying them to the language analyzers such as part-of-speech taggers, chunkers and parsers to extract PPIs.",
        "Based on the level of linguistic analyses, we can divide the linguistic approaches into two categories: shallow parsing (Seki-mizu et al., 1998; Gondy et al., 2003) and full parsing methods (Temkin & Gilder, 2003; Nikolai et al., 2004).",

        "Machine learning and statistical approaches have been around for a while but have recently become a dominant approach for PPI extraction.",

        "To further improve the performance of the multiple kernel system, the same group combined multiple corpora to exploit additional features for a modified SVM model (Miwa et al., 2009b).",
        "While they achieved the best performance in PPI extraction, it was possible only with additional kernels and corpora from which additional features were extracted.",
        "Unlike the aforementioned approaches trying to use all possible resources for performance enhancement, this paper aims at maximizing the performance of PPIE using only a single kernel without any additional resources.",

        "If this set contains M unique sub-trees, the vector space becomes M-dimensional.",
        "The similarity between two parse trees can be obtained by computing the inner product of the two corresponding vectors, which is the output of the parse tree kernel.",
        "There are two types of parse tree kernels of different forms of sub-trees: one is SubTree Kernel (STK) proposed by Vishwanathan and Smola (2003), and the other is SubSet Tree Kernel (SSTK) developed by Collins and Duffy (2001).",
        "In STK, each sub-tree should be a complete tree rooted by a specific node in the entire tree and ended with leaf nodes.",
        "All the sub-trees must obey the production rules of the syntactic grammar.",
        "Meanwhile, SSTK can have any forms of sub-trees in the entire parse tree given that they should obey the production rules.",
        "It was shown that SSTK is much superior to STK in many tasks (Moschitti, 2006).",
        "He also introduced a fast algorithm for computing a parse tree kernel and showed its beneficial effects on the semantic role labeling problem.",
        "A parse tree kernel can be computed by the following equation: K(TltT2,A,a) = where Ti is ith parse tree and n1 and n2 are nodes in NT, the set of the entire nodes of T. A represents a tree kernel decay factor, which will be explained later, and a decides the way the tree is severed.",

        "Without pruning, all the words like addition, increased and activity would intricately participate in deciding the interaction type of this sentence.",
        "Another important effect of the tree pruning is its ability to separate features when two or more interactions exist in a sentence.",
        "As in Figure 1, each interaction involves its unique context even though a sentence has multiple interactions.",
        "With tree pruning, it is likely to extract context-sensitive features by ignoring external features.",
        "Collins and Duffy (2001) addressed two problems of the parse tree kernel.",
        "The first one is that its kernel value tends to be largely dominated by the size of two input trees.",
        "If they are large in size, it is highly probable for the kernel to accumulate a large number of overlapping counts in computing their similarity.",
        "Secondly, the kernel value of two identical parse trees can become overly large while the value of two different parse trees is much tiny in general.",
        "These two aspects can cause a trouble during a training phase because pairs of large parse trees that are similar to each other are disproportionately dominant.",
        "Consequently, the resulting models could act like nearest neighbor models (Collins and Duffy, 2001).",
        "To alleviate the problems, Collins and Duffy (2001) introduced a scalability parameter called decay factor, 0 < X < 1 which scales the relative importance of tree fragments with their sizes as in line 33 of Fig. 2.",
        "Based on the algorithm, a decay factor decreases the degree of contribution of a large sub-tree exponentially in kernel computation.",
        "Figure 4 illustrates both the way a tree kernel is computed and the effect of a decay factor.",
        "In the figure, T1 and T2 share four common sub-trees (S1, S2, S3, S5).",
        "Let us assume that there are only two trees in a training set and only five unique sub-trees exist.",

        "It is highly probable for large sub-trees to contain many smaller subtrees, which lead to an overestimated similarity value between two parse trees.",
        "As mentioned above, therefore, it is necessary to rein those large sub-trees with respect to their sizes in computing kernel values by using decay factors.",
        "In this paper, we treat the decay factor as one of the important optimization parameters for a PPI extraction task.",
        "Experimental Results",
        "In order to show the superiority of the simple kernel based method using the two factors used in this paper, compared to the resent results for PPIE using additional resources, we ran a series of experiments using the same PPI corpora cited in the literature.",
        "In addition, we show that the method is robust especially for cross-corpus experiments where a classifier is trained and tested with entirely different corpora.",
        "To evaluate our approach for PPIE, we used \"Five PPI Corpora\" organized by Pyysalo et al.",
        "(2008).",
        "It contains five different PPI corpora: AImed, BioInfer, HPRD50, IEPA and LLL.",

        "While the performance differences are not very big, we argue that obtaining higher performance values is significant because the proposed system did not use any of the additional efforts and resources.",
        "To investigate the effect of the scaling parameter of the parse tree kernel in PPI extraction, we measure how the performance changes as the decay factor varies (Figure 5).",
        "It is obvious that the decay factor influences the overall performance of PPI extraction.",
        "Especially, the F-scores of the small-scale corpora such as HPRD50 and LLL are influenced by the decay factor.",
        "The gaps between the best and worst scores in LLL and HPRD50 are 19.1% and 5.2%, respectively.",
        "The fluctuation in F-scores of the large-scale corpora (AIMed, BioInfer, IEPA) is not so extreme, which seems to stem from the abundance in syntactic and lexical forms that reduce the normalizing effect of the decay factor.",
        "The increase in the decay factor leads to the increase in the precision values of all the corpora except for LLL.",
        "The phenomenon is fairly plausible because the decreased normalization power causes the system to compute the tree similarities more intensively and therefore it classifies each instance in a strict and detailed manner.",
        "On the contrary, the recall values slightly decrease with respect to the decay factor, which indicates that the tree pruning (PT) has already conducted the normalization process to reduce the sparseness problem in each corpus.",
        "Most importantly, along with tree pruning, decay factor could boost the performance of our system by controlling the rigidness of the parse tree kernel in PPI extraction.",

        "(2) Even when using LLL or HPRD50, two smallest corpora, as training sets, our system performs well with every other corpus for testing.",
        "It indicates that our approach is much less vulnerable to the sizes of training corpora than other methods.",
        "(3) The degree of score fluctuation of our system across different testing corpora is much smaller than other regardless of the training data set.",
        "When trained on LLL, for example, the range for our system (55.9% ~ 82.1%) is smaller than the others (38.6% ~ 83.2% and 33.3% ~ 76.8%).",

        "The improvement in precision (12.8%) is most significant, especially in comparison with the work of Miwa et al., (2009b), which used multiple corpora (AIMed + IEPA) for training and combined various kernels such as bag-of-words, parse trees and graphs.",
        "It is natural that the recall value is lower since a less number of patterns (features) must have been learned.",
        "What's important is that the proposed method has a higher or at least comparable overall performance without additional resources.",
        "Our approach is significantly better than that of Airola et al., (2008), which employed two different forms of graph kernels to improve the initial model.",
        "Since they did not use multiple corpora for training, the comparison shows the direct benefit of using the extension of the kernel."
