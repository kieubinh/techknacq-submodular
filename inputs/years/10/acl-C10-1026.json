      "text": [
        "In the field of natural language processing, it is common wisdom that handwritten, rule-based models generally perform poorly on complex problems, mainly due to the knowledge acquisition bottleneck: it is hard for the human modeller to conceive of all possible scenarios the model has to cope with.",
        "In parsing, many approaches have relied on handwritten grammars, and their fragility is one of their largest weaknesses.",
        "Such models can fail due to insufficiency of lexical entries or grammatical constructions, but also due to creative or ungrammatical input.",
        "In any case, the parser should always return a reasonable output.",
        "A very simple technique is partial or fragment parsing (Kiefer et al., 1999; Riezler et al., 2001; Zhang et al., 2007a): if there is no item in the chart that both spans the complete sentence and fulfills the root condition, several chunks that do conform to a root condition are combined by minimising a certain cost function (for instance to favour larger chunks, or more probable chunks).",
        "A second problem with deep parsers is their relatively low efficiency.",
        "For online applications, it is impermissible to wait for longer than a minute before the system responds.",
        "Apart from studies that were aimed at increasing the efficiency of deep parsers by using smarter algorithms (e.g. using left-corner relations (Van Noord, 1997)), several studies in recent years have suggested that search space restriction can offer a beneficial balance between speed and accuracy as well.",
        "Techniques that have been proposed are, among others, su-pertagging (Clark and Curran, 2007), CFG filtering (Matsuzaki et al., 2007) and beam thresholding (Ninomiya et al., 2005).",
        "A potential disadvantage of the latter technique is that the unifications have taken place by the time the value of the resulting chart item is investigated.",
        "One strategy that tries to prevent execution of unlikely tasks altogether is presented by van Noord (2009).",
        "In this method, the parser learns from an unannotated corpus which parse steps contributed to the solution as preferred by the disambiguation model (as opposed to a certain gold standard).",
        "Hence, this approach is self-learning.",
        "Another study that is close to our approach to search space restriction is c-structure pruning (Cahill et al., 2008).",
        "The authors show that a large, hand-written, unification-based parser (the XLE LFG parser for English) can perform reasonably faster (18%) without losing accuracy, by not allowing the parser to unify if the resulting item will have a span that does not conform to a CFG tree that was generated from the sentence beforehand by a PCFG parser.",
        "Much better results (67% speed-up) are obtained by pruning chart items locally, based on their relative probabilities (Cahill et al., 2008).",
        "This is the approach that is closest to the one we present in this paper.",
        "In this paper, we introduce a method that addresses robustness and efficiency concurrently.",
        "The search space is restricted by setting a maximum on the number of tasks per chart cell.",
        "Because tasks are carried out according to a priority model based on the generative probabilities of the rule applications, it is unlikely that good readings are dropped.",
        "More robustness is achieved by adding radically overgenerating rules to the grammar, which could cover all sentences, given an disproportionate amount of time and memory.",
        "By strongly restricting the search space, however, the computation requirements remains within bounds.",
        "Because the robustness rules are strongly dispre-ferred by both the priority model and the disambiguation model, all sentences that would be covered by the 'restricted' grammar remain high-precision, but sentences that are not covered will get an additional push from the robustness rules.",
        "The grammar we use (Cramer and Zhang, 2009) is the combination of a hand-written, constraint-based grammar in the framework of HPSG and an open word class lexicon extracted from the Tiger treebank (Brants et al., 2002) in a deep lexical acquisition step.",
        "One of the aims of this grammar is to be precision-oriented: it tries to give detailed analyses of the German language, and reject ungrammatical sentences as much as possible.",
        "However, this precision comes at the cost of lower coverage, as we will see later in this paper.",
        "Along with the grammar, a treebank has been developed by re-parsing the Tiger treebank, and including those sentences for which the grammar was able to reproduce the original Tiger dependencies.",
        "The treebank's size is just over 25k sentences (only selected from the first 45k sentences, so they don't overlap with either the development or test set), and contains the correct HPSG derivation trees.",
        "These (projective) derivation trees will function as the training set for the statistical models we develop in this study."

      "text": [
        "The parser we employ, the PET parser (Callmeier, 2000), is an agenda-driven, bottom-up, unification-based parser.",
        "In order to reduce computational demands, state-of-the-art techniques such as subsumption-based packing (Oepen and Carroll, 2000) and the quasi-destructive unification operator (Tomabechi, 1991) have been implemented.",
        "A central component in the parser is the agenda, implemented as a priority queue of parsing tasks (unifications).",
        "Tasks are popped from the agenda, until no task is left, after which all passive items spanning the complete sentence are compared with the root conditions as specified by the grammar writer.",
        "The best parse is extracted from the parse forest by a Maximum Entropy parse disambiguation model (Toutanova et al., 2002), using selective unpacking (Zhang et al., 2007b).",

        "Passive items are 'normal' chart items, in the sense that they can freely combine with other items.",
        "Active items still need to combine with a passive item to be complete.",

        "Each time a task succeeds, the following happens:",
        "• For each inserted passive item, add (rule+passive) tasks that combine the passive item with each of the rules, and add (active+passive) tasks that combine with each of the neighbouring active items.",

        "The priorities of the parsing tasks are calculated based on a generative PCFG model extracted from the treebank by maximum likelihood estimation, smoothed by Lidstone smoothing.",
        "Each passive chart item receives a score based on its generative probability, calculated as the product of all applied rule probabilities.",
        "For active parsing items, we set the score to be the upper bound of this generative probability, if the item succeeds later in combining with other passive edge(s) to build a complete subtree.",
        "Lhis is done by simply assuming the undetermined subtree in the active item receiving a generative score of 1.",
        "Lhe priorities that are assigned to both types of tasks are not yet conditioned on the probability of the topmost rule application.",
        "Hence, they are computed using the following simple formula:",
        "where Pr is the task's priority, p(R) the prior probability of the rule category R; and p{P) is the highest possible generative probability of the resulting passive item P.",
        "It is a natural thought to allocate more computational resources to longer sentences, and this is exactly what happens in the restriction strategies we develop in this study.",
        "We define a cap on the number of tasks for a certain cell/span (i, j), which means that the number of cells is quadratically related to the number of words in a sentence: riceiu = n{n + l)/2.",
        "We define three task restriction strategies: all, success, and passive.",
        "In all, the cap is defined for all tasks, whether the unification is successful or not.",
        "Success only counts tasks that are successful (i.e. lead to either an active or a passive item), and passive only counts tasks that lead to a passive item.",
        "In all strategies, morphological and lexical tasks are not counted, and hence not restricted.",
        "Unary phrasal rules (such as empty-det) are counted, though.",
        "Lhe implementation uses only one priority queue.",
        "Each time a task is popped from the agenda, it is checked whether the limit for this span has been reached or not.",

        "As expected, for all strategies it holds that longer computation times lead to higher coverage numbers.",
        "The interesting thing is that the restriction of the search space doesn't affect the parses' precision, indicating that the priorities work well: the tasks leading to good solutions are indeed given high priority scores.",
        "A striking observation is that the coverage numbers go up by about 1%, with reductions in parse times of more than 80%.",
        "This is due to the use of the timeout, and the generic tendency of our definition of the priorities: because less rule applications lead to higher log probabilities, the agenda will favour tasks with smaller span size.",
        "If the agenda doesn't apply too strong a restriction on those tasks, the parser might not create any items spanning the whole sentence after the full 60 seconds, and hence produce no parse.",
        "This is mitigated by stronger restriction, leading to a quicker path upwards in the chart.",
        "No large differences of success are found between the different strategies.",
        "The intuition behind the success and passive strategies was that only more effort should be invested into a particular span if not enough chart items for that span have been created.",
        "However, the time/quality trade-offs are very similar for all strategies, as shown in figure 2.",
        "The strategies we have reported on have one thing in common: their counters are with respect to one particular span, and therefore, they have a very local scope.",
        "We have tried other strategies that would give the algorithm more flexibility by defining the caps on more global scale, for instance per span length or for the entire chart.",

        "For handwritten deep parsers, efficiency and coverage are often competing factors: allowing more items to be created might be beneficial for recall, but the parser will also be too slow.",
        "However, because the search space can be restricted so rigidly, we can make the grammar more permissive to accept more sentences, hopefully without a heavy efficiency penalty.",
        "One way to do this is to remove constraints from the grammar rules.",
        "However, that would infringe on the precision-oriented nature of the grammar.",
        "Instead, we will keep the normal grammar rules as they are, and create a small number of additional, super-accepting robustness rules.",
        "The intuition is that when the restricted part of the grammar can find a solution, that solution will indeed be found, and preferred by the statistical models.",
        "On the other hand, when the sentence is extragrammatical, the robustness rules may be able to overcome the barriers.",
        "Let's consider the following example, assuming that the grammar only lists 'to run' as an intransitive verb:",
        "'John ran the marathon yesterday'",
        "A fragment approach would come up with the following solution:",
        "John ran the marathon yesterday",
        "'John' will correctly be identified as the subject of 'ran', but that is all.",
        "No dependencies are established between 'the marathon' and 'ran', or 'yesterday' and 'ran'.",
        "The former is hard to establish, because of the missing lexical item.",
        "However, the latter should be doable: the lexicon knows that 'yesterday' is an adverb that modifies verbs.",
        "If we could create a robustness rule that would absorb the object ('the marathon') without assigning a dependency, it would at least be able to identify the modifier dependency between 'ran' and 'yesterday'.",
        "In other words, a fragment analysis solely combines items at the top level, whereas a robust parser would ideally be able to overcome barriers in both the lower and the higher regions of the chart, meaning that the damage can be localised and thus minimised.",
        "The robustness rules we propose are intended to achieve that.",
        "How does this idea interact with the restriction mechanism explained in the previous section?",
        "Robustness rules get an inhibitively large, constant penalty in both the priority model and the disambiguation model.",
        "That means that at first the parser will try to build the parse forest with the restricted set of rules, because tasks involving subtrees with only rules from the standard grammar will always have a higher priority than tasks using an item with a robustness rule application in its subtree.",
        "When this is finished, the robustness rules try to fill the gaps.",
        "Especially in the success and passive strategies, tasks with robustness rules are discarded if already enough chart items are found for a particular span, meaning that the parser automatically focusses on those parts of the chart that haven't been filled before.",
        "Defining robustness rules is a sort of grammar engineering, and it took a bit of experimentation to find rules that worked well.",
        "One of the factors was the interaction between the subsumption-based packing and the robustness rules.",
        "When the chart is built up, items that are subsumed by an existing item are marked as 'frozen', and the latter (more general) item functions as the representative node in the remainder of the parsing process.",
        "When unpacking the best solution, the best derivation tree is extracted from the packed forest, which might include a frozen node.",
        "Because this frozen node has more constraints than its representative, this derivation tree is not guaranteed to be free of unification failures, and hence, before outputting, this is checked by replaying all the unifications in the derivation tree.",
        "This procedure is repeated until a sound derivation has been found.",
        "So what happens when the representative nodes are very general?",
        "Many nodes will be packed, and hence the chart will remain compact.",
        "However, the unpacking process will become problematic, because many of the proposed derivation trees during unpacking will be incorrect, leading to excessive computation times (in the order of minutes).",
        "Therefore, we chose to define robustness rules such, that the resulting chart items will be equally constrained as their daughters.",

        "Also, it can be seen that the +V pair of rules is more effective than +NV to increase coverage.",

        "Although the experiments were carried out on a specific grammar framework, we consider the techniques put forward in this paper to be applicable to other linguistic frameworks.",
        "The robustness rules are easy to construct (with the precautions from section 3.1 in mind), and all modern deep parsers have a treebank to their disposal, from which the generative model can be learned.",
        "There are still points that can be improved on.",
        "Currently, there is no way to determine which of the robust rule applications are more promising than others, and the decision to try one before the other is solely based on the the probabilities of the passive items, and not on the generative model.",
        "This can be inefficient: for instance, all robustness rules presented in this paper (both +V and +NV) requires the main daughter to be a verb.",
        "It would be straightforward to learn from a small treebank that trying to unify the main daughter of a robustness rules (which should have a verbal head) with a specifier-head rule application does not have a high chance on succeeding.",
        "Another possible improvement is to differentiate between different robustness rules.",
        "We presented a two-tier system here, but the framework lends itself naturally to more layers with differing degrees of specificity, creating a smoother scale from specific/prioritised to robust/non-prioritised."
