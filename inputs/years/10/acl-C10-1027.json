        "Important improvements are yet to come regarding the performance of Statistical Machine Translation systems.",
        "Dependence on training data and limited modelling expressiveness are the focus of many research efforts, such as using monolingual corpora for the former and syntactic models for the latter.",
        "Another promising approach consists in exploiting complementary sources of information in order to build better translations, as done by consensus-based system combination (e.g. (Ma-tusov et al., 2008)).",
        "This, however, requires to have several systems available for the same language pair.",
        "Considering that the same training data would be available to all systems, differences in translation modelling are expected to produce redundant and complementary hypotheses.",
        "Mul-tisource translation (e.g. (Och and Ney, 2001; Schwartz, 2008)) is a variant, involving source texts available in several languages which can be translated by systems for different language pairs and whose outputs can be successfully combined into better translations (Schroeder et al., 2009).",
        "One theoretical expectation of multisource translation is that it can successfully reduce ambiguity of the original source text, but does so under the rare conditions of availability of existing (accurate) translations.",
        "In contrast, pivot-based system combination (e.g. (Utiyama and Isahara, 2007; Wu and Wang, 2007)) aims at compensating the lack of training data for a given language pair by producing translation hypotheses obtained by pivoting via an intermediary language for which better systems are available.",
        "These techniques generally produce a search space that differs from that of the direct translation systems.",
        "As such, they create a new translation system out of various systems for which diagnosis becomes more difficult.",
        "This paper instead focusses on improving a single system, which should be state-of-the-art as regards data and models.",
        "We propose a framework in which information coming from external sources is used to boost lexical choices and guide the decoder into making more informed choices.",
        "!We performed initial experiments where the complementary information was exploited during n-best list rerank-ing (Max et al., 2010), but except for the multisource condition the list of hypotheses contained too little useful variation",
        "Complementary sources can be of different nature: they can involve other automatic systems (for the same or different language pairs) and/or human knowledge.",
        "Furthermore, complementary information is injected at the lexical level, thus making targeted fine-grained lexical predictions useful.",
        "Importantly, those predictions are exploited at the sentence level, so as to allow for efficient use of source contextual information.",
        "The second contribution of this paper is an instantiation of the proposed framework.",
        "Automatically pivoting via auxiliary languages is used to make complementary predictions that are exploited through language model adaptation by the decoder for a given language pair.",
        "For this apparently difficult condition, where predictions result from automatic translations involving two systems, we manage to report significant improvements, measured with respect to the target and the source text, under various configurations.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "We first review related work in section 2.1, and describe the distinctive characteristics of our approach in Section 2.2.",
        "Section 2.3 presents our instantiation of the framework based on lexical boosting via auxiliary language triangulation.",
        "Experiments involving three language pairs of various complexity and different amounts of training data are described in Section 3.",

        "The idea of using more than one translation system to improve translation performance is not new and has been implemented in many different ways which we briefly review here.",
        "System combination An often used strategy consists in combining the output of several systems for a fixed language pair, and to rescore the resulting set of hypotheses taking into account all the available translations and scores.",
        "Various",
        "to lead to measurable improvements.",
        "proposals have been made to efficiently perform such a combination, using auxiliary data structures such as n-best lists, word lattices or consensus networks (see for instance (Kumar and Byrne, 2004; Rosti et al., 2007; Matusov et al., 2008; Hildebrand and Vogel, 2008; Tromble et al., 2008)).",
        "Theses techniques have proven extremely effective and have allowed to deliver very significant gains in several recent evaluation campaigns (Callison-Burch et al., 2008).",
        "Multisource translation A related, yet more resourceful approach, consists in trying to combine several systems providing translations from different sources into the same target, provided such multilingual sources are available.",
        "(Och and Ney, 2001) propose to select the most promising translation amongst the hypotheses produced by several Foreign – English systems, where output selection is based on the translation scores.",
        "The intuition that if a system assigns a high figure of merits to the translation of a particular sentence, then this translation should be preferred, is implemented in the MAX combination heuristics, whose relative (lack of) success is discussed in (Schwartz, 2008).",
        "A similar idea is explored in (Nomoto, 2004), where the sole target language model score is used to rank competing outputs.",
        "(Schroeder et al., 2009) propose to combine the available sources prior to translation, under the form of a multilingual lattice, which is decoded with a multisource phrase table.",
        "(Chen et al., 2008) integrate the available auxiliary information in a different manner, and discuss how to improve the translation model of the primary system: the idea is to use the entries in the phrase table of the auxiliary system to filter out those accidental correspondences that pollute the main translation model.",
        "The most effective implementation of multisource translation to date however consists in using mono-source system combination techniques (Schroeder et al., 2009).",
        "Translation through pivoting The use of auxiliary systems has also been proposed in another common situation, as a possible remedy to the lack of parallel data for a particular language pair, or for a particular domain.",
        "Assume, for instance, that one wishes to build a translation system for the pair A – B, for which the parallel data is sparse; assuming further that such parallel resources exist for pairs A – C and for C – B, it is then tempting to perform the translation indirectly through pivoting, by first translating from A to C, then from C to B.",
        "Direct implementations of this idea are discussed e.g. in (Utiyama and Isahara, 2007).",
        "Pivoting can also intervene earlier in the process, for instance as a means to automatically generate the missing parallel resource, an idea that has also been considered to adapt an existing translation systems to new domains (Bertoldi and Federico, 2009).",
        "Pivoting can finally be used to fix or improve the translation model: (Cohn and Lapata, 2007) augments the phrase table for a baseline bilingual system with supplementary phrases obtained by pivoting into a third language.",
        "Triangulation in translation Triangulation techniques are somewhat more general and only require the availabily of one auxiliary system (or one auxiliary parallel corpus).",
        "For instance, the authors of (Chen et al., 2008) propose to use the translation model of an auxiliary C – B system to filter-out the phrase-table of a primary A – B system.",
        "As in other works, we propose to make use of several MT systems (of any type) to improve translation performance, but contrarily to these works we concentrate on improving one particular system.",
        "Our framework is illustrated on Figure 1.",
        "The main system (henceforth, direct system), corresponding to configuration 1, is a SMT system, translating from German to English in the example.",
        "Auxiliary information may originate from various sources (2-6) and enter into the decoder.",
        "A new model is dynamically built and is used to guide the exploration of the search space to the best hypothesis.",
        "Several auxiliary models can be used at once and can be weighted by standard optimization techniques using development data, so that bad sources are not used in practice, or by exploiting a priori information.",
        "In the implementation described in section 2.3, this information is updated by the auxiliary source at each sentence.",
        "We now briefly describe various possible configurations to make some links to previous works explicit.",
        "Configuration 2 translates the same source text by means of another system for the same language pair, as would be done in system combination, except that here a new complete decoding is performed by the direct system.",
        "Configuration 3, which will be detailed in section 2.3, uses translations obtained by triangulating via an auxiliary language (Spanish in the example).",
        "Using this two-step translation is common to pivot approaches, but our approach is different in that the result of the triangulation is only used as auxiliary information for the decoding of the direct system.",
        "Configurations 4 and 5 are instances of multisource translation, where a paraphrase or a translation of the source text is available.",
        "Lastly, configuration 6 illustrates the case where a human translator, with knowledge of the target language and at least of one of the available source languages, could influence the decoding by providing desired words (e.g. only for source words or phrases that would be judged difficult to translate).",
        "This human supervision through a feedback text in real time is similar to the proposal of (Dymetman et al., 2003).",
        "Given this framework, several questions arise,",
        "knowledge in this framework.",
        "the most important underlying this work being whether the performance of SMT systems can be improved by using other SMT systems.",
        "Another point of interest is whether improvements made to auxiliary systems can yield improvement to the direct system, without the latter undergoing any modification.",
        "Auxiliary translations obtained by pivoting can be viewed as a source of adaptation data for the target language model of the direct system.",
        "Assuming we have computed n-best translation hypotheses of a sentence in the target language, we can then boost the likeliness of the words and phrases occurring in these hypotheses by deriving an auxiliary language model for each test sentence.",
        "This allows us to integrate this auxiliary information during the search and thus provides a tighter integration with the direct system.",
        "This idea has successfully been used in speech recognition, using for instance close captions (Placeway and Laf-ferty, 1996) or an imperfect translation (Paulik et al., 2005) to provide auxiliary in-domain adaptation data for the recognizer's language model.",
        "(Simard and Isabelle, 2009) proposed a similar approach in Machine Translation in which they use the target-side of an exact match in a translation memory to build language models on a per sentence basis used in their decoder.",
        "This strategy can be implemented in a straightforward manner, by simply training a language model using the n-best list as an adaptation corpus.",
        "Being automatically generated, hypotheses in the n-best list are not entirely reliable: in particular, they may contain very unlikely target sequences at the junction of two segments.",
        "It is however straightforward to filter these out using the available phrase alignment information.",
        "This configuration is illustrated on Figure 2: the direct system (configuration 1) makes use of predictions from pivoting through an auxiliary language (configuration 2), where n-best lists can be used to produce several hypotheses.",
        "In order to get a upper bound on the potential gains of this approach, we can run the artificial experiment (configuration 3) where a reference in the target language is used as a \"perfect\" source of information.",
        "Furthermore, we are interested in the performance of the simple pivot system alone (configuration 4), as it gives an indication of the quality of the data used for LM adaptation.",

        "In this study, we used our own machine translation engine, which implements the n-gram-based approach to statistical machine translation (Marino et al., 2006).",
        "The translation model is implemented as a stochastic finite-state transducer trained using a n-gram language model of (source,target) pairs.",
        "In addition to a bilingual n-gram model, our SMT system uses six additional models which are linearly combined following a discriminative modeling framework: two lexicalized reordering (Tillmann, 2004) models,a target-language model, two lexicon models, a 'weak' distance-based distortion model, a word bonus model and a translation unit bonus model.",
        "Coefficients in this linear combination are tuned over development data with the MERT optimization toolkit, slightly modified to use our decoder's n-best lists.",
        "For this study, we used 3-gram bilingual and 3-gram target language models built using modified Kneser-Ney smoothing (Chen and Goodman, 1996); model estimation was performed with the SRI language modeling toolkit.",
        "Target language models were trained on the target side of the bitext corpora.",
        "After preprocessing the corpora with standard tokenization tools, word-to-word alignments are performed in both directions, source-to-target and target-to-source.",

        "Then, the grow-diag-final-and heuristic is used to obtain the final alignments from which translation units are extracted.",
        "Convergent studies have showed that systems built according to these principles typically achieve a performance comparable to that of the widely used Moses phrase-based system for the language pairs under study.",
        "We have used the Europarl corpus for our main and auxiliary languages.",

        "This will allow us to check whether the improvements provided by our method carry over even in situations where the baseline is strong; conversely, it will allow us to assess whether the proposed techniques are applicable when the baseline is average or poor.",
        "In order to measure the contribution of each of the auxiliary languages we used a subset of the training corpus that is common to all language pairs, hereinafter referred to as the intersection data condition.",
        "We used the English side of all training language pairs to collect the same sentences in all languages, summing up to 320, 304 sentence pairs.",
        "Some statistics on the data used in this study are reported in Table 1.",
        "Finally, in order to assess the impact of the training data size over the results obtained, we also considered a much more challenging condition for the fr – de pair, where we used the entire Europarl data (V5) made available for the fifth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation for training, and test our system on out-of-domain news data.",
        "The training corpus in this condition contains 43.6M French words and 37.2M German words.",
        "Development and test data for the first condition (intersection) were obtained by leaving out respectively 500 and 1000 sentences from the common subset (same sentences for all languages), while the first 500 sentences of news-test2008 and the entire newstest2009 official test sets were used for the full data condition.",

        "The fact that low quality sources such as pivot translation can provide useful complementary information calls for a better understanding of the phenomena at play.",
        "It is very likely that, looking at our results on the contribution of auxiliary languages, improving the quality of an auxiliary source can also be achieved by identifying what a source is good for.",
        "For example, in the studied language configurations predictions of translations for pronouns in the source text by auxiliary triangulation does not give access to useful information.",
        "On the contrary, triangulation with Greek when translating from French to English seems to give useful information regarding the translation of adjectives, a result which was quite unexpected.",
        "Also, it would be interesting to use richer predictions than short n-grams, such as syntactic dependencies, but this would require significant changes on the decoders used.",
        "Using dynamic models at the discourse level rather than only at the sentence level would also be a useful improvement.",
        "Besides the improvements just mentioned, our future work includes working on several configurations of the framework described in section 2.2, in particular investigating the new type of system combination."
