        "Acquiring and understanding semantic relationships is crucial for many NLP applications.",
        "In many cases, we would like to know if a given term pair participates in a specified semantic relationship or if two different term pairs encode the same (possibly unspecified) type of relationship.",
        "Beyond the well-known major relationship types such as hyponymy (is-a) and meronymy (part-of), there is a huge number of other relationships between objects and concepts.",
        "Examples include general relations such as larger-than, contained-in, liked-by and domain specific ones such as country-language, product-manufacturer, product-seller, drug-disease etc.",
        "The vast majority of NLP research is done in a few languages for which extensive corpora (including the web) are available.",
        "As a result, most relationship retrieval studies and lexical database compilation efforts target only a few languages.",
        "However, due to the substantial growth of the multilingual web and a growing demand for NLP application coverage for less common languages, there is a need for relationship data in many less studied languages.",
        "In this paper we address the task of translating relationships between languages, which has two obvious benefits.",
        "First, it can directly help applications such as machine translation, cross-lingual information retrieval, cross-lingual web mining and the construction and enrichment of semantic databases.",
        "Second, it can assist applications in a single language, especially when compensating for a relative scarcity of resources in that language.",
        "We focus on relations between two entities, which are the most common type.",
        "When discussing the translation of relationships, it is important to define how these are represented and in what way the task differs from MT.",
        "While there is wide agreement on the definition and representation of major relationship types such as hypernymy and (to a lesser extent) meronymy, there is no single accepted method (or resources) for other less common relationships.",
        "Among the methods that have been proposed for specifying lexical relationships are natural language description and rules (Girju et al., 2007), distributional means (Turney, 2005), sample term pairs (Pa≈üca et al., 2006), relationship instances (Banko et al., 2007) and pattern clusters (Davi-dov and Rappoport, 2008a).",
        "In this paper we utilize the last definition.",
        "Following (Davidov and Rappoport, 2008a) each semantic relationship can be defined and represented by a set of lexical patterns such that the represented relation holds between entities filling the patterns' slots.",
        "We focus on pattern clusters relationship definition due to several reasons.",
        "First, as opposed to natural language descriptions, pattern clusters are formal.",
        "Second, as opposed to the other methods above, pattern clusters provide a 'generative' model for the represented relationship - it is possible to obtain from them relationship instances and term pairs, as we indeed utilize in this paper.",
        "Third, pattern clusters can be mined in a fully unsupervised manner, or in a focused manner when the relationship desired is known.",
        "Finally, pattern methods have proven to be highly efficient and effective for lexical acquisition tasks (Pantel et al., 2004; Davidov and Rap-poport, 2006).",
        "The proposed framework comprises the following stages.",
        "First, given a set of patterns defining a relationship in a source language, we obtain from the web a set of corresponding term pairs.",
        "Next, for each of the terms in the obtained term pairs, we retrieve sets of their translations to the target language using available multilingual dictionaries.",
        "Now that we have a set of translations for each term in each pair, we retrieve search engine snippets with the translated term pairs.",
        "We then select appropriate word senses using web counts, and extract a set of patterns which connect these disambiguated terms.",
        "As a result we get a set of relation-specific target language patterns, effectively obtaining the desired relationship definition.",
        "We can optionally use the retrieved pattern sets to obtain term pairs of target language relationships from the web.",
        "We performed a thorough evaluation for various relationships involving 11 languages.",
        "We tested our framework on major relationships like meronymy, specific relationships like country-capital and unspecified unsupervisedly discovered English relationships.",
        "The obtained relationships were manually verified by human judges using cross-lingual SAT analogy questions, and a few specific factual relationships were evaluated using a gold standard.",
        "Our main contribution is a novel framework for automated relationship translation across languages, where relationships are defined as pattern clusters or as term pairs.",
        "This framework allows fully automated cross-lingual relationship mining and construction of multilingual pattern dictionaries without relying on parallel corpora.",
        "In Section 2 we discuss related work.",
        "Section 3 details the algorithm.",
        "Section 4 describes the evaluation, and Section 5 concludes."

        "Recently, with the development of practical applications which utilize WN-like databases in dozens of languages, great effort has been made to manually construct and interconnect such databases for different languages (Pease et al., 2008; Charoen-porn et al., 2007).",
        "Some studies (e.g., (Amasyali, 2005)) use semi-automated methods based on language-specific heuristics and dictionaries.",
        "At the same time, much work has been done on automated lexical acquisition for a single language, and in particular, on the web-based acquisition of various types of semantic relationships.",
        "There is a substantial amount of related studies which deal with the discovery of various relationship types represented in useful resources such as WordNet, including hypernymy (Pantel et al., 2004; Snow et al., 2006), synonymy (Davidov and Rappoport, 2006; Widdows and Dorow, 2002) and meronymy (Berland and Char-niak, 1999; Girju et al., 2006).",
        "Since named entities are very important in NLP, many studies define and discover relations between named entities (Hassan et al., 2006).",
        "Work was also done on relations between verbs (Chklovski and Pan-tel, 2004).",
        "There is growing research on relations between nominals (Girju et al., 2007).",
        "While the majority of studies focus on extracting pre-specified semantic relationships, several recent studies were done on the automated discovery of unspecified relationship types.",
        "Thus Tur-ney (2006) provided a pattern distance measure that allows a fully unsupervised measurement of relational similarity between two pairs of words on the same language.",
        "Banko et al.",
        "(2007) and Rosenfeld and Feldman (2007) find relationship instances where the relationships are not specified in advance.",
        "(Davidov and Rappoport, 2008a) introduced the idea that salient semantic relationships can be defined as pattern clusters, confirming it with SAT analogy test.",
        "As explained above, we use this definition in the present study.",
        "We also use pattern clusters given by (Davidov and Rappoport, 2008a) as input in our evaluation.",
        "Most of the relationship acquisition studies were done in a single language.",
        "Those that experiment in several languages usually treat each language separately, while we extract a relationship definition for one language using the provided definition for the other language.",
        "Our study is related to cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) frameworks.",
        "Both deal with multilingual information extracted from the Web.",
        "However, the majority of CLIR studies pursue different targets.",
        "Thus, one of the main CLIR goals is the retrieval of documents based on explicit queries, when the document language is not the query language (Volk and Buitelaar, 2002).",
        "These frameworks usually develop language-specific tools and algorithms including parsers, taggers and morphology analyzers in order to integrate multilingual queries and documents (Jagarlamudi and Kumaran, 2007).",
        "Our goal is to develop and evaluate a language-independent algorithm for the cross-lingual translation of relationship-defining structures.",
        "While our targets are different from those ofCLIR, CLIR systems can greatly benefit from our framework, since we can translate the relationships in CLIR queries and subsequently check if the same relationships are present in the retrieved documents.",
        "Another field indirectly related to our research is Machine translation (MT).",
        "Many MT tasks require automated creation or improvement of dictionaries (Koehn and Knight, 2001).",
        "However, MT mainly deals with translation and disambiguation of words at the sentence or document level, while we translate relationship structures as a set of patterns, defined independently of contexts.",
        "We also perform pattern-set to pattern-set translation rather than the pattern-to-pattern or pair-to-pair translation commonly explored in MT studies.",
        "This makes it difficult to perform meaningful comparison to existing MT frameworks.",
        "However, the MT studies benefit from the proposed framework by enhancement and verification of translated relationship instances.",
        "In (Davidov and Rappoport, 2009), we proposed a framework for automated cross-lingual concept mining.",
        "We incorporate several principles from this study including concept extension and disambiguation of query language (See Section 3.3).",
        "However our goals here are different since we target cross-lingual acquisition of relationship structures rather then concept term lists."

        "Our framework has the following stages: (1) given a set of patterns in a source language defining some lexical relationship, we use the web to obtain source language term pairs participating in this relationship; (2) we automatically translate the obtained terms in each pair to the target language using available multilingual dictionaries; (3) we retrieve web snippets where these translations co-appear, disambiguating translations with web counts and extracting the corresponding patterns.",
        "As an optional final stage, the translated pattern cluster can be used to extract and extend a set of target language term pairs.",
        "Now we describe each of these stages in detail.",
        "We are provided with a pattern cluster, a set of patterns representing a specific lexical relationship in some language.",
        "The goal of the first stage is to discover the most representative term pairs for this cluster and language from the web.",
        "If the relationship is already specified by a representative set of term pairs, we skip this stage and continue to the next stage.",
        "Note that the method described below can also be used at the final stage to obtain representative target language term pairs once we obtain a target language pattern cluster.",
        "The input lexical patterns are surface patterns which include several fixed words or punctuation symbols and two slots for content words, e.g. \"the [X] of the [Y],\".",
        "Given a cluster of patterns defining a semantic relationship, we would like to obtain from the web the most representative and frequent examples of the represented relationship.",
        "In order to do that we construct search engine queries from the given patterns using wildcard symbols to represent pattern slots.",
        "For example, given a pattern \"the [X] ofthe [Y] \" we construct queries such as \"the * of the\"; \"the * * of the\".",
        "We collect all the retrieved search engine snippets and extract the appropriate term pairs found in these snippets.",
        "Now we would like to select the most useful of the extracted pairs.",
        "Since the obtained pairs are only useful if we can translate them into the target language, we dismiss all pairs in which one or both terms have no translations to the target language in our dictionaries (see Section 3.2).",
        "Since each particular pattern can be ambiguous, we also dismiss pairs which were found for only a single pattern in the given cluster.",
        "For the remaining term pairs we would like to estimate their speciicity for the given pattern cluster.",
        "For each pattern, we retrieve and use two web hit counts: Fterms(p, T1, T2), a hit count for co-appearance of the pair in a way similar to that in the pattern, and Fall(p, T 1,T2), the hit count of the full pattern instance.",
        "For example, if for the pattern p=\"the * of the\" we obtain a term pair (CEO, company), then Faii(p)=Hits(\"the CEO of the company\") and Fterms(CEO, company) = Hits(\"CEO * * company\").",
        "Given a pattern cluster C with patterns (pi-- -pn] S C, we estimate the specificity of a term pair (T1, T2) using the following simple probabilistic metric, giving to all patterns in the cluster an equal weight:",
        "We select the top 15 pairs with the highest speci-icity and use them in the next stage.",
        "After the previous stage we have a good representative set of term pairs for the desired source language relationship.",
        "Now we would like to translate the words in these pairs to the target language.",
        "In order to do that we use an extensive set of 1067 multilingual dictionaries developed for Star-Dict, including Wikipedia cross-language links and Wiktionary.",
        "For each term we obtain a set of its translations to the target language.",
        "If we get more than ive different translations, we select the ive having the highest number of dictionaries where this translation appears.",
        "As discussed in Section 3.1, we dismissed terms for which no translation was found in any of the available dictionaries, so each term in each of the obtained pairs has at least a single translation to the target language.",
        "However, in many cases the available translations represent the wrong word sense, since both the source terms and their translations can be ambiguous.",
        "Thus at this stage many of the obtained term translations are irrelevant for the given relationship and require disambiguation.",
        "For this stage, we need to restrict web mining to speciic target languages.",
        "This restriction is straightforward if the alphabet or term translations are language-specific or if the search API supports restriction to this language.",
        "In case where there is no such natural restrictions, we attempt to detect and add to our queries a few language-speciic frequent words.",
        "Following (Davidov and Rappoport, 2009), we use our dictionaries to find 1-3 of the 15 most frequent words in a desired language that are unique to that language and 'and' them with the queries to ensure proper language selection.",
        "This allows applying our algorithm to more than 60 diverse languages.",
        "The only data required for each language is at least a partial coverage of the obtained term pairs by some available dictionary.",
        "Given a term pair (T 1,T2) we obtain a set of translations (Tl'ie1^n, T2je1_m).",
        "For each combination Tli, T2j of the obtained term translations, we construct and execute the following four queries: (\"Tli * T2j\", \"T2j * Tli\", \"Tli * * T2j\", \"T2j * * Tli\"].",
        "Since Yahoo!Boss allows retrieval of up to the l000 irst results, we can collect up to four thousand snippets for each combination.",
        "However, the majority of these combinations return no snippets at all, effectively generating an average of a dozen snippets per query.",
        "Now for each pair of term translations we would like to extract from the snippets all surface patterns which connect the terms in this pair.",
        "We use the basic two-slot meta-pattern type:",
        "X and Y should be the translated terms, Infix may contain punctuation, spaces, and up to four words (or up to eight symbols in languages without space-separated words like Chinese).",
        "Prefix and Postix are limited to contain one or zero punctuation characters and/or up to two words.",

        "Let Sk be the union set of all patterns obtained for all combinations of the extracted translations for a speciic source language term pair k G l.K .Let Salience(p) = K \\{k\\p G Sk ]| be the portion of source language term pairs which lead to detection of the target language pattern p. We compute salience for each pattern, and select a subset of salient patterns, deined to be those whose Salience exceeds a predefined threshold (we used l/3).",
        "If one salient pattern is a substring of another salient pattern, we only select the longer one.",
        "In our salience estimation we mix data from all combinations of translations including incorrect senses and wrong translations of ambiguous terms.",
        "Now we would like to select a single correct target language pair for each source language pair in order to ind more reined relationship representing patterns.",
        "For each source language term pair, we select the target language translated pair which captured the highest number of salient patterns.",
        "In case there are several pairs with the same number of salient patterns, we select a pair with the greatest web hit count.",
        "We drop term pairs with zero salient patterns.",
        "Finally we would like to enhance the obtained set of salient patterns with more precise and representative relationship-speciic patterns.",
        "Since we disambiguated the translated pairs, target language patterns captured by the remaining term pairs should be more trusted.",
        "We compare the target language pattern sets obtained for different remaining term pairs, and collect all patterns that were captured by at least three different term pairs.",
        "As before, if one pattern is a substring of another we retain only the longer one.",
        "As a result we get a comprehensive target language pattern cluster for the desired relationship.",
        "As an optional inal stage, we can utilize the retrieved target language pattern clusters in order to discover target language term pairs for the desired relationship.",
        "We do this by utilizing the strategy described in Section 3.1 on the obtained target language pattern clusters.",
        "We do not dismiss obtained terms having no available dictionary translations, and we do not limit our search to the 15 terms with highest speciicity.",

        "To do that, we used both manual cross-lingual analogy-based correctness evaluation and evaluation based of factual data.",
        "One of the main goals in this research was to provide a fully automated and flexible framework, which requires minimal modiications when applied to different languages and relationships.",
        "We examined an extensive set of target languages using English as a source language.",

        "Note that our framework allows two ways of specifying a source language relationship - a pattern cluster and a set of term pairs.",
        "In our Generic evaluation setting, we utilized as input a random sample of 15 automatically discovered relationship deinitions.",

        "Each of these clusters is assumed to represent a distinct semantic relationship.",
        "We randomly selected 15 pattern clusters from this set and executed our framework on these clusters to obtain the corresponding target language pattern clusters for each of the 11 tested languages.",
        "An example of a partial set of patterns in a cluster is: 'this [X] was kept in [Y], \";'the X that he kept in [Y],\";'the [X] in the [Y] and\";'the [Y] containing the[X]\"....",
        "We then used the term pair selection algorithm described in Section 3.1 to select the most spe-ciic term pair for each of the 15 source language clusters and 10 pairs for each ofthe corresponding translated target language clusters.",
        "Thus for each of the 15 pattern clusters and for each of the 11 languages we produced a single source language term pair and up to 10 corresponding target language term pairs.",
        "In order to check the correctness of translation of an unspeciied semantic relationship we need to compare source and target language relationships.",
        "Comparison of relationships is a challenging task, since there are no relationship resources for most relationship types even in a single language, and certainly so for their translations across languages.",
        "Thus various studies deine and split generic relationships differently even when describing relatively restricted relationship domains (e.g., relationships holding between parts of noun phrases (Nastase and Sz-pakowicz, 2003; Moldovan et al., 2004)).",
        "In order to compare generic relationships we used a manual cross-lingual SAT-like analogy human judgment evaluation.",
        "This allowed us to assess the quality of the translated pattern clusters, in a similar way as (Davidov and Rappoport, 2008a) did for testing clusters in a single language.",
        "For each of the 15 clusters we constructed a cross-lingual analogy question in the following manner.",
        "The header of the question was a term pair obtained for the source language pattern cluster.",
        "The six multiple choice items included: (1) one of the 10 discovered translated term pairs of the same cluster (the 'correct' answer); (2) three of the translated pairs of the other clusters among the 15; (3) a pair constructed by randomly selecting terms from different translated clusters; (4) the 6th option states that either the given options include broken words or incorrect language, or none of the presented pairs even remotely exemplifies the relationship in question.",
