        "Coreference resolution is a classic NLP problem and has been studied extensively by many researchers.",
        "Most existing studies, however, are generic in the sense that they are not focused on any specific text.",
        "In the past few years, opinion mining became a popular topic of research because of a wide range of applications.",
        "However, limited work has been done on coreference resolution in opinionated text.",
        "In this paper, we deal with object and attribute coreference resolution.",
        "Such coreference resolutions are important because without solving it a great deal of opinion information will be lost, and opinions may be assigned to wrong entities.",
        "We show that some important features related to opinions can be exploited to perform the task more accurately.",
        "Experimental results using blog posts demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique."

        "Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Ku et al., 2006; Mei et al., 2007; Titov and McDonald 2008).",
        "Here attributes mean different aspects of an object that has been commented on.",
        "Let us use the following example blog to illustrate the problem: \"I bought a Canon S500 camera yesterday.",
        "It looked beautiful.",
        "I took a few photos last night.",
        "They were amazing\".",
        "\"It\" in the second sentence refers to \"Canon S500 camera\", which is called an object.",
        "\"They\" in the fourth sentence refers to \"photos\", which is called an attribute of the object \"Canon S500 camera\".",
        "The usefulness of coreference resolution in this case is clear.",
        "Without resolving them, we lose opinions.",
        "That is, although we know that the second and fourth sentences express opinions, we do not know on what.",
        "Without knowing the opinion target, the opinion is of limited use.",
        "In (Nicolov et al., 2008), it was shown based on manually annotated data that opinion mining results can be improved by 10% if coreference resolution is used (the paper did not provide an algorithm).",
        "In this paper, we propose the problem of object and attribute coreference resolution - the task of determining which mentions of objects and attributes refer to the same entities.",
        "Note that here entities refer to both objects and attributes, not the traditional named entities.",
        "To our knowledge, limited work has been done on this problem in the opinion mining context apart from a prior study on resolving opinion sources (or holders) (Stoyanov and Cardie 2006).",
        "Opinion sources or holders are the persons or organizations that hold some opinions on objects and attributes.",
        "In this paper, we do not deal with source resolution as we are mainly interested in opinion texts on the web, e.g., reviews, discussions and blogs.",
        "In such environments opinion sources are usually the authors of the posts, which are displayed in Web pages.",
        "This work follows the attribute-based opinion mining model in (Hu and Liu 2004; Popes-cu and Etzioni, 2005).",
        "In their work, attributes are called features.",
        "We do not use the term \"feature\" in this paper to avoid confusion with the term \"feature\" used in machine learning.",
        "Our primary interests in this paper are opinions expressed on products and services, which are called objects.",
        "Each object is described by its parts/components and attributes, which are all called attributes for simplicity.",
        "This paper takes the supervised learning approach to solving the problem.",
        "The key contribution of this paper is the design and testing of two novel opinion related features for learning.",
        "The first feature is based on sentiment analysis of normal sentences (non-comparative sentences), comparative sentences, and the idea of sentiment consistency.",
        "For example, we have the sentences, \"The Sony camera is better than the Canon camera.",
        "It is cheap too.\"",
        "It is clear that \"It\" means \"Sony\" because in the first sentence, the opinion on \"Sony\" is positive (comparative positive), but negative (comparative negative) on \"Canon\", and the second sentence is positive.",
        "Thus, we can conclude that \"It\" refers to \"Sony\" because people usually express sentiments in a consistent way.",
        "It is unlikely that \"It\" refers to \"Canon\".",
        "This is the idea of sentiment consistency.",
        "As we can see, this feature requires the system to have the ability to determine positive and negative opinions expressed in normal and comparative sentences.",
        "The second feature considers what objects and attributes are modified by what opinion words.",
        "Opinion words are words that are commonly used to express positive or negative opinions, e.g., good, best, bad, and poor.",
        "Consider the sentences, \"The picture quality of the Canon camera is very good.",
        "It is not expensive either.\"",
        "The question is what \"It\" refers to, \"Canon camera\" or \"picture quality\".",
        "Clearly, we know that \"It\" refers to \"Canon camera\" because \"picture quality\" cannot be expensive.",
        "To make this feature work, we need to identify what opinion words are usually associated with what objects or attributes, which means that the system needs to discover such relationships from the corpus.",
        "These two features give significant boost to the coreference resolution accuracy.",
        "Experimental results based on three corpora demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed features."

        "Coreference resolution is an extensively studied NLP problem (e.g., Morton, 2000; Ng and Cardie, 2002; Gasperin and Briscoe, 2008).",
        "Early knowledge-based approaches were domain and linguistic dependent (Carbonell and Brown 1988), where researchers focused on diverse lexical and grammatical properties of referring expressions (Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002; Zhou et al., 2004).",
        "Recent research relied more on exploiting semantic information.",
        "For example, Yang et al.",
        "(2005) used the semantic compatibility information, and Yang and Su (2007) used automatically discovered patterns integrated with semantic relatedness information, while Ng (2007) employed semantic class knowledge acquired from the Penn Treebank.",
        "Versley et al.",
        "(2008) used several kernel functions in learning.",
        "Perhaps, the most popular approach is based on supervised learning.",
        "In this approach, the system learns a pairwise function to predict whether a pair of noun phrases is coreferent.",
        "Subsequently, when making coreference resolution decisions on unseen documents, the learnt pairwise noun phrase coreference classifier is run, followed by a clustering step to produce the final clusters (coreference chains) of coreferent noun phrases.",
        "For both training and testing, co-reference resolution algorithms rely on feature vectors for pairs of noun phrases that encode lexical, grammatical, and semantic information about the noun phrases and their local context.",
        "Soon et al.",
        "(2001), for example, built a noun phrase coreference system based on decision trees and it was tested on two standard corefe-rence resolution data sets (MUC-6, 1995; MUC-7, 1998), achieving performance comparable to the best-performing knowledge based corefe-rence engines at that time.",
        "The learning algorithm used 12 surface-level features.",
        "Our proposed method builds on this system with additional sentiment related features.",
        "The features inherit from this paper includes:",
        "Distance Feature: Its possible values are 0, 1, 2, 3 and so on which captures the sentence distance between two entities.",
        "Antecedent-pronoun feature, anaphor-pronoun feature: If the candidate antecedent or anaphor is a pronoun, it is true; false otherwise.",
        "Definite noun phrase feature: The value is true if the noun phrase starts with \"the\"; false otherwise.",
        "Demonstrative noun phrase feature: The value is true if the noun phrase starts with the word \"this\", \"that\", \"these\", or \"those\"; false otherwise.",
        "Number agreement feature: If the candidate antecedent and anaphor are both singular or both plural, the value is true; otherwise false.",
        "Both-proper-name feature: If both the candidates are proper nouns, which are determined by capitalization, return true; otherwise false.",
        "Alias feature: It is true if one candidate is an alias of the other or vice versa; false otherwise.",
        "Ng and Cardie (2002) expanded the feature set of Soon et al.",
        "(2001) from 12 to 53 features.",
        "The system was further improved by Stoyanov and Cardie (2006) who gave a partially supervised clustering algorithm and tackled the problem of opinion source coreference resolution.",
        "Centering theory is a linguistic approach tried to model the variation or shift of the main subject of the discourse in focus.",
        "In (Grosz et al., 1995; Tetreault, 2001), centering theory was applied to sort the antecedent candidates based on the ranking of the forward-looking centers, which consist of those discourse entities that can be interpreted by linguistic expressions in the sentences.",
        "Fang et al.",
        "(2009) employed the centering theory to replace the grammatical role features with semantic role information and showed superior accuracy performances.",
        "Ding et al.",
        "(2009) studied the entity assignment problem.",
        "They tried to discover the product names discussed in forum posts and assign the product entities to each sentence.",

        "It arises when an entity is part of an earlier mention.",

        "Fan et al., 2005), and it is thus not in the scope of this paper.",

        "Following (Liu, 2006), we also use the term object to denote an named entity that has been commented on.",
        "The object has a set of components (or parts) and also a set of attributes.",
        "For simplicity, attribute is used to denote both component and attribute in this paper.",

        "As we discussed in the introduction section, coreference resolution on objects and attributes is important because they are the core entities on which people express opinions.",
        "Due to our objective, we do not evaluate other types of co-references.",
        "We assume that objects and entities have been discovered by an existing system (e.g., Hu and Liu 2004, Popescu and Etzioni 2005).",
        "Recall that a coreference relation holds between two noun phrases if they refer to the same entity.",
        "For example, we have the following three consecutive sentences:",
        "s1: I love the nokia n95 but not sure how good",
        "the flash would be?",
        "s2: and also it is quite expensive so anyone got any ideas?",

        "Our task is thus to decide which mentions of objects and attributes refer to the same entities.",
        "Like traditional conference resolution, we employ the supervised learning approach by including additional new features.",
        "The main steps of our approach are as follows:",
        "Preprocessing: We first preprocess the corpus by running a POS tagger , and a Noun Phrase finder.",
        "We then produce the set O-NP which includes both possible objects, attributes and other noun phrases.",

        "Similar to previous supervised learning approaches (Soon et al., 2001), a feature vector is formed for every pair of phrases in O-NP extracted in the preprocessing step.",
        "We use some of the features introduced by Soon et al.",
        "(2001) together with some novel new features that we propose in this work.",
        "Since our focus is on products and attributes in opinionated documents, we do not use personal pronouns, the gender agreement feature, and the appositive feature, as they are not essential in blogs and forum posts discussing products.",
        "Classifier construction: Using the feature vectors obtained from the previous step, we construct the training data, which includes all pairs of manually tagged phrases that are either object names or attributes.",
        "More precisely, each pair contains at least one object or one attribute.",
        "Using the training data, a decision tree is constructed using WEKA.",
        "Testing: The testing phase employs the same preprocessing and feature vector construction steps as described above, followed by the application of the learnt classifier on all candidate coreference pairs (which are represented as feature vectors).",

        "On surface, object and attribute coreference resolution seems to be the same as the traditional noun phrase coreference resolution.",
        "We can apply an existing coreference resolution technique.",
        "However, as we mentioned earlier, in the opinion mining context, we can have a better solution by integrating opinion information into the traditional lexical and grammatical features.",
        "Below are several novel features that we have proposed.",
        "We use ai to denote an antecedent candidate and a.j an anaphor candidate.",
        "Note that we will not repeat the features used in previous systems, but only focus on the new features.",
        "Intuitively, in a post, if the author starts expressing opinions on an object, he/she will continue to have the same opinion on that object or its attributes unless there are contrary words such as \"but\" and \"however\".",
        "For example, we have the following blog (an id is added before each sentence to facilitate later discussion):",
        "\"(1) I bought Camera-A yesterday.",
        "(2) I took a few pictures in the evening in my living room.",
        "(3) The images were very clear.",

        "(5a) It is cheap too.",
        "(5b) The pictures of that camera were blurring for night shots, but for day shots it was ok\"",
        "The comparative sentence (4) says that Cam-era-A is superior to Camera-B.",
        "If the next sentence is (5a) ((5a) and (5b) are alternative sentences), \"it\" should refer to the superior product/object (Camera-A) because sentence (5a) expresses a positive opinion.",
        "Similarly, if the next sentence is sentence (5b) which expresses a negative opinion in its first clause, \"that camera\" should refer to the inferior product (Camera-B).",
        "We call this phenomenon sentiment consistency (SC), which says that consecutive sentiment expressions should be consistent with each other unless there are contrary words such as \"but\" and \"however\".",
        "It would be ambiguous if such consistency is not observed.",
        "Following the above observation, we further observe that if the author wants to introduce a new object o, he/she has to state the name of the object explicitly in a sentence si-1.",
        "The question is what happens to the next sentence si if we need to resolve the pronouns in si.",
        "We consider several cases: 1 .",
        "si-1 is a normal sentence (not a comparative sentence).",
        "If si expresses a consistent sentiment with si-1, it should refer to the same object as si-1.",
        "For example, we have si-1 : The N73 is my favorite.",
        "si: It can produce great pictures.",
        "Here \"It\" in si clearly refers to \"The N73\" in the first sentence si-1.",
        "2. si-1 is a normal sentence and si does not express a consistent sentiment, then ai and a.j introduced in these two sentences may not be coreferenced.",
        "For example, we have si-1: The K800 is awesome.",
        "si: That phone has short battery life.",
        "Here \"The K800\" and \"That phone\" may not be a coreference pair according to sentiment consistency.",
        "\"That phone\" should refer to an object appeared in an earlier sentence.",
        "3.",
        "Si-1 is a comparative sentence.",
        "If si expresses a positive (respectively negative) sentiment, the pronoun in si should refer to the superior (or inferior) entity in si-1 to satisfy sentiment consistency.",
        "This situation is depicted in the earlier example blog.",
        "For completeness, we give another example.",
        "si.1 : The XBR4 is brighter than the 5080.",
        "si: Overall, it is a great choice.",
        "Here \"it\" in si should refer to \"The XBR4\" in si-1 since they both have positive sentiments expressed on them.",
        "Opinion Mining of Comparative Sentences:",
        "To deal with case (3), we need to identify superior entities from comparative sentences.",
        "In fact, we first need to find such comparative sentences.",
        "There is a prior work on identifying comparative sentences (Jindal and Liu.",
        "2006).",
        "Since our focus is not to identify such sentences, we used several heuristic rules based on some comparative keywords, e.g. than, win, superior, etc.",
        "They achieve the F-score of 0.9.",
        "We then followed the opinion mining method introduced in (Ding et al.",
        "2009) to find superior entities.",
        "Since a comparative sentence typically has entities on the two sides of a comparative keyword, i.e., \"Camera-X is better than Camera-Y\", based on opinion mining, if the sentence is positive, then the entities before the comparative keyword is superior and otherwise they are inferior (with the negation considered).",
        "SC Feature: The possible value for this feature is 0, 1, or 2.",
        "If ai and aj have the same opinion, return 1; different opinions, return 0; and if the opinions cannot be identified for one or both of them, return 2.",
        "Here is an example explaining how the feature is used in our system: \"My wife has currently got a Nokia 7390, which is terrible.",
        "My 6233 would always get great reception, hers would get no signal.\"",
        "Using our algorithm for opinion mining, \"hers\" gets a negative opinion in the second sentence.",
        "So the value for this feature for the pair, \"hers\" and \"a Nokia 7390\", is 1.",
        "The feature value for the pair \"hers\" and \"My 6233\" is 0.",
        "The idea is that because the first sentence expresses a negative sentiment on \"a Nokia 7390\", and there is no discourse connective (such as \"but\" and \"however\") between these two sentences.",
        "\"Hers\" should be talking about \"a Nokia 7390\" so as to satisfy sentiment consistency.",
        "One of the most important factors determining the orientation of opinions is the opinion words that opinion holders use to express their opinions.",
        "Different entities may be modified by different opinion words.",
        "We can use their association information with entities (both objects and attributes) to identify their coreferences.",
        "Opinion Words: In most cases, opinions in sentences are expressed using opinion words.",
        "For example, the sentence, \"The picture quality is amazing\", expresses a positive opinion on the \"picture quality\" attribute because of the positive opinion word \"amazing\".",
        "Researchers have compiled sets of such words for adjectives, adverbs, verbs, and nouns respectively.",
        "Such lists are collectively called the opinion lexicon.",
        "We obtained an opinion lexicon from the authors of (Ding et al.",
        "2009).",
        "It is useful to note that opinion words used to express opinions on different entities are usually different apart from some general opinion words such as good, great, bad, etc, which can express opinions on almost anything.",
        "For example, we have the following passage:",
        "\"i love the nokia n95 but not sure how strong the flash would be?",
        "And also it is quite",
        "expensive, so anyone got any ideas!\"",
        "Here \"strong\" is an opinion word that expresses a positive opinion on \"the flash\", but is seldom used to describe \"the nokia n95\".",
        "\"expensive\", on the other hand, should not be associated with \"the flash\", but is an opinion word that indicates a negative opinion on \"the nokia n95\".",
        "So \"the nokia n95\" is more likely to be the antecedent of \"it\" in the second sentence.",
        "The question is how to find such associations of entities and opinion words.",
        "We use their cooccurrence information to measure, i.e., the pointwise mutual information of the two terms.",
        "First, we estimate the probability of P(NP), P(OW) and P(NP&OW).",
        "Here NP means a noun phrase, e.g., an object (attribute) after removing determiners, and OW means an opinion word.",
        "To compute the probability, we first count the occurrences of the words.",
        "Then the probability is computed as follow:",
        "NumofSŒP & OW) TotalNumofSentence where NumofS is a function that gives the number of sentences that contain the particular word string.",
        "P(NP, OW) is computed in the same way.",
        "Let us use the previous example again.",
        "We compute P(\"nokia n95\",\"expensive\") as the number of sentences containing both \"nokia n95\" and \"expensive\" divided by the total number of sentences in the whole corpus.",
        "Then we use the pointwise mutual information between a noun phrase and an opinion word to measure the association.",
        "However, this PMI value cannot be encoded directly as a feature as it only captures the local information between antecedent candidates and opinion words.",
        "That is, it cannot be used as a global feature in the classifier.",
        "We thus rank all possible antecedents of anaphor aj based on their PMI values and use the ranking as the feature value.",
        "The highest ranked antecedent ai has value 1; the second one has value 2 and so on.",
        "The candidates ranked below the fourth place all have the value 5.",
        "In the example above, if PM/(\"nokia n95\", \"expensive\") is greater than PMI(\"flash\", \"expensive\"), the feature for \"nokia n95\" and \"it\" pair will have a smaller value than the feature for the \"flash\" and \"it\" pair.",
        "One may ask if we can use all adjectives and adverbs to associate with objects and attributes rather than just opinion words since most opinion words are adjectives and adverbs.",
        "We tested that, but the results were poor.",
        "We believe the reason is that there are many adjectives and adverbs which are used for all kinds of purposes and may not be meaningful for our task.",
        "Soon et al.",
        "(2001) has a string match feature (SOON STR), which tests whether the two noun phrases are the same string after removing determiners from each.",
        "Ng and Cardie (2002) split this feature into several primitive features, depending on the type of noun phrases.",
        "They replace the SOON STR feature with three features – PRO STR, PN STR, and WORDS STR – which restrict the application of string matching to pronouns, proper names, and non-pronominal noun phrases, respectively.",
        "In the user generated opinion data, these may not be sufficient.",
        "For a certain product, people can have a large number of ways to express it.",
        "For example, we have Which Plasma tv should I go for.",
        "The TH77U",
