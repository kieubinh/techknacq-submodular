        "The ability to disambiguate a polyse-mous entity mention or infer that two orthographically different mentions are the same entity is crucial in updating an entity's KB record.",
        "This task has been variously called entity disambiguation, record linkage, or entity linking.",
        "When performed without a KB, entity disambiguation is called coreference resolution: entity mentions either within the same document or across multiple documents are clustered together, where each cluster corresponds to a single real world entity.",
        "The emergence of large scale publicly available KBs like Wikipedia and DBPedia has spurred an interest in linking textual entity references to their entries in these public KBs.",
        "Bunescu and Paşca (2006) and Cucerzan (2007) presented important pioneering work in this area, but suffer from several limitations including Wikipedia specific dependencies, scale, and the assumption of a KB entry for each entity.",
        "In this work we introduce an entity disambiguation system for linking entities to corresponding Wikipedia pages designed for open domains, where a large percentage of entities will not be linkable.",
        "Further, our method and some of our features readily generalize to other curated KB.",
        "We adopt a supervised approach, where each of the possible entities contained within Wikipedia are scored for a match to the query entity.",
        "We also describe techniques to deal with large knowledge bases, like Wikipedia, which contain millions of entries.",
