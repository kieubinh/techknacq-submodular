        "(2009) argued that many of the structural differences are related to the ubiquitous Chinese structural particle phrase Ôtl (DE) construction, used for a wide range of noun modification constructions (both single word and clausal) and other uses.",
        "They pointed out that DE is a major source of word order error when a Chinese sentence is translated into English due to the different ways that the DE construction can be translated.",

        "(2009) extended this work by classifying DE into 5 finer-grained categories using a log-linear classifier with rich features in order to achieve higher accuracy both in reordering and in lexical choice.",
        "Their experiments showed that a higher accuracy of the DE classification improved the accuracy of reordering component, and further indirectly improved the translation quality in terms of BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) scores.",
        "We regard the DE classification as a labeling task, and hence propose a new model to label the DE construction using a discriminative latent variable algorithm (DPLVM) (Morency et al., 2007; Sun and Tsujii, 2009), which uses latent variables to carry additional information that may not be expressed by those original labels and capture more complicated dependencies between DE and its corresponding features.",
