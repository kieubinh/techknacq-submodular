        "According to (Sowa and Siekmann, 1994), a synonym is a word (or concept) that means the same or nearly the same as another word (or concept).",
        "It has been observed that words are similar if their contexts are similar (Freitag et al., 2005) and so synonymy detection has received a lot of attention during the last decades.",
        "However, words used in the same context are not necessarily synonyms and can embody different semantic relationships such as hyponyms, meronyms or co-hyponyms (Heylen et al., 2008).",
        "In this paper, we introduce a new unsupervised methodology for synonym detection by extracting and aligning paraphrases on normalized domain corpora.",
        "In particular, we study a specific structure within aligned paraphrases, paraphrase casts, from which valid synonyms are discovered.",
        "In fact, we propose a new approach based on the idea that synonyms are substitutable words within a given domain corpus.",
        "Results performed on two different domain corpora, the Corpus of Computer Security (COCS) and the Corpus of Cancer Research (COCR), show that general synonyms as well as synonymic expressions can be identified with a 67.27% precision performance."

        "Automatic synonymy detection has been tackled in a variety of ways which we explain as follows.",
        "This approach to information extraction is based on a technique called selective concept extraction as defined by (Riloff, 1993).",
        "Selective concept extraction is a form of text skimming that selectively processes relevant text while effectively ignoring surrounding text that is thought to be irrelevant to the domain.",
        "The pioneer of pattern-based approaches (Hearst, 1992) has introduced lexico-syntactic patterns to automatically acquire given word semantic relationships.",
        "Specific patterns like \"X and other F' or \"X such as F' were used for hypernym-hyponym detection.",
        "Later, the idea was extended and adapted for synonymy by other researchers such as (Roark and Charniak, 1998), (Caraballo, 1999) and (Maynard and Peters, 2009).",
        "In general, manual pattern definition is time consuming and requires linguistic skills.",
        "Usually, systems based on lexico-syntactic patterns perform with very high precision, but low recall due to the fact that these patterns are rare.",
        "However, recent work by (Ohshima and Tanaka, 2009) on Web data reported high recall figures.",
        "To avoid manual encoding of patterns, many supervised approaches have been proposed as summarized in (Stevenson and Greenwood, 2006).",
        "Distributional similarity for capturing semantic relatedness is relying on the hypothesis that semantically similar words share similar contexts.",
        "These methods vary in the level of supervision from unsupervised to semi-supervised or to supervised.",
        "The first type of methods includes the work of (Hindle, 1990), (Lin, 1998) and (Heylen et al., 2008) who used unsupervised methods for detecting word similarities based on shallow-parsed corpora.",
        "Others have proposed unsupervised methodologies to solve TOEFL-like tests, instead of discovering synonyms (Turney, 2001), (Terra and Clarke, 2003) and (Freitag et al., 2005).",
        "Other researchers, such as (Girju et al., 2004), (Muller et al., 2006), (Wu and Zhou, 2003) and (Wei et al., 2009), have used language or knowledge resources to enhance the representation of the vector space model.",
        "Unlike the pattern-based approach, the distributional similarity-based approach shows low precision compared to high recall.",
        "One obvious way to verify all the possible connections between words of the vocabulary employs an exhaustive search.",
        "However, comparison based on word usage can only highlight those terms that are highly similar in meaning.",
        "This method of representation is usually unable to distinguish between middle strength and weak semantic relations, or detect the relationship between hapax-legomena.",
        "More recently, approaches combining patterns and distributional similarity appeared to bring the best of the two methodologies.",
        "(Hagiwara et al., 2009) describe experiments that involve training various synonym classifiers.",
        "(Giovannetti et al., 2008) use syntactically parsed text and manually composed patterns together with distributional similarity for detecting semantically related words.",
        "Finally, (Turney, 2008) proposes a supervised machine learning approach for discovering synonyms, antonyms, analogies and associations.",
        "For that purpose, feature vectors are based on frequencies of patterns and classified by a SVM.",
        "(Van der Plas and Tiedemann, 2006) state that \"People use multiple ways to express the same idea.",
        "These alternative ways of conveying the same information in different ways are referred to by the term paraphrase and in the case of single words or phrasal terms sharing the same meaning, we speak of synonyms\".",
        "Based on this, we propose that in order to discover pairs of semantically related words (in the best case synonyms) that may be used in figurative or rare sense, and as consequence impossible to be identified by the distributional similarity approach, we need to have them highlighted by their local specific environment.",
        "Here we differ from the pattern-based approach that use local general environment.",
        "We propose to align paraphrases from domain corpora and discover words that are possibly substitutable for one another in a given context (paraphrase casts), and as such are synonyms or near-synonyms.",
        "Comparatively to existing approaches, we propose an unsupervised and language-independent methodology which does not depend on linguistic processing, nor manual definition of patterns or training sets and leads to higher precision when compared to distributional similarity-based approaches."

        "This situation is well-known as it is one of the major drawbacks of the distributional analysis approach which needs huge quantities of texts to make secure decisions.",
        "So we note that applying the distributional analysis approach to such small corpora would have led to rather poor results.",
        "Even with an adapted corpus, figure 5 (left-most bar) shows that there are no sufficient statistics for 30 pairs of synonyms.",
        "Although the quality of the extracted pairs of synonyms is high, the precision remains relatively low with 67.27% precision on average.",
        "As we pointed out in the previous section, we did not make any restrictions to the left and right contexts of the casts.",
        "However, the longer these contexts are, compared to the misaligned sequence of words, the higher the chance is that we find a correct synonym.",
        "Table 5 shows the average lengths of both cast contexts for synonyms and erroneous pairings, in terms of words (WCL) and characters (CCL).",
        "We also provide the ratio (R) between the character lengths of the middle segment (i.e. misaligned character sequences) and the character lengths of the cast contexts (i.e. right and left sizes of equally aligned character sequences).",
        "It is clear that a more thorough study of the effects of the left and right contexts should be carried out to improve precision of our approach, although this may be to the detriment of recall.",
        "Based on the results of the ratio R, we note that the larger the cast context is compared to the cast content, the more likely it is that the misaligned words are synonyms."

        "In this paper we have introduced a new unsupervised methodology for synonym detection that involves extracting and aligning paraphrases on normalized domain corpora.",
        "In particular, we have studied a specific structure within aligned paraphrases, paraphrase casts, from which valid synonyms were discovered.",
        "The overall precision was 71.29% for the computer security domain and 66.06% for the cancer research domain.",
        "This approach proved to be promising for extracting synonymous words and synonymic multiword units.",
        "Its strength is the ability to effectively work with small domain corpora, without supervised training, nor definition of specific language-dependent patterns.",
        "Moreover, it is capable to extract synonymous pairs with figurative or rare senses which would be impossible to identify using the distributional similarity approach.",
        "Finally, our approach is completely language-independent as it can be applied to any raw text, not obligatorily normalized corpora, although the results for domain terminology may be improved by the identification of phrasal terms.",
        "However, further improvements of the method should be considered.",
        "A measure of quality of the paraphrase casts is necessary to provide a measure of confidence to the kind of extracted word semantic relationship.",
        "Indeed, the larger the contexts and the smaller the misaligned sequences are, the more likely it is for single or phrasal terms to be synonyms or near-synonyms.",
        "Further work should also be carried out to differentiate the acquired types of semantically related pairs.",
        "As it is shown in Table 3, some of the extracted pairs were not synonymic, but lexically related words such as antonyms, hypernyms/hyponyms and associations.",
        "A natural follow-up solution for discriminating between semantic types of extracted pairs could involve context-based classification of acquired casts pairs.",
        "In particular, (Turney, 2008) tackled the problem of classifying different lexical information such as synonymy, antonymy, hy-pernymy and association by using context words.",
        "In order to propose a completely unsupervised methodology, we could also follow the idea of (Dias et al., 2010) to automatically construct small",
