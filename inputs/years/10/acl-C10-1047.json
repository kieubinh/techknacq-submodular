        "In everyday parlance, the notion of 'spoilers' refers to information, such as a movie plot, whose advance revelation destroys the enjoyment of the consumer.",
        "For instance, consider the movie Derailed which features Clive Owen and Jennifer Aniston.",
        "In the script, Owen is married and meets Aniston on a train during his daily commute to work.",
        "The two of them begin an affair.",
        "The adultery is noticed by some inscrupulous people who proceed to blackmail Owen and Aniston.",
        "To experience a spoiler, consider this comment from imdb.com:",
        "I can understand why Aniston wanted to do this role, since she gets to play majorly against type (as the supposedly 'nice' girl who's really - oh no!",
        "- part of the scam), but I'm at a loss to figure out what Clive Owen is doing in this sub-par, unoriginal, ugly and overly violent excuse for a thriller.",
        "i.e., we learn that Aniston's character is actually a not-so-nice person who woos married men for later blackmail, and thus a very suspenseful piece of information is revealed.",
        "Automatic ways to detect spoilers are crucial in large sites that host reviews and opinions.",
        "Arguably, what constitutes a spoiler is inherently a subjective assessment and, for movies/books with intricate storylines, some comments are likely to contain more spoilers than others.",
        "We therefore cast the spoiler detection problem as a ranking problem so that comments that are more likely to be spoilers are to be ranked higher than others.",
        "In particular, we rank user comments w.r.t.",
        "(i.e., given) the movie's synopsis which, according to imdb, is '[a detailed description of the movie, including spoilers, so that users who haven't seen a movie can read anything about the title]'.",
        "Our contributions are three fold.",
        "(i) We formulate the novel task of spoiler detection in reviews and cast it as ranking user comments against a synopsis.",
        "We demonstrate how simple bag-of-words (BOW) representations need to be augmented with linguistic cues in order to satisfactorily detect spoilers.",
        "(ii) We showcase the ability of dependency parses to extract discriminatory linguistic cues that can distinguish spoilers from non-spoilers.",
        "We utilize an LDA-based model (Wei and Croft, 2006) to probabilistically rank spoilers.",
        "Our approach does not require manual tagging of positive and negative examples - an advantage that is crucial to large scale implementation.",
        "(iii) We conduct a detailed experimental evaluation with imdb to assess the effectiveness of our framework.",
        "Using manually tagged comments for four diverse movies and suitably configured design choices, we evaluate a total of 12 ranking strategies.",
        "Probabilistic topic modeling has attracted signii-cant attention with techniques such as probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) (Hofmann, 1999) and LDA (Blei et al., 2003; Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004; Heinrich, 2008; Steyvers and Griffiths, 2007).",
        "We discuss LDA in detail due to its centrality to our proposed techniques.",
        "As a generative model, LDA describes how text could be generated from a latent set of variables denoting topics.",
        "Each document is modeled as a mixture of topics, and topics are modeled as multinomial distributions on words.",
        "An unlabeled training corpus can be used to estimate an LDA model.",
        "Many inference methods have been proposed, e.g., variational methods (Blei et al., 2003), expectation propagation (Grifiths and Steyvers, 2004), Gibbs sampling (Grifiths and Steyvers, 2004), and a collapsed variational Bayesian inference method (Teh et al., 2007).",
        "Gibbs sampling, as a speciic form of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), is a popular method for estimating LDA models.",
        "After an LDA model is estimated, it can be used in a very versatile manner: to analyze new documents, for inference tasks, or for retrieval/comparison functions.",
        "For instance, we can calculate the probability that a given word appears in a document conditioned on other words.",
        "Furthermore, two kinds of similarities can be assessed: between documents and between words (Steyvers and Grifiths, 2007).",
        "The similarity between two documents can also be used to retrieve documents relevant to a query document (Heinrich, 2008).",
        "Yet another application is to use LDA as a dimensionality reduction tool for text classiication (Blei et al., 2003).",
        "To improve LDA's expressiveness, we can relax the bag-of-words assumption and plug in more sophisticated topic models (Griffiths et al., 2005; Griffiths et al., 2007; Wallach, 2006; Wallach, 2008; Wang and Mccallum, 2005; Wang et al., 2007).",
        "sLDA (supervised LDA), as a statistical model of labeled collections, focuses on the prediction problem (Blei and Mcauliffe, 2007).",
        "The correlated topic model (CTM) (Blei and Laf-ferty, 2007) addresses plain LDA's inability to model topic correlation.",
        "The author-topic model (AT) (Steyvers et al., 2004) considers not only topics but also authors of the documents, and models documents as if they were generated by a two-stage stochastic process."

      "text": [
        "Based on the fact that a spoiler should be topically close to the synopsis, we propose three methods to solve the spoiler ranking problem.",
        "The irst two use LDA as a preprocessing stage, whereas the third requires positive training data.",
        "Predictive perplexity: Our first method is motivated by the use of LDA-based predictive perplexity (PP) for collaborative filtering (Blei et al., 2003).",
        "Here, the PP metric is evaluated over a ixed test dataset in order to empirically compare LDA with other models (pLSI, mixture of uni-grams).",
        "In our work, we view documents as analogous to users, and words inside documents as analogous to movies.",
        "Given a group of known words, we predict the other group of unkown words.",
        "We can either calculate the predictive perplexity value from each movie comment Com to the unique synopsis (PP1), or from the synopsis Syn to each comment (PP2).",
        "In the equations above, p(wd\\wcom) and p(wd\\wsyn) are the probabilities to generate the word (wd) from a group of observed words wobs(either a comment wcom or a synopsis wsyn).",
        "Mcom or Msyn is the length of a comment or a synopsis.",
        "Notice that p($\\wobs) can be easily calculated after estimating LDA model by Gibbs sampling.",
        "It is also discussed as \"predictive likelihood ranking\" in (Heinrich, 2008).",
        "Symmetrized KL-divergence: Since documents are modeled as mixtures of topics in LDA, we can calculate the similarity between synopsis and comment by measuring their",
        "topic distributions' similarity.",
        "We adopt the widely-used symmetrized Kullback Leibler (KL) divergence (Heinrich, 2008; Steyvers and Grifiths, 2007) to measure the difference between the two documents' topic distributions, where DKL(P\\\\q) = Â£j=lPj-log21 LPU: Viewing the spoiler ranking problem as a retrieval task given the (long) query synopsis, we also consider the LPU (Learning from Positive and Unlabeled Data) method (Liu et al., 2003).",
        "We apply LPU as if the comment collection was the unlabeled dataset, and the synopsis together with few obvious spoiler comments as the positive training data.",
        "LDA, as a topic model, is widely used as a clustering method and dimensionality reduction tool.",
        "It models text as a mixture of topics.",
        "However, topics extracted by LDA are not necessarily the same topics as judged by humans since the definition of topic is very subjective.",
        "For instance, when conducting sentimental polarity analysis, we hope that topics are clusters concerning one certain kind of subjective sentiment.",
        "But for other purposes, we may desire topics focusing on broad 'plots.'",
        "Since LDA merely processes a collection according to the statistical distribution of words, its results might not it either of these two cases mentioned above.",
        "In a basic topic model (section 3.1), neither the order of a sequence of words nor the semantic connections between two words affect the probabilistic modeling.",
        "Documents are generated only based on a BOW assumption.",
        "However, word order information is very important for most text-related tasks, and simply discarding the order information is inappropriate.",
        "Signiicant work has gone in to address this problem.",
        "Grifiths et al.",
        "use order information by incorporating collocations (Griffiths et al., 2005; Griffiths et al., 2007).",
        "They give an example of the collocation \"united kingdom\", which is ideally treated as a single chunk than two independent words.",
        "However, this model can only be used to capture collocations involving sequential terms.",
        "Their extended model (Grifiths et al., 2007) integrates topics and syntax, and identiies syntactic classes of words based on their distribution.",
        "More sophisticated models exist (Wallach, 2006; Wang and Mccal-lum, 2005; Wang et al., 2007; Wallach, 2008) but all of them are focused on solving linguistic analysis tasks using topic models.",
        "In this paper, however, our focus is on utilizing dependency information as a preprocessing step to help improve the accuracy of LDA models.",
        "In more detail, we utilize dependency parsing to breakup sentences and treat parses as independent 'virtual words,' to be added to the original BOW-based LDA model.",
        "In our experiments we employ the Stanford typed dependency parser (Marneffe et al., 2006) as our parsing tool.",
        "We use collapsed typed dependencies (a.k.a.",
        "grammatical relations) to form the virtual words.",
        "However, we do not incorporate all the dependencies.",
        "We only retain dependencies whose terms have the part-of-speech tags such as \"NN\", \"VB\", \"JJ\", \"PRP\" and \"RB\", since these terms have strong plot meaning, and are close to the movie topic.",

        "However, all dependencies have very low percentage to be topic-matched, and with a topic number of 2, there remained a significant amount of unmatched <NN, NN> dependencies, demonstrating that simply doing plain LDA may not capture the plot \"topic\" as we desire.",

        "Although the debate of choosing an appropriate number of topics continues (Boyd-Graber et al., 2009), we utilized the classic perplexity method in our work.",
        "Heinrich (Heinrich, 2008) demonstrated that perplexity can be calculated by:",
        "We chose different topic numbers and calculated the perplexity value for the 20% held-out comments.",
        "A good number of topics was found to be between 200 and 600 for both Bow-based strategy and Bow+Dependency strategy, and is also affected by the size of movie comment collections.",
        "(We used 0.1 as the document topic prior, and 0.01 as the topic word prior.)",
        "As discussed earlier, our task is to rank all the comments according to their possibilities ofbeing a spoiler.",
        "We primarily used four methods to do the ranking: PP1, PP2, sKL, and the LPU method.",
        "For each method, we tried the basic model using \"bag-of-words\", and the model using dependency parse information (only), and also with both BOW and dependency information mixed.",
        "We utilize LingPipe LDA clustering component which uses Gibbs sampling.",
        "Among the four methods studied here, PP1, PP2 and sKL are based on LDA preprocessing.",
        "After obtaining the topic-word distribution and the posterior distributions for topics in each document, the PP1 and PP2 metrics can be easily calculated.",
        "The symmetrized KL divergence between each pair of synopsis and comment is calculated by comparing their topic distributions.",
        "LPU method, as a text classiier, requires a set of positive training data.",
        "We selected those comments which contain terms or phrases as strong hint of spoiler (using a list of 20 phrases as the filter, such as \"spoiler alert\", \"spoiler ahead\", etc).",
        "These spoiler comments together with the synopsis, are treated as the positive training data.",
        "We then utilized LPU to label each comment with a real number for ranking.",
        "To evaluate the ranking effects of the 12 strategies, we plot n-best precision and recall graphs, which are widely used for assessing collocation measures (Evert and Krenn, 2001; Pecina and Schlesinger, 2006).",
        "Fig.",
        "3 visualizes the precision-recall graphs from 12 different measures for the four movie comment collections.",
        "The x-axis represents the proportion of the ranking list, while the y-axis depicts the corresponding precision or recall value.",
        "The upper part of the igure is the result for the movie which contains more than 1000 comments, while the bottom part demonstrates the result for the relatively small comment collection.",
        "The n-best evaluation shows that for all the four movie comment collections, PP1_mix and PP1 perform significantly better than the other methods, and the dependency information helps to increase the accuracy sig-niicantly, especially for the larger size collection.",
        "The LPU method, though using part of the positive training data, did not perform very well.",
        "The reason could be that although some of the users put the warning phrases (like \"spoiler alert\") ahead of their comments, the comment might contain only indirect plot-revealing information.",
        "This also reflects that a spoiler tagging method by us-",
        "Figure 3: N-best(top nth) evaluation (Burnin period = 100): comparison of precision-recall for different methods on four movie comment collections.",
        "The PP1 method with BOW and dependency information mixed performs the best among all the measures.",
        "Other six methods such as dependency only and KL-based which do not give good performance are ignored in this igure to make it readable.",
        "Full comparison is available at: http://sites.google.com/site/ldaspoiler/ ing only keywords typically will not work.",
        "Finally, the approach to directly calculating the symmetrized KL divergence seems to be not suitable, either.",
        "We also compared the average precision values and normalized discounted cumulative gain (nDCG) values (Croft et al., 2009; JÃ¤rvelin and KekÃ¤lÃ¤inen, 2002) of the ranking results with different parameters for Gibbs sampling, such as burnin period and sample size.",
        "Average precision is calculated by averaging the precision values from the ranking positions where a valid spoiler is found, and the nDCG value for the top-p list is calculated as nDCGp = ^Â§Â§^ â  DCGP is denned as: DCGP = reh + Ya=2 E^fÃ¯ where rek is 1 when the i-th comment in the list is judged as a real spoiler, and 0, otherwise.",
        "IDCG denotes the maximum possible DCG value when all the real spoilers are ranked at the top (perfect ranking) (JÃ¤rvelin and KekÃ¤lÃ¤inen, 2002).",
        "Table 4: Comparison of ranking by PP_mix using different parameters for Gibbs sampling (analyzed on the top 150 ranking lists, and the values in the table are the mean of the accuracy from four movie comment collections).",
        "As we can see from Table 4, the accuracy is not affected too much as long as the burin period for the MCMC process is longer than 50 and the sample size retained is larger than 10.",
        "In our experiments, we use 100 as the burin parameter, and beyond that, 100 samples were retained with sample lag of 2.",
        "As shown in Table 5, we find that the basic BOW strategy prefers the longer comments whereas the strategy that uses dependency information prefers the shorter ones.",
        "Although it is reasonable that a longer comment would have a higher probability of revealing the plot, methods which prefers the longer comments usually leave out the short spoiler comments.",
        "By incorporating the dependency information together with the basic BOW, the new method reduces this shortcoming.",
        "For instance, consider one short comment for the movie",
        "This is the same formula as Sixth Sense - from the ability to see things other people don't, to the shocking ending.",
        "Only this movie is just not plausible - I mean Elijah goes around causing disasters, trying to see if anyone is \"Unbreakable\" - it's gonna take a lot of disasters because its a big world.",
        "whcih is ranked as the 27th result in the PP1_mix method, whereas the BOW based PP1 method places it at the 398th result in the list.",
        "Obviously, this comment reveals the twisting end that it is Elijah who caused the disasters."
