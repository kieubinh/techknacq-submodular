        "This fingerprinting selects overlapping sub-strings.",

        "Y.",
        "To decrease the size of a full fingerprint, there are various versions of selective fingerprints.",
        "The simplest kind of selective fingerprinting is the \"All substrings selection\" described in Hoad and Zobel (2003).",
        "This fingerprinting is similar to the full fingerprinting, but it does not select overlapping sub-strings.",
        "Rather, it selects all non-overlapping substrings of size a (in words) from the document.",
        "For example, if a is 3, this strategy selects the 3-word phrases that begin at position 0; 3; 6; 9; etc.",

        "The best results were achieved by 1,000 fingerprints with a=50.",
        "Another possibility is to work with a fixed proportion of the substrings, so that the size of the selective fingerprint is proportional to the size of the document.",

        "This means that all of the substrings must be calculated and sorted according to their frequency in the document, and then the rarest of them are selected.",
        "The intuition is that sub-strings, which are less common, are more effective discriminators when comparing documents for similarity.",
        "Anchor methods",

        "These methods are based on specific, predefined strings (called anchors), in the text of the document.",

        "Various anchors were used by Hoad and Zobel.",
        "The anchors were randomly selected, but extremely common strings such as \"th\" and \"it\" were rejected.",

        "Additional experiments have been applied to identify the optimal size of an anchor.",

        "According to our expert, these methods are regarded as the best.",
        "Our novel methods: CA and CR also report on 9 IDN, 0 VHS, one HS, and 0 or 3 MS document pairs, respectively.",
        "The sum (10-13) of the IDN, VHS, HS and MS document pairs found by the best full and selective fingerprint methods mentioned in the last paragraph is the same sum of the IDN, VHS, HS and MS document pairs found by the CA and CR methods.",
        "That is, the CA and CR are very close in their quailty to the best methods.",
        "However, the CA and the CR have a clear advantage on the other methods.",
        "They check a rather small portion of the papers, and therfore their run time is much more smaller.",
        "On the one hand, CR seems to be better than CA (and even the best selective fingerprint methods SF(k), and S2S(k)) because it reports on more MS document pairs, which means that CR is closer in its quality to the best full fingerprint methods.",
        "On the other hand, according to our expert CA is better than CR, since CR has more detection failures.",
        "The combinations of CA and/or CR and/or the methods defined for the three thirds of the papers report on results that are less or equal from the viewpoint of their quality to CA or CR.",
        "Several general conclusions can be drawn from the experimental results as follows:",
        "(1) There are 9 documents (in the examined corpus) that are identical to one of the 100 tested papers.",
        "According to our expert, each one of these documents is IDN to a different paper from the 100 tested papers.",
        "This means that at least 9% of our random tested papers have IDN files in a corpus that contains 10, 099 files (for each test file).",
        "(2) Several papers that have been found as IDN might be legal copies.",
        "For example: (a) by mistake, the same paper might be stored twice at the same conference website or (b) the paper, which is stored in its conference website might also be stored at its author's website.",
        "(3) All the methods that run with two possible values of k (3 or 4 words) present similar results for the two values of k.",
        "discovers 9 IDN papers, 2 HS papers, and 1 MS paper.",
        "These results were approved by a human expert.",
        "FF(4) missed one paper.",
        "One HS paper identified by FF(3) was identified as MS by FF(4) and one MS paper identified by FF(3) was identified as less than MS by FF(4).",
        "Moreover, also for other methods, variants with K=3 were better or equal to those with K=4.",
        "The main reason for these findings might be that the variants with K=4 check less substrings because the checks are done for each sentence.",
        "Substrings that end at the sequential sentence are not checked.",
        "Therefore, it is likely that additional equal substrings from the checked papers are not identified.",
        "(5) S2F(3) discovers one more MS paper compared to FF(3).",
        "According to the human expert, the similarity measure of this paper should be less than MS.",
        "Therefore, we decided to select FF(3) as the best method.",
        "(6) FF(3)'s run time is very high since it works on overlapping substrings for the whole papers.",
        "(7) Our two novel methods: CA and CR are among the best methods for identification of various levels of plagiarism.",
        "As mentioned before, CA was found as a better predictor.",
        "Sixteen methods out of the thirty-eight methods presented in Table 1, were selected for additional experiments.",
        "All the methods with k=4, the anchor methods, SSF, S3F, S3S, RDF, and RDS methods were omitted, due to their faulty results (as explained above).",
        "The remaining 16 methods (with k=3) are: FF, S2F, S2F, SF, S2S and all our 12 baseline methods: CA, and CR- CRMM.",
        "Table 2 presents the results of these methods regarding the corpus of 10,100 documents.",
        "Since we selected less than half of the original methods we allow ourselves to test 1,000 documents instead of 100.",
        "Again, according to our expert, FF has been found as the best predictive method.",
        "Surprisingly, CA achieved the second best results with one additional VHS paper.",
        "11 HS documents and 5 MS documents have been identified by CA as by FF.",
        "The meaning of this finding is that the abstracts in almost all the simple similar documents were not significantly changed.",
        "That is, the authors of the non-IDN documents did not invest enough to change their abstracts.",
        "CR indentified 41 documents as identical.",
        "The reason for this is probably because 3 additional papers have the same reference section as in 3 other tested papers, although these 3 document pairs are different in other sections.",
        "Furthermore, CR reports on relatively high number of suspicious document pairs, especially at the MS level.",
        "The meaning of this finding is that the references in many document pairs are not significantly different although these documents have larger differences in other sections.",
        "Consequently, combinations with CA achieved better results than combinations with CR.",
        "A very important finding is that the run time of FF was very expensive (one day, 3 hours and 57.3 minutes) compared to the run time of CA (9 hours and 16.7 minutes).",
        "In other words, CA achieved almost the same results as FF but more efficiently.",
        "The selected methods presented in Table 2 were analyzed according to the results of FF.",
        "Table 3 shows the distributions of false true positives (TP), false positives (FP), true negatives (TN), and false negatives (FN), regarding the 10,099 retrieved documents for the 1,000 tested document.",
        "The false positive rate is the proportion in percents of positive test results (i.e., a plagiarism was identified by a baseline function) that are really negative values (i.e., the truth is that there is no plagiarism).",
        "The false negative rate is the proportion of negative test results that are really positive values.",
        "statistical results.",
        "FF is the only method that detects all cases of simple plagiarism.",
        "According to FF, there are 0.534% true positives.",
        "That is, 54 papers out of 10,099 are suspected as plagiarized versions of 54 papers of the 1,000 tested papers.",
        "This finding fits the results of FF(3) in Table 2, where there are 38 IDN, 11 HS, and 5 MS.",
