      "text": [
        "In formal semantic theory, the compositional semantics of adjective-noun phrases can be modeled in terms of selective binding (Pustejovsky, 1995), i.e. the adjective selects one of possibly several roles or attributes from the semantics ofthe noun.",
        "b. color(car)=blue",
        "In this paper, we define a distributional framework that models the compositional process underlying the modification of nouns by adjectives.",
        "'In the original statement of the theory, adjectives select qualia roles that can be considered as collections of attributes.",
        "We focus on property-denoting adjectives as they are valuable for acquiring concept representations for, e.g., ontology learning.",
        "An approach for automatic subclassification of property-denoting adjectives is presented in Hartung and Frank (2010).",
        "Our goal is to expose, for adjective-noun phrases as in (1a), the attribute in the semantics of the noun that is selected by the adjective, while not being overtly realized on the syntactic level.",
        "The semantic information we intend to capture for (1a) is formalized in (1b).",
        "Ideally, this kind of knowledge could be extracted from corpora by searching for patterns that paraphrase (1a), e.g. the color of the car is blue.",
        "However, linguistic patterns that explicitly relate nouns, adjectives and attributes are very rare.",
        "We avoid these sparsity issues by reducing the triple r=(noun, attribute, adjective) that encodes the relation illustrated in (1b) to tuples r'=(noun, attribute) and r\"=(attribute, adjective), as suggested by Turney and Pantel (2010) for similar tasks.",
        "Both r' and r\" can be observed much more frequently in text corpora than r. Moreover, this enables us to model adjective and noun meanings as distinct semantic vectors that are built over attributes as dimensions.",
        "Based on these semantic representations, we make use of vector composition operations in order to reconstruct r from r and r .",
        "This, in turn, allows us to infer complete noun-attribute-adjective triples from individually acquired noun-attribute and adjective-attribute representations.",
        "The contributions of our work are as follows: (i) We propose a framework for attribute selection based on structured vector space models (VSM), using as meaning dimensions attributes elicited by adjectives; (ii) we complement this novel representation of adjective meaning with structured vectors for noun meanings similarly built on attributes as meaning dimensions; (iii) we propose a composition of these representations that mirrors principles of compositional semantics in mapping adjective-noun phrases to their corresponding ontological representation; (iv) we propose and evaluate several metrics for the selection of meaningful components from vector representations."

        "As seen in Fig. 1, these ambiguities are nicely captured by the separate vector representations for the adjective and the noun (upper part); by composing these representations, the ambiguity is resolved (lower part).",

        "This is illustrated in Fig. 1, a typical configuration, with one vector representing a typical property-denoting adjective that exhibits relatively strong peaks on one or more dimensions, whereas noun vectors show a tendency for broad and flat distributions over their dimensions.",

        "We use H(v) to assess the impact of singular vector components on the overall entropy of the vector: We expect entropy to detect components that contribute noise, as opposed to those that contribute important information.",
        "We define an algorithm for entropy-based attribute selection that returns a list of informative dimensions.",
        "The algorithm successively suppresses (combinations of) vector components one by one.",
        "Given that a gain of entropy is equivalent to a loss of information and vice versa, we assume that every combination of components that leads to an increase in entropy when being suppressed is actually responsible for a substantial amount of information.",
        "The algorithm includes a back-off to MPC for the special case that a vector contains a single peak (i.e., H(v) = 0), so that, in principle, it should be applicable to vectors of any kind.",
        "Vectors with very broad distributions over their dimensions, however, pose a problem to this method.",
        "For ball in Fig. 1, for instance, the method does not select any dimension.",
        "Median Selection (MSel).",
        "As a further method we rely on the median m that can be informally defined as the value that separates the upper from the lower half of a distribution (Krengel, 2003).",
        "it is less restrictive than MPC and TSel and overcomes the particular drawback of ESel.",
        "Using this measure, we choose all dimensions whose components exceed m. Thus, for the vector representing",
        "ball, weight, direction, shape, speed and size are selected.",
        "We use vector composition as a hinge to combine adjective and noun vectors in order to reconstruct the triple r=(noun, attribute, adjective).",
        "Mitchell and Lapata (2008) distinguish two major classes of vector composition operations, namely multiplicative and additive operations, that can be extended in various ways.",
        "We use their standard definitions (denoted x and +, henceforth).",
        "For our task, we expect x to perform best as it comes closest to the linguistic function ofintersective adjectives, i.e. to select dimensions that are prominent both for the adjective and the noun, whereas + basically blurs the vector components, as can be seen in the lower part of Fig. 1.",
        "We follow Padó and Lapata (2007) in defining a semantic space as a matrix M = B x T relating a set of target elements T to a set of basis elements B.",

        "Section 3.2.1).",
        "The target elements represented in the vector space comprise all adjectives Ta that match the patterns A1 to A5 in the corpus, provided they exceed a frequency threshold n. During development, n was set to 5 in order to filter noise.",

        "The stronger performance of the entropy-based method with the x operator is mainly due to its accuracy on detecting false positives, in that it is able to return \"empty\" selections.",
        "In terms of precision, MSel did worse in general, while recall is decent.",
        "This underlines that vector composition generally promotes meaningful components, but MSel is too inaccurate to select them.",

        "We proposed a structured VSM as a framework for inferring hidden attributes from the compositional semantics of adjective-noun phrases.",
        "By reconstructing Almuhareb (2006), we showed that structured vector representations of adjective meaning consistently outperform simple pattern-based learning, up to 13 pp.",
        "in precision.",
        "A combination of target filtering and pattern weighting turned out to be effective here, by selecting particulary meaningful lexico-syntactic contexts and filtering adjectives that are not property-denoting.",
        "Further studies need to investigate this phenomenon and its most appropriate formulation in a vector space framework.",
        "Moreover, the VSM offers a natural representation for sense ambiguity of adjectives.",
        "Comparing attribute selection methods on adjective and noun vectors shows that they are sensitive to the distributional structure ofthe vectors, and need to be chosen with care.",
        "Future work will investigate these selection methods in high-dimensional vectors spaces, by using larger sets ofattributes.",
        "Exp3 shows that the composition of pattern-based adjective and noun vectors robustly reflects aspects of meaning composition in adjective-noun phrases, with attributes as a hidden dimension.",
        "It also suggests that composition is effective in disambiguation of adjective and noun meanings.",
        "This hypothesis needs to be substantiated in further experiments.",
        "Finally, we showed that composition of vectors representing complementary meaning aspects can be beneficial to overcome sparsity effects.",
        "However, our compositional approach meets its limits if the patterns capturing adjective and noun meaning in isolation are too sparse to acquire sufficiently populated vector components from corpora.",
        "For future work, we envisage using vector similarity to acquire structured vectors for infrequent targets from semantic spaces that convey less linguistic structure to address these remaining sparsity issues.",
