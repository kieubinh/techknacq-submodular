        "Combinatory Categorial Grammar (Steedman, 2000) is a linguistically expressive grammar formalism that has been used for many NLP applications, including wide-coverage parsing (Clark and Curran, 2007; Hockenmaier, 2003) and semantic interpretation (Curran et al., 2007), semantic role-labeling (Gildea and Hockenmaier, 2003; Boxwell et al., 2009), semantic parsing (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005) and natural language generation (Espinosa et al., 2008).",
        "An essential feature of CCG is its flexible constituent structure, licensed by type-raising and composition rules which can create \"nonstandard\" constituents such as \"John saw\",or \"Mary talked to\", required in constructions involving non-local dependencies, such as wh-extraction (Fig.",
        "1) or right-node raising.",
        "Since \"John saw\" can now also be a constituent in \"John saw Mary\", this leads to a combinatorial explosion of spurious ambiguities,i.e.",
        "multiple syntactic derivations of the same semantic interpretation (Wittenburg, 1986).",
        "This can create problems for applications based on CCG, e.g. for the induction of stochastic CCGs from text annotated with logical forms (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2007), where spreading probability mass over equivalent derivations should be avoided.",
        "A number of normal-form (NF) parsing algorithms that aim to produce only one derivation per interpretation have been proposed (Wittenburg, 1986; Niv, 1994; Pareschi and Steedman, 1987; Hepple and Morrill, 1989; Eisner, 1996).",
        "Computationally, such algorithms are very attractive since they do not require costly semantic equivalence checks (Karttunen, 1989; Komagata, 2004) during parsing.",
        "Eisner's (1996) normal form is the most developed and well-known of these approaches, but is only defined for a variant of CCG where type-raising is a lexical operation and where the degree of composition is unbounded.",
        "Therefore, it and its equivalent reformulation by Hoyt and Baldridge (2008) in a multimodal variant of CCG are not safe (preserve all interpretations) and complete (remove all spurious ambiguities) for more commonly used variants of CCG.",
        "In particular, this NF is not safe when the degree of composition is bounded, and not complete when type-raising is a grammatical operation.",
        "This paper defines a NF for CCG with bounded composition and grammatical type-raising."

        "We have proposed a modification and extension of Eisner (1996)'s normal form that is more appropriate for commonly used variants of CCG with grammatical type-raising and generalized composition of bounded degree, as well as some non-combinatory extensions to CCG.",
        "Our experiments indicate that incorporating normal form constraints to deal with grammatical type-raising drastically reduces the number of derivations.",
        "We have sketched the outline of a proof that our normal form is safe and complete for the variant of CCG we consider, althoug we have seen that under certain circumstances, type-raising of unbounded degree may be required.",
        "Future work will investigate this issue further, and will also aim to turn our informal arguments about the adequacy of our approach into a full proof, and provide more experiments on a wider range ofgram-mars and languages.",
