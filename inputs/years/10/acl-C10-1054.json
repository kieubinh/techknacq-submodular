        "Bilingual corpora are very valuable resources in NLP.",

        "Hansards, or parliamentary proceedings in more than one language, are obvious source of bilingual corpora, yet they are about a particular domain and therefore of limited use.",
        "Many researchers then explore the Web.",
        "Some approach attempts to locate bilingual text within a web page (Jiang et al., 2009); some others attempt to collect web pages in different languages and decide the parallel relationship between the web pages by means of structural cues, like existence of a common ancestor web page, similarity between URLs, and similarity between the",
        "HTML structures (Chen and Nie, 2000; Resnik and Smith, 2003; Yang and Li, 2003; Shi et al., 2006).",
        "The corpora thus obtained are generally of high quality and wide variety in domain, but the amount is still limited, as web pages that exhibit those structural cues are not abundant.",
        "Some other effort is to mine bilingual corpora by textual means only.",
        "That is, two pieces of text are decided to be parallel merely from the linguistic perspective, without considering any hint from HTML markup or website structure.",
        "These approaches (Zhao and Vogel, 2002; Utiyama and Isahara 2003; Fung and Cheung, 2004; Munteanu and Marcu, 2005; Abdul-Rauf and Schwenk, 2009) share roughly the same framework:",
        "Phase 1: Document Pair Retrieval",
        "1) documents in some target language (TL) are stored in some database;",
        "2) each document in some source language (SL) is represented by some TL keywords;",
        "3) the TL keywords in (2) are used to assign some TL documents to a particular SL document, using some information retrieval (IR) technique.",
        "For example, Munteanu and Mar-cu (2005) apply the Lemur IR toolkit, Utiyama and Isahara (2003) use the BM25 similarity measure, and Fung and Cheung (2004) use cosine similarity.",
        "Each TL document pairs up with the SL document to form a candidate parallel document pair.",
        "Phase 2: Sentence Pair Extraction",
        "1) sentence pairs can be obtained by running sentence alignment over all candidate document pairs (or a selection of them) (Zhao and Vogel, 2002; Utiyama and Isahara, 2003);",
        "2) sentence pairs can also be selected, by some classifier or reliability measure, from the candidate sentence pairs enumerated from the candidate document pairs (Munteanu and",
        "Marcu, 2005).",
        "Note that the primary interest of these approaches is sentence pairs rather than document pairs, partially because document pair retrieval is not accurate, and partially because the ultimate purpose of these corpora is SMT training, which is based on sentence pairs.",
        "It is found that most of the sentence pairs thus obtained are not truly parallel; rather they are loose translations of each other or they carry partially similar messages.",
        "Such bilingual corpora are thus known as comparable corpora, while genuinely mutual translations constitute parallel corpora.",
        "Note also that all these comparable corpus mining approaches are tested on closed document collections only.",
        "For example, Zhao and Vogel (2002), Utiyama and Isahara (2003), and Munteanu and Marcu (2005) all acquire their comparable corpora from a collection of news articles which are either downloaded from the Web or archived by LDC.",
        "The search of candidate document pairs in such a closed collection is easy in three ways:",
        "1) all the TL documents come from the same news agency and they are not mixed up with similar documents from other news agencies;",
        "2) all the TL documents are news text and they are not mixed up with text of other domains;",
        "3) in fact, the search in these approaches is made easier by applying tricks like date window.",
        "There is no evidence that these methods apply to corpus mining from an open document collection (e.g. the entire Web) without search constraint.",
        "The possibility of open-ended text mining is a crucial problem.",
        "This paper focuses on bilingual corpus mining using only textual means.",
        "It attempts to answer two questions:",
        "1) Can comparable corpus mining be applied to an open document collection, i.e., the Web?",
        "2) Can comparable corpus mining be adapted to parallel corpus mining?",
        "We give affirmation to both questions.",
        "For the first problem, we modify document pair retrieval so that there is no longer a closed set of TL documents.",
        "Instead we search for candidate TL documents for a particular SL document from the Web by means of some Web search engine.",
        "For the second problem, in Phase 2 we replace the sentence pair classifier by a document pair filter and a sentence alignment module.",
        "Based on end-to-end SMT experiments, we will show that 1) high quality bilingual corpora can be mined from the Web; 2) the very first key to Web-mining of bilingual corpus is the formulation of good TL keywords to represent a SL document; 3) a simple document pair filter using IBM Model 1 probabilities is able to identify parallel corpus out of noisy comparable text; and 4) Web-mined parallel corpus, despite its smaller size, improves SMT much more than Web-mined comparable corpus."

        "Then the task is to search for the English sentences corresponding to those in the selected SL articles.",
        "These selected SL news articles all contain cue phrases like \"^ftlë^bÉiÂiS\" (according to foreign media), as these cue phrases suggest that the Chinese articles are likely to have English counterparts.",

      "heading": "3. Document Pair Retrieval",
      "text": [
        "Conventional approaches to comparable corpus mining usually start with document pair retrieval, which assigns to each SL document a set of candidate TL documents.",
        "This step is essentially a preliminary search for candidate sentence pairs for further scrutiny in Phase 2.",
        "The target is to find document pairs which may contain many good sentence pairs, rather than to discard document pairs which may not contain good sentence pairs.",
        "Therefore, recall is much more emphasized than precision.",
        "Document pair retrieval in conventional approaches presumes a closed set of TL documents which some IR system can handle easily.",
        "In this paper we override this presumption and attempt a much more challenging retrieval task, viz. to search for TL documents among the Web, using the search engines of Google and Yahoo.",
        "Therefore we are subject to a much noisier data domain.",
        "The correct TL documents may not be indexed by the search engines at all, and even when the target documents are indexed, it requires a more sophisticated formulation of queries to retrieve them.",
        "In response to these challenges, we propose various kinds of queries (elaborated in the following subsections).",
        "Moreover, we merge the TL documents found by each query into a big collection, so as to boost up the recall.",
        "In case a query fails to retrieve any document, we iteratively drop a keyword in the query until some documents are found.",
        "On the other hand, although the document pairs in question are of news domain, we use the general Google/Yahoo web search engines instead of the specific news search engines, because 1) the news search engines keep only a few web pages for all pages about the same news event, and 2) we leave open possibility for correct TL documents to be found in non-news web pages.",
        "There are three baseline formulations of queries:",
        "1) Query of translations of SL TF-IDF-ranked keywords (QSL-TFIDF).",
        "This is the method proposed by Munteanu and Marcu (2005).",
        "All the words in a SL document are ranked by TF-IDF and the top-N words are selected.",
        "Each keyword is then translated into a few TL words by a statistically learned dictionary.",
        "In our experiments the dictionary is learned from NIST SMT training data.",
        "2) Query of TF-IDF-ranked machine translated keywords (QTL-TFIDF).",
        "It is assumed that a machine translation (MT) system is better at handling lexical ambiguity than simple dictionary translation.",
        "Thus we propose to first translate the SL document into TL and extract the top-N TF-IDF-ranked words as query.",
        "In our experiments the MT system used is hierarchical phrase-based system (Chiang, 2007).",
        "3) Query of named entities (QNE).",
        "Another way to tackle the drawback of QSL-TFIDF is to focus on named entities (NEs) only, since NEs often provide strong clue for identifying correspondence between two languages.",
        "All NEs in a SL document are ranked by TF-IDF, and the top-N NEs are then translated (word by word) by dictionary.",
        "In our experiments we identify SL (Chinese) NEs",
        "implicitly found by the word segmentation algorithm stated in Gao et al.",
        "(2003), and the dictionaries for translating NEs include the same one used for QSL-TFIDF, and the LDC Chinese/English NE dictionary.",
        "For the NEs not covered by our dictionary, we use Google translation service as a back-up.",
        "A small-scale experiment is run to evaluate the merits of these queries.",
        "300 Chinese news web pages in three different periods (each 100) are collected.",
        "For each Chinese text, each query (containing 10 keywords) is constructed and submitted to both Google and Yahoo Search, and top-40 returned English web pages for each search are kept.",
        "Note that the Chinese news articles are not part of 11,000 pages in section 2.",
        "In fact, they do not only satisfy the requirement of length and cue phrases (described in section 2), but they also have another property that they are translated from some English news articles (henceforth target pages) on the Web.",
        "Thus they are ideal data for studying the performance of document pair retrieval.",
        "To test the influence of translation quality in document pair retrieval, we also try 'oracle queries', i.e. queries formulated directly from the target pages:",
        "1) OQTFIDF.",
        "This is the query of the top-N TF-IDF-ranked words from the target page.",
        "2) OQNE.",
        "This is the query of the top-N TF-IDF-ranked NEs from the target web page.",
        "We define recall as the proportion of SL documents whose true target pages are found.",
        "The comparison between a retrieved page and the target page is done by Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) ratio, defined as the length of the longest common word sequence of two documents divided by the length of the longer of two documents.",
        "The threshold 0.7 is adopted as it is strict enough to distinguish parallel document pairs from non-parallel ones.",
        "Table 1 shows the recalls for various queries.",
        "It can be seen from Tests 6 and 7 that the largest recall, 85% (within top 40 search results), is achieved when the word distributions in the target web pages are known.",
        "In the real scenario where the true English word distribution is not known, the recalls achieved by the simple queries are very unsatisfactory, as shown by Tests 1 to 3.",
        "This clearly shows how challenging Web-based mining of bilingual corpora is.",
        "Another challenge can be observed in comparing across",
        "Table 1: Recall (%age) of simple queries.",

        "columns, viz. it is much more difficult to retrieve outdated news document pairs.",
        "This implies that bilingual news mining must be incrementally carried out.",
        "Comparing Test 1 to Tests 2 and 3, it is obvious that QsL-TFIDF is not very useful in document pair retrieval.",
        "This confirms our hypothesis that suitable TL keywords are not likely to be obtained by simple dictionary lookup.",
        "While the recalls by Qtl-tfidf are similar to those by QNE, the two queries contribute in different ways.",
        "Test 4 simply merges the Web search results in Tests 2 and 3.",
        "The significantly higher recalls in Test 4 imply that each of the two queries finds substantially different targets than each other.",
        "The comparison of Test 5 to Test 4 further confirms the weakness of Qsl-tfidf.",
        "The huge gap between the three simple queries and the oracle queries shows that the quality of translation of keywords from SL to TL is a major obstacle.",
        "There are two problems in translation quality: 1) the MT system or dictionary cannot produce any translation for a SL word (let us refer to such TL keywords as 'Utopian translations'); 2) the MT system or dictionary produces an incorrect translation for a SL word.",
        "We can do very little for the Utopian translations, as the only solution is simply to use a better MT system or a larger dictionary.",
        "On the contrary, it seems that the second problem can somewhat be alleviated, if we have a way to distinguish those terms that are likely to be correct translations from those terms that are not.",
        "In other words, it may be worthwhile to reorder candidate TL keywords by our confidence in its translation quality.",
        "Tests 8 and 9 in Table 1 show that this hypothesis is promising.",
        "In both tests the TF-IDF-based (Test 8) or the NE-based (Test 9) keywords are selected from only those TL words that appear both in the target page and the machine translated text of the source page.",
        "In other words, we ensure that the keywords in the query must be correct translations.",
        "The recalls (especially the recalls by NE-based query in Test 9) are very close to the recalls by oracle queries.",
        "The conclusion is, even though we cannot produce the Utopian translations, document pair retrieval can be improved to a large extent by removing incorrect translations.",
        "Even an imperfect MT system or NE dictionary can help us achieve as good document pair retrieval recall as oracle queries.",
        "In the next subsection we will take this insight into our bilingual data mining system, by selecting keywords which are likely to be correct translation.",
        "Machine learning is applied to re-rank keywords for a particular document.",
        "The re-ranking of keywords is based on two principles.",
        "The first one is, of course, the confidence on the translation quality.",

In the first way of labeling (Lall), the label 3 is assigned to those words in S which are ranked among top 5 in Tall, label 2 to those ranked among top 10 but not top 5 in Tall, 1 to those beyond top 10 but still in Tall, and 0 to those words which do not appear in Tall at all.",

        "It is a difficult task to evaluate the quality of automatically acquired bilingual corpora.",
        "As our ultimate purpose of mining bilingual corpora is to provide more and better training data for SMT, we evaluate the parallel and comparable corpora with respect to improvement in Bleu score (Papineni et al., 2002).",
        "Our experiment starts with the 11,000 Chinese documents as described in Section 2.",
        "We use various combinations of queries in document pair retrieval (Section 3).",
        "Based on the candidate document pairs, we produce both comparable corpora and parallel corpora using sentence pair extraction (Section 4).",
        "The corpora are then given to our SMT systems as training data.",
        "The SMT systems are our implementations of phrase-based SMT (Koehn et al., 2003) and hierarchical phrase-based SMT (Chiang, 2007).",
        "The two systems employ a 5-gram language model trained from the Xinhua section of the Gigaword corpus.",
        "There are many variations of the bilingual training dataset.",
        "The B1 section of the NIST SMT training set is selected as the baseline bilingual dataset; its size is of the same order of magnitude as most of the mined corpora so that the comparison is fair.",
        "Each of the mined bilingual corpora is compared to that baseline dataset, and we also evaluate the performance of the combination of each mined bilingual corpus with the baseline set.",

        "The SMT systems learn translation knowledge (phrase table and rule table) in standard way.",
        "The parameters in the underlying log-linear model are trained by Minimum Error Rate Training (Och, 2003) on the development set of NIST 2003 test set.",
        "The quality of translation output is evaluated by case-insensitive BLEU4 on NIST 2005 and NIST 2008 test sets.",
        "Table 3 lists the size of various mined parallel and comparable corpora against the baseline Bl bilingual dataset.",
        "It is obvious that for a specific type of query in document pair retrieval, the parallel corpus is significantly smaller than the corresponding comparable corpus.",
        "The apparent explanation is that a lot of document pairs are discarded due to the document",
        "Table 3: Statistics on corpus size.",
        "SP means sentence pair.",
        "'all simple', 'all ranked', and 'all query' refer to the merge of the retrieval results of all simple queries, all re-ranked queries, and all simple and re-ranked queries, respectively; M&M (after Munteanu and Marcu (2005) ) refers to Q sl-tfidf • pair filter.",
        "Note that the big difference in size of the two comparable corpora by single queries, i.e., Qrank-ne and M&M, verifies again that re-ranked queries based on NEs are more reliable in sentence pair extraction.",
        "Table 4 lists the Bleu scores obtained by augmenting the baseline bilingual training set with the mined corpora.",
        "The most important observation is that, despite their smaller size, parallel corpora lead to no less, and often better, improvement in translation quality than comparable corpora.",
        "That is especially true for the case where document pair retrieval is based on all five types of query.",
        "The superiority of parallel corpora confirms that, in Phase 2 (sentence pair extraction), quality is more important than quantity and thus the filtering of document pair/sentence pair must not be generous.",
        "On the other hand, sentence pair extraction for parallel corpora generally achieves the best result when all queries are applied in document pair retrieval.",
        "It is not sufficient to use the more sophisticated re-ranked queries.",
        "That means in Phase l quantity is more important and we must seek more ways to retrieve as many document pairs as possible.",
        "That also confirms the emphasis on recall in document pair retrieval.",
        "Looking into the performance of comparable corpora, it is observed that the M&M query does not effectively apply to Web mining of comparable corpora but the proposed queries do.",

        "It is not difficult to explain the difference.",
        "Both the baseline Bl training set and the NIST 2005 comprise news wire (in-domain) text only.",
        "Although the acquisition of bilingual data also targets news text, the noisy mined corpus can never compete with the well prepared Bl dataset.",
        "On the contrary, the NIST 2008 test set contains a large portion of out-of-domain text, and so the Bl set does not gain any advantage over Web mined corpora.",
        "It might be that better and/or larger Web mined corpus achieves the same performance as manually prepared corpus.",
        "Note also that the reduction in Bleu score by each mined corpus is roughly the same as that by each other, while in general parallel corpora are slightly better than comparable corpora."

        "However, unlike those conventional approaches, which work on closed document collection only, we propose different ways of formulating queries for discovering parallel documents over Web search engines.",
        "Using learning to rank algorithm, we re-rank keywords based on representativeness and translation quality.",
        "This new type of query significantly outperforms existing query formulation in retrieving document pairs.",

        "For mining news text, in future we plan to apply the proposed approach to other language pairs.",
        "Also, we will attempt to use metainformation implied in SL document, such as \"publishing date\" or \"news agency name\", as further clue to the document pair retrieval.",
