        "CDC has mainly been developed from two perspectives.",
        "First, in the Message Understanding Conference (MUC-6), CDC was viewed as an advanced task performed based on a set of Information Extraction (IE) artifacts.",
        "IE has been one of the central topics in NLP since the 1970s and gained much success in transforming natural language text to structured text.",
        "IE on the Web, however, is inherently very challenging.",
        "For one, the Web is comprised of such heterogenous content that IE systems, many of which are developed on tidy and domain-specific corpora, may achieve relatively limited coverage.",
        "Also, the content of web documents may not even be in the natural language form.",
        "Hence, though IE based features are quite precise, it is rather difficult to achieve good coverage that's necessary to disambiguate person entities on the Web.",
        "Recently, there is significant research interest in a related task called Web Person Search (WePS) (Artiles et al., 2007), which seeks to determine whether two documents refer to the same person given a person name search query.",
        "Many systems employed the simple vector space model and word co-occurrence features for this task.",
        "Though more robust with better coverage, these methods are more susceptible to irrelevant words with regard to the entity of interest.",
        "Rather than relying solely on IE based or word co-occurrence features, this work adopts a holistic view of the different types of features useful for cross document coreference.",
        "Specifically, the main features of our proposed CDC approach are:",
        "• The proposed approach covers the entire spectrum of document level, sub-document context level and entity/relation level disambiguation evidence.",
        "In particular, we propose to use document categories as robust document level evidence.",
        "This comprehensive design naturally combines state-of-the-art categorization, information extraction and IE-driven IR methods and compensates the limitation of each of them.",
        "• The features used in this work are domain independent and thus are particularly suitable for coreferencing web documents.",
        "• The composite pairwise coreference function in this work can readily incorporate a set of heterogenous features that are not always active or are in different ranges, making it easily extensible to additional features.",
        "Moreover, we thoroughly study the contribution of each component and its features to gain insight on improving cross document coreference performance.",
        "In this work, three components specialize in generating the aforementioned three levels of features as coreference decisions.",
        "Thus we refer to them as experts.",
        "After reviewing prior work on CDC, we describe the methods of each of these components in detail and present empirical results where appropriate.",
        "We then show how these components (and its features) are aggregated to predict pairwise coreference using an ensemble method.",
        "We evaluate the contribution of each component and the overall CDC results on a benchmark dataset.",

        "(Gooi and Allan, 2004) used a 55-word window as the context without significant accuracy penalty.",
        "As these approaches only considered word cooccurrence, they were more susceptible to genre differences.",
        "Recent CDC work has sought Information Extraction (IE) support.",
        "Extracted NEs and relationships were considered in (Niu et al., 2004) for improved CDC performance.",
        "Many of these earlier CDC methods were evaluated on small and tidy news articles.",
        "CDC for Web documents is even more challenging.",
        "(Wan et al., 2005) proposed a web person resolution system called WebHawk, which extracted several attributes such as title, organization, email and phone number using patterns.",
        "These features however only covered small amount of disambiguation evidence and certain types of web pages (such as personal home pages).",
        "The more recent Web Person created a benchmark dataset which is also used in this work.",
        "Different from CDC which aims to resolve mention level NEs, WePS distinguishes documents retrieved by a name search query according to the underlying identity.",
        "The top-performing system (Chen and Martin, 2007) in this task extracted phrasal contextual and document-level entities as rich features for coreference.",
        "Similar IR features are also used by other WePS systems as they are more robust to the variety of web pages (Artiles et al., 2007).",
        "Instead of focusing on local information, (Li et al., 2004) proposed a generative model of entity co-occurrence to capture global document level information.",
        "However, inference in generative models is expensive for large scale web data.",
        "Our work instead considers document categories/topics that can be efficiently predicted and easily interpretable by users.",
        "Hand-tuned weights were used in (Baron and Freedman, 2008) and a linear classifier was used in (Li et al., 2004) to combine the extracted features.",

        "Neither of these pages contain complete natural language sentences that most IE and NLP tools are designed to process.",

        "The Open Directory Project (ODP), the largest and most comprehensive human edited directory of the Web, contains hundreds of thousands of categories labeled for 2 million Web pages.",
        "Leveraging this vast amount of web data and the large Web taxonomy has called for the development of very efficient text categorization methods.",
        "There is significant research interest in scaling up to categorize millions of pages to thousands of categories and beyond, called the many class classification setting (Madani and Huang, 2008).",
        "Flat classification methods (e.g. (Crammer et al., 2006; Madani and Huang, 2008)), which treat hierarchical categories as flat classes, have been very successful due to their superior scalability and simplicity compared to classical hierarchical one-against-rest categorization.",
        "Flat methods also achieve high accuracy that is on par with, or better than, the traditional counterparts.",
        "We adopt a flat multiclass online classification algorithm Passive Aggressive (PA) (Crammer et al., 2006) to predict ranked categories for web documents.",
        "For a categorization problem with C categories, PA associates each category k with a weight vector wk, called its prototype.",
        "The degree of confidence for predicting category k with respect to an instance x (both in online training and testing) is determined by the similarity between the instance and the prototype – the inner product wk • x. PA predicts a ranked list of categories according to this confidence.",
        "PA is a family of online and large-margin based classifiers.",
        "Given an instance (xt, yt) during online learning, the multiclass margin margin PA is the difference between the score of the true category yt and that of the highest ranked false positive category s, i.e.",
        "where s = arg maxs=yt ws • xt.",
        "A positive margin value indicates that the algorithm makes a correct prediction.",
        "One is however not only satisfied with a positive margin value, but also seeks to achieve a margin value of at least 1.",
        "When this is not satisfied, the online algorithm suffers a multiclass hinge loss:",
        "where w = (w,wC) denotes the concatenation of the C prototypes (into a vector).",
        "In an online learning step, the PA-II variant updates the category prototype with the solution of this constrained optimization problem,",
        "Essentially, if the margin is met (also implying no misclassification), PA passively accepts the current solution.",
        "Otherwise, PA aggressively learns the new prototype which satisfies the loss constraint and stays as close to the one previously learned as possible.",
        "To cope with label noise, PA-II introduces a slack variable S in the optimization for a gentler update, a technique previously employed to derive soft-margin classifiers (Vapnik, 1998).",
        "A is a parameter that controls the aggressiveness of the update.",
        "The solution to the above optimization problem amounts to only changing the two prototypes violating the margin in the update step:",
        "To conclude, PA treats the hierarchy as flat categories for multiclass classification.",
        "It is similar to Multiclass Perceptron (Crammer and Singer, 2003) but only updates two vectors per iteration and thus is more efficient.",
        "Conceptually, the text categorization component can be viewed as a function that maps a document d to a ranked list of top K categories along with their respective confidence scores, i.e.",
        "We leverage these document categories to measure the pairwise similarity of any two documents, sim((/>(dM), (/>(dv)), for entity disambiguation.",
        "Given a taxonomy T, we first formally define the affinity between a category c and one of its ancestor category cC in T as:",
        "affinity(c; cC) where len is the length of the shortest path between the two categories and depth(T) denotes the depth of the taxonomy.",
        "In other words, affinity is the complementary of the normalized path length between c and its ancestor c'.",
        "Using graph theory terminology, LCA(ci;c2) denote the lowest common ancestor of two categories ci and c2 in T. Given two category lists, <P(du) = {< >,..,< cK,sK >} and ((((dv) = {< ci,si >,..,< cK,sK >}, we use the LCA(cu, cv) of each category pair cu and cvas the basis to measure similarity.",
        "Formally, we transform (/>(du) to a K x K dimensional vector:",
        "where i,j = 1..K. In other words, we project (/>(dM) into a vector in the space spanned by the LCAs of category pairs.",
        "Using the same bases, we can derive v(dv) analogically.",
        "With this transformation, (/>(dM) and 0(dv) are expressed in the common bases, i.e. their LCAs.",
        "Therefore, the similarity between the top K categories of two documents can be measured by the inner product of these two vectors:",
        "To handle the diverse topics of Web documents, we leverage the ODP data to train the many class categorization algorithm.",

        "This dataset has 1,889,683 instances and 4,891 categories in total.",
        "Finally, stratified 8020 split was performed on this dataset, i.e. 1.5M pages for training and 377K pages for testing.",
        "As we view the taxonomy as a set of flat categories and we are interested in the top K categories, we use the recall at K metric for evaluation.",
        "Recall at K is defined as the percentage of instances having their true category ranked among the top K slots in the category list.",
        "For a single label dataset (most ODP pages have one category) and K = 1, this is the accuracy metric in multiclass classification.",
        "Note that in the many class setting, recall at 1 is a very strict metric as no credit is given for predicting the parent, children or sibling categories; also, documents may have valid secondary topics not labeled by humans.",

        "Note that though our evaluation is based on the mention level entities, the baselines One-In-One (OIO, placing each entity in a separate cluster) and All-In-One (AIO, putting all entities in one cluster) have almost identical results as those in the evaluation.",
        "OIO can yield good performance, indicating that the names in test data are highly ambiguous.",
        "As alluded to in the title, context and categories both are very useful disambiguation features.",
        "CNTX is essentially very similar to the system presented in (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998b) and is a strong baseline (outperforming 3/4 of the systems in WePS).",
        "Note that CNTX has high purity but inferior inverse purity, indicating that using the context extracted by the IE system alone is unable to link many coreferent entities.",
        "Interestingly, we observe that using only the top-K categories (TC1 + 3) can also achieve competitive F score, though in a very different manner.",
        "TC1+3 recalls much more coreferent entities (signiicantly improving inverse purity), but at the same time also introduces noise.",
        "Finally, adding document categories and using IE results (i.e. using all features in Table 1), our CDC system achieves 22% and 18% relative improvement compared to CNTX in F (purity) and B-CUBED scores, respectively.",
        "In particular, inverse purity improves by 46% relatively, implying that the additional evidence signiicantly improves the recall of coreferent entities (when there is a lack of context similarity in the traditional method).",
        "Overall, the comprehensive approach in this work outperforms the top-tiered systems in the WePS evaluation."

        "This work proposes a synergy of three levels of analysis for the web cross document coreference task.",
        "On the document level, we use text categories, trained from thousands of ODP categories and over a million pages, as a concise representation of the documents.",
        "Categorization is a robust strategy for coreferencing web documents with diverse topics, formats and when there is a lack of extraction coverage or word matching.",
        "Two types of sub-document level evidence are also used in our approach.",
        "First, we apply an information extraction system to extract attributes and relations of named entities from the documents and perform within document coreference.",
        "Second, we use the context of the entities, a natural outcome of the IE system as a focused description of the named entity that may miss the extraction process.",
        "A CDC system has been implemented based on the IE and the text categorization components to provide a comprehensive solution to the web CDC task.",
        "We demonstrate the importance of each component in our system and benchmark our system with the WePS dataset which shows superior CDC performance.",
        "There are a number of interesting directions for future research.",
        "Recently, Open IE was proposed in (Etzioni et al., 2008) for Web information extraction.",
        "This can be a more powerful alternative to traditional IE toolkits for Web CDC, though measuring the semantic similarity for a vast variety of relations can be another research issue.",
        "Employing external background knowledge such as Wikipedia (Han and Zhao, 2009) while maintaining scalability can also be an orthogonal direction for further improvement.",
