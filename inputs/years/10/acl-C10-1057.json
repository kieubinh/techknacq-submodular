        "Bar the accurate manual curation typified by Cyc (Lenat, 1995), most fact bases are built using either semi-supervised techniques or wisdom of the crowds techniques, rendering them inherently noisy.",
        "This paper describes algorithms to validate and re-rank fact bases leveraging global constraints imposed by the semantic arguments predicated by the relations.",
        "Facts are defined as instances of nary typed relations such as acted-in(movie, actor), director-of(movie, director), born-in(person, date), and buy {person, product, person).",
        "In all but very small fact bases, relations share an argument type, such as movie for the relations acted-in and director-ofin the above example.",
        "The hypothesis explored in this paper is that when two fact instances from two relations share the same value for a shared argument type, then the validity of both facts should be increased.",
        "Conversely, we also hypothesize that an incorrect fact instance will tend to match a shared argument with other facts far less frequently.",
        "For example, consider the following four facts from the relations acted-in, director-of, and is-actor:",
        "ti: acted-in(Psycho, Anthony Perkins) t2 : *acted-in(Walt Disney Pictures, Johnny Depp)",
        "t3: director-of(Psycho, Alfred Hitchcock)",
        "t4: is-actor(Anthony Perkins)",
        "Our confidence in the validity of t\\ increases with the knowledge of t3 and t4 since the argument movie is shared with t3 and actor with t4.",
        "Similarly, t\\ increases our confidence in the validity of t3 and t4.",
        "For t2, we expect to find few facts that will match a movie argument with Walt Disney Pictures.",
        "Facts that share the actor argument Johnny Depp with t2 will increase its validity, but the lack of matches on its movie argument will decrease its validity.",
        "In this paper, we present FactRank, which formalizes the above intuitions by constructing a fact graph and running various random walk graphranking algorithms over it to re-rank and validate the facts.",
        "A collection of facts is modeled in the form of a graph where nodes are fact instances and edges connect nodes that have the same value for a shared argument type (e.g., t\\ would be linked by an edge to both t3 and t4.)",
        "Given a graph representation of facts, we explore various random walk algorithms to propagate our confidence in individual facts through the web of facts.",
        "We explore algorithms such as PageRank (Page et al., 1999) as well as propose novel algorithms that leverage several unique characteristics of fact graphs.",
        "Finally, we present an empirical analysis, over a large collection of facts extracted from a 500 million document webcrawl, supporting our model and confirming that global constraints in a fact base can be leveraged to improve the quality of the facts.",
        "Our proposed algorithms are agnostic to the sources of a fact base, however our reported experiments were carried over a state-of-the-art semi-supervised extraction system.",
        "In summary, the main contributions of this paper are:",

        "• We propose novel ranking algorithms using random walk models on facts (Section 3).",

        "We model this idea by propagating extraction scores through the fact graph similarly to how authority is propagated through a hyperlink graph of the Web (used to estimate the importance of a webpage).",
        "Several link structure analysis algorithms have been proposed for this goal, of which we explore a particular example, namely, PageRank (Page et al., 1999).",
        "The premise behind PageRank is that given the hyperlink structure of the Web, when a page V generates a link to page u, it confers some of its importance to u.",
        "Therefore, the importance of a webpage u depends on the number of pages that link to u and furthermore, on the importance of the pages that link to u.",
        "More formally, given a directed graph G = (V, E) with V vertices and E edges, let I(u) be the set of nodes that link to a node u and O(v) be the set of nodes linked by V. Then, the importance of a node u is defined as:",
        "The PageRank algorithm iteratively updates the scores for each node in G and terminates when a convergence threshold is met.",
        "To guarantee the algorithm's convergence, G must be irreducible and aperiodic (i.e., a connected graph).",
        "The first constraint can be easily met by converting the adjacency matrix for G into a stochastic matrix (i.e., all rows sum up to 1.)",
        "To address the issue of periodicity, Page et al.",
        "(1999) suggested the following modification to Equation 1:",
        "where d is a damping factor between 0 and 1, which is commonly set to 0.85.",
        "Intuitively, PageRank can be viewed as modeling a \"random walker\" on the nodes in G and the score ofanode, i.e., PageRank, determines the probability of the walker arriving at this node.",
        "While our method makes use of the PageRank algorithm, we can also use other graph analysis algorithms (e.g., HITS (Kleinberg, 1999)).",
        "A particularly important property of the PageRank algorithm is that the stationary scores can be computed for undirected graphs in the same manner described above, after replacing each undirected edge by a bi-directed edge.",
        "Recall that the edges in a fact graph are bidirectional (see Figure 1).",
        "Below, we explore various random walk models to assign scores to each node in a fact graph FG.",
        "Pln: Our first method applies the traditional PageRank model to FG and computes the score of a node u using Equation 2.",
        "Traditional PageRank, as is, does not make use of the strength of the links or the nodes connected by an edge.",
        "Based on this observation, researchers have proposed several variations of the PageRank algorithm in order to solve their problems.",
        "For instance, variations of random walk algorithms have been applied to the task of extracting important words from a document (Hassan et al., 2007), for summarizing documents (Erkan and Radev, 2004), and for ordering user preferences (Liu and Yang, 2008).",
        "Following the same idea, we build upon the discussion in Section 3.2 and present random walk models that incorporate the strength of an edge.",
        "Dst: One improvement over Pin is to distinguish between nodes in FG using the extraction scores of the facts associated with them: extraction methods such as our reimplementation of (Pa§ca et al., 2006) assign scores to each output fact to reflect its confidence in it (see Section 3.2).",
        "Intuitively, a higher scoring node that connects to u should increase the importance of u more than a connection from a lower scoring node.",
        "Let I(u) be the set of nodes that link to u and O(v) be the set of nodes linked by v. Then, if w(u) is the extraction score for the fact represented by node u, the score for node u is defined:",
        "where w(v) is the confidence score for the fact represented by v. Naturally, other (externally derived) extraction scores can also be substituted for w(v).",
        "Avg: We can further extend the idea of determining the strength of an edge by combining the extraction scores of both nodes connected by an edge.",
        "Specifically, where avg(u, v) is the average of the extraction scores assigned to the facts associated with nodes u and v.",
        "Nde: In addition to using extraction scores, we can also derive the strength of a node depending on the number of distinct relations it connects to.",
        "For instance, in Figure 1, t\\ is linked to four distinct relations, namely, director-of, producer-of, is-actor, is-movie, whereas, t2 is linked to one relation, namely, is-actor.",
        "We compute p(u) as:",
        "where w(v) is the confidence score for node v and r(v) is the fraction of total number of relations in the farm that contain facts with edges to v.",
        "In traditional hyperlink graphs for the Web, dangling nodes (i.e., nodes with no associated edges) are considered to be of low importance which is appropriately represented by the scores computed by the PageRank algorithm.",
        "However, an important distinction from this setting is that fact graphs are sparse causing them to have valid facts with no counterpart matching arguments in other relation, thus rendering them dangling.",
        "This may be due to several reasons, e.g., extractors often suffer from less than perfect recall and they may miss valid facts.",
        "In our experiments, about 10% and 40% of nodes from acted-in and director-of, respectively, were dangling nodes.",
        "Handling dangling nodes in our extraction-based scenario is a particularly challenging issue: while demoting the validity of dangling nodes could critically hurt the quality of the facts, lack of global information prevents us from systematically introducing them into the re-ranked lists.",
        "We address this issue by maintaining the original rank positions when re-ranking dangling nodes.",
        "Our proposed random walk ranking methods ignore the ranking information made available by the original relation extractor (e.g., (Pa§ca et al., 2006) in our implementation).",

        "In practice, this linear combination can be learned; in our experiments, we set them to wo = 0.4 based on our observations over an independent training set.",
