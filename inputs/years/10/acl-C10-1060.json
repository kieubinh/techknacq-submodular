        "The word-segmentation task is an abstraction of part of the problem facing a child learning its native language.",
        "Fluent speech, even the speech directed at children, doesn't come with silence or pauses delineating acoustic words the way that spaces separate orthographic words in writing systems like that of English.",
        "Instead, as most people listening to a language they don't understand can attest, words in fluent speech \"run together\", and a language user needs to learn how to segment utterances of the language they are learning into words.",
        "This kind of word segmentation is presumably an important first step in acquiring a language.",
        "It is scientifically interesting to know what information might be useful for word segmentation, and just how this information might be used.",
        "These scientific questions have motivated a body of research on computational models of word segmentation.",
        "Since as far as we can tell any child can learn any human language, our goal is to develop a single model that can learn to perform accurate word segmentation given input from any human language, rather than a model that specialised to perform well on a single language.",
        "This paper extends the previous work on word segmentation by investigating whether one class of models that work very well with English input also work with Chinese input.",
        "These models will permit us to study the role that syllable structure constraints and tone in Chinese might play in word segmentation.",
        "While learners and fluent speakers undoubtedly use a wide variety of cues to perform word segmentation, computational models since El-man (1990) have tended to focus on the use of phonotactic constraints (e.g., syllable-structure constrains) and distributional information.",
        "Brent and Cartwright (1996) introduced the standard form of the word segmentation task still studied today.",
        "They extracted the orthographic representations of child-directed speech from the Bernstein-Ratner corpus (Bernstein-Ratner, 1987) and \"pho-nologised\" them by looking up each word in a pronouncing dictionary.",
        "For example, the orthographic utterance you want to see the book is mapped to the sequence of pronunciations yu want tu si D6 bUk, (the pronunciations are in an",
        "ASCII encoding of the International Phonetic Alphabet representation of English phonemes).",
        "The input to the learner is obtained by concatenating together the phonemic representations of each utterance's words.",
        "The learner's task is to identify the locations of the word boundaries in this sequence, and hence identify the words (up to ho-mophony).",
        "Brent and Cartwright (1996) pointed out the importance of both distributional information and phonotactic (e.g., syllable-structure) constraints for word segmentation (see also Swingley (2005) and Fleck (2008)).",
        "Recently there has been considerable interest in applying Bayesian inference techniques for non-parametric models to this problem.",
        "Here the term \"non-parametric\" does not mean that the models have no parameters, rather, it is used to distinguish these models from the usual \"parametric models\" that have a fixed finite vector of parameters.",

        "(2006) introduced two non-parametric Bayesian models of word segmentation, which are discussed in more detail in (Gold-water et al., 2009).",
        "The unigram model, which assumes that each word is generated independently to form a sentence, turned out to be equivalent to a model originally proposed by Brent (1999).",
        "The bigram model improves word segmentation accuracy by modelling bigram inter-word contextual dependencies, \"explaining away\" inter-word dependencies that would otherwise cause the unigram model to under-segment.",
        "Mochihashi et al.",
        "(2009) showed that segmentation accuracy could be improved by using a more sophisticated \"base distribution\" and a dynamic programming sampling algorithm very similar to the one used with the adaptor grammars below.",
        "They also applied their algorithm to Japanese and Chinese word segmentation, albeit from orthographic rather than phonemic forms, so unfortunately their results are not comparable with ours.",
        "Johnson et al.",
        "(2007) introduced adaptor grammars as a grammar-based framework for expressing a variety of non-parametric models, and provided a dynamic programming Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithm for performing Bayesian inference on these models.",
        "For example, the unigram model can be expressed as a simple adaptor grammar as shown below, and the generic adaptor grammar inference procedure provides a dynamic programming sampling algorithm for this model.",
        "Johnson (2008b) showed how a variety of different word segmentation models can be expressed as adaptor grammars, and Johnson and Goldwater (2009) described a number ofextensions and specialisations to the adaptor grammar framework that improve inference speed and accuracy (we use these techniques in our work below).",
        "Previous work on unsupervised word segmentation from phonemic input has tended to concentrate on English.",
        "However, presumably children the world over segment their first language input in the same (innately-specified) way, so a correct procedure should work for all possible human languages.",
        "However, as far as we are aware there has been relatively little work on word segmentation from phonemic input except on English.",
        "Johnson (2008a) investigated whether the adaptor grammars models that do very well on English also apply to Sesotho (a Bantu language spoken in southern Africa with rich agglutinating morphology).",
        "He found that the models in general do very poorly (presumably because the adaptor grammars used cannot model the complex morphology found in Sesotho) and that the best segmentation accuracy was considerably worse than that obtained for English, even when that model incorporated some Bantu-specific information about morphology.",
        "Of course it may also be that the Sesotho and English corpora are not really comparable: the Bernstein-Ratner corpus that Brent and other researchers have used for English was spoken to pre-linguistic 1-year olds, while most non-English corpora are of child-directed speech to older children who are capable of talking back, and hence these corpora are presumably more complex.",

        "We also ignored all utterances with codes Sinterj, Sunint, $voc and Sprmipt, as these are not always linguistic utterances.",
        "In addition, we deleted all words that could not be analysed as a sequence of syllables, such as \"xxx\" and \"hmm\", and also deleted \"cluck\".",

        "In the IPA format, the superscript indices indicate the tone patterns associated with syllables; these appear at the end of each syllable, as is standard.",
        "While we believe there are good linguistic reasons to analyse tones as associated with syllables, we moved all the tones so they immediately followed the final vowel in each syllable.",
        "We did this because we thought that locating tones after the syllable-final consonant might give our models a strong cue as to the location of syllable boundaries, and since words often end at syllable boundaries, this would make the word segmentation problem artificially easier.",
        "(Our models take a sequence of symbols as input, so the tones mustbe located somewhere in the sequence.",
        "However, the linguistically \"correct\" solution would probably be to extend the models so they could process input in an auto-segmental format (Goldsmith, 1990) where tones would be on a separate tier and unordered with respect to the segments within a syllable.)",
        "In order to evaluate the importance of tone for our word-segmentation models we also constructed a version of our corpus in which all tones were removed.",
        "We present results for all of our models on two versions of the corpus, one that contains tones following the vowels, and another that contains no tones at all.",
        "These two corpora constitute the \"gold standard\" against which our word segmentation models will be evaluated.",
        "These corpora contain 50,118 utterances, consisting of 187,533 word tokens.",
        "The training data provided to the word segmentation models is obtained by segmenting the gold data at all possible boundary locations.",
        "Consonant clusters, diphthongs and tones (ifpresent) are treated as single units, so the training data appears as follows:",

        "In order to do this, a model would need to memorise the probabilities of entire Word subtrees, since these are the units that correspond to individual words, but this PCFG simply is not expressive enough to do this.",
        "Adaptor grammars learn the probabilities of subtrees in just this way.",
        "An adaptor grammar is specified via a set of rules or productions, just like a CFG, and the set of trees that an adaptor grammar generates is exactly the same as the CFG with those rules.",

        "Rather than setting the concentration parameters by hand (there are two for each adapted non-terminal in the grammar) we follow Johnson and Goldwater (2009) and put uniform Beta and vague Gamma priors on each of these parameters, and use sampling to explore their posterior values.",
        "Because the probability of selecting a tree t is proportional to n(t), an adaptor grammar is a kind of \"rich-get-richer\" process that generates power-law distributions.",

        "An adaptor grammar is a kind of \"cache\" model, in which previously generated subtrees are stored and more likely to be reused in later sentences.",
        "That is, while an adapted non-terminal A can expand to any tree rooted in A that can be constructed with the grammar rules, in practice it is increasingly likely to reuse the same trees over and over again.",
        "It can be viewed as a kind of tree substitution grammar (Joshi, 2003), but where the tree fragments (as well as their probabilities) are learnt from the data.",
        "The unigram grammar is the simplest of the word segmentation models we investigate in this paper (it is equivalent to the unigram model investigated in Goldwater et al.",
        "(2009)).",

        "In a collocation grammar there are two different adapted non-terminals; Word and Colloc; Word expands exactly as in the unigram grammar (2), so it is not repeated here.",

        "The PYP associated with collocations either regenerates a previously generated collocation or else generates a \"fresh\" collocation by generating a sequence of words according to the PYP model explained above.",
        "The idea of aggregating words into collocations can be reapplied at a more abstract level by aggregating collocations into \"super-collocations\", which are sequences of collocations.",
        "This involves adding the following additional rules to the grammar in (3):",
        "There are three PYPs in a grammar with 2 levels of collocations, arranged in a strict Bayesian hierarchy.",
        "It should be clear that this process can be repeated indefinitely; we investigate grammars with up to three levels of collocations below.",
        "(It should be possible to use Bayesian techniques to learn the appropriate number of levels in the hierarchy, but we leave this for future work).",
        "Brent and Cartwright (1996) and others emphasise the role that syllable-structure and other phono-tactic constraints might play in word segmentation.",
        "Johnson (2008b) pointed out that adaptor grammars can learn at least some of these kinds of generalisations.",
        "It's not unreasonable to assume that language learners can learn to group phonemes into syllables, and that they can exploit this syllabic structure to perform word segmentation.",
        "The syllable-structure grammars we describe below assume that word boundaries are always aligned with syllable boundaries; this is not universally true, but it is reliable enough to dramatically improve unsupervised word segmentation in English.",
        "There is considerable cross-linguistic variation in the syllable-structure and phonotactic constraints operative in the languages ofthe world, so we'd like to avoid \"building in\" language-specific constraints into our model.",
        "We therefore make the relatively conservative assumption that the child can distinguish vowels from consonants, and that the child knows that syllables consist of Onsets, Nuclei and Codas, that Onsets and Codas consist of arbitrary sequences of consonants while Nuclei are arbitrary sequences of vowels and tones, and that Onsets and Codas are optional.",
        "Notice that syllable structure in both English and Chinese is considerably more constrained than this; we use this simple model here because it has proved successful for English word segmentation.",

        "We used the relatively cumbersome mechanism of enumerating each possible number of syllables per word (we permit words to consist of from 1 to 4 syllables, although ideally this number would not be hard-wired into the grammar) because a relatively trivial modification of this grammar can distinguish word-initial and wordfinal consonant clusters from word-internal clusters.",
        "Johnson (2008b) demonstrated that this significantly improves English word segmentation accuracy.",
        "We do not expect this to improve Chinese word segmentation because Chinese clusters do not vary depending on their location within the word, but it will be interesting to see if the additional cluster flexibility that is useful for English segmentation hurts Chinese segmentation.",
        "In this version of the syllable-structure grammar, we replace the Word rules in the syllable adaptor grammar with the following:",
        "Word-> SyllIF Word^ SyllI Syll SyllF ( )Word^ SyllI Syll Syll SyllF and add the following rules expanding the new kinds of syllables to the rules in (5).",

        "Above the Word level, there can be from zero to three levels ofcol-locations, yielding four different values for this dimension.",
        "Below the Word level, phonemes can either be treated as independent entities, or else they can be grouped into onset, nuclei and coda clusters, and these can vary depending on where they appear within a word.",
        "Thus there are three different values for the syllable dimension, so there are twelve different adaptor grammars overall.",
        "In addition, we ran all of these grammars on two versions of the corpus, one with tones and one without tones, so we report results for 24 different runs here.",
        "The adaptor grammar inference procedure we used is the one described in Johnson and Goldwa-ter (2009).",
        "We ran 1,000 iterations of 8 MCMC chains for each run, and we discarded all but last 200 iterations in order to \"burn-in\" the sampler.",
        "The segmentation we predict is the one that occurs the most frequently in the samples that were not discarded.",
        "As is standard, we evaluate the models in terms of token f-score; the results are presented in Tables 1 and 2.",
        "In these tables, \"None\" indicates that the grammar does not model syllable structure, \"General\" indicates that the grammar does not distinguish word-peripheral from word-internal clusters, while \"Specialised\" indicates that it does.",
        "\"Unigram\" indicates that the grammar does not model collocational structure, otherwise the superscript indicates the number of collocational levels that the grammar captures.",
        "Broadly speaking, the results are consistent with the English word segmentation results using adaptor grammars presented by Johnson (2008b).",
        "The unigram grammar segmentation accuracy is similar to that obtained for English, but the results for the other models are lower than the results for the corresponding adaptor grammars on English.",
        "We see a general improvement in segmentation accuracy as the number of collocation levels increases, just as for English.",
        "However, we do not see any general improvements associated with modelling syllables; indeed, it seems modelling syllables causes accuracy to decrease unless collocational structure is also modelled.",
        "This is somewhat surprising, as Chinese has a very regular syllabic structure.",
        "It is not surprising that distinguishing word-peripheral and word-medial clusters does not improve segmentation accuracy, as Chinese does not distinguish these kinds of clusters.",
        "There is also no sign of the \"synergies\" when modelling collocations and syllables together that Johnson (2008b) reported.",
        "It is also surprising that tones seem to make little difference to the segmentation accuracy, since they are crucial for disambiguating lexical items.",
        "The segmentation accuracy of the models that capture little or no inter-word dependencies (e.g., Unigram, Colloc) improved slightly when the input contains tones, but the best-performing models that capture a more complex set of inter-word dependencies do equally well on the corpus without tones as they do on the corpus with tones.",
        "Because these models capture rich inter-word context (they model three levels of collocational structure), it is possible that this context provides sufficient information to segment words even in the absence of tone information, i.e., the tonal information is redundant given the richer inter-word dependencies that these models capture.",

        "However, all 8 of the MCMC chains in this run produced lower f-scores, so it unlikely to be simply a random fluctuation produced by a single outlier.",
        "Note that one should be cautious when comparing the absolute f-scores from these experiments with those of the English study, as the English and Chinese corpora differ in many ways.",

        "The children involved in the Chinese corpus were also older than the children in the English corpus, which may also have affected the nature of the corpus."

        "This paper applied adaptor grammar models of phonemic word segmentation originally developed for English to Chinese data.",
        "While the Chinese data was prepared in a very different way to the English data, the adaptor grammars used to perform Chinese word segmentation were very similar to those used for the English word segmentation.",
        "They also achieved quite respectable f-score accuracies, which suggests that the same models can do well on both languages.",
        "One puzzling result is that incorporating syllable structure phonotactic constraints, which enhances English word segmentation accuracy considerably, doesn't seem to improve Chinese word segmentation to a similar extent.",
        "This may reflect the fact that the word segmentation adaptor grammars were originally designed and tuned for English, and perhaps differently formulated syllable-structure constraints would work well for Chinese.",
        "But even if one can \"tune\" the adaptor grammars to improve performance on Chinese, the challenge is doing this in a way that improves performance on all languages, rather than just one."
