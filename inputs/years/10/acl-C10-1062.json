        "An important aspect of a document is whether it is easily processed and understood by a human reader as intended by its writer, this is termed as the document's readability.",
        "Readability involves many aspects including grammaticality, conciseness, clarity, and lack of ambiguity.",
        "Teachers, journalists, editors, and other professionals routinely make judgements on the readability of documents.",
        "We explore the task of learning to automatically judge the readability of natural-language documents.",
        "In a variety of applications it would be useful to be able to automate readability judgements.",
        "For example, the results of a web-search can be ordered taking into account the readability of the retrieved documents thus improving user satisfaction.",
        "Readability judgements can also be used for automatically grading essays, selecting instructional reading materials, etc.",
        "If documents are generated by machines, such as summarization or machine translation systems, then they are prone to be less readable.",
        "In such cases, a readability measure can be used to automatically filter out documents which have poor readability.",
        "Even when the intended consumers of text are machines, for example, information extraction or knowledge extraction systems, a readability measure can be used to filter out documents of poor readability so that the machine readers will not extract incorrect information because of ambiguity or lack of clarity in the documents.",
        "As part of the DARPA Machine Reading Program (MRP), an evaluation was designed and conducted for the task of rating documents for readability.",
        "In this evaluation, 540 documents were rated for readability by both experts and novice human subjects.",
        "Systems were evaluated based on whether they were able to match expert readability ratings better than novice raters.",
        "Our system learns to match expert readability ratings by employing regression over a set of diverse linguistic features that were deemed potentially relevant to readability.",
        "Our results demonstrate that a rich combination of features from syntactic parsers, language models, as well as lexical statistics all contribute to accurately predicting expert human readability judgements.",
        "We have also considered the effect of different genres in predicting readability and how the genre-specific language models can be exploited to improve the readability predictions."

        "There is a significant amount of published work on a related problem: predicting the reading difficulty of documents, typically, as the school gradelevel of the reader from grade 1 to 12.",
        "Some early methods measure simple characteristics of documents like average sentence length, average number of syllables per word, etc.",
        "and combine them using a linear formula to predict the grade level of a document, for example FOG (Gunning, 1952), SMOG (McLaughlin, 1969) and Flesh-Kincaid (Kincaid et al., 1975) metrics.",
        "These methods do not take into account the content of the documents.",
        "Some later methods use predetermined lists of words to determine the grade level of a document, for example the Lexile measure (Stenner et al., 1988), the Fry Short Passage measure (Fry, 1990) and the Revised Dale-Chall formula (Chall and Dale, 1995).",
        "The word lists these methods use may be thought of as very simple language models.",
        "More recently, language models have been used for predicting the grade level of documents.",
        "Si and Callan (2001) and Collins-Thompson and Callan (2004) train unigram language models to predict grade levels of documents.",
        "In addition to language models, Heilman also use some syntactic features to estimate the grade level of texts.",
        "Pitler and Nenkova (2008) consider a different task of predicting text quality for an educated adult audience.",
        "Their system predicts readability of texts from Wall Street Journal using lexical, syntactic and discourse features.",
        "Kanungo and Orr (2009) consider the task of predicting readability of web summary snippets produced by search engines.",
        "Using simple surface level features like the number of characters and syllables per word, capitalization, punctuation, ellipses etc.",
        "they train a regression model to predict readability values.",
        "Our work differs from this previous research in several ways.",
        "Firstly, the task we have considered is different, we predict the readability of general documents, not their grade level.",
        "The documents in our data are also not from any single domain, genre or reader group, which makes our task more general.",
        "The data includes human written as well as machine generated documents.",
        "The task and the data has been set this way because it is aimed at filtering out documents of poor quality for later processing, like for extracting machine-processable knowledge from them.",
        "Extracting knowledge from openly found text, such as from the internet, is becoming popular but the quality of text found \"in the wild\", like found through searching the internet, vary considerably in quality and genre.",
        "If the text is of poor readability then it is likely to lead to extraction errors and more problems downstream.",
        "If the readers are going to be humans instead of machines, then also it is best to filter out poorly written documents.",
        "Hence identifying readability of general text documents coming from various sources and genres is an important task.",
        "We are not aware of any other work which has considered such a task.",
        "Secondly, we note that all of the above approaches that use language models train a language model for each difficulty level using the training data for that level.",
        "However, since the amount of training data annotated with levels is limited, they can not train higher-order language models, and most just use unigram models.",
        "In contrast, we employ more powerful language models trained on large quantities of generic text (which is not from the training data for readability) and use various features obtained from these language models to predict readability.",
        "Thirdly, we use a more sophisticated combination of linguistic features derived from various syntactic parsers and language models than any previous work.",
        "We also present ablation results for different sets of features.",
        "Fourthly, given that the documents in our data are not from a particular genre but from a mix of genres, we also train genre-specific language models and show that including these as features improves readability predictions.",
        "Finally, we also show comparison between various machine learning algorithms for predicting readability, none of the previous work compared learning algorithms."

        "Documents for newswire, machine translation and closed captioned genres were collected automatically by first forming a candidate pool from a single collection stream and then randomly selecting documents.",
        "Documents for weblogs, newsgroups and manual transcripts were also collected in the same way but were then reviewed by humans to make sure they were not simply spam articles or something objectionable.",
        "The Wikipedia articles were collected manually, by searching through a data archive or the live web, using keyword and other search techniques.",
        "Note that the information about genres of the documents is not available during testing and hence was not used when training our readability model.",
        "A total of 540 documents were collected in this way which were uniformly distributed across the seven genres.",
        "Each document was then judged for its readability by eight expert human judges.",
        "These expert judges are native English speakers who are language professionals and who have specialized training in linguistic analysis and annotation, including the machine translation postediting task.",
        "Each document was also judged for its readability by six to ten naive human judges.",

        "and have no specialized language analysis or linguistic annotation training.",
        "Both expert and naive judges provided readability judgments using a customized web interface and gave a rating on a 5-point scale to indicate how readable the passage is (where 1 is lowest and 5 is highest readability) where readability is defined as a subjective judgment of how easily a reader can extract the information the writer or speaker intended to convey."

        "In order to make the machine's predicted score comparable to a human judge's score (details about our evaluation metrics are in Section 6.1), we also restricted the machine scores to integers.",
        "Hence, the task is to predict an integer score from 1 to 5 that measures the readability of the document.",
        "This task could be modeled as a multi-class classification problem treating each integer score as a separate class, as done in some of the previous work (Si and Callan, 2001; Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2004).",
        "However, since the classes are numerical and not unrelated (for example, the score 2 is in between scores 1 and 3), we decided to model the task as a regression problem and then round the predicted score to obtain the closest integer value.",

        "Good input features are critical to the success of any regression algorithm.",
        "We used three main categories of features to predict readability: syntactic features, language-model features, and lexical features, as described below.",
        "Many times, a document is found to be unreadable due to unusual linguistic constructs or ungrammatical language that tend to manifest themselves in the syntactic properties of the text.",
        "Therefore, syntactic features have been previously used (Bernth, 1997) to gauge the \"clarity\" of written text, with the goal of helping writers improve their writing skills.",
        "Here too, we use several features based on syntactic analyses.",
        "Syntactic analyses are obtained from the Sundance shallow parser (Riloff and Phillips, 2004) and from the English Slot Grammar (ESG) (McCord, 1989).",
        "Sundance features: The Sundance system is a rule-based system that performs a shallow syntactic analysis of text.",
        "We expect that this analysis over readable text would be \"well-formed\", adhering to grammatical rules of the English language.",
        "Deviations from these rules can be indications of unreadable text.",
        "We attempt to capture such deviations from grammatical rules through the following Sundance features computed for each text document: proportion of sentences with no verb phrases, average number of clauses per sentence, average sentence length in tokens, average number of noun phrases per sentence, average number of verb phrases per sentence, average number of prepositional phrases per sentence, average number of phrases (all types) per sentence and average number of phrases (all types) per clause.",
        "ESG features: ESG uses slot grammar rules to perform a deeper linguistic analysis of sentences than the Sundance system.",
        "ESG may consider several different interpretations of a sentence, before deciding to choose one over the other interpretations.",
        "Sometimes ESG's grammar rules fail to produce a single complete interpretation of a sentence, in which case it generates partial parses.",
        "This typically happens in cases when sentences are ungrammatical, and possibly, less readable.",
        "Thus, we use the proportion of such incomplete parses within a document as a readability feature.",
        "In case of extremely short documents, this proportion of incomplete parses can be misleading.",
        "To account for such short documents, we introduce a variation of the above incomplete parse feature, by weighting it with a log factor as was done in (Riloff, 1996; Thelen and Riloff, 2002).",
        "We also experimented with some other syntactic features such as average sentence parse scores from Stanford parser and an in-house maximum entropy statistical parer, average constituent scores etc., however, they slightly degraded the performance in combination with the rest of the features and hence we did not include them in the final set.",
        "One possible explanation could be that averaging diminishes the effect of low scores caused by ungrammaticality.",
        "A probabilistic language model provides a prediction of how likely a given sentence was generated by the same underlying process that generated a corpus of training documents.",
        "In addition to a general n-gram language model trained on a large body of text, we also exploit language models trained to recognize specific \"genres\" of text.",
        "If a document is translated by a machine, or casually produced by humans for a weblog or newsgroup, it exhibits a character that is distinct from documents that go through a dedicated editing process (e.g., newswire and Wikipedia articles).",

        "Normalized document probability: One obvious proxy for readability is the score assigned to a document by a generic language model (LM).",
        "Since the language model is trained on well-written English text, it penalizes documents deviating from the statistics collected from the LM training documents.",
        "Due to variable document lengths, we normalize the document-level LM score by the number of words and compute the normalized document probability NP (D) for a document D as follows:",
        "where M is a general-purpose language model trained on clean English text, and \\D\\ is the number of words in the document D. Perplexities from genre-specific language models: The usefulness of LM-based features in categorizing text (McCallum and Nigam, 1998; Yang and Liu, 1999) and evaluating readability (Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2004; Heilman et al., 2007) has been investigated in previous work.",
        "In our experiments, however, since documents were acquired through several different channels, such as machine translation or web logs, we also build models that try to predict the genre of a document.",
        "Since the genre information for many English documents is readily available, we trained a series of genre-specific 5-gram LMs using the modified Kneser-Ney smoothing (Kneser and Ney, 1995; Stanley and Goodman, 1996).",
        "Table 1 contains a list of a base LM and genre-specific LMs.",

        "Posterior perplexities from genre-specific language models: While perplexities computed from genre-specific LMs reflect the absolute probability that a document was generated by a specific model, a model's relative probability compared to other models may be a more useful feature.",
        "To this end, we also compute the posterior perplexity defined as follows.",
        "Let D be a document, [Mi}G=1be G genre-specific LMs, and L(D\\Mi) be the perplexity of the document D with respect to Mi, then the posterior perplexity, R(Mi\\D), is defined as:",
        "We use the term \"posterior\" because if a uniform prior is adopted for [Mi}f=l, R(Mi\\D) can be interpreted as the posterior probability of the genre LM Mi given the document D.",
        "The final set of features involve various lexical statistics as described below.",
        "Out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rates: We conjecture that documents containing typographical errors (e.g., for closed-caption and web log documents) may receive low readability ratings.",
        "Therefore, we compute the OOV rates of a document with respect to the various LMs shown in Table 1.",
        "Since modern LMs often have a very large vocabulary, to get meaningful OOV rates, we truncate the vocabularies to the top (i.e., most frequent) 3000 words.",
        "For the purpose of OOV computation, a document D is treated as a sequence of tokenized words [wi : i = 1, 2, • • • , \\D\\}.",
        "Its OOV rate with respect to a (truncated) vocabulary V is then:",
        "where I (wi G V) is an indicator function taking value 1 if wi is not in V, and 0 otherwise.",
