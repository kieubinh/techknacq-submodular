        "However, creation ofsense marked corpora has always remained a costly proposition, especially for some of the resource deprived languages.",
        "To circumvent this problem, Khapra et al.",
        "(2009) proposed a WSD method that can be applied to a language even when no sense tagged corpus for that language is available.",
        "This is achieved by projecting Wordnet and corpus parameters from another language to the language in question.",
        "The approach is centered on a novel synset based multilingual dictionary (Mohanty et al., 2008) where the synsets of different languages are aligned and thereafter the words within the synsets are manually cross-linked.",
        "For example, the word WLl belonging to synset S of language L\\ will be manually cross-linked to the word WL2of the corresponding synset in language L2 to indicate that WL2 is the best substitute for WLl according to an experienced bilingual speaker's intuition.",
        "We extend their work by addressing the following question on the economics of annotation, lexicon building and performance:",
        "• Is there an optimal point of balance between the annotation effort and the lexicon building (i.e. manual cross-linking) effort at which one can be assured ofbest value for moneyin terms ofaccuracy?",
        "To address the above question we first propose a probabilistic cross linking model to eliminate the effort of manually cross linking words within the source and target language synsets and calibrate the resultant trade-off in accuracy.",
        "Next, we show that by injecting examples for most frequent hard-to-disambiguate words from the target domain one can achieve higher accuracies at optimal cost of annotation.",
        "Finally, we propose a measure for cost-benefit analysis which identifies the optimal point of balance between these three related entities, viz., cross-linking, sense annotation and accuracy of disambiguation.",

        "Supervised approaches like SVM (Lee et al., 2004) and k-NN (Ng and Lee, 1996), on the other hand, give better accuracies, but the requirement of large annotated corpora renders them unsuitable for resource scarce languages.",

        "PCL v/s MCL: Table 5 shows that the probabilistic cross-linking model performs much better than the WFS (a typically reported baseline) and it comes very close to the performance of manual cross-linking.",
        "This establishes the soundness of the probabilistic model and suggests that with a little compromise in the accuracy, the model can be used as an approximation to save the cost of manual cross-linking.",
        "Further, in Table 7 we see that when PCL is used in conjunction with certain amount of annotated corpus we get up to 9% improvement in F-score as compared to the case when the same amount ofannotated corpus is used alone.",
        "Thus, in the absence of skilled bilingual lexicographers, PCL can still be used to boost the accuracy obtained using annotated corpora.",

        "Selective Sampling v/s Random Annotation: Table 6 shows the benefit of selective sampling over random annotation.",
        "This benefit is felt more when the amount of training data injected from Marathi is small.",
        "For example, when an annotated corpus of size 2K is used, selective sampling gives an advantage of 3% to 4% over random selection.",
        "Thus the marginal gain (i.e., value for money) obtained by using selective sampling is more than that obtained by using random annotation.",
        "3.",
        "Optimal cost-benefit: Finally, we address the main message of our work, i.e., finding the best cost benefit.",
        "By referring to Tables 3 and 4, we see that the best value for money in Tourism domain is obtained by manually cross-linking 2/3rd of all corpus words and sense annotating 2K target words and in the Health domain it is obtained by manually cross-linking 2/3rd of all corpus words but sense annotating only 1K words.",
        "This suggests that striking a balance between cross-linking and annotation gives the best value for money.",

        "On the other hand, using our model we obtain higher accuracies of 76.96% in the Tourism domain (using 1/3rd manual cross-links and 2K injection) at a lower total cost (32K rupees) and 75.57% in the Health domain (using only 1/3rd cross-linking and 1K injection) at a lower cost (16K rupees)."
