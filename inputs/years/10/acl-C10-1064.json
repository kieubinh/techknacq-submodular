        "Relation extraction aims to identify semantic relations of entities in a document.",
        "Many relation extraction studies have followed the Relation Detection and Characterization (RDC) task organized by the Automatic Content Extraction project (Doddington et al., 2004) to make multilingual corpora of English, Chinese and Arabic.",
        "Although these datasets encourage the development and evaluation of statistical relation extractors for such languages, there would be a scarcity of labeled training samples when learning a new system for another language such as Korean.",
        "Since manual annotation of entities and their relations for such resource-poor languages is very expensive, we would like to consider instead a weakly-supervised learning technique in order to learn the relation extractor without significant annotation efforts.",
        "To do this, we propose to leverage parallel corpora to project the relation annotation on the source language (e.g. English) to the target (e.g. Korean).",
        "While many supervised machine learning approaches have been successfully applied to the RDC task (Kambhatla, 2004; Zhou et al., 2005; Zelenko et al., 2003; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004; Bunescu and Mooney, 2005; Zhang et al., 2006), few have focused on weakly-supervised relation extraction.",
        "For example, (Zhang, 2004) and (Chen et al., 2006) utilized weakly-supervised learning techniques for relation extraction, but they did not consider weak supervision in the context of cross-lingual relation extraction.",
        "Our key hypothesis on the use of parallel corpora for learning the relation extraction system is referred to as cross-lingual annotation projection.",
        "Early studies of cross-lingual annotation projection were accomplished for lexically-based tasks; for example part-of-speech tagging (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001), named-entity tagging (Yarowsky et al., 2001), and verb classification (Merlo et al., 2002).",
        "Recently, there has been increasing interest in applications of annotation projection such as dependency parsing (Hwa et al., 2005), mention detection (Zitouni and Florian, 2008), and semantic role labeling (Padó and Lapata, 2009).",
        "However, to the best of our knowledge, no work has reported on the RDC task.",
        "In this paper, we apply a cross-lingual annotation projection approach to binary relation detection, a task of identifying the relation between two entities.",
        "A simple projection method propagates the relations in source language sentences to word-aligned target sentences, and a target relation detector can bootstrap from projected annotation.",
        "However, this automatic annotation is unreliable because of misclassification of source text and word alignment errors, so it causes a critical falling-off in annotation projection quality.",
        "To alleviate this problem, we present three noise reduction strategies: a heuristic filtering; an alignment correction with dictionary; and an instance selection based on assessment, and combine these to yield a better result.",
        "We provide a quantitive evaluation of our method on a new Korean RDC dataset.",
        "In our experiment, we leverage an English-Korean parallel corpus collected from the Web, and demonstrate that the annotation projection approach and noise reduction method are beneficial to build an initial Korean relation detection system.",
        "For example, the combined model of three noise reduction methods achieves F1-scores of 36.9% (59.8% precision and 26.7% recall), favorably comparing with the 30.5% shown by the supervised base-line.",
        "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we describe our cross-lingual annotation projection approach to relation detection task.",
        "Then, we present the noise reduction methods in Section 3.",
        "Our experiment on the proposed Korean RDC evaluation set is shown in Section 4 and Section 5, and we conclude this paper in Section 6."

        "The annotation projection for relation detection can be performed as follows:",
        "1) For a given pair of bi-sentences in parallel corpora between a resource-rich language Li and a target language L2, the relation detection task is carried out for the sentence in Li .",
        "http://isoft.postech.ac.kr/^megaup/research/resources/.",
        "2) The annotations obtained by analyzing the sentence in Li are projected onto the sentence in L2 based on the word alignment information.",
        "3) The projected annotations on the sentence in L2 are utilized as resources to perform the relation detection task for the language L2.",
        "The first step to projecting annotations from L1onto L2 is obtaining annotations for the sentences in L1.",
        "Since each instance for relation detection is composed of a pair of entity mentions, the information about entity mentions on the given sentences should be identified first.",
        "We detect the entities in the L1 sentences of the parallel corpora.",
        "Entity identification generates a number of instances for relation detection by coupling two entities within each sentence.",
        "For each instance, the existence of semantic relation between entity mentions is explored, which is called relation detection.",
        "We assume that there exist available models or systems for all annotation processes, including not only an entity tagger and a relation detector themselves, but also required preprocessors such as a part-of-speech tagger, base-phrase chun-ker, and syntax parser for analyzing text in L1 .",
        "Figure 1 shows an example of annotation projection for relation detection of a bitext in English and Korean.",
        "The annotation of the sentence in English shows that \"Jan Mullins\" and \"Computer Recycler Incorporated\" are entity mentions of a person and an organization, respectively.",
        "Furthermore, the result indicates that the pair of entities has a semantic relationship categorized as \"ROLE.Owner\" type.",
        "In order to project the annotations from the sentences in L1 onto the sentences in L2, we utilize the information of word alignment which plays an important role in statistical machine translation techniques.",
        "The word alignment task aims to identify translational relationships among the words in a bitext and produces a bipartite graph with a set of edges between words with translational relationships as shown in Figure 1.",

        "We assume that the words of the sentences in L2 aligned with a given entity mention in L\\ inherit the information about the original entity in L\\.",
        "After projecting the annotations of entity mentions, the projections for relational instances follow.",
        "A projection is performed on a projected instance in L2 which is a pair of projected entities by duplicating annotations of the original instance in L\\.",

        "In addition, the instance composed of the two projected entities is annotated as a positive instance, because its original instance on the English sentence also has a semantic relationship.",
        "As the description suggests, the annotation projection approach is highly dependant on the quality of word alignment.",
        "However, the results of automatic word alignment may include several noisy or incomplete alignments because of technical difficulties.",
        "We present details to tackle the problem by relieving the influence of alignment errors in Section 3.",
        "The most important challenge for annotation projection approaches is how to improve the robustness against the erroneous projections.",
        "The noise produced by not only word alignment but also monolingual annotations in L\\ accumulates and brings about a drastic decline in the quality of projected annotations.",
        "The simplest policy of utilizing the projected annotations for relation detection in L2 is to consider that all projected instances are equivalently reliable and to employ entire projections as training instances for the task without any filtering.",
        "In contrast with this policy, which is likely to be substandard, we propose an alternative policy where the projected instances are assessed and only the instances judged as reliable by the assessment are utilized for the task.",

        "Our noise reduction approach includes the following three strategies: heuristic-based alignment filtering, dictionary-based alignment correction, and assessment-based instance selection.",
        "In order to improve the performance of annotation projection approaches, we should break the bottleneck caused by the low quality of automatic word alignment results.",
        "As relation detection is carried out for each instance consisting of two entity mentions, the annotation projection for relation detection concerns projecting only entity mentions and their relational instances.",
        "Since this is different from other shallower tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, base phrase chunking, and dependency parsing which should consider projections for all word units, we define and apply some heuristics specialized to projections of entity mentions and relation instances to improve robustness of the method against erroneous alignments, as follows:",
        "• A projection for an entity mention should be based on alignments between contiguous word sequences.",
        "If there are one or more gaps in the word sequence in L2 aligned with an entity mention in the sentence in L1, we assume that the corresponding alignments are likely to be erroneous.",
        "Thus, the alignments of non-contiguous words are excluded in projection.",
        "• Both an entity mention in L1 and its projection in L2 should include at least one base noun phrase.",
        "If no base noun phrase occurs in the original entity mention in L1, it may suggest some errors in annotation for the sentence in L1.",
        "The same case for the projected instance raises doubts about alignment errors.",
        "The alignments between word sequences without any base noun phrase are filtered out.",
        "• The projected instance in L2 should satisfy the clausal agreement with the original instance in L1.",
        "If entities of an instance are located in the same clause (or different clauses), its projected instance should be in the same manner.",
        "The instances without clausal agreement are ruled out.",
        "The errors in word alignment are composed of not only imprecise alignments but also incomplete alignments.",
        "If an alignment of an entity among two entities of a relation instance is not provided in the result of the word alignment task, the projection for the corresponding instance is unavailable.",
        "Unfortunately, the above-stated alignment filtering heuristics for improving the quality of projections make the annotation loss problems worse by filtering out several alignments likely to be noisy.",
        "In order to solve this problem, a dictionary-based alignment correction strategy is incorporated in our method.",
        "The strategy requires a bilingual dictionary for entity mentions.",
        "Each entry of the dictionary is a pair of entity mention in L1 and its translation or transliteration in L2.",
        "For each entity to be projected from the sentence in L1 , its counterpart in L2 is retrieved from the bilingual dictionary.",
        "Then, we seek the retrieved entity mention from the sentence in L2 by finding the longest common subsequence.",
        "If a subsequence matched to the retrieved mention is found in the sentence in L2, we make a new alignment between it and its original entity on the L1 sentence.",
        "The reliabilities of instances projected via a series of independent modules are different from each other.",
        "Thus, we propose an assessment strategy for each projected instance.",
        "To evaluate the reliability of a projected instance in L2, we use the confidence score of monolingual relation detection for the original counterpart instance in L1 .",
        "The acceptance of a projected instance is determined by whether the score of the instance is larger than a given threshold value 9.",
