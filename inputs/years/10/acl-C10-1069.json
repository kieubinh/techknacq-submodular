        "The clustering is symmetric and recursive: it is applied both to source-language and target-language phrases, and the clustering in one language helps determine the clustering in the other.",
        "The phrase clusters have many possible uses.",
        "This paper looks at one of these uses: smoothing the conditional translation model (TM) probabilities employed by the SMT system.",
        "We incorporated phrase-cluster-derived probability estimates into a baseline loglinear feature combination that included relative frequency and lexically-weighted conditional probability estimates.",
        "In Chinese-English (C-E) and French-English (F-E) learning curve experiments, we obtained a gain over the baseline in 29 of 30 tests, with a maximum gain of 0.55 BLEU points (though most gains were fairly small).",
        "The largest gains came with medium (200-400K sentence pairs) rather than with small (less than 100K sentence pairs) amounts of training data, contrary to what one would expect from the paraphrasing literature.",

        "The source-language and target-language \"phrases\" employed by many statistical machine translation (SMT) systems are anomalous: they are arbitrary sequences of contiguous words extracted by complex heuristics from a bilingual corpus, satisfying no formal linguistic criteria.",
        "Nevertheless, phrase-based systems perform better than word-based systems (Koehn 2010, pp.",
        "127-129).",
        "In this paper, we look at what happens when we cluster together these anomalous but useful entities.",
        "Here, we apply phrase clustering to obtain better estimates for \"backward\" probability P(slt) and \"forward\" probability P(tls), where s is a source-language phrase, t is a target-language phrase, and phrase pair (s,t) was seen at least once in training data.",
        "The current work is thus related to work on smoothing P(slt) and P(tls) see (Foster et al., 2006).",
        "The relative frequency estimates for P(slt) and P(tls) are",
        "PRF (s 11) =#(s,t)/#t and PRF (t l s) =#(s,t)/#s , where #(s,t) denotes the number of times phrase pair (s,t) was observed, etc.",
        "These estimates are typically smoothed with \"lexical\" estimates found by breaking phrases s and t into words.",
        "We adopt a different idea, that of smoothing PRF(slt) and PRF(tls) with estimates obtained from phrases that have similar meanings to s and t. In our experiments, the two methods were combined, yielding an improvement over lexical smoothing alone - this indicates they provide complementary information.",
        "E.g., lexical estimates don't work well for non-compositional phrases like \"kick the bucket\" - our method might cluster this phrase with \"die\" and \"expire\" and thus provide better smoothing.",
        "The research that comes closest to ours is the work of Schwenk et al.",
        "(2007) on continuous space N-gram models, where a neural network is employed to smooth translation probabilities.",
        "However, both Schwenk et al.",
        "'s smoothing technique",
        "and the system to which it is applied are quite different from ours.",
        "Phrase clustering is also somewhat related to work on paraphrases for SMT.",
        "Key papers in this area include (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005), which pioneered the extraction of paraphrases from bilingual parallel corpora, (Callison-Burch et al., 2006) which showed that paraphrase generation could improve SMT performance, (Calli-son-Burch, 2008) and (Zhao et al., 2008) which showed how to improve the quality of paraphrases, and (Marton et al., 2009) which derived paraphrases from monolingual data using distributional information.",
        "Paraphrases typically help SMT systems trained on under 100K sentence pairs the most.",
        "The phrase clustering algorithm in this paper outputs groups of source-language and target-language phrases with similar meanings: paraphrases.",
        "However, previous work on paraphrases for SMT has aimed at finding translations for source-language phrases in the system's input that weren't seen during system training.",
        "Our approach is completely useless in this situation: it only generates new information for target or source phrases that are already in the system's phrase table.",
        "Thus, we find paraphrases for many of the source and target phrases that are in the phrase table, while the work cited above looks for paraphrases of source phrases that are not in the phrase table.",
        "Our work also differs from most work on paraphrases in that information is extracted not from sources outside the SMT system (e.g., pivot languages or thesauri) but from the system's phrase table.",
        "In this respect if no other, it is similar to Chiang's classic work on hierarchical phrase-based systems (Chiang, 2005), though Chiang was mining a very different type of information from phrase tables.",
        "Because of all these differences between work on paraphrasing and the phrase clustering approach, both in terms of the input information and where they are best applied, we did not experimentally compare the two approaches."

        "Each has its advantages.",

        "However, these metrics are unreliable when total counts are low, since phrase co-occurrences are determined by a noisy alignment process.",
        "Edit-based metrics are independent of how often phrases were observed.",
        "However, sometimes they can be fooled by phrases that have similar word sequences but different meanings (e.g., \"the dog bit the man\" Clustering source phrase vectors Clustering target phrase vectors Table ot joint phrase cluster counts and \"the man bit the dog\", or \"walk on the beach\" and \"don't walk on the beach\").",
        "In our experiments, we used a combination of count-based and edit-based metrics to cluster phrases (by simply multiplying the metrics together).",
        "However, we invested most of our effort in perfecting the count-based component: our edit-based metric was fairly na√Øve.",
        "If we rely mainly on count-based similarity between phrases to cluster them, and this kind of similarity is most reliable when phrases have high counts, yet we need phrase-cluster-based estimates most for phrases with low counts, aren't we carrying out clustering on the phrases that need it least?",
        "Our hope was that there is a class of phrases with intermediate counts (e.g., with 3-15 observations in the training data) that can be clustered reliably, but still benefit from phrase-cluster-based probability estimates.",
        "Figure 1 shows count-based phrase clustering.",
        "One first arbitrarily picks a language (either source or target) and then clusters together some of the phrases in that language.",
        "One then switches to the other language and clusters phrases in that language, then switches back to the first one, and so on until enough clustering has taken place.",
        "Each phrase or phrase cluster is represented by the vector of its co-occurrence counts.",
        "To calculate the similarity between two phrase clusters, one first normalizes their count vectors.",
        "At the top of Figure 1, source phrase s1 occurred 9 times: 7 times aligned with target phrase t1, 2 times aligned with t4.",
        "For source similarity computation, the entry for (s1,t1) is normalized to 7/9 = 0.78 and the entry for (s1,t4) is normalized to 2/9 = 0.22 (these normalized values are shown in brackets and italics after the counts).",

If we merge vector pairs with the lowest values of MAPL, we will never merge vectors in a way that will cause a large loss to either of the two parents.",

        "We have shown that source-language and target-language phrases in the phrase table can be clustered, and that these clusters can be used to smooth \"forward\" and \"backward\" estimates P(tIs) and P(sIt), yielding modest but consistent BLEU gains over a baseline that included lexical smoothing.",
        "Though our experiments were done on a phrase-based system, this method could also be applied to hierarchical phrase-based SMT and syntactic SMT systems.",
        "There are several possibilities for future work based on new applications for phrase clusters:",
        "‚Ä¢ In the experiments above, we used phrase clusters to smooth P(tIs) and P(sIt) when the pair (s,t) was observed in training data.",
        "However, the phrase clusters often give non-zero probabilities for P(tIs) and P(sIt) when s and t were both in the training data, but didn't co-occur.",
        "We could allow the decoder to consider such \"invented\" phrase pairs (s,t).",
        "‚Ä¢ Phrase clusters could be used to construct target language models (LMs) in which the basic unit is a phrase cluster rather than a word.",
        "For instance, a tri-cluster model would estimate the probability of phrase p at time i as a function of its phrase cluster, Ci(p), and the two preceding phrase clusters Ci-1 and Ci-2:",
        "‚Ä¢ Lexicalized distortion models could be modified so as to condition distortion events on phrase clusters.",
        "‚Ä¢ We could build SMT grammars in which the terminals are phrases and the parents of terminals are phrase clusters.",
        "The phrase clustering algorithm described above could be improved in several ways:",
        "‚Ä¢ In the above, the edit distance between phrases and between phrase clusters was",
        "crudely defined.",
        "If we improve edit distance, it will have an especially large impact on \"count 1\" phrases, for which count-based metrics are unreliable and which are a large proportion of all phrases.",
        "The edit distance between two phrases weighted all words equally: preferably, weights for word substitution, insertion, or deletion would be learned from purely count-derived phrase clusters (content words and negative words might have heavier weights than other words).",
        "The edit distance between two phrase clusters was defined as the edit distance between the phrases with the most observations in each cluster.",
        "E.g., distance to the phrase cluster in Figure 2 is defined as the phrase edit distance to \"emancipating\".",
        "Instead, one could allow a cluster to be characterized by (e.g.) up to three phrases, and let distance between two clusters be the minimum or average pairwise edit distance between these characteristic phrases.",
        "‚Ä¢ To cluster phrases, we only used information derived from phrase tables.",
        "In future, we could also use the kind of information used in work on paraphrases, such as the context surrounding phrases in monolingual corpora, entries in thesauri, and information from pivot languages.",
        "‚Ä¢ The phrase clustering above was \"hard\": each phrase in either language belongs to exactly one cluster.",
        "We could modify our algorithms to carry out \"soft\" clustering.",
        "For instance, we could interpolate the probabilities associated with a phrase with probabilities from its neighbours.",
        "‚Ä¢ Clustering is a primitive way of finding latent structure in the table of joint phrase counts.",
        "One could apply principal component analysis or a related algorithm to this table."
