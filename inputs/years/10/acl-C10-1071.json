        "Since the seminal work by (Wu, 1997) and (Ya-mada and Knight, 2001), there have been great advances in syntax-based statistical machine translation to accurately model the word order distortion between the source and the target languages.",
        "Compared with the IBM source-channel models (Brown et al., 1994) and the phrase translation models (Koehn et al., 2003), (Och and Ney, 2004) which are good at capturing local reordering within empirical phrases, syntax-based models have been effective in capturing the longrange reordering between language pairs with very different word orders like Japanese-English (Yamada and Knight, 2001), Chinese-English (Chiang, 2005) and Urdu-English (Zollmann et al.",
        "2008), (Callison-Burch et al.",
        "2010).",
        "However, (Xu et al., 2009) show that applying dependency parsing-based reordering as preprocessing (pre-ordering hereafter) to phrase translation models produces translation qualities significantly better than a hierarchical phrase-based translation model (Hiero hereafter) implemented in (Zollman and Venugopal, 2006) for English-to-Japanese translation.",
        "They also report that the two models result in comparable translation qualities for English-to-Korean/Hindi/Turkish/Urdu, underpinning the limitations of syntax-based models for handling long-range reordering exhibited by the strictly head-final Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) order languages like Japanese and the largely head-initial Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) order languages like English.",
        "In this paper, we present a novel constituent parsing-based reordering technique that uses manually written context free (CFG hereafter) and context sensitive grammar (CSG hereafter) rules.",
        "The technique improves the performance of the state-of-the-art English-to-Japanese phrase translation system that includes distortion models by 4.76 BLEU points.",
        "The phrase translation model with constituent pre-ordering consistently outperforms a syntax-based translation system that integrates features from a phrase translation model, Hiero and a tree-to-string grammar.",
        "We also achieve an additional 0.84 BLEU point improvement by applying an extended set of reordering rules that incorporate new rules learned from the syntax model for decoding.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we summarize previous work related to this paper.",
        "In Section 3, we give an overview of the syntax model with which we compare the performance of a phrase translation model with pre-ordering.",
        "We also discuss a chart-based decoder used in all of our experiments.",
        "In Section 4, we describe the constituent parsing-based reordering rules.",
        "We show the impact of pre-ordering on a phrase translation model and compare its performance with the syntax model.",
        "In Section 5, we discuss experimental results from the combination of syntax model and pre-ordering.",
        "Finally in Section 6, we discuss future work."

        "We have proposed a constituent pre-ordering technique for English-to-Japanese translation.",
        "The technique improves the performance of the state-of-the-art phrase translation models by 4.76 BLEU points and outperforms a syntax-based translation system that incorporates a phrase translation model, Hiero and a tree-to-string grammar.",
        "We have also shown that combining constituent pre-ordering and the syntax model improves the translation quality by additional 0.84 BLEU points.",
        "While achieving solid performance improvement over the existing translation models for English-to-Japanese translation, our work has revealed some limitations of syntax models both in terms of grammar representations and modeling.",
        "Whereas many syntax models are based on CFG rules for probability acquisition, the current research shows that there are various types of reordering that require the generative capacity beyond CFG.",
        "While most of the reordering rules for changing the English order to the Japanese order (and vice versa) should apply categorically, often the probabilities of tree-to-string grammar rules are not high enough to survive in the translation derivations.",
        "As for the reordering rules that require the generative capacity beyond CFG, we may model mildly context sensitive grammars such as tree adjoining grammars (Joshi and Schabes, 1997), as in (Carreras and Collins, 2009).",
        "The extended domain of locality of tree adjoining grammars should suffice to capture non-CFG reordering rules for many language pairs.",
        "Alternatively, we can adopt enriched feature representations so that a tree of depth one can actually convey information on a tree of several depths, such as parent annotation of (Klein and",
