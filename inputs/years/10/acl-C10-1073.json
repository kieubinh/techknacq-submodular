        "Bilingual dictionaries are an essential resource in many multilingual natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as machine translation (Och and Ney, 2003) and cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) (Ballesteros and Croft, 1997).",
        "Hand-coded dictionaries are of high quality, but expensive to build and researchers have tried, since the end of the 1980s, to automatically extract bilingual lexicons from parallel corpora (see (Chen, 1993; Kay and Roscheisen, 1993; Melamed, 1997a; Melamed, 1997b) for early work).",
        "Parallel corpora are however difficult to get at in several domains, and the majority of bilingual collections are comparable and not parallel.",
        "Due to their low cost of acquisition, several researchers have tried to exploit such comparable corpora for bilingual lexicon extraction (Fung and McKeown, 1997; Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1999; Dejean et al., 2002; Gaussier et al., 2004; Robitaille et al., 2006; Morin et al., 2007; Yu and Tsujii, 2009).",
        "The notion ofcomparability is however a loose one, and comparable corpora range from lowly comparable ones to highly comparable ones and parallel ones.",
        "For data-driven NLP techniques, using better corpora often leads to better results, a fact which should be true for the task of bilingual lexicon extraction.",
        "This point has largely been ignored in previous work on the subject.",
        "In this paper, we develop a well-founded strategy to improve the quality of a comparable corpus, so as to improve in turn the quality of the bilingual lexicon extracted.",
        "To do so, we first propose a measure of comparability which we then use in a method to improve the quality of the existing corpus.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the experimental materials used for the different evaluations; comparability measures are then presented and evaluated in Section 3; in Section 4, we detail and evaluate a strategy to improve the quality of a given corpus while preserving its vocabulary; the method used for bilingual lexicon extraction is then described and evaluated in Section 5.",
        "Section 6 is then devoted to a discussion, prior to the conclusion given in Section 7."

        "Furthermore, the presence of common words suggests that one should rely on a presence/absence criterion rather than on the number of occurrences to avoid a bias towards common words.",
        "Given the natural language text, our evaluation will show that the simple presence/absence criterion can perform very well.",
        "This leads to Pr(w G Cf ) = 1/|Cf |, and finally to:",

For each Pj, as p increases, we obtain several comparable corpora with a decreasing gold-standard comparability score.",
        "All the Pj and their descendant corpora constitute the group Ga.",

        "The pseudo-alignments identified in the construction process are then used to leverage state-of-the-art bilingual lexicon extraction methods.",
        "This approach to bilingual lexicon extraction from comparable corpora radically differs, to our knowledge, from previous approaches which are mainly variants of the standard method proposed in (Fung and Yee, 1998) and (Rapp, 1999).",
        "For example, the method developed in (Dejean et al., 2002) and (Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002) involves a representation of dictionary entries with context vectors onto which new words are mapped.",
        "Pekar et al.",
        "(2006) smooth the context vectors used in the standard approach in order to better deal with low frequency words.",
        "A nice geometric interpretation of these processes is proposed in (Gaussier et al., 2004), which furthermore introduces variants based on Fisher kernels, Canonical Correlation Analysis and a combination of them, leading to an improvement of the F1-score of 2% (from 0.14 to 0.16) when considering the top 20 candidates.",
        "In contrast, the approach we have developed yields an improvement of 7% (from 0.13 to 0.20) of the F-1 score on C, again considering the top 20 candidates.",
        "More important, however, is the fact that the approach we have developed can be used in conjunction with any existing bilingual extraction method, as the strategies for improving the corpus quality and the re-weighting formula (equation 2) are general.",
        "We will assess in the future whether substantial gains are also attained with other methods.",
        "Some studies have tried to extract subparts of comparable corpora to complement existing parallel corpora.",
        "Munteanu (2004) thus developed a maximum entropy classifier aiming at extracting those sentence pairs which can be deemed parallel.",
        "The step for choosing similar document pairs in this work resembles some of our steps.",
        "However their work focuses on high quality and specific documents pairs, as opposed to the entire corpus of guaranteed quality we want to build.",
        "In this latter case, the cross-interaction between documents impacts the overall comparability score, and new methods, as the one we have introduced, need to be proposed.",
        "Similarly, Munteanu and Marcu (2006) propose a method to extract sub-sentential fragments from non-parallel corpora.",
        "Again, the targeted elements are very specific (parallel sentences or sub-sentences) and limited, and the focus is put on a few sentences which can be considered parallel.",
        "As already mentioned, we rather focus here on building a new corpus which preserves most of the information in the original corpus.",
        "The construction process we have presented is theoretically justified and allows one to preserve ca.",
        "95% of the original vocabulary."

        "We have first introduced in this paper a comparability measure based on the expectation of finding translation word pairs in the corpus.",
        "We have then designed a strategy to construct an improved comparable corpus by (a) extracting a subpart of the original corpus with a guaranteed comparability level, and (b) by completing the remaining subpart with external resources, in our case other existing bilingual corpora.",
        "We have then shown how the information obtained during the construction process could be used to improve state-of-the-art bilingual lexicon extraction methods.",
        "We have furthermore assessed the various steps of our approach and shown: (a) that the comparability measure we introduced captures variations in the degree of comparability between corpora, (b) that the construction process we introduced leads to an improved corpus preserving most of the original vocabulary, and (c) that the use of pseudo-alignments through simple re-weighting yields bilingual lexicons of higher quality."
