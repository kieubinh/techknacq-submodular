        "Whereas negation in predicate logic is well-defined and syntactically simple, negation in natural language is much complex.",
        "Generally, learning the scope of negation involves two subtasks: negation signal finding and negation scope finding.",
        "The former decides whether the words in a sentence are negation signals (i.e., words indicating negation, e.g., no, not, fail, rather than), where the semantic information of the words, rather than the syntactic information, plays a critical role.",
        "The latter determines the sequences of words in the sentence which are negated by the given negation signal.",
        "Compared with negation scope finding, negation signal finding is much simpler and has been well resolved in the literature, e.g. with * Corresponding author the accuracy of 95.8%-98.7% on the three subcorpora of the Bioscope corpus (Morante and Daelemans, 2009).",
        "In this paper, we focus on negation scope finding instead.",
        "That is, we assume golden negation signal finding.",
        "Finding negative assertions is essential in information extraction (IE), where in general, the aim is to derive factual knowledge from free text.",
        "For example, Vincze et al.",
        "(2008) pointed out that the extracted information within the scopes of negation signals should either be discarded or presented separately from factual information.",
        "This is especially important in the biomedical domain, where various linguistic forms are used extensively to express impressions, hypothesized explanations of experimental results or negative findings.",
        "Szarvas et al.",
        "(2008) reported that 13.45% of the sentences in the abstracts subcorpus of the BioScope corpus and 12.70% of the sentences in the full papers subcorpus of the Bioscope corpus contain negative assertions.",
        "In addition to the IE tasks in the biomedical domain, SoN learning has attracted more and more attention in some natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as sentiment classification (Turney, 2002).",
        "For example, in the sentence 'The chair is not comfortable but cheap\", although both the polarities of the words \"comfortable\" and \"cheap\" are positive, the polarity of \"the chair\" regarding the attribute \"cheap\" keeps positive while the polarity of \"the chair\" regarding the attribute \"comfortable\" is reversed due to the negation signal \"not\".",
        "Most of the initial research on SoN learning focused on negated terms finding, using either some heuristic rules (e.g., regular expression), or machine learning methods (Chapman et al., 2001; Huang and Lowe, 2007; Goldin and Chapman, 2003).",
        "Negation scope finding has been largely ignored until the recent release of the BioScope corpus (Szarvas et al., 2008; Vincze et al., 2008).",
        "Morante et al.",
        "(2008) and Morante and Daelemans (2009) pioneered the research on negation scope finding by formulating it as a chunking problem, which classifies the words of a sentence as being inside or outside the scope of a negation signal.",
        "However, this chunking approach suffers from low performance, in particular on long sentences, due to ignoring structured syntactic information.",
        "For example, given golden negation signals on the Bioscope corpus, Morante and Daelemans (2009) only got the performance of 50.26% in PCS (percentage of correct scope) measure on the full papers subcorpus (22.8 words per sentence on average), compared to 87.27% in PCS measure on the clinical reports subcorpus (6.6 words per sentence on average).",
        "This paper explores negation scope finding from a parse tree perspective and formulates it as a shallow semantic parsing problem, which has been extensively studied in the past few years (Carreras and Màrquez, 2005).",
        "In particular, the negation signal is recast as the predicate and the negation scope is recast as its arguments.",
        "The motivation behind is that structured syntactic information plays a critical role in negation scope finding and should be paid much more attention, as indicated by previous studies in shallow semantic parsing (Gildea and Palmer, 2002; Punyakanok et al., 2005).",
        "Our parsing approach to negation scope finding differs from the state-of-the-art chunking ones in two aspects.",

        "1) The negation signal itself and all of its ancestral constituents are non-arguments.",
        "2) If constituent X is an argument of the given negation signal, then X should be the highest constituent dominated by the scope of wordm, wordn.",

        "explained by abnormalities Figure 2: An illustration of a negation signal and its arguments in a parse tree.",
        "The first rule ensures that no argument covers the negation signal while the second rule ensures no overlap between any two arguments.",
        "For example, in the sentence \"These findings indicate that corticosteroid resistance can not be explained by abnormalities\", the negation signal \"can not\" has the negation scope \"corti-costeroid resistance can not be explained by abnormalities\".",
        "As shown in Figure 2, the node \"RB77\" (i.e., not) represents the negation signal \"can not\" while its arguments include three constituents {NP45, MD66, and VP8 ii}.",
        "It is worth noting that according to the above rules, negation scope finding via shallow semantic parsing, i.e. determining the arguments of a given negation signal, is robust to some variations in parse trees.",
        "This is also empirically justified by our later experiments.",
        "For example, if the VP6,ii in Figure 2 is incorrectly expanded by the rule VP6,n^MD6,6+RB7j+VB8,8+VP9,n, the negation scope of the negation signal \"can not\" can still be correctly detected as long as {NP4,5, MD6,6, VB8,8, and VP9,ii} are predicted as the arguments of the negation signal \"can not\".",
        "Compared with common shallow semantic parsing which needs to assign an argument with a semantic label, negation scope finding does not involve semantic label classification and thus could be divided into three consequent phases: argument pruning, argument identification and post-processing.",
        "Similar to the predicate-argument structures in common shallow semantic parsing, the negation signal-scope structures in negation scope finding can be also classified into several certain types and argument pruning can be done by employing several heuristic rules to filter out constituents, which are most likely non-arguments of a negation signal.",
        "Similar to the heuristic algorithm as proposed in Xue and Palmer (2oo4) for argument pruning in common shallow semantic parsing, the argument pruning algorithm adopted here starts from designating the negation signal as the current node and collects its siblings.",

        "To sum up, except the negation signal and its ancestral constituents, any constituent in the parse tree whose parent covers the given negation signal will be collected as argument candidates.",
        "Taking the negation signal node \"RB7,7\" in Figure 2 as an example, constituents {MD6,6, VP8,ii, NP4,5, IN3,3, VBP2,2, and NPo,i} are collected as its argument candidates consequently.",

        "However, the performance decrease shows that negation scope finding is not as sensitive to automatic syntactic parsing as common shallow semantic parsing, whose performance might decrease by about ~10 in F1-measure (Toutanova et al., 2005).",
        "This indicates that negation scope finding via shallow semantic parsing is robust to some variations in the parse trees.",

        "However, it is surprising to find that autoparse(t&t) achieves better performance on the clinical reports subcorpus than autoparse(test).",
        "This may be due to the special characteristics of the clinical reports subcorpus, which mainly consists of much shorter sentences with 6.6 words per sentence on average, and better adaptation of the argument identification classifier to the variations in the automatic parse trees.",
        "3) The performance on all three subcorpora indicates that the recognition of right boundary is much harder than that of left boundary.",
