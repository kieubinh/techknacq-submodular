        "One of the most noticeable trends in the past decade of Natural Language Processing (NLP) research has been the deployment of language processing technology to meet the information retrieval and extraction needs of scientists in other disciplines.",
        "This meeting of fields has proven mutually beneficial: scientists increasingly rely on automated tools to help them cope with the exponentially expanding body of publications in their field, while NLP researchers have been spurred to address new conceptual problems in theirs.",
        "Among the fundamental advances from the NLP perspective has been the realisation that tools which perform well on textual data from one source may fail to do so on another unless they are tailored to the new source in some way.",
        "This has led to significant interest in the idea of contrasting domains and the concomitant problem of domain adaptation, as well as the production of manually annotated domain-specific corpora.",
        "One definition of domain variation associates it with differences in the underlying probability distributions from which different sets of data are drawn (Daumé III and Marcu, 2006).",
        "The concept also mirrors the notion of variation across thematic subjects and the corpus-linguistic notions of register and genre (Biber, 1988).",
        "In addition to the differences in vocabulary that one would expect to observe, domains can vary in many linguistic variables that affect NLP systems.",
        "The scientific domain which has received the most attention (and is the focus of this paper) is the biomedical domain.",
        "Notable examples of corpus construction projects for the biomedical domain are PennBioIE (Kulick et al., 2004) and GENIA (Kim et al., 2003).",
        "These corpora have been used to develop systems for a range of processing tasks, from entity recognition (Jin et al., 2006) to parsing (Hara et al., 2005) to coreference resolution (Nguyen and Kim, 2008).",
        "An implicit assumption in much previous work on biomedical NLP has been that particular subdomains of biomedical literature - typically molecular biology - can be used as a model of biomedical language in general.",
        "For example, GENIA consists of abstracts dealing with a specific set of subjects in molecular biology, while PennBioIE covers abstracts in two specialised domains, cancer genomics and the behaviour of a particular class of enzymes.",
        "This assumption of representativeness is understandable because linguistic annotation is labour-intensive and it may not be worthwhile to produce annotated corpora for multiple subdomains within a single discipline if there is little task-relevant variation across those subdomains.",
        "However, such conclusions should not be made before studying the actual degree of difference between the subdomains of interest.",
        "One of the principal goals of this paper is to map how the concept of \"biomedical language\", often construed as a monolithic entity, is composed of diverse patterns of behaviour at more fine-grained topical levels.",
        "Hence we study linguistic variation in a broad biomedical corpus of abstracts and full papers, the PMC Open Access Subset.",
        "We select a range of lexical and structural phenomena for quantitative investigation.",
        "The results indicate that common subdomains for resource development are not representative of biomedical text in general and furthermore that different linguistic features often partition the subdomains in quite different ways."

        "Secondly, academic writing places greater demands on the reader by omitting non-essential information, through the frequent use of passivisation, nominalisation and noun compounding.",

        "This analysis unsurprisingly finds differences between the domain and newswire corpora across many linguistic dimensions; more interestingly for our purposes, the comparison of domain text to the broader biomedical superdomain shows a more complex picture with similarities in some aspects (e.g., passivisation and negation) and dissimilarities in others (e.g., sentence length, semantic features).",

        "An important initial question was how to treat data with multiple classifications: we only consider journals assigned a single subdomain, to avoid the added complexity of interactions in data from overlapping subdomains.",
        "To ensure sufficient data for comparing a variety of linguistic features, we discard the subdomains with less than one million words meeting the single-subdomain criterion.",
        "After review, we also drop the \"Biology\" subdomain, which appears to function as a catch-all for many loosely related areas.",
        "Figure 1 shows the distribution of data across the subjects we use, by word-count, with lighter-coloured areas representing data that is assigned multiple subjects.",
        "These subjects provide a convenient starting point for dividing the corpus into subdomains (hereafter, \"subdomain\" will be used rather than \"subject\").",
        "We also add a reference subdomain, \"Newswire\", composed of a 6 million word random sample from the English Gigaword corpus (Graff et al., 2005).",
        "The final data set has a total of 39 subdomains.",
        "Articles in the OpenPMC corpus are formatted according to a standard XML tag set (NIH, 2009a).",
        "We first convert each article to plain text, ignoring \"non-content\" elements such as tables and formulas, and split the result into sentences, aggregating the results by subdomain.",
        "We investigate subdomain variation in our corpus across a range of lexical, syntactic, sentential and discourse features.",
        "The corpus is lemmatised, tagged and parsed using the C&C pipeline (Cur-ran et al., 2007) with the adapted part-of-speech and lexical category tagging models produced by Rimell and Clark (2009) for biomedical parsing.",
        "From this output we count occurrences of noun, verb, adjective and adverb lemmas, part-of-speech (POS) tags, grammatical relations (GRs), chunks, and lexical categories.",
        "The lemma features are Zipfian-distributed items from an open class, so we have experimented with filtering low-frequency items at various thresholds to reduce noise and improve processing speed.",
        "The other feature sets can be viewed as closed classes, where filtering is unnecessary.",
        "Since verbs are central to the meaning and structure of sentences, we consider their special behavior by constructing features for each verb's distribution over other grammatical properties.",
        "Several grammatical properties are captured by pairing each verb with its POS (indicating e.g. tense, such as present, past, and present participle).",
        "Voice is determined from additional annotation output by the C&C parser.",
        "Table 1 shows the POS-distribution for the verb \"restrict\", in two subdomains from the corpus.",
        "Finally, we record distributions over verb subcategorization frames (SCFs) taken by each verb, and over the GRs it participates in.",

        "The Gibbs sampling procedure is parameterised to induce Ï00 topics, each giving a coherent cluster of related words learned from the data, and to run for Ï000 iterations.",
        "We collate the predicted distribution over topics for each article in a subdomain, weighted by article wordcount, to produce a topic distribution for the subdomain.",
        "Our goal is to illustrate the presence or absence of differences between the feature sets, and to do so we calculated the Jensen-Shannon divergence and the Pearson correlation.",
        "Jensen-Shannon divergence is a finite symmetric measurement of the divergence between probability distributions, while Pearson correlation quantifies the linear relationship between two real-valued samples.",
        "The count-features are weighted, for a given subdomain, by the feature's log-likelihood between the subdomain's data and the rest of the corpus.",
        "Log-likelihood has been shown to perform well when comparing counts of potentially low-frequency features (Rayson and Garside, 2000) such as found in Zipfian-distributed data.",
        "This serves to place more weight in the comparison on items that are distinctive of the subdomain with respect to the entire corpus.",
        "While the count-features are treated as a single distribution for the purposes of JSD, the verbwise-features are composed of many distributions, one for each verb lemma.",
        "Our approach is to combine the JSD of the verbs, weighted by the loglikelihood of the verb lemma between the two subdomains in question, and normalize the distances to the interval [0, ï].",
        "Using the lemma's log-likelihood assumes that, when a verb's distribution behaves differently in a subdomain, its frequency changes as well.",
        "We present the results as dendrograms and heat maps.",
        "Dendrograms are tree structures that illustrate the results of hierarchical clustering.",
        "We perform hierarchical clustering on the inter-subdomain divergences for each set of features.",
        "The algorithm begins with each instance (in our case, subdomains) as a singleton cluster, and repeatedly joins the two most similar clusters until all the data is clustered together.",
        "The order of these merges is recorded as a tree structure that can be visualized as a dendrogram in which the length of a branch represents the distance between its child nodes.",
        "Similarity between clusters is calculated using average distance between all members, known as \"average linking\".",
        "Heat maps show the pairwise calculation of a metric in a grid of squares, where square (x, y) is shaded according to the value of metric(subx, suby).",
        "For our measurements of JSD, black represents 0 (i.e. identical distributions) and white represents the metric's theoretical maximum of ï.",

        "The results of Pearson correlation and JSD show similar trends, and due to its specific design for comparing distributions we only report the latter.",
        "Differences in vocabulary are what first comes to mind when describing subdomains.",
        "Word features are fundamental components for systems such as POS taggers and lexicalised parsers; one therefore expects that these systems will be affected by variation in lexical distributions.",
        "Figure 2a uses JSD calculated on each subdomain's distribution over ï00 LDA-induced topics to compare vocabulary distributions.",
        "Subdomains related to molecular biology (Genetics, Molecular Biology) show the smallest divergences, an interesting fact since these are heavily used in building resources for BioNLP.",

        "Part of the variation is due to characteristic markers of scientific argument (\"therefore\", \"significantly\", \"statistically\").",
        "A more interesting factor is the coining of domain-specific adverbs, an example of the tendency in scientific text to use complex lexical items and premodifiers rather than additional clauses.",
        "This also has the effect of moving subdomain-specific objects and processes from verbs and nouns to adverbs.",
        "This behavior seems non-continuous, in that subdomains either make heavy, or almost no, use of it: for example, Pediatrics has no subdomain-specific items among the its ten top adverbs by log-likelihood, while Neoplasms has \"histologically\", \"immunohistochemi-cally\" and \"subcutaneously\".",
        "These information-dense terms could prove useful for tasks like automatic curation of subdomain vocabularies, where they imply relationships between their components, the items they modify, etc.",
        "Modelling verb behavior is important for both syntactic (Collins, 2003) and semantic (Korhonen et al., 2008) processing, and subdomains are known to conscript verbs into specific roles that change the distributions of their syntactic properties (Roland and Jurafsky, ï998).",
        "The four properties we considered verbs' distributions over (SCF, POS, GR and voice) produced similar inter-subdomain JSD values.",
        "Figure 2c demonstrates how verbs differ between subdomains with respect to SCFs.",
        "For example, while the Pediatrics subdomain uses the verb \"govern\" in a single SCF among its ï2 possibilities, the Genetics subdomain distributes its usage over 7 of them.",
        "Two subdomains may both use \"restrict\" with high frequency (e.g. Molecular Biology and Ethics), but with different frequency distributions over SCFs.",
        "It is difficult to measure syntactic complexity accurately without access to a hand-annotated treebank, but it is well-known that sentence length correlates strongly with processing difficulty (Collins, Ï996).",
        "The first column of Table 2 gives average sentence lengths (excluding punctuation and \"sentences\" of fewer than three words) for selected domains.",
        "All standard errors are < 0.1.",
        "It is clear that all biomedical subdomains typically use longer sentences than newswire, though there is also variation within biomedicine, from an average length of 27 words in Molecular Biology to 24.5 words in Pediatrics.",
        "\"Packaging\" information in complex pre and/or post-modified noun phrases is a characteristic feature of academic writing (Biber and Gray, 20ï0).",
