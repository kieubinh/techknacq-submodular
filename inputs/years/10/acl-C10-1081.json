        "Semantics-based SMT, as a natural extension to SSMT, has begun to receive more attention from researchers (Liu and Gildea, 2008; Wu and Fung, 2009).",
        "Semantic structures have two major advantages over syntactic structures in terms of helping machine translation.",
        "First of all, semantic roles tend to agree better between two languages than syntactic constituents (Fung et al., 2006).",
        "This property motivates the approach of using the consistency of semantic roles to select MT outputs (Wu and Fung, 2009).",
        "Secondly, the set of semantic roles of a predicate models the skeleton of a sentence, which is crucial to the readability of MT output.",
        "By skeleton, we mean the main structure of a sentence including the verbs and their arguments.",
        "In spite of the theoretical potential of the semantic roles, there has not been much success in using them to improve SMT systems.",
        "Liu and Gildea (2008) proposed a semantic role based Tree-to-String (TTS) transducer by adding semantic roles to the TTS templates.",
        "Their approach did not differentiate the semantic roles of different predicates, and did not always improve the TTS transducer's performance.",
        "Wu and Fung (2009) took the output of a phrase-based SMT system Moses (Koehn et al., 2007), and kept permuting the semantic roles of the MT output until they best matched the semantic roles in the source sentence.",
        "This approach shows the positive effect of applying semantic role constraints, but it requires re-tagging semantic roles for every permuted MT output and does not scale well to longer sentences.",
        "This paper explores ways of tightly integrating semantic role features (SRFs) into an MT system, rather than using them in post-processing or n-best re-ranking.",
        "Semantic role labeling (SRL) systems usually use sentence-wide features (Xue and Palmer, 2004; Pradhan et al., 2004; Toutanova et al., 2005); thus it is difficult to compute targetside semantic roles incrementally during decoding.",
        "Noticing that the source side semantic roles are easy to compute, we apply a compromise approach, where the target side semantic roles are generated by projecting the source side semantic roles using the word alignments between the source and target sentences.",
        "Since this approach does not perform true SRL on the target string, it cannot fully evaluate whether the source and target semantic structures are consistent.",
        "However, the approach does capture the semantic-level reordering of the sentences.",
        "We assume here that the MT system is capable of providing word alignment (or equivalent) information during decoding, which is generally true for current statistical MT systems.",
        "Specifically, two types of semantic role features are proposed in this paper: a semantic role reordering feature designed to capture the skeleton-level permutation, and a semantic role deletion feature designed to penalize missing semantic roles in the target sentence.",
        "To use these features during decoding, we need to keep track of the semantic role sequences (SRS) for partial translations, which can be generated based on the source-side semantic role sequence and the corresponding word alignments.",
        "Since the SRL system and the MT system are separate, a translation rule (e.g., a phrase pair in phrase-based SMT) could cover two partial source-side semantic roles.",
        "In such cases partial SRSs must be recorded in such a way that they can be combined later with other partial SRSs.",
        "Dealing with this problem will increase the complexity of the decoding algorithm.",
        "Fortunately, Tree-to-String transducer based MT systems (Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006) can avoid this problem by using the same syntax tree for both SRL and MT.",
        "Such an arrangement guarantees that a TTS template either covers parts of one source-side semantic role, or a few complete semantic roles.",
        "This advantage motivates us to use a TTS transducer as the MT system with which to demonstrate the use of the proposed semantic role features.",
        "Since it is hard to design a generative model to combine both the semantic role features and the TTS templates, we use a log-linear model to estimate the feature weights, by maximizing the conditional probabilities of the target strings given the source syntax trees.",
        "The log-linear model with latent variables has been discussed by Blunsom et al.",
        "(2008); we apply this technique to combine the TTS templates and the semantic role features.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the semantic role features proposed for machine translation; Section 3 describes how semantic role features are used and trained in a TTS transducer; Section 4 presents the experimental results; and Section 5 gives the conclusion."

        "Compared to the general reordering models used in statistical MT systems, this type of feature is capable of modeling skeleton-level re-ordering, which is crucial to the fluency of MT output.",
        "Because a predicate can have different semantic role sequences in different voices, passive/active are tagged for each occurrence of the verbs based on their POS and preceding words.",

        "Though most statistical MT systems have penalties for word deletion, it is still useful to make separate features for the deletion of semantic roles, which is considered more harmful than the deletion of non-core components (e.g., modifiers) and deserves more serious penalty.",

        "This paper proposes two types of semantic role features for a Tree-to-String transducer: one models the reordering of the source-side semantic role sequence, and the other penalizes the deletion of a source-side semantic role.",
        "These semantic features",
        "Figure 8: Examples of the MT outputs with and without SRFs.",
        "The first and second example shows that SRFs improve the completeness and the ordering of the MT outputs respectively, the third example shows that SRFs improve both properties.",
        "The subscripts of each Chinese phrase show their aligned words in English.",
        "and the Tree-to-String templates, trained based on a conditional log-linear model, are shown to significantly improve a basic TTS transducer's performance in terms of BLEU-4.",
        "To avoid BLEU's bias towards the adequacy of the MT outputs, manual evaluation is conducted for sentence fluency and significant improvement is shown by using the semantic role features in the log-linear model.",
        "Considering our semantic features are the most basic ones, using more sophisticated features (e.g., the head words and their translations of the source-side semantic roles) provides a possible direction for further experimentation.",
