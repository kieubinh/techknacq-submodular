        "Event recognition and classification has been pointed out to be very important to improve complex natural language processing (NLP) applications such as automatic summarization (Daniel et al., 2003) and question answering (QA) (Puste-jovsky, 2002).",
        "Natural language (NL) texts often describe sequences of events in a time line.",
        "In the context of summarization, extracting such events may aid in obtaining better summaries when these have to be focused on specific happenings.",
        "In the same manner, the access to such information is crucial for QA systems attempting to address questions about events.",
        "The analysis of events as well as the classification of the different forms they adopt in NL text is not a new issue (Vendler, 1967).",
        "It relates not only to linguistics but different scientific areas such as philosophy, psychology, etc.",
        "In NLP, different definitions of event can be found regarding the target application.",
        "On the one hand, in topic detection and tracking (Allan, 2002), event is defined as an instance of a topic identified at document level describing something that happen (e.g., \"wars\").",
        "The aim of this task is to cluster documents on the same topic, that is to say, the same event.",
        "On the other hand, information extraction (IE) provides finer granularity event definitions.",
        "IE proposes standard schemes to annotate the individual events within the scope of a document.",
        "STAG scheme (2000) was aimed to identify events in news and their relationship with points in a temporal line.",
        "More recently, TimeML (Pustejovsky et al., 2003a) presented a rich specification for annotating events in NL text extending the features of the previous one.",
        "This paper is focused on the TimeML view of events.",
        "TimeML defines events as situations that happen or occur, or elements describing states or circumstances in which something obtains or holds the truth.",
        "These events are generally expressed by tensed or untensed verbs, nominaliza-tions, adjectives, predicative clauses or prepositional phrases.",

        "Many research efforts into the application ofse-mantic roles demonstrated that this information is useful for different NLP purposes (Melli et al., 2006).",
        "Focusing on TimeML, semantic roles have been applied to temporal expressions recognition (Llorens et al., 2009), and temporal links classification (Hagege and Tannier, 2007).",
        "However, they have not been used to recognize and classify TimeML events.",
        "Semantic roles provide structural relations of the predicates in which events may participate.",
        "Beyond syntactic relations expressed by means of the different types of phrases, semantic roles give further information about semantic relations between the arguments of a predicate.",
        "Therefore, as richer information, roles may better distinguish tokens to be candidate events.",

        "This paper presented an approach for the recognition and classification of TimeML events consisting of a CRF model learned using semantic roles as main feature.",
        "In addition to morphosyntactic features, the model was enhanced including extra semantic information, semantic role labeling, used for other applications with satisfactory results, but never employed before for this purpose.",
        "Our proposal was evaluated using the gold standard corpus, TimeBank 1.2, and the results obtained were analyzed and compared to measure the impact of both semantic roles and CRFs in the described task.",
        "The obtained Fß=1 results demonstrated that semantic roles are useful to recognize (81.43%) and classify (64.20%) TimeML events, improving the presented baseline by 19% for recognition and 30% for classification.",
        "Specifically, Semantic roles employed as additional feature improved the recall of the non-roles version by 6% and 10% for recognition and classification respectively.",
        "This indicates that roles features led to more general models capable of better annotating unseen instances.",
        "The roles contribution was more significant in state and occurrence classes of noun events, concentrating around the 70% of the improvement.",
        "Furthermore, it was verified that CRFs achieve higher results than models learned using other ML techniques such as SVM (5% improvement), contributing especially to nominal events.",
        "This demonstrated that CRF models are appropriate to face the task.",
        "Finally, to the extent our results are comparable to state of the art evaluations, ours outperform the Fß=1 scores in both recognition and classification.",
        "Especially, our approach showed better performance than related works in state (32% improvement) and nominal events (44% improvement).",
        "Hence, the extension of the current approaches with semantic roles features could benefit their performance.",
        "The main difficulties found in the task addressed in this paper are related to iaction and state events.",
        "In the former, we detected that modality and the word senses are important and must be treated to distinguish such events.",
        "In the later, although they were improved by our approach, state events are still the most complex class of events due to their richness in contrast to the reduced size of the training data.",
        "We agree with related literature that event classification results are still below other tasks performance, which indicates that this task is inherently complex and more training data may lead to significant improvements.",
        "As further work we propose, firstly, improving the iaction results by taking into account the modality considering the AM-MOD role, and the word senses using a WSD technique.",
        "Secondly, the application of FrameNet role set (finer granularity) to determine which kind of roles are better to improve the current event annotation systems."
