        "This paper investigates the problem ofrecognising textual entailment within discourse.",
        "Textual Entailment (TE) is a generic framework for applied semantic inference (Dagan et al., 2009).",
        "Under TE, the relationship between a text (T) and a textual assertion (hypothesis, H) is defined such that T entails H if humans reading T would infer that H is most likely true (Dagan et al., 2006).",
        "TE has been successfully applied to a variety of natural language processing applications, including information extraction (Romano et al., 2006) and question answering (Harabagiu and Hickl, 2006).",
        "Yet, most entailment systems have thus far paid little attention to discourse aspects of inference.",
        "In part, this is the result of the unavailability of adept tools for handling the kind of discourse processing required for inference.",
        "In addition in the main TE benchmarks, the Recognising Textual Entailment (RTE) challenges, discourse played little role.",
        "This state of affairs has started to change with the recent introduction of the RTE Pilot \"Search\" task (Bentivogli et al., 2009b), in which assessed texts are situated within complete documents.",
        "In this setting, texts need to be interpreted based on their entire discourse (Bentivogli et al., 2009a), hence attending to discourse issues becomes essential.",
        "Consider the following example from the task's dataset:",
        "(T) The seven men on board were said to have as little as 24 hours of air.",
        "For the interpretation of T, e.g. the identity and whereabouts of the seven men, one must consider T's discourse.",
        "The preceding sentence T', for instance, provides useful information to that aim:",
        "(T') The Russian navy worked desperately to save a small military submarine.",
        "This example demonstrates a common situation in texts, and is also applicable to the RTE Search task's setting.",
        "Still, little was done by the task's participants to consider discourse, and sentences were mostly processed independently.",
        "Analyzing the Search task's development set, we identified several key discourse aspects that affect entailment in a discourse-dependent setting.",
        "First, we observed that the coverage of available coreference resolution tools is considerably limited.",
        "To partly address this problem, we extend the set of coreference relations to phrase pairs with a certain degree of lexical overlap, as long as no semantic incompatibility is found between them.",
        "Second, many bridging relations (Clark, 1975) are realized in the form of \"global information\" perceived as known for entire documents.",
        "As bridging falls completely out of the scope of available resolvers, we address this phenomenon by identifying and weighting prominent document terms and allowing their incorporation in inference even when they are not explicitly mentioned in a sentence.",
        "Finally, we observed a coherence-related discourse phenomenon, namely interrelations between entailing sentences in the discourse, such as the tendency of entailing sentences to be adjacent to one another.",
        "To that end, we apply a two-phase classification scheme, where a second-phase meta-classifier is applied, extracting discourse and document-level features based on the classification of each sentence on its own.",
        "Our results show that, even when simple solutions are employed, the reliance on discourse-based information is helpful and achieves a significant improvement of results.",
        "We analyze the contribution of each component and suggest some future work to better attend to discourse in entailment systems.",
        "To our knowledge, this is the most extensive effort thus far to empirically explore the effect of discourse on entailment systems."

        "Yet, such applications typically only handle a narrow aspect ofdiscourse, addressing coreference by term substitution (Dali et al., 2009; Li et al., 2009).",
        "The limited coverage and scope of existing tools for coreference resolution and the unavailability of tools for addressing other discourse aspects also contribute to this situation.",
        "For instance, VP anaphora and bridging relations are usually not handled at all by such resolvers.",
        "A similar situation is seen in the TE research field.",
        "The prominent benchmark for entailment systems evaluation is the series of RTE challenges.",
        "The main task in these challenges has traditionally been to determine, given a text-hypothesis pair (T,H), whether T entails H. Discourse played no role in the first two RTE challenges as T's were constructed of short simplified texts.",
        "In RTE-3 (Giampiccolo et al., 2007), where some paragraph-long texts were included, inter-sentential relations became relevant for correct inference.",
        "Yet the texts in the task were manually modified to ensure they are self-contained.",
        "Consequently, little effort was invested by the challenges' participants to address discourse issues beyond the standard substitution of coreferring nominal phrases, using publicly available tools such as JavaRap (Qiu et al., 2004) or OpenNLP, e.g. (Bar-Haim et al., 2008).",
        "A major step in the RTE challenges towards a more practical setting of text processing applications occurred with the introduction of the Search task in the Fifth RTE challenge (RTE-5).",
        "In this task entailing sentences are situated within documents and depend on other sentences for their correct interpretation.",
        "Thus, discourse becomes a substantial factor impacting inference.",

        "The task may seem as a variant of information retrieval (IR), as it requires finding specific texts in a corpus.",
        "Yet, it is fundamentally different from IR for two reasons.",
        "First, the target output is a set of sentences, each evaluated independently, rather than a set of documents.",
        "Second, the decision criterion is entailment rather than relevance.",

        "As mentioned, these phenomena are poorly addressed by available reference resolvers or fall completely out of their scope.",
        "A large number of coreference relations are comprised of terms which share lexical elements, (e.g. \"airliners's first flight\" and \"Airbus A380's first flight\").",
        "Although common in coreference relations, standard resolvers miss many of these cases.",

        "This is a bridging phenomenon that is typically not addressed by available discourse processing tools.",
        "To compensate for that, we identify key terms for each document based on tf-idf scores and consider them as global information for that document.",

        "(iii) is it a location?",
        "The weights for these features are set empirically.",

        "Considering the previous sentence Another method for addressing missing coreference and bridging relations is based on the assumption that adjacent sentences often refer to the same entities and events.",

        "fications of its adjacent sentences are given by an oracle classifier that provides the correct answer with probability p. The system is applied using two locality features: the 1st sentence entailing title feature and a close variant of the smoothed entailment feature, which calculates the weighted average of adjacent sentences, but disregards the score of the currently evaluated sentence.",
        "Thus we supply information about adjacent sentences and test whether overall performance increases with the accuracy of this information.",
        "We performed this experiment for p in a range of [0.5-1.0].",
        "Figure 2 shows the results of this simulation, based on the average F1 of five runs for each p. Since performance, from a certain point, increases with the accuracy of the oracle classifier, we can conclude that indeed precise information about adjacent sentences improves performance on the current sentence, and that locality is a true phenomenon in the data.",
        "We note, however, that performance improves only when accuracy is very high, suggesting the currently limited practical potential of this information, at least in the way locality was represented in this work.",
        "Ablation tests Table 3 presents the results of the ablation tests performed to evaluate the contribution of each component.",
        "Based on the result reported in Table 1 and the above discussion, the tests were performed relative to BIU-DISCno-loc, the optimal configuration.",

        "Possibly, this information is also included in the other components, thus proving no marginal contribution relative to them.",
        "Under the conditions of an overwhelming majority of negative examples, this is a risky method to use, and should be considered when the ratio of positive examples is higher.",
        "For future work, we intend to use this information via classification features (e.g. the coverage obtained with and without global information), rather than the crude addition of the term to the sentence.",
        "Analysis of augmented coreferences We analyzed the performance of the component for augmenting coreference relations relative to the OpenNLP resolver.",
        "Recall that our component works on top of the resolver's output and can add or remove coreference relations.",
        "As a complete annotation of coreference chains in the dataset is unavailable, we performed the following evaluation.",
        "Recall is computed based on the number of identified pairs from a sample of 100 intra-document coreference and bridging relations from the annotated dataset described in (Mirkin et al., 2010).",
        "Precision is computed based on 50 pairs sampled from the output of each method, equally distributed over topics.",
        "The results, shown in Table 4, indicate the much higher recall obtained by our component at some cost in precision.",
        "Although rather simple, the ablation test ofthis component shows its usefulness.",
        "Still, both methods achieve low absolute recall, suggesting the need for more robust tools for this task.",

        "Figure 3: Fi performance as a function of the number of retrieved candidates.",
        "Candidate retrieval setting As mentioned in Section 3, best performance of RTE systems in the task was obtained when applying a first step of IR-based candidate filtering.",
        "We therefore compare the performance of BIU-DISC with that of BIU-BL under this setting as well.",
        "For candidate retrieval we used Lucene, a state of the art search engine, in a range of top-k retrieved candidates.",
        "The results are shown in Figure 3.",
        "For reference, the figure also shows the performance along this range of Lucene as-is, when no further inference is applied to the retrieved candidates.",
        "While BIU-DISC does not outperform BIU-BL at every point, the area under the curve is clearly larger for BIU-DISC.",
        "The figure also indicates that BIU-DISC is far more robust, maintaining a stable F1 and enabling a stable tradeoff between recall and precision along the whole range (recall ranges between 42% and 55% for k G [15 - 100], with corresponding precision range of 51% to 33%).",
        "Finally, Table 5 shows the results of the best systems as determined in our first experiment.",
        "We performed a single experiment to compare BIU-DISCno-loc and BIU-BL under a candidate retrieval setting, using k = 20, where both systems highly perform.",
        "We compare these results to the highest score obtained by Lucene, as well as to the two best submissions to the RTE-5 Search task.",
        "BIU-DISCno-loc outperforms all other methods and its result is significantly better than BIU-BL with p < 0.01 according to McNemar's test.",
        "While it is generally assumed that discourse interacts with semantic entailment inference, the concrete impacts of discourse on such inference have been hardly explored.",
        "This paper presented a first empirical investigation of discourse processing aspects related to entailment.",
        "We argue that available discourse processing tools should be substantially improved towards this end, both in terms of the phenomena they address today, namely nominal coreference, and with respect to the covering of additional phenomena, such as bridging anaphora.",
        "Our experiments show that even rather simple methods for addressing discourse can have a substantial positive impact on the performance of entailment inference.",
        "Concerning the locality phenomenon stemming from discourse coherence, we learned that it does carry potentially useful information, which might become beneficial in the future when better-performing entailment systems become available.",
        "Until then, integrating this information with entailment confidence may be useful.",
        "Overall, we suggest that entailment systems should extensively incorporate discourse information, while developing sound algorithms for addressing various discourse phenomena, including the ones described in this paper."
