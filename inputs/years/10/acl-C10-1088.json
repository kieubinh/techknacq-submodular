        "Several parsers and representations have been applied in high-performing methods both in domain studies in general and in the BioNLP'09 shared task in particular, but no direct comparison of parsers or representations has been performed.",
        "Likewise, a number of evaluation of parser outputs against gold standard corpora have been performed in the domain, but the broader implications ofthe results of such intrinsic evaluations are rarely considered.",
        "The BioNLP'09 shared task involved documents contained also in the GENIA treebank (Tateisi et al., 2005), creating an opportunity for direct study of intrinsic and task-oriented evaluation results.",

        "The shared task provided common and consistent task definitions, data sets for training and evaluation, and evaluation criteria.",
        "The shared task defined five simple events (Gene expression, Transcription, Protein catabolism, Phosphorylation, and Localization) that take one core argument, a multi-participant binding event (Binding), and three regulation events (Regulation, Positive regulation, and Negative regulation) used to capture both biological regulation and general causation.",
        "The participants of simple and Binding events were specified to be of the general Protein type, while regulation-type events could also take other events as arguments, creating complex event structures.",

        "In Task 1 the event arguments that need to be extracted are restricted to the core Theme and Cause roles, with secondary arguments corresponding to locations and sites considered in Task 2.",

        "The system was originally developed for finding core events (Task 1) using the native output of the Enju and GDep parsers.",
        "The system consists of three supervised classification-based modules: a trigger detector, an event edge detector, and a complex event detector.",
        "The trigger detector classifies each word into the appropriate event types, the event edge detector classifies each edge between an event and a candidate participant into an argument type, and the complex event detector classifies event candidates constructed by all edge combinations, deciding between event and non-event.",
        "The system uses one-vs-all support vector machines (SVMs) for classification.",
        "The system operates on one sentence at a time, building features for classification based on the syntactic analyses for the sentence provided by the two parsers as well as the sequence of the words in the sentence, including the target candidate.",
        "The features include the constituents/words around entities (triggers and proteins), the dependencies, and the shortest paths among the entities.",
        "The feature generation is format-independent regarding the shared properties of different formats, but makes use also of format-specific information when available for extracting features, including the dependency tags, word-related information (e.g. a lexical entry in Enju format), and the constituents and their head information.",
        "We apply here a variant of the base system incorporating a number of modifications.",
        "The applied system performs feature selection removing two classes of features that were found not to be beneficial for extraction performance, and applies a refinement of the trigger expressions of events.",

        "Many approaches for parser comparison have been proposed, and most comparisons have used gold treebanks with intermediate formats (Clegg and Shepherd, 2007; Pyysalo et al., 2007).",
        "Parser comparison has also been proposed on specific tasks such as unbounded dependencies (Rimell et al., 2009) and textual entailment (Onder Eker, 2009).",
        "Among them, application-oriented parser comparison across several formats was first introduced by Miyao et al.",
        "(2009), who compared eight parsers and five formats for the protein-protein interaction (PPI) extraction task.",
        "PPI extraction, the recognition of binary relations of between proteins, is one of the most basic information extraction tasks in the BioNLP field.",
        "Our findings do not conflict with those of Miyao et al.",
        "Event extraction can be viewed as an additional extrinsic evaluation task for syntactic parsers, providing more reliable and evaluation and a broader perspective into parser performance.",
        "An additional advantage of application-oriented evaluation on BioNLP shared task data is the availability of a manually annotated gold standard treebank, the GENIA treebank, that covers the same set of abstracts as the task data.",
        "This allows the gold treebank to be considered as an evaluation standard, in addition to comparison of performance in the primary task.",

        "We compared six parsers and three formats on a bio-molecular event extraction task with a state-of-the-art event extraction system from two different aspects: dependency-based intrinsic evaluation and task-based extrinsic evaluation.",
        "The specific task considered was the BioNLP shared task, allowing the use of the GENIA treebank as a gold standard parse reference.",
        "Five of the six considered parsers were applied using biomedical models trained on the GENIA treebank, and they were found to produce similar performance.",
        "The comparison of the parsers from two aspects showed slightly different results, and and the dependency representations have advantages and disadvantages for the event extraction task.",
        "The contributions of this paper are 1) the comparison of intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation on several commonly used parsers with a state-of-the-art system, and 2) demonstration of the limitation and possibility of the parser and system improvement on the task.",
        "One limitation of this study is that the comparison between the parsers is not perfect, as the parsers are used with the provided models, the format conversions miss some information from the original formats, and results with different formats depend on the ability of the event extraction system to take advantage of their strengths.",
        "To maximize comparability, the system was designed to extract features identically from similar parts of the dependency-based formats, further adding information provided by other formats, such as the lexical entries of the Enju format, from external resources.",
        "The results of this paper are expected to be useful as a guide not only for parser selection for biomedical information extraction but also for the development of event extraction systems.",
        "The comparison in the present evaluation is limited to the dependency representation.",
        "As future work, it would be informative to extend the comparison to other syntactic representation, such as the PTB format.",
        "Finally, the evaluation showed that the system fails to recover approximately 40% of events even when provided with manually annotated treebank data, showing that other methods and resources need to be adopted to further improve bio-molecular event extraction systems.",
        "Such improvement is left as future work."
