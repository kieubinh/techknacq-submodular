        "Semantic Roles (also known as thematic roles) help to understand the semantic structure of a document (Fillmore, 1968).",
        "At a fundamental level, they help to capture the similarities and differences in the meaning of verbs via the arguments they define by generalizing over surface syntactic configurations.",
        "In turn, these roles aid in domain independent understanding as the semantic frames and semantic understanding systems do not depend on the syntactic configuration for each new application domain.",
        "Identifying semantic roles benefit several language processing tasks - information extraction (Sur-deanu et al., 2003), text categorization (Moschitti, Rohini K. Srihari",
        "University at Buffalo 2008) and finding relations in textual entailment (Burchardt and Frank 2006).",
        "Automatically identifying semantic roles is often referred to as shallow semantic parsing (Gil-dea and Jurafsky, 2002).",
        "For English, this process is facilitated by the existence of two main SRL annotated corpora - FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) and PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005).",
        "Both datasets mark almost all surface realizations of semantic roles.",
        "FrameNet has 800 semantic frames that cover 120,000 example sentences.",
        "PropBank has annotations that cover over 113,000 predicate-argument structures.",
        "Clearly English is well supported with resources for semantic roles.",
        "However, there are other widely spoken resource poor languages that are not as privileged.",
        "The PropBank based resources available for languages like Chinese (Xue and Palmer, 2009) , Korean (Palmer et al., 2006) and Spanish (Taule, 2008) are only about two-thirds the size of the English PropBank.",
        "Several alternative techniques have been explored in the literature to generate semantic role labeled corpora for resource poor languages as providing manually annotated data is time consuming and involves intense human labor.",
        "Ambati and Chen (2007) have conducted an extensive survey and outlined the benefits of using parallel corpora to transfer annotations.",
        "A wide range of annotations from part of speech (Hi and Hwa, 2005) and chunks (Yarowsky et al., 2001) to word senses (Diab and Resnik, 2002), dependencies (Hwa et al., 2002) and semantic roles (Padó and Lapata, 2009) have been successfully transferred between languages.",
        "FrameNet style annotations in Chinese is obtained by mapping English FrameNet entries directly to concepts listed in HowNet (online ontology for Chinese) with an accuracy of 68% (Fung and Chen, 2004).",
        "Fung et al.",
        "(2007) analyze an automatically annotated English-Chinese parallel corpus and show high cross-lingual agreement for PropBank roles (range of 75%-95% based on the roles).",
        "In this paper we explore the possibility of using English-Urdu parallel corpora to generate SRL annotations for Urdu, a less commonly taught language (LCTL).",
        "Earlier attempts to generate SRL corpora using annotation projections have been for languages such as German, French (Padó and Lapata, 2009) and Italian (Moschitti, 2009) that have high vocabulary overlap with English.",
        "Also, German belongs to the same language family as English (Germanic family).",
        "Urdu on the other hand is an Indic language that is grammatically very different and shares almost no vocabulary with English.",
        "The technique of cross lingual projections warrants good BLEU score that ensures correct word alignments.",
        "According to NIST 2008 Open Machine Translation challenge, a 0.2280 best BLEU score was achieved for Urdu to English translation.",
        "This is comparable to the BLEU scores achieved for German to English - 0.253 and French to English - 0.3 (Koehn, 2005).",
        "But, for SRL transfer, perfect word alignment is not mandatory as SRL requires semantic correspondence only.",
        "According to Fillmore (1982) semantic frames are based on conceptual structures.",
        "They are generalizations over surface structures and hence less prone to syntactic variations.",
        "Since English and Urdu have a reasonable semantic correspondence (Example 3), we believe that the projections when capped with a post processing step will considerably reduce the noise induced by inaccurate alignments and produce acceptable mappings.",
        "Hindi is syntactically similar to Urdu.",
        "These languages are standardized forms of Hindustani.",
        "They are free word order languages and follow a general SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) structure.",
        "Projection approach has been used by (Mukerjee et al., 2006) and (Sinha, 2009) to transfer verb predicates from English onto Hindi.",
        "Sinha (2009) achieves a 90% F-Measure in verb predicate transfer from English to Hindi.",
        "This shows that using cross lingual transfer approach to obtain semantic annotations for Urdu from English is an idea worth exploring.",
        "Our approach leverages existing English PropBank annotations provided via the SemLinkcorpus.",
        "SemLink provides annotations for VerbNet using the pb (PropBank) attribute.",
        "By using English-Urdu parallel corpus we acquire verb predicates and their arguments.",
        "When we transfer verb predicates (lemmas), we also transfer pb attributes.",
        "We obtain annotation projections from the parallel corpora as follows:",

        "Annotate E with semantic roles.",
        "3.",
        "Project the annotations from E onto U using word alignment information, lexical information and linguistic rules that involve syntactic information.",
        "There are several challenges to the annotation projection technique.",
        "Dorr (1994) presents some major lexical-semantic divergence problems applicable in this scenario:",
        "(a) Thematic Divergence - In some cases, although there exists semantic parallelism, the theme of the English sentence captured in the subject changes into an object in the Urdu sentence (Example 1).",
        "(b) Conflatational Divergence - Sometimes target translations spans over a group of words (Example 1: plays is mapped to kirdar ada).",
        "Trying to ascertain this word span for semantic roles is difficult as the alignments can be incomplete and very noisy.",
        "(c) Demotional divergence and Structural divergence - Despite semantic relatedness, in some sentence pairs, alignments obtained from simple projections generate random matchings as the usage is syntactically dissimilar (Example 2).",
        "Handling all challenges adds complexity to our model.",
        "The heuristic rules that we implement are guided by linguistic knowledge of Urdu.",

        "Sentence alignment is a prerequisite for any parallel corpora processing.",
        "As the first step, we had to generate a perfect sentence aligned parallel corpus as the translated sentences, despite belonging to the same domain (WSJ - Penn tree bank), had several errors in demarcating the sentence boundaries.",
        "Sentence alignment between English and Urdu is achieved over two iterations.",
        "In the first iteration, the length of each sentence is calculated based on the occurrence of words belonging to important part of speech categories such as proper nouns, adjectives and verbs.",
        "Considering main POS categories for length assessment helps overcome the conflatational divergence issue.",
        "For each English sentence, Urdu sentences with the same length are considered to be probable candidates for alignment.",

        "There could also be a collision if Urdu sentences have English transliterated words (Example 3, \"office\").",

        "In order to augment the alignment accuracy, we added 3000 Urdu-English words and phrases obtained from the Urdu-English dictionary to our parallel corpus.",
        "The alignment accuracy improved by 3% as the lexicon affects the word cooccurrence count.",
        "Word alignment in itself does not produce accurate semantic role projections from English to Urdu.",
        "This is because the verb predicates in Urdu can span more than one token.",
        "Semantic roles can cover sentential constituents of arbitrary length, and simply using word alignments for projection is likely to result in wrong role spans.",
        "Also, alignments are not obtained for all words.",
