        "With rapidly growing online sources aimed at encouraging and stimulating people's discussions concerning personal, public or social issues (news, blogs, discussion forums, etc.",
        "), there is a great need in development of a computational tool for the analysis of people's attitudes.",
        "According to the Appraisal Theory (Martin and White, 2005), attitude types define the specifics of appraisal being expressed: affect (personal emotional state), judgment (social or ethical appraisal of other's behaviour), and appreciation (evaluation of phenomena).",
        "To analyse contextual sentiment of a phrase or a sentence, rule-based approaches (Nasukawa and Yi, 2003; Moilanen and Pulman, 2007; Sub-rahmanian and Reforgiato, 2008), a machine-learning method using not only lexical but also syntactic features (Wilson et al., 2005), and a model of integration of machine learning approach with compositional semantics (Choi and Cardie, 2008) were proposed.",
        "With the aim to recognize fine-grained emotions from text on the level of distinct sentences, researchers have employed a keyword spotting technique (Chuang and Wu, 2004; Strapparava et al., 2007), a technique calculating emotion scores using Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) (Kozareva et al., 2007), an approach inspired by common-sense knowledge (Liu et al., 2003), rule-based linguistic approaches (Boucouvalas, 2003; Chaumartin, 2007), machine-learning methods (Alm, 2008; Aman and Szpakowicz, 2008; Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2008), and an ensemble based multilabel classification technique (Bhowmick et al., 2009).",
        "Early attempts to focus on distinct attitude types in the task of attitude analysis were made by Taboada and Grieve (2004), who determined a potential value of adjectives for affect, judgement and appreciation by calculating the PMI with the pronoun-copular pairs 'I was (affect)' 'He was (judgement)'and 'It was (appreciation)', and Whitelaw et al.",
        "(2005), who used a machine learning technique (SVM) with finegrained semantic distinctions in features (attitude type, orientation) in combination with \"bag of words\" to classify movie reviews.",
        "However, the concentration only on adjectives expressing appraisal and their modifiers greatly narrows the potential of the Whitelaw et al.",
        "(2005) approach.",
        "In this paper we introduce our system @AM (ATtitude Analysis Model), which (1) classifies sentences according to the fine-grained attitude labels (nine affect categories (Izard, 1971): 'anger', 'disgust', 'fear', 'guilt', 'interest', 'joy', 'sadness', 'shame', 'surprise'; four polarity labels for judgment and appreciation: 'POS jud', 'NEG jud', 'POS app', 'NEG app'; and 'neutral'); (2) assigns the strength of the attitude; and (3) determines the level of confidence, with which the attitude is expressed.",

        "Polarity reversal means that a phrase or statement containing an attitude-conveying term/phrase with prior positive polarity becomes negative, and vice versa.",

        "In order to evaluate the performance of our algorithm, we created the data set of sentences extracted from personal stories about life experiences that were anonymously published on the Experience Project website",
        "(www.experienceproject.com), where people share personal experiences, thoughts, opinions, feelings, passions, and confessions through the network of personal stories.",
        "With over 4 million experiences accumulated (as of February 2010), Experience Project is a perfect source for researchers interested in studying different types of attitude expressed through text.",
        "For our experiment we extracted 1000 sentencesfrom various stories grouped by topics within 13 different categories, such as \"Arts and entertainment\", \"Current events\", \"Education\", \"Family and friends\", \"Health and wellness\", \"Relationships and romance\" and others, on the Experience Project website.",
        "Sentences were collected from 358 distinct topic groups, such as \"I still remember September 11\", \"I am intelligent but airheaded\", \"I think bullfighting is cruel\", \"I quit smoking\", \"I am a fashion victim\", \"I was adopted\" and others.",
        "We considered three hierarchical levels of attitude labels in our experiment (see Figure 1).",
        "Three independent annotators labeled the sentences with one of 14 categories from the ALL level and a corresponding score (the strength or intensity value).",
        "These annotations were further interpreted using labels from the MID and the TOP levels.",
        "Fleiss' Kappa coefficient was used as a measure of reliability of human raters' annotations.",
        "The agreement coefficient on 1000 sentences was 0.53 on ALL level, 0.57 on MID level, and 0.73 on TOP level.",
        "Only those sentences, on which at least two out of three human raters completely agreed, were included in the gold standards for our experiment.",
        "Three gold standards were created according to the hierarchy of attitude labels.",
        "Fleiss' Kappa coefficients are 0.62, 0.63, and 0.74 on ALL, MID, and TOP levels, correspondingly.",
        "Table 3 shows the distributions of labels in the gold standards.",
        "The results of a simple method selecting the attitude label with the maximum intensity from the annotations of sentence tokens found in the database were considered as the baseline.",
        "After processing each sentence from the data set by the baseline method and our @AM system, we measured averaged accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score for each label in ALL, MID, and TOP levels.",
        "The results are shown in Table 4.",
        "As seen from the obtained results, our algorithm performed with high accuracy significantly surpassing the baselines in all levels of attitude hierarchy, thus demonstrating the contribution of the sentence parsing and our hand-crafted rules to the reliable recognition of attitude from text.",
        "Two-tailed t-tests with significance level of 0.05 showed that the differences in accuracy between the baseline method and our @AM system are statistically significant (p<0.001) in fine-grained as well as coarse-grained classifications.",
        "In the case of fine-grained attitude recognition (ALL level), the highest precision was obtained for 'shame' (0.923) and 'NEG jud' (0.889), while the highest recall was received for 'sadness' (0.917) and 'joy' (0.905) emotions at the cost of low precision (0.528 and 0.439, correspondingly).",
        "The algorithm performed with the worst results in recognition of 'NEG app' and 'neutral'.",
        "The analysis of a confusion matrix for the ALL level revealed the following top confusions of our system: (1) 'anger', 'fear', 'guilt', 'shame', 'NEG jud', 'NEG app' and 'neutral' were predominantly incorrectly predicted as 'sadness' (for ex., @AM resulted in 'sadness' for the sentence 'I know we have several months left before the election, but I am already sick and tired of seeing the ads on TV, while human annotations were 'anger'/'anger'/'disgust'); (2) 'interest', 'POS jud' and 'POS app' were mostly confused with 'joy' by our algorithm (e.g., @AM classified the sentence 'It's one of those life changing artifacts that we must have in order to have happier, healthier lives' as 'joy'(-ful), while human annotations were 'POS app'/'POS app'/'interest').",
        "Our system achieved high precision for all categories on the MID level (Table 4), with the exception of 'NEG app' and 'neutral', although high recall was obtained only in the case of categories related to affect ('POS aff, 'NEG aff).",
        "These results indicate that affect sensing is easier than recognition of judgment or appreciation from text.",
        "TOP level results (Table 4) show that our algorithm classifies sentences that convey positive or negative sentiment with high accuracy (92% and 91%, correspondingly).",
