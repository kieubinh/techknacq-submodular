        "Although establishing the trustworthiness of the information presented to us has always been a challenge, the advent of the Information Age and the Internet has made it more critical.",
        "Blogs, wikis, message boards and other collaborative media have eliminated the high entry barrier-and, with it, the enforced journalistic standards-of older, established media such as newspapers and television, and even these sometimes loosen their fact-checking in the face of increased competitive pressure.",
        "Consequently, we find that corpora derived from these sources now offer far more numerous views of far more questionable veracity.",
        "If one author claims Mumbai is the largest city in the world, and another claims it is Seoul, who do we believe?",
        "One or both authors could be intentionally lying, honestly mistaken or, alternatively, of different viewpoints of what constitutes a \"city\" (the city proper?",
        "The metropolitan area?)",
        "Truth is not objective: there may be many valid definitions of \"city\", but we should believe the claim that accords with our user's viewpoint.",
        "Note that the user may be another computational system rather than a human (e.g. building a knowledge base of city sizes for question answering), and often neither the user's nor the information source's perspective will be explicit (e.g. an author will not fully elaborate \"the largest city by metropolitan area bounded by...\") but will instead be implied (e.g. a user's statement that \"I already know the population of city A is X, city B is Y...\" implies that his definition of a city accords with these figures).",
        "The most basic approach is to take a vote: if multiple claims are mutually exclusive of each other, select the one asserted by the most sources.",
        "In our experiments, sources will be the authors of the document containing the claim, but other sources could be publishers/websites (when no authorship is given), an algorithm that outputs claims, etc.",
        "Although sometimes competitive, we found voting to be generally lackluster.",
        "A class of algorithms called fact-finders are often a dramatic improvement, but are incapable of taking advantage of the user's prior knowledge.",
        "Our framework translates prior knowledge (expressed as firstorder logic) into a linear program that constrains the claim beliefs produced by a fact-finder, ensuring that our belief state is consistent with both common sense (\"cities usually grow\") and known facts (\"Los Angeles is more populous than Wichita\").",
        "While in the past first-order logic has been translated to NP-hard integer linear programs, we use polynomial-time-solvable linear programs, allowing us to readily scale to large problems with extensive prior knowledge, as demonstrated by our experiments.",
        "We next discuss related work, followed by a more in-depth description of the fact-finding algorithms used in our experiments, including three novel, high-performing algorithms: Average-Log, Investment, and Pooledlnvestment.",
        "We then present the framework's mechanics and the translation of first-order logic into a linear program.",
        "Finally, we present our experimental setup and results over three domains chosen to illustrate different aspects of the framework, demonstrating that both our new fact-finders and our framework offer performance improvements over the current state of the art."

        "While our belief in a claim is decidedly Bayesian (the probability that the claim is true), \"unknowns\" (discussed later) allow us to reason about ignorance as subjective logic and Dempster-Shafer do, but with less complexity.",
        "Reputation-based systems determine an entity's trust or standing among peers via transitive recommendations, as PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998) does among web pages, Advogato (Levien, 2008) does among people, and Eigentrust (Kam-var et al., 2003) does among peers in a network.",
        "Some, such as Hubs and Authorities (Klein-berg, 1999), are readily adapted to fact-finding, as demonstrated later.",
        "Information-based approaches utilize content (rather than peer recommendations) to compute trust, and are often specialized for a particular domain.",
        "For example, (Zeng et al., 2006) and Wik-itrust (Adler and de Alfaro, 2007) determine trust in a wiki's text passages from sequences of revisions but lack the claim-level granularity and general applicability of fact-finders.",
        "Given a large set of sources making conflicting claims, fact-finders determine \"the truth\" by iteratively updating their parameters, calculating belief in facts based on the trust in their sources, and the trust in sources based on belief in their facts.",
        "TruthFinder (Yin et al., 2008) is a straightforward implementation of this idea.",
        "AccuVote (Dong et al., 2009a; Dong et al., 2009b) improves on this by using calculated source dependence (where one source derives its information from another) to give higher credibility to independent sources.",
        "(Galland et al., 2010)'s 3-Estimates algorithm incorporates the estimated \"hardness\" of a fact, such that knowing the answer to an easy question earns less trust than to a hard one.",

        "), eliminating any date these sources disagreed upon, and ultimately obtained a total of 2,685 dates to test against.",
        "Our common sense (\"CS\") knowledge was: nobody dies before they are born, people are infertile before the age of 7, nobody lives past 125, all spouses have overlapping lifetimes, no child is born more than a year after a parent's (father's) death, nobody has more than two parents, and nobody is born or dies after 2008 (the \"present day\", the year of the Wikipedia dump).",
        "Applying this knowledge roughly halved convergence times, but had little effect on the results due to data sparsity similar to that seen in the population data-while we know many birthdays and some death dates, relatively few biographies had parent-child and spouse claims.",
        "To this we also added knowledge of the decade (but not the exact date) in which 15,145 people were born (\"CS+Decades\").",

        "After obtaining a list of words with spellings that differed between American and British English (e.g. \"color\" vs. \"colour\"), we examined the British National Corpus as well as Washington Post and Reuters news articles, taking the source's (the article author's) use of a disputed word as a claim that his spelling was correct.",
        "Our goal was to find the \"true\" British spellings that conformed to a British viewpoint, but American spellings predominate by far.",
        "Consequently, without prior knowledge the fact-finders do very poorly against our test set of 694 British words, predicting American spelling instead in accordance with the great majority of authors (note that accuracy from an American perspective is 1 โ \"British\" accuracy).",
        "Next we assumed that the user already knew the correct spelling of 100 random words (removing these from the test set, of course), but with little effect.",
        "Finally, we added our common sense (\"CS\") knowledge: if a spelling a is correct and of length > 4, then if a is a substring of b, a <<=> b (e.g. colour <<=> colourful).",
        "Furthermore, while we do not know a priori whether a spelling is American or British, we do know if e and f are different spellings of the same word, and, if two such spellings have a chain of implication between them, we can break all links in this chain (while some American spellings will still be linked to British spellings, this removes most such errors).",
        "Interestingly, common sense alone actually hurts results (e.g. Pooledlnvestment (IBT) gets 6.2%), as it essentially makes the fact-finders more adept at finding the predominant American spellings!",
        "However, when some correct spellings are known, results improve greatly and demonstrate IBT's ability to spread strong prior knowledge, easily surpassing L+I.",

      "text": [
        "We have introduced a new framework for incorporating prior knowledge into a fact-finding system, along with several new high-performing fact-finding algorithms (Investment, PooledIn-vestment, and Average Log).",
        "While the benefits of prior knowledge were most dramatic in the Spelling domain, we saw gains from both \"common sense\" and specific knowledge in all experiments-even the difficult Biography domain saw faster convergence with common sense alone and notably higher results when specific knowledge was added.",
        "We find that while prior knowledge is helpful in reducing error, when the user's viewpoint disagrees with the norm it becomes absolutely essential and, formulated as a linear program, it need not be the computational burden that might otherwise be expected."
