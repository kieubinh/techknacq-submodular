        "Textual emotion analysis is becoming increasingly important due to augmented communication via computer mediated communication (CMC).",
        "A possible application of textual emotion recognition is online chat system.",
        "An emotion feedback system can recognize users' emotion and give appropriate responses.",
        "Another application example is weblog emotion recognition and prediction.",
        "Blogspace consists of millions of users who maintain their online diaries, containing frequently-updated views and personal remarks about a range of issues.",
        "An emotion recognition and prediction system can understand the public's reaction to some social issues and predict emotion changes.",
        "It would be helpful for solving some psychological problems or giving early warnings, such as suicide or terrorism.",
        "Textual emotion analysis also can improve the accuracy of other nonverbal modalities like speech or facial emotion recognition, and to improve human computer interaction systems.",
        "However, automatic recognition of emotion meaning from texts presents a great challenge.",
        "One of the reasons is the manifoldness of expressed emotions in words.",
        "Emotion words have been well used as the most obvious choice as feature in the task of textual emotion recognition and automatic emotion lexicon construction (Virginia and Pablo, 2006; Tokuhisa et al., 2008, etc.).",
        "And there are many lexical resources developed for these tasks, such as GI (Stone et al., 1966), WordNet-Affect (Strap-parava and Valitutti, 2004), NTU Sentiment Dictionary (Ku et al., 2006), Hownet (Dong and Dong, 2003), SentiWordnet (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006).",
        "In these sentimental or affective lexicons, the words usually bear direct emotions or opinions, such as happy or sad, good or bad.",
        "Although they play a role in some applications, several problems of emotion expression in words have been ignored.",
        "Firstly, there are a lot of sentences can evoke emotions without direct emotion words.",
        "For example,",
        "m o (Spring is in children's eyes, and in their hearts.)",
        "In sentence (1), we may feel joy, love or expect delivered by the writer.",
        "But there are no direct emotion words can be found from lexicons.",
        "As Ortony (1987) indicates, besides words directly referring to emotion states (e.g., \"fear\", \"cheerful\") and for which an appropriate lexicon would help, there are words that act only as an indirect reference to emotions depending on the context.",
        "Strapparava et al.",
        "(2006) also address this issue.",
        "The authors believed that all words can potentially convey affective meaning, and they distinguished between words directly referring to emotion states (direct affective words) and those having only an indirect reference that depends on the context (indirect affective words).",
        "The second problem is emotion ambiguity of words.",
        "The same word in different contexts may reflect different emotions.",
        "For example,",
        "(2) S m s M ^ m # m o (Thisiscur-rently the only thing I can do.)",
        "In sentence (2), the word – (only)\" may express the emotion of anxiety or expect; but in sentence (3), the word – (only)\" may express the emotion of love or expect.",
        "The emotion categories can not be determined without their certain contexts especially for the words with emotion ambiguity.",
        "In addition, some words can express multiple emotions, such as \"ffi $ 3t tü (mingled feelings of joy and sorrow)\".",
        "Statistics on an annotated emotion corpus (Ren-CECps , Chinese emotion corpus developed by Ren-lab) showed that 84.9% of all emotion words have one emotion, 15.1% have more than one emotions (Quan and Ren, 2010).",
        "Multi-emotion words are indispensable for expressing complex feelings in use of language.",
        "In this work, we explore features for recognizing word emotion in sentences.",
        "Based on Ren-CECps and MaxEnt model, several contextual features and their combination have been experimented.",
        "Then PLSA (probabilistic latent semantic analysis) is used to get semantic feature by clustering word and sentence.",
        "The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of using semantic feature for word emotion recognition.",
        "After that, the notion of \"word emotion components\" is proposed to describe the combined basic emotions in a word.",
        "A significant performance improvement over only using contextual and semantic features was observed after adding word emotion components as feature and output in MaxEnt based model.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "In section 2, based on Ren-CECps and MaxEnt, an exploration of using contextual feature for Chinese word emotion recognition is described.",
        "In section 3, using PLSA technique, the performance of adding semantic feature is presented.",
        "In section 4, the notion of \"word emotion components\" is proposed and the performance of using encoding feature is presented.",
