        "The purpose of route directions is to inform a person, who is typically not familiar with his current environment, of how to get to a designated goal.",
        "Generating such directions poses difficulties on various conceptual levels such as planning the route, selecting landmarks (i.e., recognizable buildings or structures) and splitting the task into appropriate single instructions of how to navigate along the route using the selected landmarks as reference points.",
        "Previously developed natural language generation (NLG) systems make use of simple heuristics for the task of content selection for route directions (Dale et al., 2005; Roth and Frank, 2009).",
        "In our work, we aim for a corpus-based approach that can be flexibly modeled after natural, human-produced directions for varying subtasks (e.g., indoor vs. outdoor navigation), and that facilitates multilingual extensions.",
        "By employing salient landmarks and allowing for variation in NL realization, such a system is expected to generate natural sounding directions that are easier to memorize and easier to follow than directions given by a classical route planner or navigation system.",
        "NLG for route directions crucially differs from other generation tasks such as document summarization (Mani, 2001) in that the selection and ordering of input structures for language generation is heavily situation-dependent, i.e., dependent on the specific properties of a given route to be followed.",
        "In line with a corpus-based NLG approach, we propose to automatically align geographical route representations as produced by a route planner with an annotated corpus of NL directions given by humans for the respective routes.",
        "The induced alignments will (i) serve to identify which elements of a route to select for verbalization, and (ii) deliver correspondences between route segments and linguistic input structures that can be used as a basis for statistical NL generation.",
        "We investigate a minimally supervised method for inducing such alignments to ensure maximal flexibility for adaptations to different scenarios.",
        "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: In Section 2 we discuss related work.",
        "Section 3 introduces the task, and the representation formats and resources we use.",
        "Section 4 introduces a basic Expectation-Maximization model and two extensions for the alignment task.",
        "Section 5 outlines the experiments and presents the evaluation results.",
        "In Section 6 we conclude and discuss future work."

        "Selecting appropriate content for a task can be defined heuristically, by manually crafted rules or by learning content selection rules automatically from corpus data.",
        "Previous work by on generating NL directions used hand-crafted heuristics.",

        "They show how a generative model can be used to segment text into utterances and to identify relevant facts with minimal supervision.",
        "Both tasks are handled jointly in a unified framework by training a hierarchical semi-Markov model on pairs of text and world states, thereby modeling sequencing effects in the presentation of facts.",
        "While their work is not primarily concerned with NLG, the learned correspondences and their probabilities could be applied to induce content selection rules and linguistic mappings in a NLG task.",
        "The approach is shown to be effective in scenarios typical for NLG settings (weather forecasts, RoboCup sportscasting, NFL recaps) that differ in the amount of available data, length of textual descriptions, and density of alignments.",
        "In the following, we will adapt ideas from their EM-based approach to align (segments of) route representations and NL route directions in a minimally supervised manner.",
        "We will investigate increasingly refined models that are tailored to the nature of our task and underlying representations.",
        "In particular, we extend their approach by exploiting semantic markup in the NL direction corpus."

        "While our EM implementation maximizes the likelihood for all alignment probabilities based on expected counts, many pairs are not - or not frequently - found in the corpus.",
        "This results in the model often choosing incorrect alignments for categorial attributes and makes up for 23% of the misaligned attributes in total.",
        "We found that further 5% of the attributes are misaligned with frame elements containing pronouns that actually refer to a different attribute.",
        "As our word choice model does not account for the use of anaphora, none of the affected frame elements are aligned correctly.",
        "Given the genre of our corpus, integrating simple heuristics to resolve anaphora (e.g., binding to the closest preceding mention) could solve this problem for the majority of the cases."

        "We presented a weakly supervised method for aligning route representations and natural language directions on the basis of parallel corpora using EM-based learning.",
        "Our models adopt ideas from Liang et al.",
        "(2009) with special adaptations to the current application scenario.",
        "As a major difference to their work, we make use of frame-semantic annotations on the NL side as a basis for segmentation.",
        "While we can show that the extended models significantly outperform a simple EM-based model, the overall results are still moderate.",
        "We cannot draw a direct comparison to the results presented in Liang et al.",
        "(2009) due to the different scenarios and data sets.",
        "However, the corpus they used for the NFL recaps scenario is the closest to ours in terms of available data size and percentage of aligned records (in our case attributes).",
        "For this kind of corpus, they achieve an F1 score of 39.9% with the model that is closest to ours (Model 2').",
        "Their model achieves higher performance for scenarios with more available data and a higher percentage of alignments.",
        "Thus we expect that our model benefits from additional data sets, which we plan to gather in web-based settings.",
        "Still, we do not expect to achieve near to perfect alignments due to speaker variation, a factor we also observe in the current data.",
        "As our ultimate goal is to generate NL instructions from given route representations, we can nevertheless make use of imperfectly aligned data for the compilation of high-confidence rules to compute semantic input structures for NLG.",
        "Following previous work by Barzilay and Lee (2002), we can also exploit the fact that our data consists of multiple directions for each route to identify alternative realization patterns for the same route segments.",
        "In addition, (semi-)supervised models could be used to assess the gain we may achieve in comparison to the minimally supervised setting.",
        "However, we still see potential for improving our current models by integrating refinements based on the observations outlined above: Missing alignment targets on the linguistic side - especially due to anaphora, elliptical or aggregating constructions - constitute the main error source.",
        "We aim to capture these phenomena within the linguistic markup in order to provide hidden alignment targets.",
        "Also, our current model only considers frame elements as alignment targets.",
        "This can be extended to include their verbal predicates.",
