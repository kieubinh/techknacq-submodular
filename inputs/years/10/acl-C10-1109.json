        "Existing ontology builders either ignore this general information or they provide a limited implementation to extract it.",
        "The input to our builder (Figure 1) is a multiple-domain corpus.",
        "The first step is the clustering operation, which divides the given corpus documents into clusters that are different among each other with high internal similarity.",

        "We separate a multiple-domain corpus into various domain specific corpora such that the domain concepts are weighted based on their significance in that domain; also, the common concepts in different domains are separated.",

        "That was because the number of resulting clusters should be known as a parameter in the latter.",

        "We employ the agglomerative hierarchical clustering technique (Manning et al., 2008).",
