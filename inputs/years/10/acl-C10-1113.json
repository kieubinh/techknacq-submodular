        "Besides enriching our thought and communication with novel imagery, the phenomenon of metaphor also plays a crucial structural role in our use of language.",
        "Metaphors arise when one concept is viewed in terms of the properties of the other.",
        "Below are some examples of metaphor.",
        "(2) Inflation has eaten up all my savings.",
        "(Lakoff (3) He shot down all of my arguments.",
        "(Lakoff",
        "(4) And then my heart with pleasure fills, And dances with the daffodils.",
        "In metaphorical expressions seemingly unrelated features of one concept are associated with another concept.",
        "In the computer science metaphor in (1) the computational process is viewed as something alive and, therefore, its forced termination is associated with the act of killing.",
        "Lakoff and Johnson (1980) explain metaphor as a systematic association, or a mapping, between two concepts or conceptual domains: the source and the target.",
        "The metaphor in (3) exemplifies a mapping of a concept of argument to that of war.",
        "The argument, which is the target concept, is viewed in terms of a battle (or a war), the source concept.",
        "The existence of such a link allows us to talk about arguments using the war terminology, thus giving rise to a number of metaphors.",
        "Characteristic to all areas of human activity (from poetic to ordinary to scientific) and, thus, to all types of discourse, metaphor becomes an important problem for natural language processing (NLP).",
        "In order to estimate the frequency of the phenomenon, Shutova and Teufel (2010) conducted a corpus study on a subset of the British National Corpus (BNC) (Burnard, 2007) representing various genres.",
        "They manually annotated metaphorical expressions in this data and found that 241 out of 761 sentences contained a metaphor, whereby in 164 phrases metaphoricity was introduced by a verb.",
        "Due to such a high frequency of their use, a system capable of recognizing and interpreting metaphorical expressions in unrestricted text would become an invaluable component of any semantics-oriented NLP application.",
        "Automatic processing of metaphor can be clearly divided into two subtasks: metaphor identification (distinguishing between literal and metaphorical language in text) and metaphor interpretation (identifying the intended literal meaning of a metaphorical expression).",
        "Both of them have been repeatedly attempted in NLP.",
        "To date the most influential account of metaphor identification is that of Wilks (1978).",
        "According to Wilks, metaphors represent a violation of selectional restrictions in a given context.",
        "Consider the following example.",
        "The verb drink normally takes an animate subject and a liquid object.",
        "Therefore, drink taking a car as a subject is an anomaly, which may as well indicate metaphorical use of drink.",
        "This approach was automated by Fass (1991) in his met* system.",
        "However, Fass himself indicated a problem with the method: it detects any kind of non-literalness or anomaly in language (metaphors, metonymies and others), i.e., it overgenerates with respect to metaphor.",
        "The techniques met* uses to differentiate between those are mainly based on hand-coded knowledge, which implies a number of limitations.",
        "In a similar manner manually created knowledge in the form of WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) is employed by the system of Krishnakumaran and Zhu (2007), which essentially differentiates between highly lexicalized metaphors included in WordNet, and novel metaphorical senses.",
        "Alternative approaches (Gedigan et al., 2006) search for metaphors of a specific domain defined a priori (e.g. MOTION metaphors) in a specific type of discourse (e.g. Wall Street Journal).",
        "In contrast, the scope of our experiments is the whole of the British National Corpus (BNC) (Burnard, 2007) and the domain of the expressions we identify is unrestricted.",
        "However, our technique is also distinguished from the systems of Fass (1991) and Krishnakumaran and Zhu (2007) in that it does not rely on any hand-crafted knowledge, but rather captures metaphoricity in an unsupervised way by means of verb and noun clustering.",
        "The motivation behind the use of clustering methods for metaphor identification task lies in the nature of metaphorical reasoning based on association.",
        "Compare, for example, the target concepts of marriage and political regime.",
        "Having quite distinct meanings, both of them are cognitively mapped to the source domain of mechanism, which shows itself in the following examples:",
        "(6) Our relationship is not really working.",
        "(7) Diana and Charles did not succeed in mending their marriage.",
        "(8) The wheels of Stalin's regime were well oiled and already turning.",
        "We expect that such relatedness of distinct target concepts should manifest itself in the examples of language use, i.e. target concepts that are associated with the same source concept should appear in similar lexico-syntactic environments.",
        "Thus, clustering concepts using grammatical relations (GRs) and lexical features would allow us to capture their relatedness by association and harvest a large number of metaphorical expressions beyond our seed set.",
        "For example, the sentence in (6) being part of the seed set should enable the system to identify metaphors in both (7) and (8).",
        "In summary, our system (1) starts from a seed set of metaphorical expressions exemplifying a range of source-target domain mappings; (2) performs unsupervised noun clustering in order to harvest various target concepts associated with the same source domain; (3) by means of unsupervised verb clustering creates a source domain verb lexicon; (4) searches the BNC for metaphorical expressions describing the target domain concepts using the verbs from the source domain lexicon.",
        "We tested our system starting with a collection of metaphorical expressions representing verb-subject and verb-object constructions, where the verb is used metaphorically.",
        "We evaluated the precision of metaphor identification with the help of human judges.",
        "In addition to this we compared our system to a baseline built upon WordNet, whereby we demonstrated that our method goes far beyond synonymy and captures metaphors not directly related to any of those seen in the seed set."

        "Starting from a small seed set of metaphorical expressions, the system implicitly captures the associations that underly their production and comprehension.",
        "It generalizes over these associations by means of unsupervised verb and noun clustering.",
        "The obtained clusters then represent potential source and target concepts between which metaphorical associations hold.",
        "The knowledge of such associations is then used to annotate metaphoricity in a large corpus.",
        "Abstract concepts that are associated with the same source domain are often related to each other on an intuitive and rather structural level, but their meanings, however, are not necessarily synonymous or even semantically close.",
        "The results of previous research on corpus-based lexical semantics suggest that the linguistic environment in which a lexical item occurs can shed light on its meaning.",
        "A number of works have shown that it is possible to automatically induce semantic word classes from corpus data via clustering of contextual cues (Pereira et al., 1993; Lin, 1998; Schulte im Walde, 2006).",
        "The consensus is that the lexical items exposing similar behavior in a large body of text most likely have the same meaning.",
        "However, the concepts of marriage and political regime, that are also observed in similar lexico-syntactic environments, albeit having quite distinct meanings are likewise assigned by such methods to the same cluster.",
        "In contrast to concrete concepts, such as tea, water, coffee, beer, drink, liquid, that are clustered together due to meaning similarity, abstract concepts tend to be clustered together by association with the same source domain.",
        "It is the presence of this association that explains the fact that they share common contexts.",
        "We exploit this idea for identification of new target domains associated with the same source domain.",
        "We then use unsupervised verb clustering to collect source domain vocabulary, which in turn allows us to harvest a large number of new metaphorical expressions.",
        "Since Levin (1993) published her classification, there have been a number of attempts to automatically classify verbs into semantic classes using supervised and unsupervised approaches (Lin, 1998; Brew and Schulte im Walde, 2002; Korhonen et 2008; Sun and Korhonen, 2009).",
        "Similar methods were also applied to acquisition of noun classes from corpus data (Rooth et al., 1999; Pantel and Lin, 2002; Bergsma et al., 2008).",
        "We adopt a recent verb clustering approach of Sun and Korhonen (2009), who used rich syntactic and semantic features extracted using a shallow parser and a clustering method suitable for the resulting high dimensional feature space.",
        "When Sun and Korhonen evaluated their approach on 204 verbs from 17 Levin classes, they obtained 80.4 F-measure (which is high in particular for an unsupervised approach).",
        "We apply this approach to a much larger set of 1610 verbs: all the verb forms appearing in VerbNet (Kipper et al., 2006) with the exception of highly infrequent ones.",
        "In addition, we adapt the approach to noun clustering.",
        "Our verb dataset is a subset of VerbNet compiled as follows.",
        "For all the verbs in VerbNet we extracted their occurrences (up to 10,000) from the raw corpus data collected originally by Korhonen et al.",
        "(2006) for construction of VALEX lexicon.",
        "Only the verbs found in this data more than 150 times were included in the experiment.",
        "For verb clustering, we adopted the best performing features of Sun and Korhonen (2009): automatically acquired verb subcategorization frames (SCFs) parameterized by their selectional preferences (SPs).",
        "We obtained these features using the SCF acquisition system of Preiss et al.",
        "(2007).",
        "The system tags and parses corpus data using the RASP parser and extracts SCFs from the resulting GRs using a rule-based classifier which identifies 168 SCF types for English verbs.",

        "We obtained SPs by clustering argument heads appearing in the subject and object slots of verbs in the resulting lexicon.",

        "Following previous works on semantic noun classification (Pantel and Lin, 2002; Bergsma et al., 2008), we used GRsas features for noun clustering.",
        "We employed all the argument heads and verb lemmas appearing in the subject, direct object and indirect object relations in the RASP-parsed BNC.",
        "The feature vectors were first constructed from the corpus counts, and subsequently normalized by the sum of the feature values before applying clustering.",
        "We use spectral clustering (SPEC) for both verbs and nouns.",
        "This technique has proved to be effective in previous verb clustering works (Brew and Schulte im Walde, 2002; Sun and Korhonen, 2009) and in related NLP tasks involving high dimensional data (Chen et al., 2006).",
        "We use the MNCut algorithm for SPEC which has a wide applicability and a clear probabilistic interpretation (Meila and Shi, 2001).",

        "This criterion finds the partition where random walks are most likely to happen within the same cluster.",

        "The same deficiency of the baseline system manifests itself in the source domain vocabulary: the system has only the knowledge of direct synonyms of stir, as opposed to other verbs characteristic to the domain of liquids, e.g. pour, flow, boil etc., successfully identified by means of clustering.",
        "To compare the coverage achieved by unsupervised clustering to that of the baseline in quantitative terms, we estimated the number of WordNet synsets, i.d.",
        "different word senses, in the metaphorical expressions captured by the two systems.",
        "We found that the baseline system covers only 13% of the data identified using clustering and does not go beyond the concepts present in the seed set.",

        "Some examples of sentences annotated by the system are shown in Figure 3.",
        "Such a striking discrepancy between the performance levels of the clustering approach and the baseline can be explained by the fact that a large number of metaphorical senses are included in WordNet.",
        "This means that in WordNet synsets source domain verbs are mixed with more abstract terms.",
        "For example, the metaphorical sense of shape in shape opinion is part of the synset (de- termine, shape, mold, influence, regulate).",
        "This results in the baseline system tagging literal expressions as metaphorical, erroneously assuming that the verbs from the synset belong to the source domain.",
        "The main source of confusion in the output of our clustering method was the conventionality of some metaphorical expressions, e.g. hold views, adopt traditions, tackle a problem.",
        "The system is capable of tracing metaphorical etymology of conventional phrases, but their senses are highly lexicalized.",
        "This lexicalization is reflected in the data and affects clustering in that conventional metaphors are sometimes clustered together with literally used terms, e.g. tackle a problem and resolve a problem, which may suggest that the latter are metaphorical.",
        "It should be noted, however, that such errors are rare.",
        "Since there is no large metaphor-annotated corpus available, it was impossible for us to reliably evaluate the recall of the system.",

        "These numbers can be explained by the fact that 92.00% of the verbs of MOTION and CURE in the Wall Street",
        "Journal corpus are used metaphorically, thus making the dataset unbalanced with respect to the target categories and the task notably easier.",
        "Both Birke and Sarkar (2006) and Gedigan et al.",
        "(2006) focus only on metaphors expressed by a verb.",
        "As opposed to that the approach of Kr-ishnakumaran and Zhu (2007) deals with verbs, nouns and adjectives as parts of speech.",
        "They use hyponymy relation in WordNet and word bigram counts to predict metaphors at the sentence level.",
        "Given an IS-A metaphor (e.g.",
        "The world is a stage) they verify if the two nouns involved are in hyponymy relation in WordNet, and if this is not the case then this sentence is tagged as containing a metaphor.",
        "Along with this they consider expressions containing a verb or an adjective used metaphorically (e.g.",
        "He planted good ideas in their minds or He has a fertile imagination).",
        "Hereby they calculate bigram probabilities of verb-noun and adjective-noun pairs (including the hyponyms/hypernyms of the noun in question).",
        "If the combination is not observed in the data with sufficient frequency, the system tags the sentence containing it as metaphorical.",
        "This idea is a modification of the selectional preference view of Wilks.",
        "However, by using bigram counts over verb-noun pairs as opposed to verb-object relations extracted from parsed text Kr-ishnakumaran and Zhu (2007) loose a great deal of information.",
        "The authors evaluated their system on a set of example sentences compiled from the Master Metaphor List (Lakoff et al., 1991), whereby highly conventionalized metaphors (they call them dead metaphors) are taken to be negative examples.",
        "Thus, they do not deal with literal examples as such: essentially, the distinction they are making is between the senses included in WordNet, even if they are conventional metaphors, and those not included in WordNet."

        "We presented a novel approach to metaphor identification in unrestricted text using unsupervised methods.",
        "Starting from a limited set of metaphorical seeds, the system is capable of capturing the regularities behind their production and annotating a much greater number and wider range of previously unseen metaphors in the BNC.",
        "Our system is the first of its kind and it is capable of identifying metaphorical expressions with a high precision (0.79).",
        "By comparing its coverage to that of a WordNet baseline, we proved that our method goes far beyond synonymy and generalizes well over the source and target domains.",
        "Although at this stage we tested our system on verb-subject and verb-object metaphors only, we are convinced that the described identification techniques can be similarly applied to a wider range of syntactic constructions.",
        "Extending the system to deal with more parts of speech and types of phrases is part of our future work.",
        "One possible limitation of our approach is that it is seed-dependent, which makes the recall of the system questionable.",
        "Thus, another important future research avenue is the creation of a more diverse seed set.",
        "We expect that a set of expressions representative of the whole variety of common metaphorical mappings, already described in linguistics literature, would enable the system to attain a very broad coverage of the corpus.",
        "Master Metaphor List (Lakoff et al., 1991) and other existing metaphor resources could be a sensible starting point on a route to such a dataset."
