        "Zulu (also known as isiZulu) is a Bantu language of South Africa, classified as S.30 in Guthrie's classification scheme (Guthrie, 1971).",
        "Since 1994, it has been recognized as one of the eleven official languages of South Africa.",
        "It has a written history of about 150 years: the first grammar was published by Grout (1859), and the first dictionary by Colenso (1905).",
        "There are about 11 million mother-tongue speakers, who constitute approximately 23% of South Africa's population, making Zulu the country's largest language.",
        "Zulu is highly mutually intelligible with the Xhosa, Swati and Southern Ndebele languages, and with Ndebele of Zimbabwe (Lanham, 1960), to the extent that all of these can be considered dialects or varieties of a single language, Nguni.",
        "Despite its size, Zulu is considerably under-resourced, compared to Western languages with similar numbers of speakers, e.g. Swedish.",
        "There are only about four regular publications in Zulu, there are few published books, and the language is not used as a medium of instruction.",
        "This of course is partly due to the short timespan of its written history, but the main reason, of course, is the apartheid history of South Africa: for most of the twentieth century resources were allocated to Afrikaans and English, the two former official languages, and relatively few resources to the indigenous Bantu languages.",
        "Since 1994, Zulu has had a much larger presence in the media, with several television programs being broadcast in Zulu every day.",
        "Yet much needs to be done in order to improve the resources available to Zulu speakers and students of Zulu.",
        "The aim of the project reported in this paper was to establish a Zulu corpus, named the Ukwabelana corpus, consisting of morphologically labeled words (that is, word types) and part-of-speech (POS) tagged sentences.",
        "Along with the labeled corpus, unlabeled words and sentences, a morphological grammar, a semi-automatic morphological analyzer and a POS tagger for morphologically analyzed words will be provided.",
        "The sources used for the corpus were limited to fictional works and the Zulu Bible.",
        "This means that there is not a wide variety of registers, and perhaps even of vocabulary items.",
        "This defect will have to be corrected in future work.",
        "The Ukwabelana corpus can be used to develop and train automatic morphological analyzers, which in turn tag a large corpus of written Zulu, similar to the Brown corpus or the British National Corpus.",
        "Moreover, the list of POS tagged sentences is an essential step towards building an automatic syntactic tagger, which still does not exist for Zulu, and a tagged corpus of Zulu.",
        "Such a corpus would be beneficial to language researchers as it provides them with examples of actual usage, as opposed to elicited or invented examples, which may be artificial or unlikely to occur in real discourse.",
        "This would greatly improve the quality of Zulu dictionaries and grammars, most of which rely heavily on the work of Doke (1927) and Doke, Malcom and Sikakana (1958), with little in the way of innovation.",
        "Morphological tagging is also useful for practical computational applications like predictive text, spell-checking, grammar checking and machine translation; in the case of Zulu, where a large percentage of grammatical information is conveyed by prefixes and suffixes rather than by separate words, it is essential.",
        "For example, in English, the negative is expressed by means of a separate word 'not', but in Zulu the negative is constructed using a prefix-and-suffix combination on the verb, and this combination differs according to the mood of the verb (indicative, participial or subjunctive).",
        "The practical computational applications mentioned could have a very great impact on the use of Zulu as a written language, as spell-checking and grammar checking would benefit proofreaders, editors and writers.",
        "Machine translation could aid in increasing the number of texts available in Zulu, thus making it more of a literary language, and allowing it to become established as a language of education.",
        "The use of Zulu in public life could also increase.",
        "Currently, the tendency is to use English, as this is the language that reaches the widest audience.",
        "If high-quality automatic translation becomes available, this would no longer be necessary.",
        "As it is hoped that the Ukwabelana corpus will be of benefit to any person doing research on Zulu or on computer-aided analysis of languages, it will be made available as the first morphologically analysed corpus of Zulu in the public domain."

        "In this section, we will give an overview of linguistic research on Nguni languages, following the discussions in van der Spuy (2001), and thereafter a summary of computational approaches to the analysis of Zulu.",
        "The five Nguni languages Zulu, Xhosa, South African Ndebele, Swati, and Zimbabwean Nde-bele are highly mutually intelligible, and for this reason, works on any of the other Nguni languages are directly relevant to an analysis of Zulu.",
        "There have been numerous studies of Nguni grammar, especially its morphology; in fact, the Nguni languages probably rival Swahili and Chewa for the title of most-studied Bantu language.",
        "The generative approach to morphological description (as developed by Aronoff (1976), Selkirk (1982), Lieber (1980), Lieber (1992)) has had very little influence on most of the work that has been done on Nguni morphology.",
        "Usually, the descriptions have been atheoreti-cal or structuralist.",
        "Doke's paradigmatic description of the morphology (Doke, 1927; Doke, 1935) has remained the basis for linguistic work in the Southern Bantu languages.",
        "Doke (1935) criticized previous writers on Bantu grammars for basing their classification, treatment and terminology on their own mother tongue or Latin.",
        "His intention was to create a grammatical structure for Bantu which did not conform to European or classical standards.",
        "Nevertheless, Doke himself could not shake off the European mindset: he treated the languages as if they had inflectional paradigms, with characteristics like subjunctive or indicative belonging to the whole word, rather than to identifiable affixes; in fact, he claimed (1950) that Bantu languages are \"inflectional with [just] a tendency to agglutination\", and assumed that the morphology was linear not hierarchical.",
        "Most subsequent linguistic studies and reference grammars of the Southern Bantu languages have been directed at refining or redefining Doke's categories from a paradigmatic perspective.",
        "Important Nguni examples are Van Eeden (1956), Van Wyk (1958), Beuchat (1966), Wilkes (1971), Nkabinde (1975), Cope (1984), Davey (1984), Louw (1984), Ziervogel et al.",
        "(1985), Gauton (1990), Gauton (1994), Khumalo (1992), Poulos and Msimang (1998), Posthumus (1987), Posthumus (1988), Posthumus (1988) and Posthumus (2000).",
        "Among the very few generative morphological descriptions of Nguni are Lanham (1971), Mbadi (1988) and DuPlessis (1993).",
        "Lan-ham (1971) gives a transformational analysis of Zulu adjectival and relative forms.",
        "This analysis can be viewed as diachronic rather than syn-chronic.",
        "Mbadi (1988) applies Lieber (1980) and Selkirk's percolation theory (Selkirk, 1982) to a few Xhosa morphological forms.",
        "Du Plessis (1993) gives a hierarchical description of the morphology of the verb, but he assumes that derivation is syntactical rather than lexical.",
        "In short, there has been no thoroughgoing generative analysis of the morphology which has treated the Nguni languages as agglutinative rather than inflectional.",
        "In the last decade, various computational approaches for Zulu have been reported.",
        "Based on the Xerox finite-state toolbox by Beesley and Kart-tunen (2003), Pretorius and Bosch (2003) developed a prototype of a computational morphological analyzer for Zulu.",
        "Using a semi-automated process, a morphological lexicon and a rule-base were built incrementally.",
        "Later work (Pretorius and Bosch, 2007) dealt with overgeneration of the Zulu finite-state tool concerning locative formation from nouns and verbal extensions to verb roots.",
        "Pretorius and Bosch (2009) also used cross-linguistic similarities and dissimilarities of Zulu to bootstrap a morphological analyser for Xhosa.",
        "Joubert et al.",
        "(2004) followed a bootstrapping approach to morphological analysis.",
        "A simple framework uses morpheme lists, morphophonological and morphosyntactic rules which are learnt by consulting an oracle, in their case a linguistic expert who corrects analyses.",
        "The framework then revises its grammar so that the updated morpheme lists and rules do not contradict previously found analyses.",
        "Botha and Barnard (2005) compared two approaches for gathering Zulu text corpora from the World Wide Web.",
        "They drew the conclusion that using commercial search engines for finding Zulu websites outperforms web-crawlers even with a carefully selected starting point.",
        "They saw the reason for that in the fact that most documents on the internet are in one of the world's dominant languages.",
        "Bosch and Eiselen (2005) presented a spell checker for Zulu based on morphological analysis and regular expressions.",
        "It was shown that after a certain threshold for the lexicon size performance could only be improved by incrementally extending morphological rules.",
        "Experiments were performed for basic and complex Zulu verbs and nouns, and large numbers of words still were not recognized.",
        "Spiegler et al.",
        "(2008) performed experiments where they tested four machine learning algorithms for morphological analysis with different degrees of supervision.",
        "An unsupervised algorithm analyzed a raw word list, two semi-supervised algorithms were provided with word stems and subsequently segmented prefix and suffix sequences, and the supervised algorithm used a language model of analysed words which was applied to new words.",
        "They experimentally showed that there is a certain trade-off between the usage of labeled data and performance.",
        "They also reckoned that computational analysis improves if words of different grammatical categories are analysed separately since there exist homographic morphemes across different word categories."

        "Zulu is an agglutinative language, with a complex morphology.",
        "It presents an especial problem for computational analysis, because words usually incorporate both prefixes and suffixes, and there can be several of each.",
        "This makes it hard to identify the root by mechanical means, as the root could be the first, second, third, or even a later morpheme in a word.",
        "The complexities involved are exacerbated by the fact that a considerable number of affixes, especially prefixes, have allomor-phic forms.",
        "This is largely brought about by the fact that Zulu has a prohibition against sequences of vowels, so that a prefix whose canonical form is nga- will have an allomorph ng- before roots that begin with vowels.",
        "Given a sequence nga-, then, it is possible that it constitutes an entire morpheme, or the beginning of a morpheme like the verb root ngabaz- 'to be uncertain', or a morpheme ng- followed by a vowel-commencing root like and 'to increase'.",
        "Furthermore, many morphemes are homographs, so that the prefix nga- could represent either the potential mood morpheme or a form of the negative that occurs in subordinate clauses; and the sequence ng- could be the allomorph ofei-ther of these, or of a number of homographic morphemes ngi-, which represent the first person singular in various moods.",
        "Besides these phonologically conditioned allomorphs, there are also morphologically conditioned ones, for example the locative prefix e-has an allomorph o-that occurs in certain morphological circumstances.",
        "Certain morpheme sequences also exhibit syncretism, so that while most nouns take a sequence of prefixes known as the initial vowel and the noun prefix, as in i-mi-zi 'villages', nouns of certain classes, like class 5, syncretise these two prefixes, as in i-gama 'name', where the prefix i-represents both the initial vowel and the noun prefix.",
        "Like all other Bantu languages, Zulu divides its nouns into a number of classes.",
        "The class is often identifiable from the noun prefix that is attached to the noun, and it governs the agreement of all words that modify the noun, as well as of predicates of which the noun is a subject.",
        "Object agreement may also be marked on the predicate.",
        "Two examples of this agreement are given below.",
        "Example 1.",
        "Leso si-tshudeni e-si-hle e-ngi-si-fundis-ile si-phas-e kahle.",
        "that student who-Agr-good who-I-him-teach-Past Agr-pass-Past well.",
        "'That good student whom I taught passed well.'",
        "Example 2.",
        "Lowo m-fundi o-mu-hle e-ngi-m-fundis-ile u-phas-e kahle.",
        "that learner who-Agr-good who-I-him-teach-Past Agr-pass-Past well.",
        "'That good learner whom I taught passed well.",
        "The differences in agreement morphology in the two sentences is brought about because the nouns sitshudeni and mfundi belong to different classes.",
        "Canonici (1996) argues that a noun should be assigned to a class by virtue of the agreement that it takes.",
        "In terms of this criterion, there are twelve noun classes in Zulu.",
        "These classes are numbered 1-7, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15.",
        "The numbering system was devised by Meinhof (1906), and reflects the historical affinities between Zulu and other Bantu languages: Zulu lacks classes 8, 12 and 13, which are found in other Bantu languages.",
        "In the labels used on the database, morphemes that command or show agreement have been labeled as <xn>, where x is a letter or sequence of letters, and n is a number: thus the morpheme m-in mfundi is labeled <n1>, as it marks the noun as belonging to noun class 1.",
        "The morpheme si- in engisifundis-ile is marked <o7>, as it shows object agreement with a noun of class 7.",
        "Zulu predicatives may be either verbal or nonverbal - the latter are referred to in the literature as copulatives.",
        "Copulatives usually consist of a predicative prefix and a base, which may be a noun, an adjective, or a prepositional, locative or adverbial form.",
        "There may also be various tense, aspect and polarity markers.",
        "They translate the English verb 'be , plus its complement - Zulu has no direct equivalent of 'be ; the verb -ba, which has the closest meaning, is probably better translated as 'become .",
        "Examples of copulative forms are ubenguthisha 'he was a teacher , zimandla 'they are strong', basekhaya 'they are at home'.",
        "Predicatives may occur in a variety of moods, tenses, aspects and polarities; these are usually distinguished by the affixes attached to the base form.",
        "Thus in engasesendlini '(s)he no longer being in the house', the initial prefix e-indicates third person singular, class 1, participial mood; the prefix nga- denotes negative; the first prefix se- denotes continuative aspect; the second prefix se- is the locative prefix; n-shows that the noun belongs to class 9; dl- is the noun root meaning 'house , an allomorph of the canonical form -dlu; and -ini is the locative suffix.",
        "Thus in typical agglutinative manner, each affix contributes a distinctive part of the meaning of the word as a whole.",
        "This characteristic of the language was exploited in the labeling system used for the morphological corpus: labels were designed so as to indicate the grammatical function of the morpheme.",
        "A person searching for past tense negative verbs, for example, could simply search for the combination of <past >, < neg> and < vr>.",
        "A complete list ofmorphemes, allomorphs and their labels is provided along with the corpus and other resources.",
        "According to the Dokean grammatical tradition (Doke, 1927), Zulu has a large number of parts of speech.",
        "This is because what would be separate words in other languages are often prefixes in Zulu, and also because various subtypes of determiner are given individual names.",
        "The parts of speech recognised in the corpus are: noun, verb, adjective, pronoun, adverb, conjunction, prepositional, possessive, locative, demonstrative, pre-sentative, quantitative, copulative and relative.",
        "Adjective includes the traditional Dokean adjective (a closed class of roots which take noun prefixes as their agreement prefixes) and the predicative form of the Dokean relative, which is seen as an open class of adjectives (cf. van der Spuy (2006)).",
        "Pronouns are the personal pronouns, which may also (sometimes in allomor-phic form) be used as agreement morphemes in quantifiers.",
        "Adverbs may be forms derived from adjectives by prefixing ka- to the root, or morphologically unanalysable forms like phansi 'in front, forward .",
        "Ideophones have been included as adverbs.",
        "Prepositionals are words that incorporate the Dokean \"adverbials\" na- 'with', nga-'by means of , njenga- 'like , kuna- 'more than , etc., which are better analysed as prepositions.",
        "The presentative is Doke s \"locative demonstrative copulative\" - the briefer name was suggested by van der Spuy (2001).",
        "Copulatives are all Doke s copulatives, excluding the adjectives mentioned above.",

      "heading": "4. The labeling scheme",
      "text": [
        "The labeling scheme has been based on the idea that each morpheme in a word should be labeled, even when words belong to a very restricted class.",
        "For example, the demonstratives could have been labeled as composite forms, but instead it is assumed that demonstratives contain between one and three morphemes, e.g. le<d>si<d7>ya<po3> 'a demonstrative of the third position referring to class 7' - i.e.. 'that one yonder, class 7 .",
        "It should be possible from this detailed labeling to build up an amalgam of the morphological structure of the word.",
        "The labels have been chosen to be both as brief as possible and as transparent as possible, though transparency was often sacrificed for brevity.",
        "Thus indicative subject prefixes are labeled <i1-15>, relative prefixes are labeled <r>, and noun prefixes are labeled <n1-15>; but negative subject prefixes are labeled <g1-15> and possessive agreement prefixes are labeled <z1-15>.",
        "Sometimes a single label was used for several different forms, when these are orthographically distinct, so for example < asp> (aspect) is used as a label for the following, among others: the continuative prefix sa- and its allomorph se-, the exclusive prefix se-, and the potential prefix nga- and its allo-morph ng-.",
        "A person searching for forms containing the potential aspect would have to search for 'nga<asp> + ng<asp> '.",
        "However, there should be no ambiguity, as the orthographic form would eliminate this.",

        "This was the case for 2595 sentences.",
        "For 431 sentences, however, we needed to disambiguate POS tags.",

        "We have described the annotation process and the tools for compiling this corpus.",
        "We see this work as a first step in an ongoing effort to ultimately label the entire word and sentence corpus.",
        "Our future work includes further automation of the annotation process by extending the described abductive algorithm with a more sophisticated hypothesis evaluation and by combining syntactical and morphological information during the decision process.",
        "Our research interest also lies in the field of automatic grammar induction which will help to refine our partial grammar.",
        "Another aspect is interactive labeling where a linguistic expert directs the search of an online parsing algorithm by providing additional information.",
        "Apart from the benefits to language researchers, we foresee an application of the corpus by machine learners which can develop and train their algorithms for morphological analysis."
