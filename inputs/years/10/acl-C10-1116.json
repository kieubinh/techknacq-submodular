        "Words in natural language are constructed from smaller building blocks called morphemes.",
        "For example, the word wives breaks down into an underlying stem, wife, together with a plural suffix.",
        "Analyzing the morphological structure of words is known to benefit a variety of downstream natural language (NL) tasks such as speech recognition (Creutz, 2006; Arisoy et al., 2009), machine translation (Oflazer et al., 2007), and information retrieval (McNamee et al., 2008).",
        "A variety of automatic systems can morphologically analyze words that have been removed from their surrounding context.",
        "These systems range from hand-built finite state approaches (Beesley and Karttunen, 2003) to recently proposed algorithms which learn morphological structure in an unsupervised fashion (Kurimo et al., 2007).",
        "Since unsupervised systems do not have access to linguistically motivated morpheme labels, they typically produce morphological analyses that are closely related to the written form.",
        "Such a system might decompose wives as wiv -es.",
        "Meanwhile, a hand-built system might propose wife_N +Plu-ral, or even parse wives as a hierarchical feature structure.",
        "As morphological analysis systems produce such varied outputs, comparing decompositions from disparate systems is a challenge.",
        "This paper describes EMMA, an Evaluation Metric for Morphological Analysis that quantitatively measures the quality of a set of morphological analyses in a linguistically adequate, empirically useful, and novel fashion.",
        "EMMA evaluates analyses that can be represented as a flat set of symbolic features, including hierarchical representations, which can be projected down to a linearized form (Roark and Sproat, 2007).",
        "An automatic metric that discriminates between proposed morphological analyses should fulfill certain computational and linguistic criteria.",
        "Computationally, the metric should:",
        "1.",
        "Correlate with the performance of real-world NL processing tasks which embed the morphological analyses.",
        "2.",
        "Be Readily Computable: The metric will only be useful if it is less time consuming and easier to compute than the larger NL task.",
        "3.",
        "Be Robust: The metric should be difficult to game and should accurately reflect the distribution of predicted and true morphemes.",
        "4.",
        "Be Readily Interpretable: When possible, the final numeric score should directly identify the strengths and weaknesses of the underlying morphological analysis system.",
        "While accounting for these computational requirements, a morphology metric should still reward accurate models of linguistic structure.",
        "In particular, the metric should account for:",
        "1.",
        "Morphophonology: Applying a morphological rule may alter the surface form of stem or affix.",
        "In the word wives, /waivz/, a rule of mor-phophonology voices the stem-final /f/ of wife, /waif/, when the plural suffix is added.",
        "A metric should penalize for not placing wives and wife as forms of the same lexeme.",
        "2.",
        "Allomorphy: A metric should capture the successful grouping of allomorphs.",
        "The German plural has several surface allomorphs including en in Zeiten (times), e in Hunde (dogs), and s in Autos (cars).",
        "A metric should reward a morphological analysis system that analyzes the different surface forms of the German plural as underlyingly identical.",
        "3.",
        "Syncretism: In mirror fashion, a metric should reward analyses that distinguish between surface-identical syncretic morphemes: although derives and derivations both contain an s morpheme, one marks 3rd person singular and the other plural.",
        "4.",
        "Ambiguity: Finally, a metric should account for legitimate morphological ambiguity.",
        "In Hebrew, the written word MHGR has three viable morphological segmentations: M H GR, \"from the foreigner\", M HGR, \"from Hagar\", and the unsegmented form MHGR, meaning \"immigrant\" (Lavie et al., 2004).",
        "Absent disambiguating context, a morphological system should be rewarded for calling out all three analyses for MHGR.",
        "Morphophonology, allomorphy, syncretism, and ambiguity are all common phenomena in the world's languages.",
        "The first three have all received much discussion in theoretical linguistics (Spencer and Zwicky, 2001), while morphological ambiguity has significant practical implications in NL processing, e.g. in machine translation of morphologically complex languages (Lavie et al., 2004; Oflazer et al., 2007).",
        "In Section 2 we propose the metric EMMA, which has been specifically designed to evaluate morphological analyses according to our computational and linguistic criteria.",
        "Section 3 then describes and qualitatively critiques several well-used alternative metrics.",
        "Section 4 empirically compares EMMA against the qualitatively-strong metric used in the Morpho Challenge competition series (Kurimo et al., 2009).",
        "And we conclude in Section 5."

        "EMMA, the metric we propose for the evaluation of morphological analyses, like all the metrics that we consider in this paper, compares proposed morphological analyses against an answer key of definitively-analyzed words from a vocabulary.",
        "Since a set of proposed analyses is likely to use a different labeling scheme than the answer key, especially true of the output from unsupervised systems, EMMA does not perform a direct comparison among proposed and answer analyses.",
        "Instead, EMMA seeks a one-to-one relabeling of the proposed morphemes that renders them as similar as possible to the answer key.",
        "EMMA, then, measures the degree to which proposed analyses approximate an isomorphism of the answer key analyses.",
        "For exposition, we initially assume that, for each word, a single proposed analysis is scored against a single unambiguous answer analysis.",
        "We relax this restriction in Section 2.3, where EMMA scores multiple proposed analyses against a set of legitimately ambiguous morphological analyses.",
        "To find the most appropriate one-to-one morpheme relabeling, EMMA turns to a standard algorithm from graph theory: optimal maximum matching in a bipartite graph.",
        "A bipartite graph, G = {X, Y ; E}, consists of two disjoint sets of vertices, X = {x\\,x2,..., xn} and Y = {yi, V2,---,Vm}, and a set of edges e(xi,yj) G E suchthateachedge has one endin X and the other end in Y.",
        "In EMMA, the set, A, of all unique morphemes in the answer key and the set, P, of all unique morphemes in the proposed analyses serve as the disjoint vertex sets of a bipartite graph.",
        "A matching M ç E in a bipartite graph is defined as a set of edges e(xi,yj) such that no xior yj is repeated.",
        "A maximum matching is a matching where no M' with |M'j > |M| exists.",
        "Furthermore, a weight w(xi, yj) G RR may be assigned to each edge e(xi; yj) of a bipartite graph.",
        "An optimal assignment is a maximum matching which also maximizes the sum of the weights of the edges of the matching",
        "w(xi,yj).",
        "EMMA weights the edge between a particular answer morpheme a G A and a proposed morpheme p G P as the number of words, w, in the vocabulary, V, where the answer analysis of w includes morpheme a while the proposed analysis includes p. EMMA constructs an optimal assignment maximum matching in this weighted bipartite morpheme graph.",
        "The edge weights ensure that the optimal matching will link the answer and proposed morphemes which globally occur in the analyses of the same words most often - restricting each answer morpheme to be represented by at most one proposed morpheme, and each proposed morpheme to represent at most one morpheme in the answer key.",
        "On the one hand, the restrictions thus imposed by bipartite matching penalize sets of proposed analyses that do not differentiate between surface-identical syncretic morphemes.",
        "On the other hand, the same one-to-one matching restrictions penalize proposed analyses that do not conflate allomorphs of the same underlying morpheme, whether those allomorphs are phonologically induced or not.",
        "Thus, EMMA meets our linguistic criteria from Section 1 of modeling syncretism, allomorphy, and morphophonology.",
        "To construct the maximum matching optimal assignment of answer and proposed morphemes, EMMA uses standard integer linear programming techniques as implemented in lpsolve (Berkelaar et al., 2004).",
        "For the purpose of our integer program, we represent the weight of each potential edge of the optimal bipartite morpheme assignment in a count matrix C = {cij } where cij is assigned the number of words w G V which share morpheme ai in the answer key and pj in the prediction.",
        "We then define a binary matrix B = {bij } of the same dimensions as C. Each bij will be set to 1 if an edge exists from ai to pj in the optimal maximum matching, with bij = 0 otherwise.",
        "The integer linear program can then be defined as follows:",
        "where (C • B)ij = cij • bij is the element-wise Hadamard product.",
        "Having settled on a maximum matching optimal assignment of proposed and answer morphemes, EMMA derives a final numeric score.",
        "Let be the kth word of V ; and let Ak and Pk denote, respectively, the sets of morphemes in the answer key analysis of wk and predicted analysis of wk.",
        "Furthermore, let P£ denote the predicted morphemes for w where a morpheme pj is replaced by ai if bij = 1.",
        "Now that Ak and P* contain morpheme labels that are directly comparable, we can define precision and recall scores for the proposed analysis of the word wk.",
        "Precision is the fraction of correctly relabeled proposed morphemes from among all proposed morphemes of wk ; while recall is the number of correctly relabeled morphemes as a fraction of the answer key analysis of wk.",

        "When a word is truly ambiguous, EMMA expects an answer key to contain a set of analyses for that word.",
        "Similarly, we permit sets of proposed alternative analyses.",
        "To extend EMMA with the ability to evaluate alternative analyses we first generalize the optimal maximum matching of morphemes from Section 2.1.",

        "Directly comparing proposed analyses against an answer key, or 2.",
        "Indirectly comparing proposed and answer analyses by measuring the strength of an isomorphic-like relationship between the proposed and answer morphemes.",

        "By Segmentation Point.",
        "Perhaps the most readily accessible automatic evaluation metric is a direct comparison of the morpheme boundary positions in proposed and answer analyses.",
        "As early as 1974, Hafer and Weiss used the direct boundary metric.",
        "Although intuitively simple, the segmentation point method implicitly assumes that it is possible to arrive at a valid morphological analysis by merely dividing the characters of a word into letter sequences that can be reconcatenated to form the original word.",
        "But, by definition, concatenation cannot describe non-contanative processes like morphophonology and allomorphy.",
        "Nor does simple segmentation adequately differentiate between surface-identical syncretic morphemes.",

        "To confront the reality of non-concatenative morphological processes, an answer key can hold full morphological analyses (as opposed to merely segmented surface forms).",
        "But while a hand-built (Beesley and Karttunen, 2003) or supervised (Wicentowski , 2002) morphology analysis system can directly model the annotation standards of a particular morphological answer key, the label given to specific morphemes is ultimately an arbitrary choice that an unsupervised morphology induction system has no way to discover.",
        "By Hand.",
        "On the surface, scoring proposed analyses by hand appears to provide a way to evaluate the output of an unsupervised morphology analysis system.",
        "Hand evaluation, however, does not meet our criteria from Section 1 for a robust and readily computable metric.",
        "It is time consuming and, as Goldsmith (2001) explains, leaves difficult decisions of what constitutes a morpheme to on-the-fly subjective opinion.",

        "metrics as soft isomorphic measures.",
        "As discussed in Section 2, metrics of isomorphism measure similarities between the distribution of proposed morphemes and the distribution of answer morphemes, where proposed and answer morphemes may be disjoint symbol sets.",
        "Unlike the EMMA metric proposed in Section 2, the soft metrics of isomorphism do not seek to explicitly link proposed morphemes to answer morphemes.",
        "Instead, their metrics group sets or pairs of words which share, in either the proposed analyses or in the answer analyses, a stem (Schone and Jurafsky, 2001; Snover, 2002), a suffix (Snover et al., 2002), or any arbitrary morpheme (Kurimo et al., 2007).",
        "The soft metrics subsequently note whether these same sets or pairs of words share any morpheme in the answer key or, respectively, in the proposed analyses.",
        "By foregoing a hard morpheme assignment, the soft metrics do not adequately punish sets of proposed and answer morphemes which fail to model syncretism and/or allomorphy.",
        "For example, proposed analyses that annotate 3rd person singular and plural with a single undifferentiated +s morpheme will receive recall credit for both nouns and verbs.",
        "The Morpho Challenge (MC) competition series for unsupervised morphology analysis algorithms (Kurimo et al., 2009) has used a soft metric of isomorphism in its most recent three years of competition: 2007, 2008, and 2009.",

        "In addition to MC's crude handling of ambiguity and its over-counting of allomorphs and syncretic morphemes, the random pair sampling method that MC uses is not independent of the set of analyses being evaluated.",
        "If two algorithms predict different morpheme distributions, the sampling method will find different numbers of word pairs.",
