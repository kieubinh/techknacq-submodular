        "We investigate the language dynamics in small group interactions across various settings.",
        "Our focus in this paper is on English online chat conversations; however, the models we are developing are more universal and applicable to other conversational situations: informal face-to-face interactions, formal meetings, moderated discussions, as well as interactions conducted in languages other than English, e.g., Urdu and Mandarin.",
        "Multi-party online conversations are particularly interesting because they become a pervasive form of communication within virtual communities, ubiquitous across all age groups.",
        "In particular, a great amount of communication online occurs in virtual chat-rooms, typically conducted using a highly informal text dialect.",
        "At the same time, the reduced-cue environment of online interaction necessitates more explicit linguistic devices to convey social and cultural nuances than is typical in face-to-face or even voice conversations.",
        "Our objective is to develop computational models of how certain social phenomena such as leadership, power, and conflict are signaled and reflected in language through the choice of lexical, syntactic, semantic and conversational forms by discourse participants.",
        "In this paper we report the results of an initial phase of our work during which we constructed a prototype system called DSARMD-1 (Detecting Social Actions and Roles in Multiparty Dialogue).",
        "Given a representative segment of multiparty task-oriented dialogue, DSARMD-1 automatically classifies all discourse participants by the degree to which they deploy selected social language uses, such as topic control, task control, involvement, and disagreement.",
        "These are the mid-level social phenomena, which are deployed by discourse participants in order to achieve or assert higher-level social constructs, including leadership.",
        "In this work we adopted a two-tier empirical approach where social language uses are modeled through observable linguistic features that can be automatically extracted from dialogue.",
        "The high-level social constructs are then inferred from a combination of language uses attributed to each discourse participant; for example, a high degree of influence and a high degree of involvement by the same person may indicate a leadership role.",
        "In this paper we limit our discussion to the first tier only: how to effectively model and classify social language uses in multi-party dialogue."

        "Issues related to linguistic manifestation of social phenomena have not been systematically researched before in computational linguistics; indeed, most of the effort thus far was directed towards the communicative dimension of discourse.",
        "While the Speech Acts theory (Austin, 1962; Searle, 1969) provides a generalized framework for multiple levels of discourse analysis (locution, illocution and perlocution), most current approaches to dialogue focus on information content and structural components (Blaylock, 2002; Carin dialogue; few take into account the effects that speech acts may have upon the social roles of discourse participants.",
        "Also relevant is research on modeling sequences of dialogue acts - to predict the next one (Samuel et al.",
        "1998; Ji & Bilmes, 2006 inter alia) - or to map them onto subsequences or \"dialogue games\" (Carlson 1983; Levin et al., 1998), which are attempts to formalize participants' roles in conversation (e.g., Linell, 1990; Poe-sio & Mikheev, 1998; Field et al., 2008).",
        "There is a body of literature in anthropology, linguistics, sociology, and communication on the relationship between language and power, as well as other social phenomena, e.g., conflict, leadership; however, existing approaches typically look at language use in situations where the social relationships are known, rather than using language predictively.",
        "For example, conversational analysis (Sacks et al., 1974) is concerned with the structure of interaction: turn-taking, when interruptions occur, how repairs are signaled, but not what they reveal about the speakers.",
        "Research in anthropology and communication has concentrated on how certain social norms and behaviors may be reflected in language (e.g., Scollon and Scollon, 2001; Agar, 1994) with few systematic studies attempting to explore the reverse, i.e., what the linguistic phenomena tell us about social norms and behaviors."

        "Our initial focus has been on on-line chat dialogues.",
        "While chat data is plentiful on-line, its adaptation for research purposes presents a number of challenges that include users' privacy issues on the one hand, and their complete anonymity on the other.",
        "Furthermore, most data that may be obtained from public chat-rooms is of limited value for the type of modeling tasks we are interested in due to its high-level of noise, lack of focus, and rapidly shifting, chaotic nature, which makes any longitudinal studies virtually impossible.",
        "To derive complex models of conversational behavior, we need the interaction to be reasonably focused on a task and/or social objectives within a group.",
        "Few data collections exist covering multiparty dialogue, and even fewer with on-line chat.",
        "Moreover, the few collections that exist were built primarily for the purpose of training dialogue act tagging and similar linguistic phenomena; few if any of these corpora are suitable for deriving pragmatic models of conversation, including sociolinguistic phenomena.",
        "Existing resources include a multi-person meeting corpus ICSI-MRDA and the AMI Meeting Corpus (Carletta, 2007), which contains 100 hours of meetings captured using synchronized recording devices.",
        "Still, all of these resources look at spoken language rather than on-line chat.",
        "There is a parallel interest in the online chat environment, although the development of useful resources has progressed less.",
        "Some corpora exist such as the NPS Internet chat corpus (Forsyth and Martell, 2007), which has been hand-anonymized and labeled with part-of-speech tags and dialogue act labels.",
        "The StrikeCom corpus (Twitchell et al., 2007) consists of 32 multi-person chat dialogues between players of a strategic game, where in 50% of the dialogues one participant has been asked to behave 'deceptively'.",
        "It is thus more typical that those interested in the study of Internet chat compile their own corpus on an as needed basis, e.g., Wu et al.",
        "(2002), Khan et al.",
        "(2002), Kim et al.",
        "(2007).",
        "Driven by the need to obtain a suitable dataset we designed a series of experiments in which recruited subjects were invited to participate in a series of on-line chat sessions in a specially designed secure chat-room.",
        "The experiments were carefully designed around topics, tasks, and games for the participants to engage in so that appropriate types of behavior, e.g., disagreement, power play, persuasion, etc.",
        "may emerge spontaneously.",
        "These experiments and the resulting corpus have been described elsewhere (Shaikh et al., 2010b), and we refer the reader to this source.",
        "Ultimately a corpus of 50 hours of English chat dialogue was collected comprising more than we also assembled a corpus of 20 hours of Urdu chat.",
        "A subset of English language dataset has been annotated at four levels: communication links, dialogue acts, local topics and meso-topics (which are essentially the most persistent local topics).",
        "Although full details of these annotations are impossible to explain within the scope of this article, we briefly describe them below.",
        "Annotated datasets were used to develop and train automatic modules that detect and classify social uses of language in discourse.",

        "• Dialogue Acts.",
        "We developed a hierarchy of 15 dialogue acts for annotating the functional aspect of the utterance in discussion.",
        "The tagset we adopted is based on DAMSL (Allen & Core, 1997) and SWBD (Jurafsky et al., 1997), but compressed to 15 tags tuned significantly towards dialogue pragmatics and away from more surface characteristics of utterances (Shaikh et al.,",
        "2010a).",

        "We are interested in modeling the social phenomena of Leadership and Power in discourse.",
        "These high-level phenomena (or Social Roles, SR) will be detected and attributed to discourse participants based on their deployment of selected Language Uses (LU) in multi-party dialogue.",
        "Language Uses are mid-level sociolinguistic devices that link linguistic components deployed in discourse (from lexical to pragmatic) to social constructs obtaining for and between the participants.",
        "The language uses that we are currently studying are Agenda Control, Disagreement, and Involvement (Broadwell et al., 2010).",
        "Our research so far is focused on the analysis of English-language synchronous chat, and we are looking for correlations between various metrics that can be used to detect LU in multiparty dialogue.",
        "We expect that some of these correlations may be culturally specific or language-specific, as we move into the analysis of Urdu and Mandarin discourse in the next phase of this project.",
        "Agenda Control is defined as efforts by a member or members of the group to advance the group's task or goal.",
        "This is a complex LU that we will model along two dimensions: (1) Topic Control and (2) Task Control.",
        "Topic Control refers to attempts by any discourse participants to impose the topic of conversation.",
        "Task Control, on the other hand, is an effort by some members of the group to define the group's project or goal and/or steer the group towards that goal.",
        "We believe that both behaviors can be detected using scalar measures per participant based on certain linguistic features of their utterances.",
        "For example, one hypothesis is that topic control is indicated by the rate of local topic introductions (LTI) per participant (Givon, 1983).",
        "Local topics may be defined quite simply as noun phrases introduced into discourse, which are subsequently mentioned again via repetition, synonym, pronoun, or other form of co-reference.",
        "Thus, one measure of topic control is the number of local topics introduced by each participant as percentage of all local topics in a discourse.",
        "Using an LTI index we can construct assertions about topic control in a discourse.",
        "For example, suppose the following information is discovered about the speaker LE in a multi-party discussion dialogue-1 where 90 local topics are identified:",
        "1.",
        "LE introduces 23/90 (25.6%) of local topics in this dialogue.",
        "2.",
        "The mean rate of local topic introductions is this dialogue is 14.29%, and standard deviation is 8.01.",
        "3.",
        "LE is in the top quintile of participants for introducing new local topics",
        "We can now claim the following, with a degree of confidence (to be determined):",
        "TopicControlLTI (LE, 5, dialogue-1)",
        "We read this as follows: speaker LE exerts the highest degree of topic control in dialogue-1.",
        "Of course, LTI is just one source of evidence and we developed other metrics to complement it.",
        "We mention three of them here:",
        "• SMT Index.",
        "This is a measure of topic control suggested in (Givon, 1983) and it is based on subsequent mentions of already introduced local topics.",
        "Speakers who introduce topics that are discussed at length by the group tend to control the topic of the discussion.",
        "The subsequent mentions of local topics (SMT) index calculates the percentage of second and subsequent references to the local topics, by repetition, synonym, or pronoun, relative to the speakers who introduced them.",
        "• Cite Score.",
        "This index measures the extent to which other participants discuss topics introduced by that speaker.",
        "The difference between SMT and CiteScore is that the latter reflect to what degree a speaker's efforts to control the topic are assented to by other participants in a conversation.",
        "• TL Index (TL).",
        "This index stipulates that more influential speakers take longer turns than those who are less influential.",
        "The TL index is defined as the average number of words per turn for each speaker.",
        "Turn length also reflects the extent to which other participants are willing to 'yield the floor' in conversation.",
        "Like LTI, all the above indices are mapped into a degree of topic control, based on quin-tiles in normal distribution (Table 1).",
        "Table 1: Topic Control distribution in dialogue-1.",
        "Each row represents a speaker in the group (LE, JR, etc.).",
        "Columns show indices used, with degrees per speaker on 5-point scale based on quintiles in normal distribution, and the average value.",
        "Ideally, all the above indices (and others yet to be defined) should predict the same outcome, i.e., for each dialogue participant they should assign the same degree of topic control, relative to other speakers.",
        "This is not always the case, and where the indices divert in their predictions, our level of confidence in the generated claims decreases.",
        "We are currently working on how these different metrics correlate to each other and how they should be weighted to maximize accuracy of making Topic Control claims.",
        "Nonetheless, we can already output a Topic Control map (shown in Table 1) that captures a sense of internal social dynamics within the group.",
        "The other aspect of Agenda Control phenomenon is Task Control.",
        "It is defined as an effort to determine the group's goal and/or steer the group towards that goal.",
        "Unlike Topic Control, which is imposed by influencing the subject of conversation, Task Control is gained by directing other participants to perform certain tasks or accept certain opinions.",
        "Consequently, Task Control is detected by observing the usage of certain dialogue acts, including Action-Directive,",
        "Agree-Accept, Disagree-Reject, and related categories.",
        "Here again, we define several indices that allow us to compute a degree of Task Control in dialogue for each participant:",
        "• Directive Index (DI).",
        "The participant who directs others is attempting to control the course of the task that the group is performing.",
        "We count the number of directives, i.e., utterances classified as Action-Directive, made by each participant as a percentage of all directives in discourse.",
        "• Directed Topic Shift Index (DTSI).",
        "When a participant who controls the task offers a directive on the task, then the topic of conversation shifts.",
        "In order to detect this condition, we calculate the ratio of coincidence of directive dialogue acts by each participant with topic shifts following them.",
        "• Process Management index (PMI).",
        "Another measure of Task Control is the proportion of turns each participant has that explicitly address the problem solving process.",
        "This includes utterances that involve coordinating the activities of the participants, planning the order of activities, etc.",
        "These fall into the category of Task (or Process) Management in most DA tagging systems.",
        "• Process Management Success Index (PMSI).",
        "This index measures the degree of success by each speaker at controlling the task.",
        "A credit is given to the speaker whose suggested curse of action is supported by other speakers for each response that supports the suggestion.",

        "We developed a prototype automated DSARMD system that comprises a series of modules that create automated annotation of the source dialogue for all the language elements discussed above, including communicative links, dialogue acts, local/meso topics, and polarity.",
        "Automatically annotated dialogue is then used to generate language use degree claims.",
        "In order to evaluate accuracy of the automated process we conducted a preliminary evaluation comparing the LU claims generated from automatically annotated data to the claims generated from manually coded dialogues.",
        "Below we briefly describe the methodology and metrics used.",
        "Each language use is asserted per a participant in a discourse (or per each pair of participants, e.g., for Disagreement) on a 5-point \"strength\" scale.",
        "This can be represented as an ordered sequence LUX(d1, d2, ... dn), where LU is the language use being asserted, X is the index used, di is the degree of LU attributed to speaker i.",
        "This assignment is therefore a 5-way classification of all discourse participants and its correctness is measured by dividing the number of correct assignments by the total number of elements to be classified, which gives the micro-averaged precision.",
        "The accuracy metric is computed with several variants as follows:",
        "1.",
        "Strict mapping: each complete match is counted as 1; all mismatches are counted as 0.",
        "For example, the outputs LUX (5,4,3,2,1) and LUX (4,5,3,1,1) produce two exact matches (for the third and the last speaker) for a precision of 0.4.",
        "2.",
        "Weighted mapping: since each degree value di in LUX(d1, d2, .",
        "dn) represents a quintile in normal distribution, we consider the position of the value within the quintile.",
        "If two mismatched values are less than V quintile apart we assign a partial credit (currently 0.5).",
        "3.",
        "Highest - Rest: we measure accuracy with which the highest LU degree (but not necessarily the same degree) is assigned to the right speaker vs. any other score.",
        "This results in binary classification of scores.",
        "The sequences in (1) produce 0.6 match score.",
        "4.",
        "High - Low: An alternative binary classification where scores 5 and 4 are considered High, while the remaining scores are considered Low.",
        "Under this metric, the sequences in (1) match with 100% precision.",
        "The process of automatic assignment of language uses derived from automatically processed dialogues was evaluated against the control set of assignments based on human-annotated data.",
        "In order to obtain a reliable \"ground truth\", each test dialogue was annotated by at least three human coders (linguistics and communication graduate students, trained).",
        "Since human annotation was done at the linguistic component level, a strict inter-annotator agreement was not required; instead, we were interested whether in each case a comparable statistical distribution of the corresponding LU index was obtained.",
        "Annotations that produced index distributions dissimilar from the majority were eliminated.",
        "Automated dialogue processing involved the following modules:",
        "• Local topics detection identifies first mentions by tracking occurrences of noun phrases.",
        "Subsequent mentions are identified using fairly simple pronoun resolution (based mostly on lexical features), with Wordnet used to identify synonyms, etc.",
        "• Meso-topics are identified as longest-chain local topics.",
        "Their polarity is assessed at the utterance level by noting presence of positive or negative cue words and phrases.",
        "• Dialogue acts are tagged based on presence",
        "of certain cue phrases derived from a training corpus (Webb et al., 2008).",
        "• Communicative links are mapped by computing inter-utterance similarity based on n-gram overlap.",
        "Preliminary evaluation results are shown in Tables 3-5 with average performance over 3 chat sessions (approx 4.5 hours) involving three groups of speakers and different tasks (job candidates, political issues).",
        "Topic Control and Involvement tables show average accuracy per index.",
        "For example, the LTI index, computed over automatically extracted local topics, produces Topic Control assignments with the average precision of 80% when compared to assignments derived from human-annotated data using the strict accuracy metric.",
        "However, automated prediction of Involvement based on NPI index is far less reliable, although we can still pick the most involved speaker with 67% accuracy.",
        "We omit the indices based on turn length (TL) and turn count (TI) because their values are trivially computed.",
        "At this time we do not combine indices into a single LU prediction.",
        "Additional experiments are needed to determine how much each of these indices contributes to LU prediction.",
        "Table 3: Topic Control LU assignment performance averages of selected indices over a subset of data covering three dialogues with combined duration of 4.5 hours with total of 19 participants (7, 5, 7 per session).",
        "Table 4: Involvement LU assignment performance averages for selected indices over the same subset of data as in Table 3.",
        "Topical Disagreement performance is shown in Table 5.",
        "We calculated precision and recall of assigning a correct degree of disagreement to each pair of speakers who are members of a group.",
        "Precision and recall averages are then computed over all meso-topics identified in the test dataset, which consists of three separate 90-minute dialogues involving 7, 5 and 7 speakers, respectively.",
        "Our calculation includes the cases where different sets of meso-topics were identified by the system and by the human coder.",
        "A strict mapping of levels of disagreement between speakers is hard to compute accurately; however, finding the speakers who disagree the most, or the least, is significantly more robust.",
        "Table 5: Topical Disagreement LU assignment performance averages over 13 meso-topics discussed in three dialogues with combined duration of 4.5 hours with total of 19 participants (7, 5, and 7 per session)."
